nt|mariner1: makes the up trick though|pg||
nt|keylime: and now onto hands where we'll have comparisons|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: and, be forewarned, there's some wild ones coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS in Closed sure like to bid.....|pg||
nt|garnetts: rock solid 4@H here  should be flat|pg||
mb|2H|an|strong/weak bal |nt|idc: an icon of someone queueing to buy beers would help to identify dummy, in a meaningful real-life way :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Not a good hand for bergen raises|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  Not my guess.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: England only 18 behind now, but it's a little too late. Only 2 boards remaining there|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hope that is not a weak two :)|pg||
mb|2S|an|relay|mb|p|nt|idc: but as a passed hand, North can bid a 4 card good raise 2@d, and stop in 2@s :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|galadriel: They apparently don't play that|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|keylime: B3: partial swing as predicted; six imps for a quiet 2@c partial instead of a push for the need to cash the club ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might get too high I suppose--but no good reason to|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well so do our NS|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ianrei: if they had stopped in 2S E/W could play their cold 3d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is why Drury was invented. To avoid the 3-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 3@ds a transfer and 3@s a superaccept?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: North - South have got themselves too high.  A bad advertisement for raising to 3 with four trumps.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: how to get out of this now |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mariner1: this time the position is different so 8@H hook was good play|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@H is enough--hand has already limited and described |pg||
nt|garnetts: Golden rule limit your hand and leave it to partner |pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, 5 isn't safe but makes on this layaout.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|chen_xin: Ê¥ÓêÌïÓ®»Ø8imp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: 3D is one down I believe.|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3D is -1 if they take their tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: If they stop they get lucky |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: now just hopes hts split|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: I don't blame N/S for bidding on.  I wouldn't like to be defending 4@H in the hope that 4 black suit losers stand up|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|garnetts: The think is about how to explian to partner that I should have bid 4@H if this goes off|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|keylime: b4: 3NT making six, so the six club slam and excellent play, nets more imps to N-S|pg||
nt|sybarra: right|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a push|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||

mb|p|nt|keylime: at the other table, a precision 2@c opener landed N-S into 5@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the lead that helped on 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S could be actually bid here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This surely won't be a push|pg||
nt|garnetts: shouldn't maybe but.............  :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|keylime: yep, that lead was charitable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Depends on how large and quick-tempered your teammates are.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|galadriel: Some people play Michaels as either weak or strong..would you call this strong?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Thought I might see Michaels.  Want to avoid the trump suit that doesn't break though.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this just doesnt make 4   good decision|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ianrei: he must be regretting not showing the majors a round earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: uh oh|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: true was wondering 3 can be beaten--maybe not on that lead a trump would have been interesting |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: 3@S does it this time|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|galadriel: Oh well, he obviously thinks its too strong|pg||
nt|idc: if only the auction had offered a clue that suits were splittling badly|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: oh, wait a minute ...|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I play any strength Michaels.  I like to get my shape over early.|pg||
nt|mariner1: DX just took the lead so this should bring it back to 1 imp|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3N is out the window|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Even if you don't, it's not too strong vulnerable opposite a passed partner|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ianrei: this hand shows why Brian is right|pg||
nt|ianrei: 800 against a non-making game|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think this is a clasical vul Michaels|pg||
pc|s4|nt|keylime: I am not a fan of redouble here - you have a clear idea of how you want to bid here|pg||
nt|keylime: unless, they are forced to systemically|pg||
pc|c2|nt|galadriel: 2 decent suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garvey bid Michaels in the other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: and gets your hand over in one bid|pg||
nt|keylime: CR also got to the laydown small slam, but earned an imp by not getting the A@c cashed.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: Hmmm, I seem to be channeling the sarcastic spirit of Sam Leckie|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Garvey managed to avoid doing something strange!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is is still allowed to play a King and switch to show a singleton?   (rather than the Ace)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like it at the 4 level and below (if not playing Rusinow).|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|idc: that in itself counts as strange|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: 800 or 1100, matters little|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A club would have yielded 11|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Strange line but good enough.  I would have played on diamonds myself|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|idc: it matters for the 100 IMP difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it still will|pg||

nt|Walddk2: inviting us to participate|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A lot of if's, but if EBU can hold on to a lead around 40 (21-9), England must win the second half by 50 IMPs against Wales to win the Camrose Trophy. So EBU in a very strong ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: position now that England are 33 IMPs in arrears against Wales|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not exactly a triumph when Gillis had a normal raise.|pg||

nt|keylime: not something you hear normally..."plus 80, gain 16"|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|mariner1: another barn burner here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|galadriel: I doubt it too|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I was about to say you can have so many sophisticated methods for passed hand raises, 4@S here seems a bit agricultural|pg||
nt|santyclz: If it's right over 1@s, it has to be right over 2@ss.|pg||

nt|santyclz: After the opponents have shown no fit?|pg||

nt|galadriel: Successful here though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Devastating if you are a Scotland supporter|pg||
nt|galadriel: yep|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I thinks Bowles did very well here.  With two side aces either making or not, he tried to get a diamond established.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|santyclz: Wd by n.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idc: he did - to be fair to the dbl of 5@d, he was probably expecting NS to stop in 5@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: could have made both @S |pg||
nt|chick: hmmm, probably thinks he should save the boss trump for later|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: 3 boards to play,,,,, next session scheduled for 32 minutes from now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Presumably 4C a cue.  Maybe 3H a genral slam try in spades works better.  Don't know their methods.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Brian, and let 4m be a splinter|pg||
nt|sybarra: just guess the @D's for one loser |pg||
nt|santyclz: I see 8, doesn't anyone see a 9th?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's come home |pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: i expect you are right Brian - if 4@c were a splinter, the South hand has improved, if not, I prefer his 4@s signoff|pg||
nt|keylime: this hand is down off the hope a bunch on the heart lead|pg||
nt|keylime: at least one that I see, likely two|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally some IMPs to Scotland. Must be your presence, Ian|pg||
nt|idc: though trumps are so good I might go for 4@h amyway|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: The main danger was that trumps weren't solid enough.  Not sure they addressed that, but OK here.  |pg||
nt|idc: thx Roland but the reality is once I start talking about bridge, the other Scottish players just *seem* better :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think N just decided he was going to be in slam when his pd showed a @S fit, and to be fair, he does have a nice hand|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting auction in other room - transfer to @s and then a forcing 3@s bid by North|pg||
nt|idc: (they transfer with 4+ suits on some hand types) - presumably that invited South to cue but he didn't, and 4@s it was|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: That diamond again, says Gillis to himself|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Presumably, in the other room, 4S meant somethin.  Good trumps?  Otherwise 3NT an alternative.|pg||
nt|garnetts: well the spades do let you get two tricks --not that you would look for them--but too slow anyway|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|idc: would be good to know what 4@s meant - if good trumps North really should go on, if min and not interested ... well, North still might try|pg||

nt|keylime: wow. did that just happen?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1010 with give Scotland another imp|pg||
nt|idc: Was it John Matheson?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: On top club lead might be 1010.|pg||
nt|idc: If so, someone should tell him 1978 is over now and he can start bidding them again|pg||
nt|keylime: N-S has had much of the play this match,and the score is showing, along with very active biddings in the CR|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session........ next session in 26 minutes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nasty splits here--|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you sure he did not make them all?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, I'll give you the code for correction|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Sorry, does look like it should be 1010 in any case.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: He claimed 12 ... they are discussing it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E-W should give him one more|pg||

mb|3D|mb|4D|nt|bcallaghan: Vulnerable 5C save on this board.|pg||
nt|galadriel: I froze when we gained 10 imps!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S was bid in the OR and drifted two off--seems likely to be repeated |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chick: I think it's a guess ... as Joe says you need 2 honors onside, but which two you can't tell, so mentally flip a coin for the 9 or J|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: 11 even|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: this is a brutal hand |pg||
nt|santyclz: Since it doesn't matter, take the play that gains if all 3 are on side.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|keylime: the dummy is not much of comfort for declarer - the heart suit is a lacking of a fourth trump a potential bother|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: how to play the @S......  normally one thinks S has more dues to 3@D call|pg||
nt|chick: that's a good thought :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: true|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|nt|mariner1: and of course he needs to ruff out the @D|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sometimes the glass *is* half full.|pg||
nt|chick: this looks to be down at least 1, maybe 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not sure I like 4@D  unless it showed 5/5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Does everyone play negative x's on that auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: double for takeout maybe|pg||
nt|santyclz: If not, 4@d is kind of forced.|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H forcing?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|idc: understandable doubles from NS but they won't get rich from them|pg||

nt|garnetts: Odd result on the last hand in the OR played in 1@D making 10 tricks |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|d3|nt|idc: Interesting 1@h overcall from Howard - when you play very agressive style, that hand is too good/defensive for a weak jump at these colours|pg||
