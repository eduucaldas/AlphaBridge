nt|jrssd: indeed, this is an online reunion of sorts|pg||
nt|diamond_: Thanks John - it was a bit lonely for Al|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Steve|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|lestergold: a routine 3n to bid on n/s cards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jrssd: Eeast played 1@S in the other room, just making|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 spades 2h 2d and a club available maybe....2 clubs...depends how play goes|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jrssd: using dummies 2 entries to lead Spades towards his KQXXX|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jrssd: in the other room the North opened 1@C, which influenced South to lead his doubleton Q.|pg||
nt|jrssd: this will require some help from the defense if it's going to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 1n i assume foring in their sys|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications are slightll awkward here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwi_joker: y - the 2@D may be a bit prepared ..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Grant Ker play precision with 2@D 11/15 6@D or 5/5 minors|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: best start for the defence ... declarer will want to unblock the hearts ..but will also be wary of removing entries to that spade suit ... so a little tricky|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy o play double dummy n ot so easy when you can only see 2 hands|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: maybe intrafinesse in @C|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jrssd: it seems as though declarer could set up a @C for his 8th trick|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: he did not duck because of limited entries and communication|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jrssd: but not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe needed to do it when in hand with @H|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: he played hearts first so finesse in spades into 'safe' hand but....|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jrssd: yes, he needed to use dummies entries, just as in the CR, to make 2@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer does not kbnow of the nasty surprise in spades|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jrssd: by leading trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well off on this line|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: misclick?|pg||
nt|lestergold: even offf if he takes the spade finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: this should be 4 imps for Burrows -- they need a lot more, but it's a start :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: looks like he did indeed finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphznp: ni missclick|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: but he will still take club and go off|pg||

mb|1C|mb|2H!|mb|2N|nt|hedyg: no updates yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: looks like another flat board at 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphznc: this might endin 3@D dbled|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|davidb: very agressive 3D even NV|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: or not :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: even more agressive 4@H! did we miss a double by S?|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: south was waiting for X from North|pg||
nt|davidb: do we have the right bidding? |pg||
nt|vugraphznc: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ron says we do|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i trust him :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: there are jokes going around the table that I cant repeat :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: i wonder how S didn't find anymore bid with Q@c, A@s and 4@h's|pg||
nt|hedyg: well this will help|pg||
nt|yuval10: *any more bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is still furious that pd did not double|pg||
nt|davidb: S was not thinking of bidding over 4H? Ron?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the pass came very quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: I just asked him and I got a clear "NO"|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 3@H would show a stronger hand and 4@H more distributional|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|hedyg: bd CR S in 2@s X|pg||
