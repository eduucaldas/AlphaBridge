mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You don't change things overnight in Britain|pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes loads of them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you suggesting UK is behind the times, Roland?|pg||
nt|ady: presumably 1NT natural   under strength for me oppsoite a simle overcall   especially with no fit|pg||
nt|snorris: much bidding in south|pg||
nt|thegarve:  all sorts of unusual ones|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's what I am implying bridgewise, yes|pg||
nt|snorris: they might stumble into 3nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Do Meckwell play them?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play a strong club system so that is moot|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I even play 3@S in plenty of auctions as a transfer to 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|thegarve:  evn in natural systems I play plenty xfers|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|thegarve:  1m (1@s) 2D as hearts is very good|pg||
nt|irwinbo: the bridge world has been promoting transfers for years but they are rarely played in the united states  again the acbl "protects" the general player|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: e/w    got problems defending  with no communication|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: is that because it's a good system or does it put off the opposition?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its technically very good|pg||
nt|snorris: lucky north...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Transfers to a natural 1@C are far superior for many reasons|pg||
nt|thegarve:  puts the overcaller on lead for example|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with the bridge population falling, i think that's a good idea of the ACBL|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   set for a good score whatever the result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's the certain way to keep youngsters away from the game|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the mind needs to grow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Welcome folks, but you are not allowed to play this, that and this"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the philosophy is good but in reality it doesnt work|pg||
nt|mariner1: Ogust or feature whichever you prefer|pg||
nt|thegarve:  yiou are simply to stupid therefore yiu can't|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was answering question|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but to the average player it's a pastime Martin |pg||
nt|thegarve:  IN New Zealand I played against plenty of elderly folk who loved fancy oideas and played them themselves|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: many very intelligent people play bridge without being in the higher echelons|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You should not protect the 70 year olds. They can't play forever. Turn your attention to the youngsters.  You need them for the future|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So let them have fun|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Restrictions are no fun for them|pg||
