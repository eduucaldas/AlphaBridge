mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|frankaus: nice gentle part score to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: many would exp that this martch will be a walk-over for the danish juniors - but in a practice match before NM the gils won!! easy!!|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @H could be a very lucky one - defeated, if South stays cool with the @D Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: another one of these over strength weak 2s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: with similar result to one this morning i suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Oh - the @C-ruff gives the 10th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should double this to show the good hand|pg||
nt|chick: 13 HCP and doubleton H isn't enough to force to 3 level though|pg||
nt|othered1: overstrength?  Looks sanely standard to me.|pg||
nt|werge: @h-lead!?!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: EW sh be: Lea Troels Møller Pedersen og Lars Møller Sørensen|pg||
nt|snorris: the 5 of @ds should be lavinthal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: quite right Chich but east has opened with a rather super maxi  weak 2|pg||
nt|werge: And not cover the @C Queen, pls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT here for the minors, but whether to do this opposite a passed hand is debatable  |pg||
nt|lestergold: this should have been competed to 3h at any rate|pg||
pc|hK|nt|snorris: but hard to see all the same|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the natural play in hearts is losing..|pg||
nt|snorris: still 7 tricks e-w|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: sorry, but I don't think it's super-maxi at all |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it might be overstrength, after all, at least in expected suit quality, since west chose to sell out.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|chick: E has a moderate weak 2, not even close to a 1@H bid, so while this may make 4@H, I don't think they should be bidding it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|snorris: chanse to beat it now|pg||
nt|pelu: If N now play @C she almost force declayer to "find" @HQ|pg||
nt|snorris: @c back..|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 3c looks like at least 1 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how do you make 4@H on a trump lead? |pg||
nt|lestergold: why not cashing second heart?|pg||
nt|werge: But 4 @H is obe down... - trump-lead and duck the @C Qieen|pg||
nt|othered1: lead @S on trump lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: in hearts there 6h tricks 2 dims and 2 clubs available as cards lie n'est ce pas?|pg||
nt|werge: Not if South is cool|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|snorris: a safty play should yield 8 tricks..small h to k low back|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|p_fredin: I dont exactly nknow how they are playing but 1C might be bal or nat and 1D +4 and unbal. Transfers after the resposes oto 1D|pg||
nt|chthonic: One would assume 2C is a prelude to showing a major/minor hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: North must now decide whether he is worth a game try, facing a vulnerable bid. But the opening was a strong 1NT and he will probably hold back.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: Guess not|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: WIth no heart fit, she judged well not to make a try.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any 2 suiter besides club suit maybe|pg||
nt|p_fredin: 2C probably Asptro. +4H and +5 any suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: Did 2C show hearts and diamonds specifically?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: due to z|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: There was no government warning attached, saying 'Not suitable for commentators'.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@Sx on a trump lead might not be much fun.|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east has been warned....|pg||
nt|othered1: as many play, double by south would imply interest in penalty of @S as much as great length/strength in @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: one 5 card suit more or less destined for the skip|pg||
nt|othered1: and the @S, though 4 long, aren't very robust|pg||

mb|4N!|nt|jtr: It means 'double'|pg||

mb|p|nt|p_fredin: true|pg||

nt|mmmakela: luckily N had those beautiful heart 109, W could've had them as well|pg||
nt|chthonic: One more heart will be ducked, then diamonds run.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our next match in 1½ hours is Denmark Juniors vs Iceland Juniors|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer suggests that declarer might have ruffed the first spade high, to preserve fluidity in the trump suit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't.  I think it's irresponsible to the team, even if it might work out here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: south might be shaken after the 12 tricks in last board|pg||
nt|snorris: good night|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes it was|pg||
nt|chick: I would prefer 1@S then 4@S, in case partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also, 4@S as an opening bid is quite difficult to defend against - is double penalty or take-out, is 4NT three-suited or for the minors, etc, etc  |pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: Cornelia you wont win too many tough matches opening these hands with 1 spade|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||

nt|jtr: Nicely done anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry, remembering that sort of thing is not a highlight of my limited skills.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D is the par contract. Well bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well bid|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, and without any lurking dangers, 420 will quickly be wrapped up.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever to lead a low club, whether they bid 5@D or 6@D. When a club is not led, declarer has no option but to lead towards the @CK himself.|pg||

mb|p|nt|snorris: well if n-s have @cs  and I have clubs then pd doesnt..|pg||
