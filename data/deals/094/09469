mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: most people who play Jacoby 2N [essentially, that's what is used by NS] have replaced original reply of jump in new suit showing void - with jump in new suit showing good 2nd 5 ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: card suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: Checkback|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason to bid a nt slam with a combined 30 points|pg||

nt|henryb: no|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Henry:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: max 2 3 4 4 shape|pg||

nt|oosmanb: or a -90 imps dbl?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|farrukh: good dbl for 2 imps minimum|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well @S lead is the only double dummy lead on which you can not make|pg||
nt|oosmanb: according to GIB|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double is the sort of bid which normally attracts a redouble and make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: luckily for north no one can redouble and few would make either|pg||
nt|werge: @D to the 10 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Squeeze they call it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with north showing spade length why should east play north for dim length too?|pg||
nt|werge: Almost...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|granguru: N should have played @DA|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|werge: @D to the ten is only real hope for two tricks in that suit|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @S and @D is best shot i think|pg||
nt|granguru: the known card|pg||
nt|ketoprak: agree|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but if north ducks you can not make|pg||
