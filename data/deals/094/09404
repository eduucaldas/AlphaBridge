mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 1NT 4NT Pass wd be my guess|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|davidstern: IN the CR South opened 1NT 15-17 it seems which may make it hard for North to probe|pg||

nt|davidstern: Flat 15-17 opposite flat 16 not so hard|pg||

nt|davidstern: Yes 1NT-4NT sounds ideal|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They seem to be playing Puppet  (2@C   2@S = hearts). Not sure what 3@H is though|pg||

mb|2H|nt|petergill: Dbl = clubs, I am told, so 1@s was a psychic bid with club support. |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|petergill: Now North does another psychic bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: North doesn't have @SQ to lead :) so he's trying other diversions|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sunsamvar: interference over strong 1 @C pays big tome here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: time sry|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: kept Parnu away from the cold 4@H contract|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h3|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: If North talked EW out of their 4-4 heart fit by making psychic bids, South's failure to ever raise spades is curious.  |pg||

nt|bridge_one: AKJx for Qxx you could try to play :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 6@S makes here, can they find it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6s played bu north is better than 50%|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|lestergold: as dim ace is right and clubs are three its 200%!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he always needs A@D in W|pg||
nt|lestergold: no clubs 3/3  enuf|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup|pg||
mb|1S|an|red or black|nt|neobas: Pitch a @D on the 4th @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c do not have to be 3 3 either....... but it helps|pg||
nt|neobas: Either @DA onside or @Cs 3/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: one or the other is needed|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a @D lead|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think it is 36% for the 3-3 clubs and one half of the remaining 64% or 68% in total|pg||
nt|lestergold: so its well above 50%|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also A in East singleton|pg||
nt|neobas: lol Rob|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: only if its led or you long neck it|pg||
nt|neobas: brb, drinks :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead by E gins 6@S unless W has 0 - 1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s means ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I was not suggesting it woul be led,,, I said IF :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the interesting question is will they get there for a big score?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no singleton, so can keep a void ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: 2N is forcing @S raise.....|pg||
nt|irwinbo: is this "serious"3nt?|pg||
nt|neobas: 3NT must be artificial, surely|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bridge_one: i hops no serious 3Nt ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has to be further enquiry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|neobas: 4@H by S will slow N down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving the informations about the weakness of hands ...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: 4@s now isn't correct with the control in @D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: tame bidding|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, some will bid this slam I think|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like 4@H, it takes up too much bidding space imo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is uaed in one of this way: 1) strong hand (6+controls) 2)no first round controls in minors suit - i think they play the option 2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: they need to have a void showing call over the 2N|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: so often u see good slams unbid because players fail to realise that their other values may still bwe good ebuf for slam|pg||
