pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: EW did well to push NS too high, West judging well to reopen the bidding despite his longish spades. |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the king, diamond ducked|pg||
nt|petergill: and East didn't punish his partner's enterprising re-opening dbl by bidding too much. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But will he play like that? I doubt it|pg||
nt|werge: No - @d only brings in one trick|pg||
nt|thegarve: he might have considered protecting with 1NT on xxxx|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: North can place @CAQ with East, hence @DA with West on the bidding. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: However, he knows West's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 spades, 4 hearts, 3 clubs|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: 4 hearts because of the lead (@H2). They play 3rd|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: I think North can count West as 4423 from East's failure to bid hearts.  |pg||

mb|1H|nt|petergill: NS have a very fluky 3NT on, but a heart partscore is more normal. |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Easy 3 NT here - but hard to bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|thegarve: Pusten have a handy 14 VP lead at this stage - not so easy to reel that in using the 25VP method|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: How do you think the K&R Hand Evaluator will rate that East hand?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: 2@D to show the long heart suit (or major), suitable at this vulnerability. |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 19.2?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|petergill: Norwegian bridge must be tough - I an see the name of a current World Champion in the team coming 20th. These teams are coming 1st and 4th. |pg||

nt|Walddk2: passing 2NT is rarely right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|werge: - also against 2 NT|pg||

nt|petergill: South played a heart back in the hope that North had enough to stop the @d's from running, e.g. @DQxx. |pg||
nt|petergill: The rationale being that if @D's run, 2NT will not go down|pg||
