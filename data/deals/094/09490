nt|snorris: 1@h-1@s, 4@h...|pg||

mb|d|an|t.o|nt|mariner1: hi Arifin and George|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.bridge.ee/MV/AB-tln.htm - Tournament site|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|r|nt|josj: a grand slam for breakfast|pg||
nt|snorris: yes!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought about 4@S by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was Cherry  Blossom festival weekend |pg||
nt|snorris: where ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|garnetts: 5@D is clearly the best contract--but even that may be too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting pass for S|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|snorris: -3  too much|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|snorris: first double not negative?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: it was; alert was too late:)|pg||
nt|snorris: and no neg double from north?|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S can cue the @D early.....off to the races |pg||
mb|4D|nt|garnetts: Sometimes this sort of pre-emptive tactics help declarer  in the play|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: this should end the auction|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: we start off with an everyday grand|pg||
nt|col3435: do you think it points out the diamond situation here?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The heart position will force west to unguard the Kxx of spades because the Q@H acts as a squeeze xard|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess NS do not use forcing NT,,, maybe polish @c or similar?|pg||
nt|daman: unless East takes a view|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: wondering if they get there -- it's certainly possible|pg||
mb|5C|nt|josj: 4@S should be cue with @C as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho there are only 2 visible losers in 5c, 11 winners may well prove dfficult if they reach it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Avram|pg||
nt|snorris: this is too cheep|pg||
nt|snorris: only 300|pg||
nt|garnetts: unusual to make a shortgage cue in a suit you opened :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a simple 4@S to  restart with|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: re and sorry about that|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Cornelia |pg||
nt|snorris: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sybarra: now what does south bid?|pg||
nt|snorris: looks like cue-bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H might reassure partner of no heart losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I think dec will not get the @D position right--the 3@H will ensure that---I am afraid I would have bid 4@H which would have been a better indication|pg||
nt|col3435: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still we have stopped short for some reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can't have much faith in his partner's bidding or card play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: dummy lost its @s 4 and now looking for it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo an example how easy it is bto disrupt a big 1@C by opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: wlc david|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think north liked that|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I suppose 2@S was non-forcing |pg||
pc|d5|nt|josj: 5@D = 4 KC with @C trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's seldom easy to bid a grand based on long, well-fitting suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are thee!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/abkoos09.htm - Convention Cards|pg||
nt|snorris: a chanse for 500 if east misguesses @cs|pg||

nt|xenya: pity|pg||
nt|josj: you were right, Vladimir...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|josj: with @H 5-1 the @D finesse is needed in 7 but it would have been an excellent contract|pg||
nt|xenya: quick claim i suppose|pg||
nt|snorris: north liked it plenty|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|josj: no sign of it yet...|pg||

nt|mariner1: openers.... many have|pg||
pc|d3|nt|snorris: right|pg||

nt|lestergold: a cars lie 4h looks cold for e/w|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: previous results http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||

nt|snorris: and when not..|pg||
nt|garnetts: The two leading teams are equal at this point--so this is a real shoot out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we had a very exciting and very good match earlier today here in CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: roheline lammas is playing against druva now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|josj: another near-slam but this time it will fail|pg||
nt|josj: so it should end up in a boring 3nt|pg||
nt|april7: after opening and stayman E will play 4@Hlosing 2 @C and 1 @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @h the limit|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW might be on for 5@C here but may find it hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|snorris: 10 tricks in @cs here|pg||
nt|snorris: no game on|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: this also looks slammy, but they'd better stay out of it, it seems |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: or 2@S:)|pg||
nt|snorris: 3@h is my bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if pass now np for ew|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 2@S gets round to east he may balance with 3@C |pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|col3435: I don't know whether these 1@c bids are "strong" clubs or something else - anyone have any information?|pg||

nt|snorris: :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: he is on the other side of the screen... so might not:)|pg||
nt|snorris: max too tricks for declerer|pg||

nt|snorris: now s has to bid..|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: how many C's?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|xenya: too much duplication in @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the wasted qj of clubs is compensatwed for by the nfavourable position of the spade ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he buy it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: opening lead most probably a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is likley to be flat 4h a completely normal papa mama contract|pg||
nt|april7: or trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead can beat this|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe but I think he can do little real damage by trying 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @c was appropriate|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: N having only 2@H and K@S 3rd means this should be beat too|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @H broke better the could jettison a @D on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: or even if he only had kx @S|pg||
nt|snorris: now this is critical.. must switch too clubs|pg||

nt|garnetts: OH a multi of sorts|pg||
nt|garnetts: East can do nothing here unless he is on medication lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: singleton of certain suits or 0-8; 10+ 4/4; 15+ any|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s 3@cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: E finding this bid "interesting"|pg||
nt|chick: jullis will be at a loss with 19 hcp and a strong spade suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: This is a reasonable 4@S contract--but very hard to get to|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: 2@D looks like a good bid here to me--unusual but what else|pg||

nt|jaapfr: tx piret|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: you prefer 1@D ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: maybe their style is canope|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: canape|pg||

nt|garnetts: 3NT is silly--surely 3@S is much better|pg||
nt|col3435: but the alerting suggests that this is an artificial sequence|pg||
nt|daman: opening 1 @H is destructive to a partnership    takes partner completely out of the auction |pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: now N is looking confused:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H was daft |pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: TD coming to table |pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @SA indeed it was down 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not sure South can unscramble things |pg||
nt|garnetts: a low spade and later the A@S beats it too |pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok that i disagee:)?|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat board if the result stands 4@D made in the OR|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D away and play @D @D until trump and still home imo|pg||

nt|daman: so, if he opened properly the auction would proceed  1@D  (Dbl) Pass - 2@C - 2@H   etc etc   and then they would land on their feet|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe they sold out |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: in estonia, 1@d usually just denies 5 card major and says nothing about @d|pg||
nt|daman: when you bid 2@H it has to show longer @Ds than @Hs|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a play for 4@S|pg||
nt|snorris: more slams|pg||
nt|snorris: a grand one..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H also has the same play|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h is a fair contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree--but there are times when instinct and judgement maust override this|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to find @S lead vs the unlikely 4@H|pg||

nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H here is likely --also laydown |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now a quiet 4@H made no problems and relax:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo is the current leader ater 2 round robins, Pärnu 3 is on 8th place|pg||

mb|1S|nt|garnetts: 3NT also laydown |pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: a very risky bid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: These hands are not that easy--here 3NT is the best contract looking at EW only --but again tough to get to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and will make|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard opens a strong club and you hold this hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 13 imps to Monte Carlo on 2, when they stopped in 5N in OR -- also a bit too high, but makeable as it is|pg||
nt|josj: ty Tanel|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: standings at http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
nt|josj: little justice to gain 13 imps for stopping too high :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: a good 2@S bid--that will help |pg||
nt|lestergold: bur he is worried that e/w may be stealing the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo (356), Roheline Lammas (343), Druva (342,5), Eksprompt (338), Rakvere (313), Derpt (249), Otepää (222), Pärnu BK3 (201). |pg||

nt|jaapfr: time for coffee no way this goes wrong:)|pg||

nt|sybarra: ty Piret |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: no TD decision yet|pg||
nt|jaapfr: laydown=easily made in English although it contains the word down:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: but you suggested it :)|pg||
nt|daman: I would have raised @Ss    he already spoke to the @H suit when he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suggested it had play, not that they should be in it :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: confusing language|pg||
nt|snorris: north could be without the q of @ds so..|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|josj: this lead solves the trump problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is awake!|pg||
nt|ahalim: :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure "we" care about q @D|pg||
nt|snorris: for 13 tricks in nt yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D bid is?  rkk?|pg||
nt|chick: well, the @DQ makes the 13th trick, but only 15 pts in aces/kings, N must have a Q or two, so 7N is safer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: he cannot lead a @D for profit so I predict this will make|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: careful play makes this as EW should not score a @D|pg||
nt|snorris: no fancy bidding here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not a good advertisement for strong club |pg||

pc|s6|nt|xenya: a normal, quiet contract -- i think i'll go and get coffee|pg||

nt|josj: just 1 more @S to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: they are playing too fast|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: classical thoery is as you describe but modern thinking seems to be in favour of getting into the bidding at tye first opportunity as you may not get another one|pg||
nt|snorris: might be hard to reach|pg||
nt|snorris: yes:)|pg||
nt|chick: 7 is certainly possible with careful play, so no overruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 2Nt at least invitational |pg||
mb|2S|nt|col3435: yes that's how I'd play it. And I do think South should go on over that - excellent chance of 9 top tricks in NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might be able to make 4@S if they can get there|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe they will bid 6@D it is a very good contract--cold without a heart lead and on a spade finesse otherwise|pg||
nt|jaapfr: illogical whilst a child understands @DA lead b3 must be based on wrong explanations|pg||
nt|snorris: now north..do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Then South was very conservative|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might be tricky for NS to stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think most people today would make that double|pg||
nt|snorris: no bid..?|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: (or, failing that, a game on a finesse, which you still want to be in when vul)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: mb 2@H|pg||
nt|snorris: guessing 2 @h is the final bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: I will need guidance on the auction |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 3C was explained to opp, but i dont see it:(|pg||
nt|snorris: west needs to know about easts distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East looks confused|pg||
nt|snorris: so he can see the possibility of crossruffs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: had S rebid 2nt now, he would have committed himself...he certainly does not like 2@H either|pg||
nt|april7: experience told me that without the right shape when you double you get to often in trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: for the appeal: N normally acts as TD not player... |pg||
nt|jaapfr: au:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: This shortgage showing works against EW here as it strongly indicates a heart lead---obviously North will lead it anyway but he does not have to have the KQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so you predict 6@D-1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|col3435: well, the 5-level is OK here, and I'm sure they won't bid a slam off two aces (will they?)|pg||
nt|garnetts: depends |pg||
nt|garnetts: I already don't like the auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: me too|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 2 controls and  singleton C, and support for D shown by E|pg||
nt|snorris: bummer...|pg||
nt|snorris: makes the match closer though..|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok again....I will ask, is there something wrong with bidding 4 @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East admits: 3C was C shortness..... |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|josj: with the @D coming in and the @S right...|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a good debate|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to run the 9 @H when in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1nt 16-19 here?|pg||
nt|chick: now W's turn to say 'sorry'|pg||
nt|sybarra: good grief |pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: u also get into trouble when u miss a game|pg||
nt|snorris: some play 1@h from south shows 19+ hp|pg||
nt|snorris: so 1nt only 16-18|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzmf: connection lost, sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have a system mix up?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: well now 3N can be beaten|pg||
nt|josj: well, declarer has found a way to go down...@H bak and @C return...|pg||
nt|josj: back|pg||
nt|josj: I doubt if EW will find it|pg||
nt|xenya: but S was playing for @HA with W -- reasonable enough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this not easy to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 12 imps so 13-6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|snorris: 25-21 after this|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzmf: yes; i think they are all just tired|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: and then again when in with Q@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: still the @C duck doesn't look right to me, somehow|pg||
nt|josj: there we go!|pg||
nt|xenya: oh dear -- he found the switch!|pg||
nt|josj: should bring them some badly needed imps...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bridge is sometimes not honest|pg||
nt|jaapfr: fair|pg||
nt|garnetts: He has slightly misplayed this--should try A and another club  might be KQx --but no difference as things lie|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a very strange auction--why not play in the other red suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: could go off with tight defence|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d9|nt|april7: its really a difficult debate when to X,when to bid and when to pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: heart ten guess is critical here unless e/wopen them up|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: no, Jos |pg||
pc|h9|nt|snorris: no 2 nt might have been easier|pg||
pc|hK|nt|snorris: as the cards lie|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: they are going to lose more imps here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he still tries but too late|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|snorris: -1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess North showed 5-5 and South chose the stronger suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: they looked like they misunderstood each other|pg||
nt|col3435: ah. or that.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: i agree avrasm but my sonm has shocked me with hat he and his partner do  they are much more aggressive risk propne than we were in my day|pg||

nt|lestergold: are we gonna get a replay or a result here?|pg||
nt|april7: what did wets play???|pg||
nt|lestergold: we want to know badly did he play the spade|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.bridge.ee/MV/AB-tln.htm - Tournament site|pg||
nt|snorris: 20-20|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no 1 out of 14 was told:):)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kalma not at his best play i suppose?|pg||
nt|garnetts: test |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: i dont see him (screen):)|pg||
nt|snorris: a good 4 @h but might not win|pg||
nt|snorris: can be won on a endplay double dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@D 11-15 precision style|pg||
nt|mariner1: something to be said for passing these 11's........ works here though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: this looks like a hand where both sides might do best defending rather gthan declaring|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not 2 out of 7 boards:)|pg||
nt|snorris: otherwise east has to lead @d|pg||
nt|snorris: they are far from 4 @hs n-s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: in a simple sentence: one doesn't have to dance on every wedding|pg||
nt|snorris: misfit ..hard to reach 2 @c n-s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still upset about b3|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: I agree David|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: here is some connection problems so i lost first trick, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well placed cards for dec here|pg||
nt|col3435: ok, never mind about this one, anything can happen in these 1NT contracts so I won't try and predict it|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead doesnt hurt!|pg||
nt|lestergold: might just make with the loss of 2s 2c and a diamond now|pg||
nt|garnetts: likely to get to a bad game here |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: this time X would probably have led to 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is OK but 4@H is poor |pg||
nt|jaapfr: last chance:pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean OK  not good |pg||
nt|snorris: any live from north?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|josj: which is a much, much better proposition than 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you problems is entries|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but unlikely he pass|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: no other lead wouldhave endanger the contract either|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: after the club disacrds declarr is in dummy for the last time i fear|pg||
nt|april7: should discard 2 @C and hope for Q of @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: well E must not had a gimic to show his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: surely the contract is in danger avram|pg||
nt|snorris: going down..probably|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is not the best bid I have ever seen |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@S looks a better contract, even with 4-1 @Ss, -- 3N has no chance|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: i see 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|snorris: life|pg||
nt|chick: sadly, no|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|garnetts: I prefer 2NT over 2@H |pg||
nt|jaapfr: set 5 was very good we can not say that about this set:(|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|snorris: small @s for @c return|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: you can not even pull up system info for profile,  and as operator, you usually are just busy getting names, flag, etc in |pg||
pc|s6|nt|snorris: 2 @s will win|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: the 9 of @S was not a good idea|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S could be set....... needs to get a @D ruff in|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: would have been better for west to have ducked|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: too late now|pg||
nt|snorris: east not liking it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: X as N 2@H would be trusting the opps bidding tooo much:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: still thinking|pg||
nt|snorris: stick with ace..3 times @d ..and ace of @h..then @d|pg||
nt|snorris: that will save a trick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|snorris: ..maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: provided also @HA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh you said that|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|april7: but what kind of anopening was that anyway???|pg||
nt|lestergold: not one u or i would have macde for sure avram!|pg||
nt|april7: and vul. too???|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well pressure often leads to bridge that is not great--but that is normal |pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|snorris: south might counter that with a SMALL ruff in front of dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i do not agree with @CQ by N|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: east wisely played spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade and hes ioff|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant pick up the dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: west must play that pesky spade top beat it|pg||
nt|april7: S should have played @D after @H, now he will lose 2 @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: the reason is tio vlaidate the heart exits|pg||
nt|april7: W should continue @S ofcourse|pg||
nt|lestergold: however fat lady aints sung yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: west in tank|pg||
nt|lestergold: its jot necessarily obvious to west that he must play that spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: another card gives the contract|pg||
nt|april7: E should ofcourse not cover the 10 of @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: he wont im sure that would be misere|pg||
nt|april7: W has exiccards in @H after K of @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: exacly why he has to play spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point we are4 waiting|pg||
nt|april7: W might want to ruff a @D if the K of @D is with E, but its really not necessary, except S has QJ|pg||
nt|ahalim: isn't there still a @D loser ?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: well since J@S won they had another shot|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: W can win a @D now though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D for -4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 13-17|pg||
nt|garnetts: a club discard last time would have helped |pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C now for 13-13    -2|pg||
nt|garnetts: 7@S looks like suit preference for a club --10@S for a diamond |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: i will claim in a minute, too fast|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|snorris: not me either|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @CJ play and S thinking?|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW were very unlucky to lose 12 imps on the slam board |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: EW screaming at each other again|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now even could make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: that was actually privie, but so everyone knows.  as operator, you can not pick up bbo info (for example, stars, profiles etc)  |pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: 4@S woukd require a careful play in trumps -- even so, i'm not sure it would be made in practice|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: if he had played K@S on 1st @S he had it made|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: operators have plenty to do rather than worry about whether the audience knows if they have a star or no |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: but -1 too likely still lol|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: he could have pulled @H and led @S into E|pg||

nt|snorris: no pd is counting on something in south|pg||

nt|mariner1: snuck the @S the wrong way|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: it is indeed very easy to analyze from here|pg||
nt|garnetts: must draw trumps and guess spades |pg||
nt|jaapfr: seeing 52 cards and smoking|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 10@D indicates the divison and vacant spaces indicates a likely spade split is 4-2 |pg||
nt|garnetts: Therefore Q@D and J@S |pg||
pc|cK|nt|josj: W has given upside down count and gets the obvious ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can not believe he is making this|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: that is also my view--perhaps 3@H would do it justice|pg||
nt|lestergold: elimination wont help a jot here|pg||
nt|chick: Board 7, the 4@H with @D endplay was textbook perfect ... a good hand for the less experienced in our audience to study :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: and for NS N rescuing with 5@CX-2:)|pg||
nt|snorris: no way now they do|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: with current score, the total standings become even more intriguing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Standings before the current match are: Druva (320,5), Monte Carlo (319), Roheline Lammas (311), Ekspromt (309), Rakvere (270), Derpt (221), Otepää (203), Pärnu BK3 (171).   |pg||

nt|jaapfr: what is 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 2 @h ??|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raising to 4@s seems a bit of an overbid, though - and has galvanised North|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 1N is safe|pg||

nt|jaapfr: ecco|pg||

pc|h3|nt|lestergold: no he hasnt |pg||

nt|jaapfr: lovely 3@C C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Aivar Tihane|pg||
pc|h9|nt|snorris: e-w need to play clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, 4@S makes more sense in a strong club (and presumably 5-major) system  |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|col3435: this comes up quite a lot - my feeling is that the easiest way to bid these hands is to have the player with the long suit show his suit, and then let partner take control|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have adn lost an overtrick|pg||
nt|chick: tough to play spaces for only 2 losers, so difficult with a @D lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|mariner1: well he did so well done this time|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is bridge: if S does not open EW mite end in a horrible 4@H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|snorris: might have to finesse @hs for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris: if continued @ds lead|pg||
nt|snorris: best is small @d from south now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|col3435: from East's point of view, AKQxxx spades + Blackwood = easy game|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open they found 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: quick claim|pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: defence cannot remove both the @H and the @D entries to dummy's @C in time|pg||
nt|xenya: all  the defence can get is 4 @Ss and 2 aces|pg||
nt|col3435: but I suppose here they have so much to spare that they're always OK|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure i would have wasted much time over a 2NT opening from East|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: E showed 2 aces and 3 kings|pg||
nt|tihas: hi all, I will try to fit in with the commentary|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure Mike when you were told that when partner raises a major to game there is no slam on lol--I can remember seeing all my partner's cards when I used Blackwood--he threw ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: them at me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D a violation of Burn's Law|pg||

nt|lestergold: id have certainly led dim against 6!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: indeed it cost nothing|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR   South "gilded the lily" by bidding 6@D over 5   hung his partner for no reason|pg||
nt|snorris: now more @d|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|josj: no less than 3, I think...|pg||

nt|snorris: this is giving up|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: i thought all lines do lead to making this|pg||
nt|snorris: or this way..|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: TD at table |pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: East "almost" played a small H|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and then corrected|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: so the small stands|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: so new leader|pg||
nt|snorris: then 10 tricks?|pg||

nt|garnetts: Yes it was the size of your windows |pg||
nt|mdgraham: surprised at West's silence in the other room|pg||
nt|snorris: hard to find those @ds now|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 1D artificial, so no info yet about D suit.... |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|col3435: yes I would|pg||
nt|garnetts: Too small and you saved lots of money and you could pay---too large and you had plenty of money to pay anyway|pg||
nt|chick: unless N gets a bit braver|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: at equal    3@H was silly by West   could have given them something for nothing|pg||
nt|garnetts: We all think that 4NT by west is takeout and not natural do we?|pg||
nt|tihas: now this situation differs from the other table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|tihas: because E knows opps are pre-empting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Nothing East can do here now|pg||
nt|tihas: he can double|pg||
mb|2D|nt|col3435: I'd consider something more than 4@s as North, but never mind|pg||
nt|april7: after strong @C yes and come in perhaps later as you see|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has bid freely with taht garbage|pg||
nt|april7: disturbing bid|pg||
nt|daman: partner didn't need to have the World's Fair|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@S is off yet no DBL so............|pg||
nt|ahalim: no trouble|pg||
nt|snorris: see..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true is likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: backfiring rubbish here|pg||
nt|snorris: should do...|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: they do play Precision after all|pg||
nt|tihas: and W can take it out to his suits with 4NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tihas: but not today|pg||
nt|garnetts: Presumeably west figured it was natural |pg||
nt|sybarra: S is really thinking?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mariner1: Open also in 3@S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|snorris: not winning this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: on 9, the defence gave declarer no chance in 3N in OR -- 2 down|pg||
nt|xenya: and 9 more imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: no play|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: maybe 2NT was leb|pg||
nt|snorris: actually e-w can win 6 @ds|pg||
nt|chick: If N's X is a standard neg double, S should pass, his spade stopper is not good enough for 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: he opened a piece of cheese and now drives to game??  yu,k!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|snorris: might think 31@ds is forcing|pg||
nt|snorris: 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: normally 1@D-p-1@H-1@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|josj: best return for E now is a club :)|pg||
nt|snorris: lucky mind you..|pg||
nt|garnetts: I was wondering how else you can play in 4NT when you want to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the take-out option must be logical - with a balanced hand and some strength, West can double|pg||
nt|snorris: ..not 31 @ds|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: debate at table, what is  stornger , x or 3D|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: y|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mariner1: well he can drop the Q@S and make this|pg||
nt|chick: ah, I was about to type that if 3@D is forcing, they need to discuss their system :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Yes but with say   xx Kxx   xx  KQxxxx  |pg||
mb|4D|nt|april7: whats the hurry???|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 2@D-2@S etc|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: good guess in @Ds -- likely 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 3@S was made in Open as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: for some reason I convinced myself he had a @S loser........|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: should be, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: not that it matters much of course -- at this score|pg||
nt|april7: now S makes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: lewt it thru forsoem  reason |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: too fast again; discarding clubs and spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway easy making|pg||
nt|snorris: so on "normal" bidding e-w will end in 5 @ds..|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: went for sure 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dreadful defence|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: yes. never easy|pg||
nt|tihas: actually I dont like the 2NT bid at all with W hand here - the spades are weak and there is 4-card @h too|pg||

nt|garnetts: yes he needs to do that|pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: thay play too fast and i make some signal errors sometimes|pg||
nt|daman: 2nd push in 11 boards|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H NS looks right|pg||
nt|garnetts: But 4NT needs discussion |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it was a routine defence situation|pg||
nt|daman: EW may compete a bit perforce in @Ss|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like this will buy it|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @c n-s|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 4 @H?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: Open is in 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as we all can see today not normal-bidding has advantages but also considerable disadvantages|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: this is almost exactly a 50% slam--and that is the worst it could be |pg||
nt|daman: East has a good hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can hardly act |pg||
nt|tihas: no real reason for anybody to bid smth|pg||
nt|garnetts: You?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not me, cluck cluck |pg||
nt|garnetts: Bad hearts make it dubious I suppose|pg||
nt|snorris: @ss can be held to 8 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: Case for South doubling?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who would act as South |pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h is difficult with @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: and sometimes these people are right, but the risk is high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fully paid-up member of the Chicken Club |pg||
nt|tihas: and at this VUL much too high to my mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: when you know that a slam cannot be worse than that you should bid it in my view|pg||
nt|col3435: indeed|pg||
nt|snorris: battle of majors|pg||
nt|snorris: will end here I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: But 4@H is a horrible bid --surely a slam may be on |pg||
nt|mariner1: play should be quick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: 6@H makes but is not so good|pg||
nt|april7: its ab forcing pass? now W will pass also|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: the losing @C has to go on a @D|pg||
nt|josj: so it needs more thans the @D finesse being right|pg||
nt|col3435: they must play very limited openings - but even then, I agree, East has to do more|pg||
nt|lestergold: really Avram?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about north?|pg||
nt|april7: where should he go???|pg||
nt|snorris: but they sure are trying n-s these last boards|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: Not much wrong with a 1@S response|pg||

pc|d4|nt|josj: s?|pg||

nt|snorris: 11 hp..|pg||
nt|snorris: well ..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|april7: if S would discontinue @S after J of @S dropped, than defense makes only 5 @S and 1@H and 1 @D trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: glad we both wrong|pg||
nt|snorris: no one won..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: explaining 2D: minimum|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: not many would pass with his hand i think|pg||

pc|h3|nt|garnetts: an interesting point about the lead---I would lead a heart retaining the A@S as an entry later |pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: not any longher|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: indeed, and 4@H looks utterly hopeless here|pg||
nt|josj: it might be difficult to avoid a @C loser here even after guessing the @S|pg||
nt|chick: nah, E has more like a 14 count|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: if we play std and me 3rd hand 1@H you bid 2nt?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: luckily 5h is safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: miond you not an unreasonable try|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is another mistake not because game has been missed but because it has been missed vulnerable|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
pc|s4|nt|col3435: I might lead a club.|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have no real rationale for this except that experience has left me with this prejudice |pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: they need to knock the A @D out|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: 2NT is right vul on the west cards and not otherwise |pg||
nt|chick: no matter how you count distribution, any 6-5 is a very good hand beyond the HCP|pg||

nt|garnetts: Something that I have a thing about at teams --push for vulnerable games |pg||
nt|mdgraham: plus Jx of partner's suit is a plus|pg||
nt|garnetts: also bear in mind they were behind almsot certainly and they have just had a pick up--golden time to ram home an advantage |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: in Open they are in a calm 2@S in W|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D E  2@S  swish|pg||
nt|garnetts: Instead they have given it back |pg||
mb|1D|mb|2D|nt|mariner1: N has a sort of tough call here knowing S has a limited opener|pg||
nt|daman: do we like 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahalim: i prefer dbl|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: I would raise 1@H to 2@H|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah I was about to ask whether you prefer 2@h to 1NT :)|pg||
nt|april7: X now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north south cold for 3s close to 4 not even in auction!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Peter Pigot (Ireland) says, West on the last hand had aces, which give a certain measure of control|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we DBL  I like shaped DBL (my mouse and me :) )|pg||
nt|snorris: no 3 @ds??|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!|pg||
nt|chick: yikes is right|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s stealing this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: South levered EW into 3NT in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: not so keen on this|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D can risk a 5-1 fit--whereas 2@H must be at worse 4-3|pg||
nt|col3435: I know the 1@d bid hadn't shown diamonds, but ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|jaapfr: let @DJ walk|pg||
nt|snorris: its ok double stop|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 1 entry in E then|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT looks like a reasonable shot here |pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: something strange happened at trick1 of previous board...unlikely S won the trick with his @DJ...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a few spectators have pointed that out... |pg||
nt|josj: to me too...:)|pg||
nt|xenya: however it's not so important i think|pg||
nt|josj: 1 imp at stake, possibly|pg||
nt|xenya: it could be W's or operator's error|pg||
nt|josj: of the 2 Parnu has got...|pg||
nt|lestergold: abusrd|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: playing strong @C you sometimes end up in remarkably low contracts|pg||
nt|josj: E can pass here as p is known not to have 16+|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like 1NT--but prefer that to 2@D |pg||
nt|snorris: no easy contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very interesting play ahead here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: so 2@S played in different directions here in the two rooms..... one is a violation of|pg||
nt|mariner1: Burn's Law|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: good lead problem for South, as 1@D may (I think) be short |pg||
nt|garnetts: How many times does West want to bid this? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, West has removed 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|snorris: actually best to raise @ss!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E can see about his entry problems rite now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and hates the @C7 and @C6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not knowing they are 4-1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway|pg||
nt|snorris: might try finesse @s now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not clear why|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: nice idea of E @HQ!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: George Burns?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe he doesn't think his partner is much of a card player|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, his team is joint first.... |pg||
nt|tihas: he probably figured that his hand is too weak for playing 3NT, when partner has 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not for much longer methinks |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ks lead beatsb it low lets it thru|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|april7: NS have a cold 4@S, so it was a lucky openerby E|pg||
nt|mariner1: Say Good Night Gracie :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 2@S in W was not a winner in Open|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|snorris: counting on 4 @c tricks..not forthcomming|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even mite make now|pg||
nt|snorris: so will try the @s finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or trow in?|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at the end|pg||
nt|snorris: but south should play small @dnow|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thrilling board until now|pg||
nt|snorris: and the defense prevails|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then endplay easy for 9 tr|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|garnetts: If partner cannot handle the odd Moysian fit--so called after Sonny Moyse who had a habit of opening three card majors--then find a partner who can lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dim lead can defeat 4s with a ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|snorris: see!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT should show a spade fit in way --not a small singleton so maybe he was wondering if there was a miracle fit in clubs for a slam |pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: One point about the last hand--anyone for 2NT from North?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now makes|pg||
nt|snorris: now n-s win|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: the defence have got all the tricks they are entitled to here|pg||

nt|jaapfr: @C@C@C@HT and @C|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: the lead was bizarre|pg||

nt|snorris: @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: it's close, obviously, but I think a misfitting 10-count is not an invite normally|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and failing that they could have at least defeated 1nt trivially|pg||
nt|snorris: almost a slam..|pg||
nt|garnetts: Knows about seven diamonds and the spades and hearts ==three clubs|pg||
nt|tihas: lets be honest - this is some awful bridge|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: check the vugraph schedule as Roland has some good ones lined up|pg||

nt|snorris: for 10th trick the king of @h|pg||
nt|tihas: whatever the reason, guys are not playing their best game|pg||
nt|snorris: no if 4@c is inviting|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: routine, yes -- they might prefer to play in @Hs though -- also a good contract|pg||
nt|garnetts: precision canape at work here|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is a good grand slam needing only @d 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: N could have bid 2@S after 1NT by W|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a crime by any means but letting 1nt thru that was off teh sc ale|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello Mr. Holland :)|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says this looks like a Romx 2@D   any comments?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i have to count better:)|pg||
nt|snorris: gliding into 4 @s not making?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|snorris: on @c lead.. wich is not likly|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: Romex*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@D|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|april7: 9 tricks available if E finesses for the J of @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems to me that there is a squeeze on S on the 4th @s|pg||
nt|snorris: PASS::|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: N is shaking his head; wasnt pleased for the 4S|pg||
nt|snorris: last chanse..|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: would be great if now @D lead against 4nt|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is an overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: lunch after this match and back at 15:00|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a classic auction to 3N via a @H transfer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: 2@H is surely not a good move here--overstates by a lot|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he discs a @H you can pick up all@hs, if he discs a @d........|pg||
nt|daman: I play a @C|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lestergold: and what other line is there?|pg||

nt|hedyg: or declarer here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i have problems with X by N|pg||
nt|snorris: should be -1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|col3435: I'm not sure I know what 2@h means for them|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east sets up a n easy club trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: This may well make --but it does not justify the bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry two easy club tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: what a dreadful decision by north|pg||
nt|snorris: dont like the double either|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out  of 10 would rebid 3nt|pg||
nt|snorris: so 12 imps to Monte Carlo and a close match|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: 2@S as a trial would catch 3@S and then 4@H is fine--but maybe EW are fed up |pg||
nt|snorris: so Monte Carlo will keep Druva behind..|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|xenya: 10 top tricks -- perhaps there's an 11th somewhere |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|col3435: not enough values, not enough fit, but maybe enough tricks :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: to have any chance the has to work out the transportation too|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|garnetts: certain line for 10 tricks so this is right and it will cost an IMP|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: Very lucky club position --but dec has blown it |pg||
pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: specs suggested 3@H rebid by N: you like that?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|snorris: no|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very hard on EW - we have all had sessions like this, when all that you do crumbles|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: if he hadnt pulled the @ds early he could play the J@H now and then the black winners..|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is no longer possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: and he now has to pitch before S does|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8@H would stay as a menace|pg||
nt|hedyg: and E could have pitched his @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: too hard to go for the @H finesse directly when in 7NT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|snorris: north has the stopper himself|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|snorris: and easy 9 tricks|pg||
