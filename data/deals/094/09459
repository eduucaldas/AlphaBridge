nt|yo_yo: hello bumi|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|5C|an|.|nt|mtvesuvius: 5@c is exclusion?|pg||
nt|dburn: but this auction is probably locked into spades now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedes still bidding the hand in the other room. The auction has taken 6 minutes so far|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprising - this is a very tough hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they are in 6@s in the CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eventually they stopped in 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|mtvesuvius: this should get EW to 7@s though|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: this will be very interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: now if this makes on a trump coup we have a champagne hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Jóhann reads the layout to perfection he can execute a so-called Trump Coup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At trick 11 he will end in dummy with @DA10 in his hand over North's J8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: I think he is capable of doing that. Jóhann is a fine player|pg||

nt|frankaus: Dagher  must be a beer card exponent the way he played the @D suit|pg||

nt|bobholl: not easy to take 2@H before one disappears on @C|pg||

nt|april7: but some people lead from Kings|pg||
nt|hussein2: not in egypt April :)|pg||

nt|hussein2: Yousry is an agressive player, lets see what is he having in mind.|pg||
nt|april7: is this a 2@S opener vul.?|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely not vuln against not|pg||
nt|hussein2: I wouldn't, but maybe he would especially after finishing his juniors duty.|pg||
nt|april7: interesting bidding in hand 1 in oben room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzkh: rare to pass with the S hand nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ady: yes   AK  A  and 5 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris: will west invite?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D here would leave the suit at opps|pg||

nt|marlowepi: a lucky slam here|pg||

nt|frankaus: 21S ok 4 me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with long in @C the lead @D can be right|pg||

mb|3S|nt|april7: now W will make 4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: now migth make 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S used as big balanced hand here,,,,, could be others such as weak major|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D I mean|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@d is a multi type I guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends, ed. "sniff at" has two meanings:  " flirt with " or "disdain"|pg||
nt|othered1: flirt with was my context|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my usual context also :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: maanged to climb to 4 sspades in other room|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we told him to make a try :)|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|april7: why K???|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|yo_yo: that's a bit odd|pg||
nt|mariner1: 8 opposite the 22 or so here usually means no slam with no supported suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: now J of @D|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: a bit ?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: maybe Rabie makes a habit of underleading aces|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|snorris: probably not the way it vent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however it doesnt look good to make 4 when you are only in 2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: it looks like W, who led spade ace, was imagining a spade holding like Kxx in declarer's hand and stiff queen in dummy, with E having an entry|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobholl: should play @H now|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: well, he had a chance for safety|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes operation big deal as Flint would say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If everything looks like a rose garden, it is time to take stock and ask yourself: "What can possibly go wrong in this contract?"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only a 4-1 trump break can|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can I do about it if trumps are indeed 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: and it cannot be avoided if 4 are offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|.|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: so ruffing a @c is a step toward shorten his trumps to the necessary length|pg||

mb|1C|nt|bobholl: no game on this one but how to stay out :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a routine 3NT here|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: 2@S|pg||

nt|yo_yo: agree|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT now ans then ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 9@S lead might cause some problems    somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: raise off Kx might make life tricky though|pg||

mb|p|nt|hussein2: Hi again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: We are back, yes|pg||

nt|april7: 3@S???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2NT artificial?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: ugh|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hussein2: We have seen the action on the OR, apparently here there is a chance of avoiding game.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobholl: inspired pass and gain 2|pg||
nt|werge: But how can North stay out of game..?|pg||
nt|hussein2: They pllay 2@h as one round forcing, so 3@h can be of a 10 HCP|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT must be his bid!|pg||
nt|bobholl: well 3@C to Q doesn't help improve your cards|pg||
nt|werge: Sure - in NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nt from bad site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no aces, no heart card, one measly D stopper.......i wouldnt bid 2NT even facing Al Roth|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt makes :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzkh: hard to do when S was already passed though|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: unlikely to hold 6 cards in S|pg||
nt|snorris: yes q of @h onside|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure I like the 2N here...... looks like 3@D to me|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: it may be artificial|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobholl: he thougth probably that 3@H was forcing|pg||
nt|snorris: even better|pg||
nt|april7: @C lead and down you go, but @H lead  will make|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @C lead makes also with Q offside if a of @C rigth|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt 3NT cold on @C lead?|pg||
nt|april7: but also on @C lead |pg||
nt|mariner1: well using it as artificial should deny this much shape to me... sometimes you|pg||
nt|mariner1: need to tell as well as ask|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|werge: All this game needs, is @H Queen onside, but not fourth or more|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably best to play D queen at trick 2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|snorris: with a finesse|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: 10 asking for @S ??|pg||

nt|bobh1: at mps, more delicacy might be indicated|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: double finesse in @S :) 10 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: and he might play for Qx @H too|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: A tool invented my Eric Rodwell, becasue he would bid with 3 card suits over his partner's 1m opening and he hated playing 3-3 fits|pg||

pc|c3|nt|vugraphzkh: no explanation asked or given|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|april7: so little losers in E'S hand, so might try for slam except 2 @D isa weak raise|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hussein2: at least he assures the 11 tricks now |pg||
nt|bridge_one: and in IMP to play @D instead @H isn't a big lose|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bobholl: now he could know|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now singleton in @C in North is read|pg||
nt|sybarra: he might get the drift of the delicate auction |pg||
nt|bobholl: but not quite sure :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@H OUT convention - here helps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 5@D is a good choose now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N should rebid 4C over 3H. that has to be a club control with either a heart tolerance or a slammish hand in diamonds. but if N simply bids 2D over 2C, S will get to tell his whole ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: story|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has not shown short clubs. he could easily have a stiff heart honor and two losing clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @H migth be in danger only looking at S card :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|frankaus: OUT bid 6 if can hold (O)pponents , (U)nbid or (T)rump suit to one loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could push N to slam now |pg||
nt|frankaus: in that order|pg||
nt|marlowepi: automatic for N to bid slam now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @H can't be - so 5@D (a differite raise) show the force of hand (and the limites)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless he feels he has done his all with the jump to 3D. but if so, then he shouldnt have made that crowding bid to begin with|pg||
nt|bridge_one: south give all his cards |pg||
nt|bridge_one: no controls in blacks suit, 6 @h, support with H in @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't be sure of @H j so bid 6@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in many partnership styles, 3D would be impossible with N hand, as it is a general principle that a jump rebid in a forcing auction shows a solid suit. not all pairs have that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agreement though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: A of @H @D from top :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: making 3 or 4, depending on if he finds the Q@H|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|werge: For what reason, when I bid so, opponents take their 6-7 @S-trickc|pg||
nt|bobholl: in pairs you would have a very good score but here no difference|pg||
nt|bridge_one: patience|pg||
nt|sybarra: boo hiss |pg||
pc|c8|pc|s6|nt|henryb: from the subsequent actions I would guess it was a transfer showing 4+ @h|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bobholl: i have the fairly simple agreement that 4th suit bidder can pass partner can't so than 3 @D or 3@H is obligatory|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb: If he tries to split the @h he could go down a lot|pg||

nt|bobholl: than 2 @D is much better :)|pg||

nt|werge: West has a 2 @S-bid!!!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|werge: - with Q-9...|pg||
nt|april7: N might though bid 1NT 8-12 or 10-12 after 1@S by E|pg||
nt|frankaus: poll for final contract? - 2@H S 4 me|pg||
nt|bobholl: kaplan would be angrey with fady 55 black :)|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hussein2: do you bid 2@s with that?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: pitch a @s on the @d before playing trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @S out win A@H @c back|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: YES, especialæly when South does´nt double|pg||
nt|april7: a dead dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 16 hcp are very much !|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: does he want ruff's ? not my lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: have a chance of some imps here    can actually make 6@H     but at least 3NT from North|pg||
nt|henryb: 6N from the N hand is a fair contract|pg||
nt|snorris: this might go many down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: 4-6 3@S and with 7-9 and @S bid 2@H that can't be real :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|henryb: needs a red suit to come in and either clubs breaking or the @sA|pg||
nt|ady: yes   6NT as well with the clubs bedhaving  only need one of the red suits to come home|pg||
nt|henryb: onside|pg||
nt|april7: very discplined from E|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@D 2@h, 2Nt 3@D ,,, now 3Nt the same ...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hussein2: Well, the options was either pass or 3@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes that works,,,, can means maybe beat|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: the trick is to win this @S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: always making... assuming he flys A@S here|pg||
nt|othered1: overcall should make the play easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is a big assumption :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: if you play 2@S as 4-6 he has a normal pass:)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i tell nonsense ?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Y switch  - so carding miscommunication|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East thought to find 5 @C in North ... otherwise i don't see a reason to shift in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to bid 3Nt in 1 sec. can give this advantage|pg||
nt|frankaus: i suggest K for cont  leads  - then can tell pd has 3 (or 1) |pg||
nt|frankaus: *count|pg||
nt|sybarra: will try again here|pg||
nt|bobholl: will work now shirley :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: i was saying - that K 4 count leads would have helped here|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but if you have KQ you like to know wheather he has the !J :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: or just plain old fourths|pg||
nt|bobholl: for us it is so easy to play a and small @D :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: i lead Q from KQ - asks for attitude|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think that after A@C lead and 5 by the p, think to have chance in S! isn't a good idea (bidding 3Nt North must have a good stop in @S) - so the only chance to beat is to play for ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one:  3@C at the p|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|hussein2: thought it was easy at the begining :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|bobholl: so he was very rigth in not bidding 3@D |pg||

mb|4S!|nt|henryb: on a @s lead 5 of either minor makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: is that asking for preference or just a slam try?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: off 3 cashing tricks, but a @s lead should help that|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can't know to insert the jack. They also lead 3rd from 1065  for example|pg||

nt|bobholl: in how many @C ?|pg||

nt|bobholl: which is very good explainable losing 2@C 1@S 1D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he could play A in @D (10 in the dummy), @H for the A, and @D versus the Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Meanwhile EBU is ahead by 81, so thil looks fairly hopeless for England|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 20-20 hand here|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ady: a dicy 3NT here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: not necessarily|pg||
nt|othered1: is 1N automatic?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: East might balance with 2@d|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would never bid 1n|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that's probably where the hand will be played|pg||
nt|bobh1: clear takeout x|pg||
nt|mariner1: Rabbi's have a play for 1N|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer double, too, but expect we're in the minority.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Declarer has no choice but to drop the King|pg||
nt|mariner1: I do not like 1N but I hate DBL so I bid 1N|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1n leaves you so exposed|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I don't like 1NT, but X seems wrong here... At the table I would probably bid 1NT though|pg||
nt|mariner1: and DBL exposes you to more agony|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure what you think double promises that you don't have|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It also depends on how frequently people psych against you...|pg||
nt|bobh1: double brings partner into the game|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1n is very unilateral|pg||
nt|othered1: just in cast partner can bid NT, it may play several tricks better from that side|pg||
nt|mariner1: you do have a slight advantage having your hand over the E opener...... though I|pg||
nt|mariner1: prefer "usually" to have what looks like 2 @S stoppers|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Partner has KJx QTxx KQxxx 9, will partner be able to show this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me 1NT is clear at IMPs. the most likely game is 3NT (e.g. pd coul;d have KQxxx of diamonds & Q of clubs)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't want partner in the game if he can't bid over 1N :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marshall and I agree :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually when people agree with me they start to rethink their positions|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is one of those "Least Lie" issues and to me 1N is the least lie|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am committed Marshall, or should be committed :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess "zero" counts as "least"|pg||
nt|mariner1: well DBL is a big lie to me :)|pg||
nt|othered1: If you agree that the 1N overcaller will be treated as having @C (arbitrarily), east has easy takeout double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: by South yes ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5 of either minor should fail|pg||
nt|mariner1: well you duck J@S lead and then what does W do?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: these days a lot of folks open the S hand with 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: difficult for North to avoid a heart lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT is an underbid on the S hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now need pass - 4@H down|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bobholl: 1/2 @S 2 nt ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: stayman now???|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bobholl: i can't see the meanings :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: Check Back Stayman|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably S had no systemic option to 3NT, but that call could easily cause NS to miss 6D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @D and @h ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: and whats 3@D then|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: in Italy it is used 3@D forcing|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ady: even J@S  no good as long as west plays low|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: EBU are +83 24 imps  to play with for their 25 VP|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: i said a shot|pg||
nt|bobholl: no 3@H no 4@S so they play it differently|pg||
nt|bobholl: and reach 4@S neatly|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: this board has a multiplicity of results. One table played 3@c making 4, the par result. Another played 6@c, got the @hA lead, and guessed @d for 920|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the thing is, though, that it isn;t your partnership and its agreements that are playing in this event :)|pg||

nt|othered1: I guess on last hand, north was hoping 2@S would come back to him (not 3 or 4) and he'd then be able to double -- and perhaps bid game by himself?|pg||

nt|april7: why not 3@H???|pg||
nt|werge: Never bid 3 @D - 2 @H is the best bid for East|pg||
nt|frankaus: the richman style has had the effect that opps have had to rethink - how to compete as often neither opp is short enough in @S to make a t/o X |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: don't ask me :) i would surely have bid it|pg||

pc|d6|nt|henryb: I think that is a very good bid|pg||
nt|othered1: west has a nasty hand.  To begin with 2@C (if natural) and then make a slam try (3@H?) feels like you may trap partner with good but not fabulous @C into going too high.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange that W did not bid over 1NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: strang bid in my partnerships it asks ab out spade strength and you know it is bad|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the score showing is not up to date--there are several comparisons yet to come in|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 1 2 or 3@D all possible openings here|pg||
