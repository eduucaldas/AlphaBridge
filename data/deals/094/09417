nt|ralfwil: But a fit in any major needs less in HP than 6nt with balanced hands|pg||
nt|col3435: I think that's taking it too far though. Playing in a 4-4 fit is likely to make slam an awful lot better.|pg||
nt|col3435: (what Ralf said)|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: 4@H by NS is probably a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: unlikley they will get there|pg||
nt|Walddk3: North has a hand that's ideal for the Woolsey convention. Double = 4 of a major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|daman: ugh|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  not easy to reach|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|daman: at least they will m ake this on a xruff|pg||

nt|daman: wow    astro is a flash from the past    I guess you can come up with any convention to suit a particular hand|pg||
