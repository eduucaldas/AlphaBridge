nt|camacho: yes|pg||
nt|athene: you might just bid game with south facing 15-17, but it's a little pushy NV i suppose|pg||
nt|camacho: they may play NT range 16-18. Lets see|pg||

nt|bridge_one: K in @C was for sure in West, so A in @D don't need|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Antoff is originate from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|athene: but when BOTH your menaces are blocked, it all works out|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: no games here (best defense) however someone could be in one|pg||
nt|athene: so sometimes two wrongs do make a right :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Please check that result, operator.  It looked as if they took 9 tricks.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bedap: 1S?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bedap: pass?|pg||
nt|mayors: EW probably heading for 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Markku|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H is pretty good here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Negative x's over weak 2s?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mmmakela: hi all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Came just in time for an exciting hand.|pg||
nt|mariner1: u want to help?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but really it comes down to north's @H10 and @h9|pg||
nt|leao: 3@C should be N bid|pg||
nt|leao: lots of time to bid @s|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: we got all the way up there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Markku.|pg||
nt|athene: if north just had @HJxxx then 6@H would be very bad|pg||
nt|athene: and @HJ10xx it wouldn't be great|pg||
nt|leao: if they are serious bidders, they wont bid it|pg||
nt|leao: 4@s or 5@c for NS but not 5@S|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: I hate to pass with !xx support|pg||
nt|bedap: maybe just 2S as South but same result|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Axx|pg||
nt|mayors: Nice diamond position for declarer here. He can't get them wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3n plays well with the KQ @D doubletom|pg||
nt|mariner1: everything except @S set well here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D probably "waiting", often staymanic|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@c now should be a q in support of @ds and/or @ss.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|athene: it's certainly hard to get there|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his @SK and @DQJ are facing shortage and might not be worth much|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and he doesn't have much in the way of keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably @H, and @C for A in the dummy, now @D verussu A for small and K, after A in @D for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: joe :)|pg||
nt|leao: 3@d is indeed waiting|pg||
mb|6C|nt|bedap: Tully will think about 4-1 trump breaks|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 1|pg||
nt|leao: 12 tricks if normal play. next, please|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C would make too on the fortunate club break - if you take the right view in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you only have one entry to dummy in 6@C (@SK) so you have to decide whether to lead a small heart from hand first (which works on the layout) or go to dummy and lead the @HJ first ...|pg||
nt|athene: (which would work if east had the doubleton heart honour)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|nt|bridge_one: this is a error|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: playing on the black suits works as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|santyclz: E takes out an expensive insurance policy.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: can make 3Nt guessing to move J in @C|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|leao: ok... 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: well not attacking @D 2st will cost|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|bedap: The BOURKE team has no Margaret Bourke, she's NPC|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: this line isn't so bad - if K in @s out then K in @C problably in finesse ...|pg||

nt|leao: 5 imps to Peirão|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps 5@D|pg||
nt|santyclz: Profiles of some of the players (I'm told):|pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/leaocarvalho.php (leão again)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bedap: Hard to find hearts now|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here.......|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the 3rd rarest contract(after ppp and 1 @C)|pg||
nt|leao: 5@d is there for the asking|pg||
nt|athene: not many hcp but everything is working hard|pg||
nt|leao: @s and a minor, 5-5 at least|pg||
nt|santyclz:   http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/sergioaranha.php|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugrapha2: she's on lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: shouldn't be too hard to find them|pg||
nt|bedap: Good decision not to double the cold 2S|pg||
nt|mariner1: no making games though someone could be shoved up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass in North may be too much timide|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S play level 2 forcing|pg||
nt|mayors: I would have bid 1nt on the first round as north|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes NV vs VUL he might have risk 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N would be sandwich or strong for most.........|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt however not so bad - now need to guess|pg||
nt|athene: you might even make 12 tricks perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mayors: not after partner has opened|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I am nutz...... S opened 1@H :)|pg||
nt|mayors: now double is penalties|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one should be off quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N lebensohl asking for 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to diagnose the great fit|pg||
nt|athene: the key is that north has a singleton club facing a weak suit|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't have anything like @CK,@CQ, @CJ wasted|pg||
nt|athene: you can never know this in the bidding - when partner bids a suit you tend to assume he has strength there|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Both have the death holding, 3 small in the opps suit.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mayors: after the first round pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: now 3@H to play|pg||
nt|leao: rite u are|pg||
nt|athene: hence north just makes a limit raise|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bedap: find the cold 4H ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes this would be penalties|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s Dbl isnt easy to beat|pg||
nt|athene: and clearly south has dead minimum and passes|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|vugrapha2: that will be hard|pg||
nt|athene: you can come to 12 tricks by pitching a heart on spade and ruffing hearts good, reversing dummy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: @H @H ruff @c lead 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mayors: with 9 cards in @c NS have much less defense than they think|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|leao: Aranha will have to play for @d Ax with W|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|leao: i doubt hell go for that|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|leao: defense now found a @d ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/leaocarvalho.php |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|bedap: Maybe 2D over 1NT as a start?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and a trump loser too|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: well this line works same|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|mariner1: if he scores @D ruff its also with a good trump|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|mc|8|nt|bedap: so -100 in 3NT a good save|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: if dont 2 @D poss|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: he has big NT with a big NT on his left which reduces his hand value and increases|pg||
nt|mariner1: LHO value|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: once east shows up with the @DA you know west has to have the @CK to have even a shadow of a 1@S opener|pg||
nt|athene: of course to begin with, declarer will assume west has @CK AND @DA|pg||
mb|3C|nt|santyclz: I like 2@h.  The hand is a little strong for it, but the @ck can't be presumed to be worth much.|pg||

nt|mariner1: another hand where some one could get shoved too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: the weak NT will slow EW down...... so its up to NS to rise here|pg||
nt|leao: Ns limit is 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: the thing is, to beat a low-level contract, you need to think as though you are the one playing the hand|pg||
nt|athene: so for example to beat 1@D you need to make 1@D your way|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rule of 8:  subtract the number of aces held by the opponents from 8, and *don't* bid to that level.|pg||

nt|mariner1: hard to bang down A@D then|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H ? 6 @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: slam time|pg||
nt|athene: 3minor is getting killed|pg||
nt|leao: aloi still not on the board|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room it was much harder for Chagas as west opened 2NT showing minors|pg||
nt|athene: 24 hcp and 4-4 hearts...borderline whether you bid game on these, NV|pg||
nt|athene: personally i would just bid game with south, with two tens|pg||
nt|athene: facing 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe that's a bit pushy|pg||
nt|leao: key card is @c Q|pg||
nt|athene: east is pretty much endplayed on lead|pg||
nt|leao: if declarer finds her, he has a good chnce for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|leao: 4@h is the limit for EW|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: yes - strange the return @S without a bad distribution of @H|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely try a minor which finds that queen for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: right|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible that Thomson actually showed an even number of spades, in order to get Brightling to do what he did|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wd if bid|pg||
nt|leao: theyll bid it, it seems|pg||
nt|athene: well it's a chance for Aloi to get on the scoreboard :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: S has an interesting choice to make here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: chooses DBL without 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@h must be a double negative.  This demonstrates one of the problems with this approach.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: danger 9if NS can lead a @d against 5@S |pg||
nt|bedap: 30 imps needed in 16 boards ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: manageable|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: in fact, easy|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the only problem is making sure they are all yours!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose declarer might have read it, but it would be a bit silly to go down by running into a desperately unlucky 3-2 break|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 @H seems doomed again|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: now splinter then easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N lebensohl asking for 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bedap: perhaps Giura needed to double|pg||
nt|athene: come on! they don't give you a game bonus for 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: takes 2@S and a @D switch|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bridge_one: there are the possibility to make a mistake by E/W|pg||
nt|mmmakela: remote one|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I think)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no invitational|pg||
nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|leao: yes... conservative move from chagas|pg||
nt|athene: now you just have to make ten tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: she perhaps felt embarassed about the quality of her 2nd "suit"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, very remote |pg||
nt|mariner1: @S 3@H and wait for the @c|pg||
nt|leao: ace of @h @h on lead... no|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bedap: still, this will be fun to play|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: acttually, the communication problems on this hand are grievous|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: needs trumps to break|pg||
nt|santyclz: Which one is relaying?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: don't like 2 NT, why not supp dias|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|mariner1: well the trump lead gives some hope however still should be off|pg||
nt|mariner1: both|pg||
nt|mariner1: so good defense beats this|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: ok relays|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with lead @S was more easy to make a mistake in counterplay|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is an asking relay......... 2n shows extras|pg||
nt|mmmakela: were no alerts|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although in this case it doesn't matter.  Usually having the strong hand concealed is of some value.|pg||
nt|leao: should be 1 down|pg||
nt|leao: yes 2@h is 0-5 |pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|mariner1: only chance if give up a @c and hope K and @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: now it can make depending|pg||
nt|leao: but not an ace|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: the key was not setting up the @S pitch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|santyclz: 4@s ace asking?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugrapha2: and since they don't, nothing good can happen with the 3-3 @H|pg||
nt|bedap: when she didn't double, east may have assumed diamonds as her second|pg||
nt|bedap: 2S = 5-4 spades & minor|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I think , from the 5@D bid, that that is right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but then, East perhaps needed toshowvalues, to make the X easier|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice switch.......|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
nt|mmmakela: relay auctions: commentator's dream|pg||

nt|mariner1: Joe be sure to take Oz a bunch more pass cards next Christmas|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|bedap: didn't need this, needed +500 vs 5Cx|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: good defense|pg||
nt|athene: he can't really get much of a count as he doesn't know the spade position|pg||
nt|athene: he will find out that diamonds are 4-3 and trumps 3-2|pg||

nt|othered1: Yes and you could be right.  On the other hand, 3N is rather descriptive and east can stillmove on the right hand.|pg||

nt|mariner1: or maybe the 2n said it was a @S , not sure|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know there was much to go on, there|pg||
nt|leao: yes... he had every clue|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps a bit of restricted choice on opening lead|pg||
nt|athene: with Qxxx in BOTH minors, east had a choice|pg||
nt|leao: that was possible to have|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|bedap: wk NT like most pairs in this final|pg||
nt|leao: closed room is playing just 4@h, so Peirao should win 10 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bet NS will overbid here to game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugrapha2: the renascense of Acol!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S a nice spot|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bedap: i've always said BBO needed a spellchecker|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: check your dictionary|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: it's a legitimate alternative|pg||
nt|bedap: i get it andrew ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N would have issues though defense might help|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: N passing?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bets withdrawn|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N makes too,,,,,,|pg||
mb|3H|nt|leao: 1NT is FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 2 @H more probable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - better 2@H |pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: notice @S slam does not make as @H will not set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N should try 3@H I think and did|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: and @S are 3 1|pg||
nt|athene: west did well to make 11 tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|leao: since 1@s is equivalent to 1NT|pg||
nt|leao: they play tfers to the @C opening|pg||
nt|leao: 2@d was an inquiry|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: Maybe if we all applaud really loudly we can convince the lovely and talented Nicoleta Giura to join us and translate the auctions.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dbl helped to stay under|pg||
nt|mariner1: are they using 2@C as a hand quality ask?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: even picking up the clubs you have only 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mariner1: wait maybe it can............. make........|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|cQ|nt|athene: there are various squeeze possibilities though|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: told it shows 10 - 11 artificial|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|leao: 3nt was unbeatble, with a @h lead declarer can give up the @c ace and shalk up 9 tricks, while defense has only 4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: so NS use 2@C as 10 - 11 and 2@D as game forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it makes,,,,, this line......|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: a double squeeze perhaps|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: 2@C, unless it's very limited, is rather aggressive on west's hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: will take them to 4@S now!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: was 2@C GF or bal'd?|pg||

nt|othered1: I prefer 1@D also, since you can rebid it strong and naturally, unless our system says you can't have a 5+ honor trick hand with shape opening 1@D.|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 7-8 tricks available... |pg||
nt|viren169: no close to GF for me...|pg||

nt|bridge_one: E/W had a bad distribution of they honors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N was the best overbid,,,,,,,,,|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes though the @D @S positions which hurt a @H contract would have helped a|pg||
nt|mariner1: possible 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes well done|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so made 6 anyway,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|santyclz: A @s lead is the only lead that really has a chance to beat it, and it shouldn't.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: N/E do well here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @H had no chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@H = @S here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes 3N makes EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: dbl? or pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to guess|pg||
nt|athene: well the defence have five fairly obvious tricks against diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: (@SK, two hearts, club, @DK)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has a shot|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now pass|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: pass works too|pg||
nt|mayors: not keen on the pre-empt with A and K on side |pg||
nt|athene: they have to organise something else to beat it - trump promotion around clubs or something i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I'd open 1 spade as E|pg||
nt|mariner1: last hand 6@S was beaten if a trump lead...... not enough entries to set up @H then|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: VillasBoas obviously expects (or hopes for) a better hand for 2@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bedap: likely flat|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hard to make much headway here|pg||
nt|mayors: so would I|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 20 was a 14 imp swing and Thomson off to the races...........|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: it all depends what 1@C - 2@D means|pg||
nt|leao: tough hand, but 3NT wasn't making either|pg||
nt|leao: since the @d Q is off|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 3 @S= better spades, less on the side|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1@S for me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if that's weak, then west's actual sequence is contstructive|pg||
nt|athene: *constructive|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 2@D was game-forcing; West just forgot :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: K and A out are not good for 3@S open - (the suit of @S with 109876 is solid ...)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bedap: status of 2D unclear|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|leao: 5@c = 1 ace|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws   in case David here|pg||
nt|mariner1: has forgotten his laws :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brave 3 nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think it is impossible to beat this 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well the @H lead allows 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but with @C lead it is the same - easy to leave the communications between N/S|pg||
nt|sybarra: we headed to 4 @S?  or?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Bermuda Bowl is in Brazil this year|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 4 @S makes|pg||
nt|athene: but that south hand doesn't really want a major suit to be trumpsd|pg||
nt|leao: this makes as cards are|pg||
nt|leao: opportunity for aloi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Maybe 3nt after the overcall warned about breaks.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play even with the bad breaks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mmmakela: 4 @S could be right on several layouts after this bidding|pg||
nt|mayors: yes can be made on any lead|pg||
nt|mayors: 3nt that is|pg||
nt|athene: there are only 2 obvious losers|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugrapha2: i think I'd hit that if I need 30 imps|pg||
nt|bedap: must have some chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@H on, Q@D on|pg||
nt|athene: (black aces)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: 4@H makes so 4@S good save|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think declarer can get rid of all those club losers|pg||
nt|athene: you can put a lot of pressure on east though|pg||
nt|leao: wud have to risk @h finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if you run this to dummy, lead a club to the @CK, then return to @HA and lead another club|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, even if east rises, he can give west a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: @D643 are good enough over the @D2|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well if supp dbls in use 3 nt has more merit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|leao: :))|pg||
nt|athene: actually when an honour appears from west on the first club, east can safely duck the second club|pg||
pc|d4|nt|santyclz: With the @ds sitting so prettily even the @s break isn't enough to set it.  The big question is whether you can work out beer.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: only if you need the beer |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: sneaky @S play|pg||
nt|mariner1: the PABF is in Macau this year|pg||
nt|athene: either partner is ruffing or he has the other honour|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bedap: not a club ....|pg||

nt|camacho: yes very interesting hands|pg||
nt|viren169: 9s and Ts working overtime here...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|othered1: 22 hcp, no great suits, unlikely game|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|viren169: probably fizzle out in 2@S or 2N|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: if that's at all invitational, it's not surprising south saw the 14 count as a maximum|pg||
nt|viren169: If 2@C was inv checkback South should go... as he has|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|othered1: but do you rate north's hand as invitational wihtout known fit?|pg||
nt|robinswr: north is a signoff|pg||
nt|viren169: By the time time the dust settles he will be quids in!|pg||
nt|othered1: I see it as a signoff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||

pc|c3|nt|camacho: @cJ!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|viren169: what's the difference going via 2@C and 2@H directly?|pg||
nt|robinswr: queen of hearts was not a piercing lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|viren169: the debates on checkback (and its varients) and NMF goes on...|pg||
nt|viren169: pros and cons for both sides!|pg||
nt|robinswr: something to be said for opening the south hand 1nt|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2 4-card suit with lots of spots make it worth 15|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: I think this hand has less to do with the merits of checkback structures, if any,  than with hand evaluation and north, rightly as things and the defense worked out, evaluated his ...|pg||
nt|othered1: hand aggressively.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: Then it is more difficult for N but will probably go via stayman and come to rest in 2@S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|camacho: won!|pg||

nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this auction will not be the same at this table|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suspect the 3N will be the same though|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets see |pg||
mb|2H|nt|bedap: here's a chance for HAVAS|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: that's ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N certainly was not the spot as in Open|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt in OR needed the dias guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is not automatic though|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N ban make NS if they bid it|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make|pg||
mb|2N|nt|viren169: Interesting discussion in the Open room on what 2@C now shows...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and what does S do now,   transfer to @D |pg||
nt|mariner1: S passed as he has a tweener.........|pg||
nt|sybarra: good for Gold |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a minimum with long clubs...it's a question of HOW minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and some more|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier just to blast into it |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: @d dont behave so nice |pg||
nt|mariner1: too weak to force and he wants N to describe his hand   they probably use DBL as|pg||
nt|mariner1: weak neg there|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like it showed a min here hence a pass by East|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|mariner1: well done.... careful play makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to play @H for 1 loser|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S has auto duck|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if south duck the K in @h can beat 4@H|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|bedap: not right to draw trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: saved and entry to dummy in @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: an entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead helps or hurts depending on what N does|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mariner1: the played it right|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|viren169: Yes how min?!?!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to lead @S to j|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: easy from here.......|pg||
nt|athene: does it say "i have almost a psyche, wish i hadn't opened"?|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bedap: just 200 now|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the @s suit, since @hs are 4-4.|pg||
nt|sybarra: lead @S up 2x|pg||
nt|leao: yes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|pc|c7|nt|bedap: drawing trumps killed Wests S8|pg||

nt|mariner1: (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||

nt|viren169: Some welcomed imps to Aloi here|pg||

nt|viren169: My guess is they have not had the checkback discussion...|pg||
nt|camacho: slam here|pg||
nt|viren169: tight match!|pg||
nt|othered1: This is the last hand of the first  half of the semi-finals.  Thank you to our operator for a fine presentation of a fast-paced set.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|camacho: 7|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks also to my co-commentators, Carlos Camacho, Brazil, Gad Chadha and William Frisby, England, and Steve Robinson, USA.  I am Ed Shapiro, USA.|pg||
nt|viren169: great hand to finish the session on...|pg||
nt|camacho: yes grand slam|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: And particular thanks to the Brazilian Bridge Federation and to Beto Barbosa for facilitating this vugraph webcast on BBO.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: And, finally, to the specs who have lots to say during this active session.|pg||
nt|robinswr: nobody in the closed room showed extras|pg||
nt|viren169: surely at least 6! Only 3N in the other room...|pg||
nt|camacho: N rebid 2@h|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C now...|pg||
nt|camacho: 2N better|pg||
nt|robinswr: i play 3nt shows strong notrump here|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@H rebid on the north hand in the other room is enough for me to assign the lion's share of a charge.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|camacho: they play a very complex system|pg||
nt|viren169: I like 2@S here|pg||
nt|robinswr: depends on whether 2hearts shows 6|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|camacho: almost 1000 sheets of paper|pg||
nt|viren169: N is going to the races!|pg||
nt|othered1: Complex or not, the result inthe closed room casts real aspersions on their methods.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i agree|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|viren169: 4N is quantitive now? or Ace ask?|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|camacho: asking for sure|pg||
nt|camacho: and 5N also|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess south's jump to 3N, even over the reverse, showed extra values.  If so, a good structure tohave.|pg||
nt|viren169: Not clear to me...|pg||
nt|viren169: good to have firm agreements in these seqs...|pg||
nt|robinswr: of course not everyone plays 2spades shows a reverse|pg||
nt|othered1: Was 4N keyless RKC?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|nt|camacho: 2 kings|pg||
nt|robinswr: a grand would be anti-percentage with game in the other room|pg||
nt|viren169: well done N!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|camacho: he don´t know it|pg||
nt|viren169: Good odds... here|pg||
nt|othered1: True, giving odds that needing the @H suit may not quite be good enough.  But it's really insulting to the opponents to allow that they won't find this one.|pg||
nt|robinswr: bad to go down with Jxxx of hearts in opponents hand when only game at other table but ns are not unlucky|pg||
nt|camacho: 14 IMPs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: 33 HCP, lots of tricks.  Just can't assume that players at this level are likely to miss slam.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|camacho: Mello should love this lead|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
mc|13|nt|robinswr: not sure why east led a heart since the opponents had a random auction|pg||
nt|viren169: thks all...|pg||
nt|viren169: great set of hands!|pg||
nt|othered1: That saved time.  A nice way to end the set of very excitiing hands.|pg||

nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|santyclz: This one is pretty reasonable, all it takes is a 3-2 @h break and no ruff on opening lead.  7nt just needs the break.|pg||
