mb|3S|nt|phil: wow!|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is better|pg||
nt|chick: choice of slam bid|pg||
nt|werge: A bad decision to bid slam - N/S have indicated bad breaks|pg||
nt|phil: note that South is going to be endplayed after winning the @cK, which will negate one of the guesses - assuming declarer takes the time to eliminate diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|mmmakela: good rule in the long run..|pg||

nt|marlowepi: zia for example|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: 7nt here for N-S if they want it enough....bringing in AK9 / J10xxxx isn't bad odds for a grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
mc|13|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suppose N was concerned about a rebid of 2H from S. but is 2D GF ion their methods? not normally in these countries, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think both N and S are guilty of underbidding here|pg||

nt|bobh1: he probably figured--"why didn't he strip the hand?" . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 6 @C seems to be lay-down. South is end-played after ruffing @D - and he must "give" away the @H-suit. Now it looks like a show-up squeeze against North - and that will tell, who ...|pg||
nt|werge: is in position of the cricial @S Queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL made so a big swing to Galim|pg||
nt|werge: crucial|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|phil: looks like 4@s which will depend on guessing the club Q (or maybe a misdefense)|pg||
nt|werge: You get an extra @C-trick, if South plays ruff and discard|pg||
nt|werge: As always: 3 NT is the contract...|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|phil: yes, 3N is excellent|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|bobh1: declarer followed the Zia Bols Bridge tip of many years ago--if they don't cover, they don't have it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 3 NT little stretchy, 2 NT enough imo|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely is down,,,,,, 3@H 1@D and 1@C to lose|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mcarroll: yes avoid the 6-4 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: only the commentators can reach it however, in real life, everyone plays 4@s :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And now it all depends on finding @CQ|pg||
nt|werge: This is tricky, two rounds of @S - and a @D, this will bring E/W in trouble|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: see the heart spots Rob|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|phil: I think East needs to rise with the K@d early|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I missed one... right,,,,,,,,, 2@H to lose|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True - give up the lead in @D and the opps have to help declarer|pg||
nt|werge: When East rises with the @D K, declarer will know - from the NOT-lead, where the @D Ace is -. and make the contract, West is endplyed|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: Sorry give a @H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|phil: lose heart, diamond to King, diamond to Jack - if declarer plays for split diamonds, he can claim|pg||
nt|phil: right, strong inference on the non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|werge: He KNOWS, that they split - from the (I repeat) NOT-lead of a high @D|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|phil: furthermore, would west pass with @hK / @d AKJ? |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mcarroll: academic now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4S|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|athene: 6nt or 6@C here i guess|pg||
