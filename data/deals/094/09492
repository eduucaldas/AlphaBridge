mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sharkirl: Hopefully we'll get the names of the players shortly|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 6 @H or @S makes|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Click on each seat in turn and insert surnames|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that either is really biddable|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkirl: as predicted|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: for those of us more geographically challenged, what is CBAI? :)|pg||
nt|sharkirl: Contract Bridge Association of Ireland|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkirl: another slam if they can bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this one might be biddable|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sharkirl: not biddable now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht has to find a way of emphasising diamonds - might not be possible|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharkirl: maybe shud have bid 2@D first and rebid @Ss|pg||
nt|mariner1: well she might pull a 3N to 4@D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There might still be a chance to bid it|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has lots of keys in support of @D though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, sometimes better to start with your long suit, but 1@H-2@D not always the best start|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: not to be|pg||
nt|sharkirl: as predicted |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you would prefer to be in 5@D really, as you are at the mercy of the diamond break if a club is led  |pg||
nt|mariner1: well 13 tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkirl: yep - play seems easy on first 3 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: are you there please operator?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|4S|nt|mariner1: NS can save I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: hard to save over 4@S though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not obvious to do so|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkirl: oh dear |pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good grief, what a hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C should be bid here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkirl: this one should be reached|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes this looks eminently biddable|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: not always easy to get across an eight-card suit, though|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H overcall should actually help|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|sharkirl: and expect jump rebid in @cs|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lover of 1@S with 4 here,,,,,,,, neg dbl my speed....... or just force with 2@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will be glad not to have to deal with 3@H by West  |pg||
nt|sharkirl: expect any system would promise 5 there|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I agree x best, if 2@D not forcing|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: now S is sort of fixed for an easy descriptive call|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - 4@D maybe better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Having bypassed 3NT, S should know slam excellent, and maybe even worth exploring a grand|pg||
nt|sharkirl: is that a mistake - surely she bid 4@D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S sure seems interesting to me|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkirl: must have taken the 4@C as gerber?   women's bridge|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree with Michael 4@D must have been the bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and I now have to dodge the bullets!!!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't believe 4@C was Gerber|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Who plays Gerber in this situation?|pg||

nt|mariner1: can EW make 4@S here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mariner1: N has no entry which helps the cause|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 9@H drops.....|pg||

pc|d4|nt|mariner1: the Open found 6@C on 4 so they are ahead in imps|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: They may get to 4@H now|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: some pairs play that after 1 of a major is doubled, responder uses transfers. So a simple raise (1@H-dbl-2@H) is weak, and a one-under transfer (1@H-dbl-2@D) is a good raise to 2@H|pg||
