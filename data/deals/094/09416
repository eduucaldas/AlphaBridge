nt|mariner1: still will get a good score I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good job by South, but a little help by E/W|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: did i mention that it has been a realy long day?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H good spot here NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Bas|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphznb: all players are in total darkness, everybody is tired|pg||
nt|lestergold: a double from south and they should reach 4h which can be held to 4 i think on a spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume this is butler scoring not mps?|pg||
nt|mariner1: everyone looking to use Littlewood's Law|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|neobas: Butler indeed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: IMPs across the field  pairs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H now ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|neobas: Tricky, S might also have doubled with 4@Ss and 3@Hs, I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: and hi Georgio!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: 4@H is correct with 6@C - give the chance to play one of 2 suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello MIKE :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: but 4d may be better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: J in @S best lead|pg||
nt|neobas: 4@D might show a 4-4-2-3 though?|pg||
nt|mariner1: can hold this to 4 with that lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with all high cards in @H/@C 4@H isn't a bad bid|pg||
nt|irwinbo: if partner bids 4h, fine if he bids 4 spades you go on to 5 clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: I am assuming he will hook @H though|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||

nt|bridge_one: AKJx for Qxx you could try to play :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 6@S makes here, can they find it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6s played bu north is better than 50%|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: as dim ace is right and clubs are three its 200%!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he always needs A@D in W|pg||
nt|lestergold: no clubs 3/3  enuf|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup|pg||
mb|1H|nt|neobas: Pitch a @D on the 4th @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c do not have to be 3 3 either....... but it helps|pg||
nt|neobas: Either @DA onside or @Cs 3/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: one or the other is needed|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a @D lead|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think it is 36% for the 3-3 clubs and one half of the remaining 64% or 68% in total|pg||
nt|lestergold: so its well above 50%|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also A in East singleton|pg||
nt|neobas: lol Rob|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: only if its led or you long neck it|pg||

nt|mariner1: @D lead by E gins 6@S unless W has 0 - 1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s means ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I was not suggesting it woul be led,,, I said IF :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the interesting question is will they get there for a big score?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no singleton, so can keep a void ?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mariner1: 2N is forcing @S raise.....|pg||
nt|irwinbo: is this "serious"3nt?|pg||
nt|neobas: 3NT must be artificial, surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i hops no serious 3Nt ...|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mariner1: 3N has to be further enquiry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|neobas: 4@H by S will slow N down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving the informations about the weakness of hands ...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@s now isn't correct with the control in @D|pg||
