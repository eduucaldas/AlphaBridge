nt|chick: over here it's called "cansino count"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: our Cansino?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and just some hand you know you have to bid the nt first,  others you want to pard to do it |pg||
nt|kareno: Still a fine result for n/s|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chick: I believe he's English, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2suiter?|pg||
nt|hedyg: alert?|pg||
nt|bgn: yes - probably 5@S 4+ minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like a muid/tartan |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Niek :)|pg||
nt|chick: true, if you can figure that out before the first bid, I'm impressed :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not saying I always do |pg||
nt|chick: sad 4@S-1 here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 1c 4h p p x p 4s maybe|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It takes some effort to make 13 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|wojela: po 4 sesjakch prowdzi para|pg||
mb|3C|nt|wojela: Andrzej Jeleniewski http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/?mycl=1&p=21&r=02013|pg||
mb|p|nt|bgn: par spot I think, EW ake 8 tricks in @S, NS 8 in @D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: except they dont get to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: invite sequence |pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this puppet stayman?|pg||
nt|timb: I'm pleased that they will go to Sao Paolo|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3N, played at the other table, has a risk of going down when 6@S makes.  But the 2@C response, assuming it's natural, may minimize the likelihood of @C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peggy Bayer: ENG 175 (maximum!) - SCOT 143 - WAL 102 - NI 49 - IRE 44|pg||
nt|bgn: but now W preempted NS out of going down in 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|sybarra2: it is sad but likely a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|wojela: i Jaroslaw Wachnowski http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/?mycl=1&p=21&r=02166|pg||
nt|timb: (EW that is)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I hate the 3N bid, wonder if 2N would have been nonforcing or would have shown many extras, part of a hateful fast arrival approach to this auction?|pg||
nt|wojela: http://pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/02pila/gp.html wyniki na bie¿¹co|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bgn: Usually not so valuable to push when you have defence to other major|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure why she did that since N was a passed hand|pg||
nt|chick: apparently not|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some type of stayman starting with a p.  Puppet of psychic.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: will probably lose 2 spades, hope they dont lose 2 clubs also|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugrapha4: system card says "other: 5 card enquiry"|pg||
nt|chick: E can see 6 tricks... where to find the other 3?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bgn: North is a demon reopener, so from West's viewpoint quite possible for N to double if West passes 2@S, and South to compete (not on this hand though)|pg||

pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Thanks Niek.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: east puts her hand down to tank|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not a nice choice - prevent declarer losing 2 clubs, give her diamond finesse..|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that double was unlikely to be duplicated.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: not at all obvious for a passed hand to ask pd to bid on the 3 level|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: or r/d|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bgn: Quite true. She would only do it if short in @S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: I don't imagine 2NT would have been forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes in case pd's pass was a trap pass|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: so that South could not really do other than bid 3NT - North did not have to pass it, of course, but one can see why he might|pg||
nt|othered1: Then maybe 2N forcing over 1@S?  Seems a better description than starting off with a semi-psych.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Just has to pitch a @c from dmy on the 1st round of @ss and hold the ace for the 3rd round.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c6|pc|h6|nt|dburn: 2NT might show a spade raise directly over 1@s|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|chick: that might be J2N|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: that's a good move ... the contract is hopeless, so go for ONLY -1|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|nt|chick: good plan, Joe :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c7|nt|santyclz: No pnlty on a revoke from dummy.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|santyclz: I guess the theory is if they let you do it, they deserve the result.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|chick: now if the dummy was really thinking fast, she could have mixed a small club in the the spades and laid them on the table that way :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: oh well didnt guess the d's|pg||

nt|othered1: OK, then NS *can* choose to tie themselves in knots with  their NT bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is a good example hand. What you do not double a weak NT with. Too weak, no attractive lead|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: po tej sesji bedzie przerwa obiadowa|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will not ask why..|pg||
nt|bgn: South splintered in @S there too so I guess East took North's NT bid too seriously|pg||
nt|chick: just kidding, of course  ....  don't send me no-no's kibs :)|pg||
nt|chick: this 4@S is a little kinder|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: might be so|pg||
nt|chick: S has a problem, 16 HCP, no suit, can't double without hearts ... maybe 1N on an aggressive day|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: only 2s? maybe her partner is in the habit of making 4 card overcalls|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|chick: I'd bid 1@H with W hand as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mind you, the defence was not world class, but still|pg||
nt|othered1: Was west's opening a weak NT at the other table or an upgrade to strong?  That's quite a hand with a good 5-card major to open as a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was a weak NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear they made 4@S on the hand I said normal human beings wouldnt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i suppose they were given it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugrapha4: i guess after 1d 2d the auction is probably going to stop |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: para jassem49,25%|pg||
nt|bgn: wow - I'm surprised West is allowed to pass out 1NT after a redouble!|pg||
nt|chick: nope, took an immediate heart finesse the right way|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: is 3 @D a spade bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: no idea, but S should definitely be showing a preference for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe she should have bid 1@s and not XX, has no bid now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no  defenders led @H for them|pg||
nt|chick: oops, you are right :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, n made a very good shift at trick 3 in this room.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: why they didnt compete wth their at least 9 cd fit i dont know|pg||
mb|p|nt|linda28: 4@S is a good spot|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|chick: maybe it was a  'you be declarer',  'no, you do it'  :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: did W  need to bid 3 @D|pg||
nt|santyclz: Happy to see e didn't commit a weak nt on this hand.|pg||
nt|linda28: all over now for Havas - lead has completely blown out with another swing on bd 32|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has become an obsessions for some. When opps open a weak NT, *you* feel you are being robbed because you have a 13 count|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you plssssssssssss play @H now pd?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: for maximum tricks, she needs to ruff 4 minor suit cards before drawing trump|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: I'll guess this will make on the nose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you double for penalties, you must be stronger than this if balanced|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|timb: I admit I would have bid 2@S on the North hand and the same over 1@S on the South hand |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|santyclz: If s exits in trump, n must duck.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: south is tanking|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: has pulled d3 to the side of her hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont mind a 1NT opener on this actually|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bgn: the @H certainly makes partner happier than anything else :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: maybe west felt really pessimistic but east knew for sure|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: on the other hand, of course, if both North and South have balanced 13 counts and no one doubles, they will indeed have been robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra: knows she is pickling pard with trump lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bgn: but still only 1 off I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tells partner  what you have and is preemptive at the same time vs vul opps|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Soputh can hardly have a 13 count for her initial pass|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: but south may have a bit of leeway to double lighter than in the direct position|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: They have not stolen anything from you, so keep a low profile|pg||
pc|h9|nt|santyclz: N figures (rightly) they have no tricks left out of trump so hopes to develope a 2nd trump trick by giving ruff sluffs.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|timb: and easy claim|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: but I tend to agree that the North hand qualifies for a slow pass rather than a penalty double|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: and @s|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, double by a  passed hand is likely to have a conventional meaning|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: It qualifies for a pass in tempo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: -2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The bridge isn't pretty now and hasn't been for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Po tej rundzie bedzie rodzinnie;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Normal, pushy 3N at the other table.  Should be equalled here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wonder what time the party ended last night|pg||
nt|bgn: 4@H by East looks reachable |pg||
nt|yo_yo: lucky 4@S here |pg||
nt|sybarra: making 4 @S e/w if East and guess the sp |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: only 1s|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder what percentage of players would pass the east hand at these colors?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes but probably wont guess them|pg||
nt|kareno: From within reach, this match has escalated to, as you say, a blowout.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bgn: but may stop lower?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 2@s and all pass?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d is a good pressure bid by Berman|pg||
nt|poohbear: Forces the opps to make a 5 lvl decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't know, but I would get in|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugrapha4: sorry lost auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: might get a @H away though |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: making 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: a 7 card suit should be repeatable|pg||
nt|bgn: all very reasonable, but unhappy result|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: The party tonight will go on a while too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-5, all high cards in your suits and NV v V|pg||
nt|othered1: So would I, especially if I had a 2-suited bid available|pg||
nt|bgn: West might evern have raised @H rather than rebid @S?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: and I|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is a @H lead |pg||
nt|santyclz: Depends on the defense.  If n shows up with ak a before the @ss are played, should get it right.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so might have to guess the @H's|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting on 32, Sue Lusk made an offside double.  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: guess the @S I mean|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fuller goes low. bidding a slam is possible as all she needs is AKxxx in @hs to make it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: That looks pretty conservative, vulnerable, but it may win imps here|pg||
nt|dburn: good view by North, that - I was thinking he might bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is makeable with all cards in view, but it's much more difficult at the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: not like her @s are that good|pg||
nt|hedyg: A10 surely worth xxx|pg||
nt|poohbear: Possibly as little as AJxxxx|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|poohbear: So Berman accomplishes her mission|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|othered1: especially with east remaining silent|pg||
nt|bgn: In other room on Bd 2, EW had an inelegant auction to 4@S on 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: I suspect it was 1N 2@D 2@H 4@H :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: no, 2nt open|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|bgn: South, Rena Kaplan, had no trouble finding a double with @SKQ108 and @HA :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: the contract got what it deserved|pg||
nt|santyclz: N must have a @c card since s didn't lead one.|pg||
nt|sybarra: play @S from the top |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: no need to raise to 2@s on xxx with a perfectly good 2@d rebid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: unblocking 9 might have been wiser|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: Niek is she thinking really?|pg||
nt|mwigor: for what its worth i like the 2@s raise|pg||
nt|bgn: Oh Hedy, now you've embarrassed me. I would have raised to 2@S, but think West should bid 2NT, not 4@S. Then we can still get to 3@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes|pg||
nt|mwigor: but dont like the jump to 4@s with a 4441 and on partners opened suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: down now |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|hedyg: why bid 2@s Bruce? 2@d is a natural bid|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|vugrapha4: a two suiter|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bgn: because I'm not strong enough to bid 2@S if partner bids 2@H over my 2@D bid. For me that shows extra|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: bad luck but it's normal to finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good lead by n.  Make declarer guess before she can get more information about the hand.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugrapha4: i missed a trick sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: oops was 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: so we will play 2@H?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: agree about the extras|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|d6|nt|bgn: but 2@H might be (probably is) preference on a singleton or doubleton|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|h9|pg||

pc|d3|nt|othered1: 6 imps any way to Ireland|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugrapha4: -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: standard 11 point opening.|pg||
nt|kareno: It is certainly cold.  7 even.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: we all get to bid a suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: JC standing before the last round: Eng 127 - NI 117 - Scot 108 - Ire 87 - Wal 97|pg||
nt|bgn: Hoffman Thompson may even play a 2@D rebid forcing ... Jenny is from Victoria and they do that sort of thing there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugrapha4: N getting some water|pg||
nt|sybarra: puppet auction coming up?|pg||
nt|poohbear: hand is good cause it has some 10s and a void and spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: it wasn't the club lead that did it, it was not playing the spades right|pg||
nt|poohbear: berman opts to pressure again|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh well then she must bid 2@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant transfer  etc  |pg||
nt|poohbear: This time though she moght be in danger of missing a game. A few well placed @c values and an ace might make 4@h|pg||
mb|3D|nt|poohbear: As it is she did well|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely @C lead but then what?|pg||
nt|bgn: (Sorry - we're talking about the auction in the other room ... I forgot!  They are BOTH Victorian, so I can almost guarantee 2@D would be forcing!)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|chick: now S will wish she'd bid hers, so pard would know what to lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: opps can make game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: in that case maybe she should have opened 2@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: This has the potential to be another medium swing to Ireland, as N. Ireland's chances to win the event are slipping away.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: again no skip with 4 of partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@c or 4@d over 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fuller is under pressure to bid when she is short in @h but dbl by her is not necessarily Take out|pg||
nt|poohbear: just shows a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that would be super max with me, Joe|pg||
nt|chick: with a total bust and 5 little spades, would you really want to be in 4@S opposite 20 balanced points?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That was a strange trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 10 9 K|pg||

nt|timb: A fine effort to reach 6@D|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|poohbear: Fuller had really no where to go|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: No, but with 3-4 points and a 9 card fit you do.|pg||

nt|poohbear: ahhhh|pg||

pc|s7|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: I try not to even discuss that |pg||
pc|h8|nt|kareno: Well, she will have a high cross ruff eventually so it's okay.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: declarer will have an easy time drawing trumps and running the club J|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't need the @d finesse now.  Of course that was the one that worked.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|othered1: They must be tired not to claim 2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: having a quick break|pg||
nt|bgn: In the other semi, this hand featured another redouble auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love an organiser who posts all CCs for us :)|pg||
nt|bgn: 1@C DBL RDBL 1@D; pass 2@D DBL pass; 2@H by North|pg||
nt|chick: easy 3N by EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: south is another 17 too good for one strong NT, in my eyes.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you XX or bid 1 @s?|pg||
nt|bgn: I'm guessing you'd rather defend 2@D than play 2@H, so perhaps there was a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: took the pass card out then changed her mind|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable I would just bid game with that south hand.  Some make, some don't.|pg||
nt|linda28: me too|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bgn: I'd probably bid 1@S - defending at the one level is too hard for me|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Natural auction to 3NT coming|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: E could have started with @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Larry Lande:  almost any 5-4 hand that N might hold would provide at least a play for a vul game (only need 38%) even with 0 hcp.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but pard is playing  1 @C XX,  so you can relax|pg||
nt|bgn: strange - normally west would bid 1@D over redbl|pg||
nt|bgn: this auction has turned out very comfortably for South - she has shown her values and stayed low|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Berman should show @d support after which her partner should show secondary spade support|pg||
nt|timb: exactly|pg||
nt|linda28: Havas have just clawed some imps back - NS in 4@H rather than 6@D on bd 20|pg||
nt|kareno: Puppet?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: wow|pg||
nt|linda28: yes i think so|pg||
nt|linda28: 1NT = 14-17|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: hmmmmmmmm commentators curse|pg||
nt|sybarra: well...  and now funny could well be a push |pg||
nt|sybarra: or funnier|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bgn: North expecting @C suit to run - nasty surprise coming there|pg||
nt|sybarra: its only a 14 count on top of that!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not heard of LL|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: having denied 3|pg||
nt|poohbear: But Berman just bids 3NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Personally I prefer 3@d. Partner is basically unlimited|pg||
nt|timb: "Lavings", asks for a 5-card major (different followups over 2@D response denying a 5-card major)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: this will help out declarer|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bgn: South can make 4 @C tricks by finessing @C8, but won't|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is LL2.  LL1 is of course Lorenzo somebody or other.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: should just win this and bang out @ds. Eventually a 9th trick will come in a red suit|pg||

nt|kareno: That certainly can be another swing to Havas.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator Niek,  |pg||
nt|poohbear: weak NT. should land them in 2@h but Havas might balance. ( I would) 2NT for the minors|pg||
nt|timb: Still, the boards are few and the imps to find are many :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugrapha4: but there's till bd 24 to score up|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: still|pg||
nt|timb: A classic weak 2|pg||
nt|timb: ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: she almost passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@C was a little ambitious|pg||
nt|chick: tough bid for S, if pard has clubs is a big hand, if not he has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course to my co commentators  Hedy (who went to bed) and Bruce is is almost ready for 2nd cup of coffee|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: may end up in 3NT here, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: I am blasting into 3 nt with 4333 |pg||
nt|poohbear: Berman might bid direct to show the majors but with a weak NT preferable to have more values when bidding direct|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: at least one should have better suits|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 3C not alerted|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: well it has been by North now|pg||
nt|linda28: they are prob playing Lebensohl so 3C shows values|pg||
nt|kareno: I wondered if it is Lebensohl.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: I dont need to give the opps any info|pg||
nt|chick: especially with an honor in every suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I hate letting them play at the 2 lvl like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: kantar advises not to stayman on 4333  but maybe puppet different|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and that won't play terribly well either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you get to 5@C with accuracy?|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision by West not to raise the pre-empt with 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David must have the recipe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that even 5@C won't make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Bidding systems of the pairs are at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2009/Systems_Womens.html|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: an maybe it was puppet but still |pg||
nt|santyclz: I handle that dilemma by refusing to play puppet.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: So how do you stay out of game?|pg||
nt|dburn: not at all obvious to get to 5@c - I confess, I would have bid the same way as North-South here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i dont really understand it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play puppet over 2 nt,  but not 1 nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: there are good reasons over 2 nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but have never been convinced over 1 nt|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: on their system card under stayman says, "other: 5 card enquiry"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: several of our young stars refuse to play puppet|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: thx also to the ABF and to Nick Fahrer for bringing this terrific tourney to BBO |pg||
nt|chick: after all, she has the A of her pard's second suit|pg||
nt|kareno: She can duck once to assure if west had a five-card suit it will be locked out.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open in 6@H here,,,, did not score in movie|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: I play 2nt can't contain a 5+card suit.  With the point count and a suit I open 2@d multi.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: She will have to brave the diamond suit.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: she just asked abou their weak 2 style|pg||
nt|kareno: No, she actually has nine without diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: No I'm wrong - she needs a diamond.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|poohbear: Declarer has 3 off suit tricks . If she can take 5 trumps in hand that would be 8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: What happened here??|pg||
nt|kareno: Let's find out right now, she says, and her ten of hearts is protected.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: in 3NT next door so no swing on this one|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs for all the the great comments |pg||
nt|yo_yo: interesting that the Aussies play womens teams at the same time as the open teams|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 not in category of "heavy lifting"|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it?|pg||
nt|chick: a little wimpy I think|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: They blocked the spades?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which means the women cant enter both|pg||
nt|sybarra: well my 1 nts and 3 nts can contain 5 cd majors but I am NEVER  5422 |pg||
nt|santyclz: That was made illegal in the acbl circa 1980.|pg||
nt|chick: and Ax in a side suit is often better than Axx|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: nothing very much|pg||
nt|sybarra: read again NEVER|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what do you mean illegal?|pg||
nt|santyclz: There was a lawsuit.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the womens trials arent held at the same time as open only the finals are the same time|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: Not unblocking is silly at best, even if east retains an entry here|pg||
nt|poohbear: So I would be looking to try and score baby trumps with ruffs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: they did indeed block the spades, but they can survive that with East having @dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer could have knocked out @DA and make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No they can't|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: South had to knock out East's entry, not West's|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: Safe overtrick.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: sure they can - East wins the third round of diamonds, on which West pitches @sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have wanted to duck first sp all around?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: It was ruled descrimination.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|s7|nt|petergill: well, if your style is to avoid overcalling 2@C on that West hand (Dbl or Pass are OK, 2@C is absurd), then we might see you in the Playoff. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer does not play a 3rd round of diamonds!|pg||
nt|othered1: but south probably thought east had @SKQJ, so took the play available (stiff @CK)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then what?|pg||

nt|chick: don't include me in your 'we women'|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think that's enough politics.|pg||
nt|chick: I'm a woman and I resent women's events|pg||
nt|chick: and I never play in them|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just found the format fun |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's fine    nobody will argue|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: australia is lucky enough to even have teams in top events, if there were no women events we would never get to play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back to the match.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer should duck the first @c just to set up communications|pg||
nt|timb: exactly|pg||
nt|kareno: This is not the hand Havas wants right now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I dont see 37 imps in the next two boards so well done to Margaret Bourke and her team|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Declarer takes two rounds of diamonds because East must duck; then he knocks out @CK. How do you defend from there, David?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh,  was putting you on Aussie time |pg||
nt|poohbear: Partial battle here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: exactement|pg||

mb|p|nt|bgn: yes - coming up to midday in Sydney :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so ok 3rd cup |pg||
nt|poohbear: or not?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I clearly open East|pg||
nt|poohbear: decent majors and a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: if they have spades hard for them to get them in missing akj too|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: That's nice double dummy, but why should south have played that way?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks flat, however we play play 4 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I knew it was your daytime ...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: i havent seen many women in the top USA teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: if we are loyal to puppet|pg||
nt|poohbear: True|pg||
nt|poohbear: hard to lead direct|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I did not say he should|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, very well done.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: But David claimed he would have beaten it|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess they play strong NT in 4th unless this was a planned auction|pg||
nt|timb: Redboule anyone?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'll be leaving now - good night from Las Vegas.|pg||
mb|p|nt|linda28: Bourke team off to Sao Paulo, Havas get consolation prize of playing in Macau|pg||
nt|linda28: thanks Karen|pg||
nt|kareno: A pleasure.  Not a bad consolation prize :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: it aint Rio|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: as things worked out, the non-unblock of the @S K was merely a Grosvenor (until west didn't return @D)|pg||
nt|chick: That's not the fault of gender, it's the fault of them not learning to play well enough to win|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H =I have 4 @S|pg||
nt|poohbear: West should compete here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I would have beaten it, if you had done what you said you would do and knocked out the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|bgn: 2@S no doubt shows @C, 2NT shows likes @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E just wanted out of Dodge  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: for anyone in the audience who doesn't know puppet .. 3@D shows at least one 4 card major, no 5.  3@H shows 4 spades but not 4 hearts.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugrapha4: no 9 cd fit tho|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bgn: 3NT actually has some play|pg||
nt|chick: the "opposite major" bid keeps the strong hand as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: works well over 2 nt, if you open 2 nt's wthat include a possible 5 card major |pg||
nt|sybarra: and right sides the 4 card major |pg||
nt|poohbear: life is tuff sometimes:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: East had to bid with 10 points in partner's suits|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

nt|vugraphzmx: minus board 1 coz closed room not playing board 1 yet|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tullo: almost so|pg||

nt|sybarra: hey Santy |pg||
nt|sybarra: @h|pg||
nt|linda28: I think Havas has a fair idea now that was a golden opportunity|pg||
nt|kareno: Definitely so.  Are they playing four-handed?  Sometimes fatigue is a big factor |pg||
nt|timb: 6@S seems to need trumps 2-2 or trumps 3-1 and East holding @DA (and no @H ruff) - about 63% (thanks to North's @HJ)|pg||
nt|linda28: no 6 handed|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: or 1 nt  then what?  not sure what n/s play|pg||
nt|linda28: but NS have played all sets today|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes maybe 1NT by W|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: better|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|hedyg: now 4th from longest and strongest|pg||

nt|timb: Liz Havas is THE player on her team|pg||

nt|sybarra: N listening to you Hedy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: the N hand is excellent when partner has a suit ... any suit, but not great for NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: maybe she counted the kingleton twice|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: such a smooz you are |pg||

mb|p|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: is @C shift best?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: For declarer, yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: That two of hearts after raising could seduce west into continuing the suit.  I would lead the top heart.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: although why would she play low without the j|pg||
nt|linda28: bourke have just moved further ahead - they found the making 4h on bd 27 |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play for sure|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|c5|nt|hedyg: N should played 10@s here for @H return|pg||

nt|hedyg: was it really?|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: not morning yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: E coming in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 15 min|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: N is too weak to pass|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: probably n/s will compete to 3c over 2h and make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like e/w can make 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: hi|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: transfer to @D no doubt |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|chick: N should stay silent and hope they find 3N|pg||
nt|chick: good 3N ... can they manage to stay out of slam?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: or maybe they will be in 3h -1 when n/s can make 4c .. hard to compete to the 4 level vul|pg||
nt|timb: It does indeed - the NS cards are quite friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And if n/s get too optimistic in spades, west has an answer :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: nah weak NT    wont strech |pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: On another day 4@s might make.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i always skip if I have 4 card support, dont you?|pg||
nt|chick: only with a max|pg||
nt|yo_yo: max and 4?|pg||
nt|chick: yes|pg||
nt|chick: might be possible to make 6@D|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the stiff K of @S in N will make it difficult |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: i wonder what the 3h bid was supposed to achieve|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i like that 2NT if it's 2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: that double looked like penalty to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: W really didnt want her pard to bid |pg||
nt|santyclz: Guessing 2nt is 2 places to play.  Not what n has in mind.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: did N really bid 2 @D,  is that conventional?|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: Many years ago Ron Cook held @DAKQ10 and he doubled 6@D in a constructive auction; that was the final contract and he made all of his trumps as he was over @DJ when his opponents ...|pg||
nt|timb: had a 4-4 fit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugrapha4: probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not so sure it is the hand for that is it?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: if you trust your partner to have 4 hearts for that X, then I'd definitely bid 3@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: N almost has 4.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now they reach their lovely... 4/4 @H fit|pg||
nt|chick: E may not be finished yet, either|pg||
nt|chick: interesting that the 7 card diamond fit is better than the 8 card club fit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe only game force they had|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugrapha4: a bit late for 3s|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|timb: The double was for the lead agains 6@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: this might get X's|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you wanted to play in @H why didnt you bid them over 2NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *X'd |pg||
nt|chick: but E is the one who should have bid it|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: e doesnt know theres a 9 cd fit|pg||
nt|chick: good point|pg||
nt|sybarra2: grab the 10 tricks and get out of dodge|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Too funny.|pg||
nt|kareno: North doubled why?  Didn't like the sound of the auction?  State of the match?|pg||
nt|linda28: sounds like state of the match|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it will be moving more in the same direction after this hand, I predict.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we dont agree on this one cornelia, I like to skip with the West hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Double-dmy can make 4 I think.|pg||
nt|chick: sometimes I forget they can't see as much as we can :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|timb: Probably the latter. Diana Smart should have a few nervous moments befor scoring +590|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|chick: 6@D can be made by ruffing a spade, drawing trump and taking the heart finesse to dump a club|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: a good time to play @H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Find the @h q for a @d pitch.|pg||

nt|sybarra2: a lot of bds to play  |pg||
nt|chick: would you open 2N with the W hand, Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: no|pg||
nt|timb: I prefer 4@H or 2@S (cue raise) to 3@H|pg||
nt|kareno: This is IMPs - I would just bid 4@h with the east hand.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|bgn: ns headed too high now, unless defence slips|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|timb: One of Australia's all time great players (Ian McCance) points out that EW play Acol circa 1960 :)|pg||
nt|linda28: I think EW may be playing only 4 card majors so raising to 4@H not so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well this will be interesting....|pg||
nt|hedyg: that happens frequently when you open hands like this|pg||
nt|bgn: If you were West, would you double 3@S for lead against 3NT?|pg||
nt|chick: playing puppet, I would.    without puppet, I'd open 1@H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you probably have to break my arm to open 1 or 2 nt on 5422 pattern unless my 2-2 are ak, aq|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no  |pg||
nt|hedyg: with what? i want a @H lead!|pg||
nt|bgn: Indeed. Some people play double of splinter asking for higher outside suit :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|sybarra2: and that particular west hand I am not afraid to reverse|pg||
nt|timb: If West has only four hearts, she has a strong notrump so 4@H is OK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: no need to reverse, if you open 1@H and partner doesn't bid 1@S, no reason to show them|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: some play it for the suit below indeed|pg||
nt|bgn: Anyway Julia Hoffman had no trouble finding the lead ... but will need to find @H switch later|pg||
nt|hedyg: she wont switch to @D :)|pg||
nt|bgn: but might play partner for @SJ|pg||

pc|sA|nt|chick: if you open 1@H, the auction here is fine with me|pg||
nt|sybarra2: that is also true Cornelia|pg||
nt|sybarra2: agree|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: cash A@H now|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: so declarer saving a trick here|pg||

pc|d5|pc|sJ|pg||
