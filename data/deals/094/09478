nt|thegarve: you can wait all day for the perfect take-out double, i rarely wait|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|camacho: 3@s for NS here|pg||
nt|othered1: North bids a sane 1@S, even though a 16-18 1N was available|pg||
nt|camacho: not talking perfect double, but double with void|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|camacho: Branco´s double very thin|pg||
nt|othered1: XX by north?|pg||
nt|othered1: Relatively balanced hand, lots of high cards, why not redouble and bring south back into the picture?|pg||
nt|othered1: Tis could go down in 4@H if declarer bases a trump play on east being short|pg||
nt|othered1: Mello will just take the penalty, I'd guess|pg||
nt|camacho: 3@d?|pg||
nt|henryb: not at all obvious what to do with E hand after N bids 2@d or 3@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not good signalling methods, udca low club discard would assure the set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|camacho: I think limit to NS is 9 tricks|pg||
nt|camacho: I prefer 3@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|othered1: takeout double makes it relatively easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|santyclz: I don't know, he has an awfully nice hand if pd is short in @ss.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|camacho: only @c breaks|pg||
nt|henryb: and not obvious how to make this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok spectators think all methods work, but some are more reliable than others :)|pg||
nt|camacho: Brenner is hidding spade support|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would too|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: No. Now is going minus, maybe a couple|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: might be slightly light on high cards, but 1N overcalls are often sounder than 1N openings.  Passing 3@S is an on-the-spot decision, as I doubt west has a stronger bid available|pg||
mb|p|nt|camacho: not easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder why not 9 or 10 from dummy?|pg||
nt|camacho: seems can´t make 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3nt is beatable also|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: good lead, on auctions like this, where the preemptor's tricks often are ruffs|pg||
nt|caitlin: on this lead down one|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|camacho: have to lose 3 spades tricks to go down|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|othered1: Really, there's no way for south to judge fit outside of @H, so north had to make the decision|pg||
nt|thegarve: I have been aksed what time (from now) the last set starts - does anyone know?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead how do you make 3nt|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|caitlin: I would think that if Brum was stronger he would not simply bid 4@H|pg||
nt|dburn: have East-West actually played together before?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|camacho: can´t make it|pg||
nt|henryb: on the other hand, E knew that relatively bad breaks are to be expected when the opponents bid to the three level on a maxumum of 13 HCP|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb: 17 HCP|pg||
nt|camacho: small @c better now (seeing 4 hands)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|camacho: all is how guess spade suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: I mean, what was 2@h supposed to be?|pg||
