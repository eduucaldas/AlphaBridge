mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|plateos: Welcome, this has been a bit of a monologue this far, and not a happy one :(|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: South's @S too tempting to allow 2@H to buy the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Martin de Knijff|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi:)|pg||
nt|pale hose: Hi all|pg||
nt|plateos: I think S is systematically supposed to show the strong version but his hand does not look like a very stong @c any more.|pg||
nt|sharynr: how weak is 1@D response supposed to be?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|pale hose: 1D is 0-7|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharynr: well then  he can't be blamed for flying into game then, I guess|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharynr: and the defense will have to be careful, i believe|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|plateos: Yes they were systematically in a bad place. Unfortunately from the Finnish point of view beating this needs concentration (decl cannot get out of dummy)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps 2 rounds of @S to see it 10 drops...before playing a @C|pg||
nt|plateos: @h now gives declarer (atleast DD) chance by unblocking the 1H and then @d|pg||
nt|sharynr: Of course, easy to see that 2@C cashed followed by a @S exit will lock declarer in dummy|pg||
nt|sharynr: but much harder for West|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: the 'transfer route' one way to go about those north shapes ...|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: 8 or 9 tricks with the spades 3-3 |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: possible but might not be easy -- it's a complex hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes defenders should play trump immediately after taking @C trick|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: many play it with 5-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: probably 9, if E reads W's @D return as a singleton|pg||

nt|pelu: 6@S bid in OR|pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: So this will be abig tense fight|pg||

nt|star6ija: 3@s are possible for EW|pg||

mb|1D|nt|raghavan: WC Malik may be but depends on a dinesse od DQ and droping CQ -|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ampelman: 10 tricks ?|pg||

nt|viren169: not the best lead... but N will find the heart switch when in with the @D|pg||
nt|viren169: Budkin should signal a dislike for @cs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: must confess having some difficulty in trying to understand the auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: good lead -- an unbid suit on this kind of auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least they are playing in the best of their multitude of 4/3 fits|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the double helps South as it would be far more awkward if forced to bid as North|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Redouble is strange - normally first round control say Axx|pg||
nt|haans: i say this is a make fast dia finesse|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|raghavan: Will S play H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|thegarve:  Pass seems normal - nothing to say|pg||
nt|paulg: are we slamming yet or just looking for the best game? Perhaps just trying to show @sHx|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: but now he cant ruff the 4. @H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|star6ija: flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: oh sorry -- @Ds were bid by E -- missed that|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am going for coffee|pg||
nt|thegarve:  pass and allow South to XX if wanting a semi-stop or bid 4m |pg||
nt|paulg: 6@h looks the best slam, at least you have some options in the play|pg||
nt|thegarve:  seems the Norwegains play  reverse - pass = 1/2 or full stop and xx = two/theree small. Unusual but highly playable if all play this way|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|j li: all roads lead to 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|ampelman: due to the very friendly distribution all roads lead to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: the moment of truth!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: this contract looks like one off with a clubs 2 spades and 2hearts tolose|pg||
nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
pc|c3|nt|thegarve:  i mean Swedes|pg||
nt|paulg: Will Helness lead @c10?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|viren169: all over!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|thegarve:  its when half your team play one way and half the other that agreements become doubtful|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|raghavan: May be making Sunil|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 1 off from here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|dK|nt|raghavan: yes agreed|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h3|nt|viren169: not easy for Mayantz|pg||

nt|thegarve:  yes she'll love the sight of KT@C|pg||
nt|paulg: the problem with that line is that you could not pick up @dQxxx|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|viren169: tough hand for defence|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cT|nt|kiwi_joker: North fails (understandably?) Bidding suggested a bunch of diamonds coming for decl.... and North saw spade lead misfire .. I think finding a low heart was not impossible|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: it appears he could have made it double dummy by winning 1st @D with the Ace (Queen drops), then ruffing 4th @H with the K and finessing trumps |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|thegarve:  worth it |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sharynr: 3@H looks like the max for E-W but can they stop|pg||

nt|plateos: Koistine Nyberg semm to have taken a phantom sacrifice, but it is not easy to beat 4@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharynr: even guessing @D, still have to trump 2 of them|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|plateos: yes, but a @d lead, for example, is detrimental for defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|thegarve:  with no overcall 3-2 breaks become far more common than 4-1|pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: After 6 Boards the scores are level 13 each|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh 1NT by W!!!!|pg||

nt|viren169: yes you are right...|pg||
mb|d|nt|raghavan: You might have played against him in European championships|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's VERY double dummy :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but on the lead almost impossible to go on @DA|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: difficult for n/s to stay out of spade game hee|pg||
nt|haans: play by North|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wwalter: never been there|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: the 2 teams here both won their grupe|pg||

nt|viren169: may get N/S too high... |pg||
nt|viren169: 2N now should end the auction...|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: unfrtunately as cards lie it looks like one off|pg||
nt|pelu: now N shy correct to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya:  even in 4@H, there might be some problems |pg||
nt|j li: even on a heart lead the defense has to time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: maybe 2H now, then North 2NT? Yes, too hugh|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: high|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: a slip of the tongue might help|pg||
nt|ampelman: @d are blocked|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but it will of ocurse be a push|pg||
nt|haans: but a small winner|pg||
nt|viren169: South will push over 2N... |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: sure will ..hoping for 5 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N by South seems enough with that hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: the only good news as in the club suit|pg||
nt|pelu: a weak hand with 5 card major sh be played in major!|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: going towards slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not often that you can make 7 tricks in nt with 19 pts and no 5 card suit|pg||
nt|pelu: also if pd only has 2 card in the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: excellent point, Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: 5 IMPs herbst|pg||

nt|lestergold: reverse the red queens and 4s is cold|pg||
nt|ampelman: well, but unblocking will be no problem|pg||
nt|viren169: 4333 dont produce many tricks!|pg||

pc|c3|nt|raghavan: another 10 here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|pelu: I know that for 45 years playing :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|duccino: Board 1 was deleted and they played a brand new one. So results of board 11 are correct but the cards are not|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wshould ponder - If s had spade 10 he need not play SJ so E has it|pg||
nt|ampelman: if one of the low @H were @h10 there would be chance for a squeeze against east|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sunsamvar: but he does not know of the lucky @S position|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice sacrifice by EW - they would be disappointed, losing 5 IMPs from this board|pg||
nt|j li: Gladiator might fake a club finesse for the ninth trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: must go  down |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is an excellent sacrifice, limiting the loss|pg||
nt|duccino: Board 1 was deleted and they played a brand new one. So results of board 11 are correct but the cards are not|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H prob also down - but 1NT need @HK x - and some help|pg||
pc|dK|nt|thegarve:  best link for groups please|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|j li: Not really|pg||
pc|d3|nt|thegarve:  it can take a while for folks to trail the websites|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|raghavan: I would have played Heart to king and finesse - also before Club A is knocked out or else they will run thru in minors|pg||
pc|d8|nt|raghavan: W has SQ|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|viren169: West needs to be careful not to end play pd|pg||
nt|haans: time for @H now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: pain has been reduced .. i remain convinced the 8@H was best card at trick 2 ... clubs can come in their own good time. Now Arnolds has tossed 2 hearts away|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm is the best place to start|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: defence has slipped. @H9 sets up|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Raghavan.. that is the line i was thinking of|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now can endplay east unless she drops @Ck|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: here we have a standard 4@S - but in the Open room Peter Fredin in West found the killing lead : @C7!|pg||

nt|star6ija: or accepted the hand as semi-balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt E and W will have a few words to say to each other after the hand is over|pg||
nt|star6ija: normally it is 2 down and 13 IMPs to Herbst|pg||
nt|pelu: @SA and a small @H!|pg||
nt|j li: Engels trumps are good enough to overruff dummy twice|pg||
nt|haans: but AQxx is a little extra|pg||
nt|viren169: South in the other room did bid 4 over 3@S|pg||
