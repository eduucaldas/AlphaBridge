mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Kokish is S using 2@H that may be artificial to show extra count when next bid,,, it|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|barnets: west on lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: kickback would have helped here|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: off the rails now|pg||
nt|barnets: so he has two out of three chance to find it|pg||
nt|migry:  it usually is when u get to slam without 2 aces|pg||
nt|mariner1: Meckwell used big @c and so stopped in 4@H|pg||
nt|kareno: Wrong hand bid blackwood!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess Roy wanted to show a solid suit with 4@H, but Willenken also expected at least one more keycard|pg||
nt|barnets: I think zia might get the vibes they are off two aces|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm reminded that it was the late, great Sam Scaffidi of Mingo Junction, Ohio, who coauthored the Striped Tail Ape double with John Lowenthal.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H is the systemic rebid playing Kokish, but they may have a different agreement|pg||
nt|barnets: they already made a slam against him off 2 aces two matches ago|pg||
