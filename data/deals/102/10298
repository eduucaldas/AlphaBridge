nt|westjava: yes Gary|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  E/W play precision with a 15-17 1NT so the 1NT rebid after 1C will be 18-20|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since transfer response to 1@C -- i believe EW are Chen-Furuta|pg||
nt|westjava: and looks like standard system from Japan pair|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5C may make on the layout but I doubt they'll bid that high|pg||
mb|2S|nt|westjava: hard to bid:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: W wrote 1@C+1NT=18-20|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: now 10 via 4@S, 4@H, 2@D ruffs|pg||
nt|mariner1: don't see it has any chance really|pg||
nt|westjava: S has to cover@D and @C return|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi all |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes no cover and @c back was not best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes 2nd trick was the key|pg||
nt|westjava: first @D cover by K|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nigel_k:  Depends on methods but I would be content with an immediate 3H on the South hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|westjava: with @H 3-3,decl will go home now|pg||
nt|mariner1: now can ruff another @D, pull trumps and pitch a @c on @H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  More passive defence was required|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Make declarer choose what to do with her 9H entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|westjava: might be a swing board to Japan|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,much better|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: playing @H is unnecessary danger |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  From North's point of view he does have extra and his partner cue bid and then raised|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  KC not worth much though|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's a benefit of transfer responses|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes can be canape and 2C denies a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@S is normal contract for EW|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  4C splinter will not encourage East|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that treatment accept transfer = 2/3 support|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: that is better|pg||

nt|mariner1: careful play makes this|pg||

nt|mariner1: @c out beats 6@H and 6@S|pg||

mb|d|nt|othered1: very tough to accurately criticize auction, other than by result, without detailed system notes that just aren't available for most pair.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: odd?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: odds?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One this one South would prefer to defend a heart contract than play one|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sure|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|westjava: 4 should be asking bid|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: I think I would have bid 3@D over the DBL...... to jack the auction up a level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually people have some mechanism for showing majors over a strong club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|westjava: Japan add their imps from   27|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: now W can pass info to E cheaply|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@C & 4@S both = cue bids|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One of those rare occasions where N can even show QC if they keep going|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: if West bidding twice -- i prefer 3@C first   but i think should pass 3@D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Rob,no use redbl|pg||
nt|westjava: no loser in @C,@D and @S,then...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's that chance :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: the hand with short @D needs honors to pull trump -- so really dislike 3@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: best to play cross ruff here|pg||
nt|westjava: on @H and @D, yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to be sure to cash the A@C in time|pg||
nt|westjava: dont forget to remember|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ruff cash @CA and A@H and cross ruff the best I can see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't south get to ruff high on 4th @H?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|westjava: The new leader,Indonesia...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|westjava: no problem...what can decl do..?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the other hand -- defense against 3@D is easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure why the pitch here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange:)|pg||
nt|westjava: a different plan...|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i dont know either why pitching...what's the line of play??|pg||
nt|mariner1: he did not pitch a loser so|pg||
pc|sA|nt|westjava: 23 - 20 imps now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sad really|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: i like duck at trick 1 -- not clear what might happen, but seems crossruff only 8 tricks to worth a try|pg||

mb|2S|nt|roswolf: SLAM TRY NOT FAVORITE HERE|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a really wide range for leaping Michaels andnorth is trying for more.  South will bail out, I'd expect|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: any operatic singers to serve as the "fat lady"?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: my voice is broke these days|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: open room finished now just 2 to play here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=0-10  4+@H & 4+@S|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: Thx Nigel, Gary, Kelvin...my last 2 bds for operator here, tomorrow will back to work but will be back on 27-Jun for operating knock-out|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: some partnerships here open W hand 2@D both majors 5/5 minimum less than opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 3rd match of the day  Ladies  China vs New Zealand|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: dont know S pass after 2nt N other table...:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nigel_k:  N/S play weak NT so the 1NT rebid is strong|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: thx L a great job look forward to seeing you back|pg||
pc|hA|nt|westjava: 2nt minors|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: not sure why N in Open Room bid 2N in their auction, RED vs White|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room west 2@D open same as our 2@H|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The contract is ok on the N/S cards and may make|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  West preferred his weaker minor that opponents opened. Turns out to be right though.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the clash at the top sees  1 give  2 a fair old lesson I'd say|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: nice lead|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: 2NT was for minors probably and S passed|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes that may have been it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and here EW will wonder why they didn't bid 4@H :)   but only after taking 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence by West. South will be short of entries to hand to draw trumps and play diamonds|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|westjava: swing for Indonesia|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h8|nt|westjava: S should be 3@C after 2nt|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nigel_k:  It's going to be two down but still worth competing nonvul. It would pay off if opponents were pushed to 3S.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but why no X|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: @S ruff to save 2nd overtrick|pg||
