nt|skorchev: I didn't saw your comments before, but I think the correct line was to jump with @SA and to draw @CA then back to hand to play clubs, declarer's aim should be 4@C3@S2@D tricks|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|oliverc: Agreed. Having escaped an initial heart lead, better to safety-play the Clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a good hand for the Smolen convention. 2@C followed by 3@H, showing 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But N-S do it the natural way|pg||

nt|skorchev: :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|oliverc: true enough, Roland, but one disadvantage is that you don't give South the chance|pg||
nt|oliverc: to super-accept Spades. You could easily be missing 6 here|pg||
nt|oliverc: (with different cards in the South hand)|pg||
nt|james_h: NS are probably Irelands best Ireland best mixed pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is not correct, Oliver. Opener responds 2@S to the Stayman inquiry with 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so there you have the super-accept already|pg||
nt|skorchev: maybe cue-bid after 3@S will show super-accept, Oliver|pg||
nt|oliverc: no information on range or controls, though|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: It's only after  2@C  2@D  you use Smolen|pg||
nt|james_h: North Karel is an ex partner of mine (much to his relief) and Anna is origionally from Moscow|pg||
