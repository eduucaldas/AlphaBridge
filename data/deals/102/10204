pc|s8|nt|xenya: 5@D is only -1|pg||
nt|xenya: or 2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: hearts 3-3 so not much ruffing needed|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kastan88: first  2 boards  success for Finland, how about this board?|pg||
nt|sybarra: should raise now,  W has a big hand for @H's and she did|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hi Ellen|pg||
mb|1N|nt|capercliff: the 10 was unlucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin: west has to stop low|pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: here is a slam im sure they will get to|pg||
nt|gavin: lets see if ew have some sort of lebensohl agreement here|pg||
nt|gavin: some people play 2nt here says i have a bad hand, some play it scrambling|pg||
nt|caitlin: not uncommon over this double to have such an agreement|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C on NS, 3NT down|pg||
nt|gowdy: @S and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot compete against this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6NT by north the top spot, but 6@D also excellent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, drinks for all on me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict 4h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: assuming they have some kind of two way new minor available|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probs in this contract with the hands so well fitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to the last 16 boards of an exciting match|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what is 2@H, maybe a relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they opt for the Moysian @S fit it will be a problem|pg||
nt|caitlin: a support double?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: value showing|pg||
nt|lestergold: prob make 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Double or 4S bid will come|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|caitlin: shows the need for the 2NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if it is, doubling is likely to help opponents|pg||
nt|gavin: was wrong about the line up|pg||
nt|gavin: they did runt he same 4 again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even with lebensohl likely to try 4|pg||
nt|gavin: agree, west hand is so huge, hard to judge|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh What agood bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C good bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: great bidding|pg||
nt|raghavan: Martin did N hear you saying 5C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well yesterday he made good bids i did not say|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna can lead singleton spade but never gets partner in|pg||
nt|raghavan: North reasoningmay be S did not bid 3S over 3H so may be S 3 cards so clubs in S hand is assured|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: north can see at trick one that the only chance to beat this hand is his partner having the Jack of hearts since clubs are frozen if the Q and K are reversed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: wolperts main worry is xx in diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi folks!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hi Martin and Sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: and hello to our wonderful operator, Karen, aka macaw on BBO @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good analysis|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin: he will overtake the spade to play another spade|pg||
nt|gavin: hoping declarer leads a high heart from dummy|pg||
nt|gavin: giving him 1 extra chance to beat the hand |pg||
nt|gavin: if his partner has 9x of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho may be a prob for south with last club so mayube only 2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|capercliff: pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT i guess is pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will bid 6@d I would guess, holding 4 small @c's|pg||
nt|gavin: leading a 4th round and having his partner ruff high in hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Martin|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|sharynr: ty Roland|pg||

pc|h2|nt|caitlin: Last night we had Gavin Wolpert here commentating...was excellent...he is now a pro and the Wolpert family is well known in Toronto with their mother, Hazel, who came in second in ...|pg||
nt|caitlin: CWTC, owns a major bridge club here|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznx: lost the play :(|pg||
nt|gowdy: tell them to slow it down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not that exciting a hand  i think two spades made unless defence errs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gavin: i guess the word faster|pg||
nt|gavin: and jurek|pg||
nt|gavin: dont go together that well|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you here?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||

nt|glen: do you have methods that get to your 4-4 fit?|pg||
nt|gambit: out of the frying pan...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i will settle for a 4-3, even a chunky 4-2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|gavin: unless theres a "than" between them... faster than jurek, is a common expression|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 9Â½ - 11Â½|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit annoying for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still was in principle right to lead trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: and E's @D8 could have suddenly become a big card, had he exited witha small @D at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi peter|pg||
nt|haans: lsome|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Bekkouche must hope that the double is negative; it usually is|pg||
nt|haans: easy really|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: 2@HX will not be pretty|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so strong 1@c, 5 card majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: south makes a responsive double?|pg||
nt|pelu: a responsiv D sh show 4-3 in major|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not this time Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she can escape for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ralf Willquist and Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D would work|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: fairly normal part score competitive auction|pg||
nt|asig: Ready for the football match tonight, Ralf?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h not a lead directive:)|pg||
nt|haans: 1C full opening bid direct 1M 2m weak opening bid 1@D BIG CLIUB|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D or 3@S by N?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but a difficult hand|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C show only i have11-16 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW plays precision, 1@d can be void, 1NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another plus score for the Icelanders|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Seems overoptimistic after partner's sign-off|pg||
nt|kastan88: GE Christer, you are far South from us :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough boards to analyze, not sure the best defense here|pg||
nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: results so far: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is too optimistic by n/s imo|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -1 or -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: close, yes -- but not quite maybe -- i think EW can get 2 trumps, 2@Ds, 2@Cs and a @S|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 3NT ?|pg||
nt|xenya: they should do that quickly however|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|pelu: diff to bid - and stop - after 3@C by East|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  can u bid it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 4c has play in any case|pg||
nt|asig: This hand should be over in a second - 10 easy tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@d= 5+M+5+m, weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: a combined 22hcp and no long suit - i think it is clear that someone overbid|pg||
nt|pelu: @C to K and @HQ will give S an chance|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N thought S has Ms|pg||
nt|pelu: and a responsiv X sh show major|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but really this sort of bidding is not suitable for a high level tournament|pg||
nt|pelu: the 3@H bid from S is - as I see it - the problem - that is FG on 10 HCP|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@d goes down too, 3@s is not fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but south paased originally - therefore north knows the values for game are not present|pg||
nt|m_niemi: with strong hand N can bid 4@c|pg||
nt|pelu: so N sh pass to 3@H - no|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so 3@d isn't that strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed peter but he should play bridge rather than slaveishly follow system|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: but pard (W) said she had zilch with the rais |pg||
nt|haans: gustavsson won swedish championships three years running. claimed he was lucky|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cenglund:  Heart lead would have been different story|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -1 if def makes an error in trumps|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cenglund:  Not really, I am staying in Finland for the moment|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer is obliging -- back to 2 ruffs now|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he could have made it by playing a high @D|pg||
nt|pelu: just what I told him .)|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should really find it easy to take at least 5 tricks|pg||

nt|shals: Good evening this game is being played in beautiful Penticton B>C> I am joining Caitlin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy but "slow" 3nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: all 3 of these players, I believe are from Toronto, certainly Hanna Nader, Jim Green, Darren Wolpert|pg||
nt|caitlin: or Czyz may be Montreal, not sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: match tightened up a little in the last segment|pg||
nt|glen: hi bart, glad to hear you are joining the kast of katz|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: don't ask me|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: welcome Shirley Laidaw|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, ralph & I will be warming up shortly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: but i think if wolpert had heart ace, would have cued at some point, similarly with void|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to envisage 5NT as GSF|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS may play in 1NTor 2C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C has come|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades, double presumably hearts|pg||
nt|caitlin: at Open Table Carruthers, who has won many championships, is from Toronto, his partner Joey Silver from Montreal and L'Ecuyer and Fergani from Quebec|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: with the heart entries in easts hand , north can probably scramble together 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gavin: welcome shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you have come to a Canadian zoo:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/ cannot come in at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 2s may already be overboard|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2@S looks like an underbid  perfect on this hand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sharynr: should East return to 4@S now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: important here for the defence to give nothing away|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: good plan if they let you do it|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sharynr: i type too slow|pg||
nt|shals: really..I am going to play ther next week ..wonderful tournament|pg||

mb|r|nt|fabsayc: hi Glen|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: these X  allow the XX,  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if defence open up hearts for example Green may end up with a trick|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: i guess they dont play super KCB|pg||
nt|sybarra: only helps opps imo |pg||
mb|4N|nt|mcarroll: and we end with a flat board - probably|pg||
nt|capercliff: there are many other ways he could have persued a grand slam on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this broadcast will continue all day, see bbo schedule for time|pg||
nt|capercliff: bye all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might have tried 5@S with hannas hand, he can be sure 6@C is down|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is your itenary, gavin?|pg||
nt|gavin: 8 1/2 hour flight to nyc, go into the city for a few hours (5 hour layover) to hang out with friends, then back to the airport for a 6 hour flight to calgary, another hour to banff ...|pg||
nt|gavin: before i quit for the night |pg||

mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Karen, to the commentators, spectators for their comments, to BBO for allowing us to see bridge from everywhere, and to the CBF for arranging this broadcast|pg||

nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|shals: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: fortunately wont have any effect here, but i see no point in this double|pg||
nt|bbramley: another case for 6RKC|pg||
nt|bbramley: good to have some rules for what's trump in ambiguous keycard auctions|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt @H set with raise of @H?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or could be @S with cue bid?|pg||
nt|bbramley: not the way i play - for me 3@S makes both suits key - immed fits in two suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the rule i use is partners suit is the key suit|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sharynr: I wonder if  Daniel would have guess @D in 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: and finally get there sunday night , relax have breakfast monday and show up for the ko|pg||
nt|shals: Banff and the trip to the Okanagan is spectacular!|pg||
nt|caitlin: to Penticton??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: warning you will have your picture taken 20 times and be asked to take pictures at least that many times|pg||
nt|caitlin: where you going for KO?|pg||
nt|gavin: penticton|pg||
nt|gavin: regional starts monday night|pg||
nt|caitlin: awesome|pg||
nt|gavin: sucks that i will miss my mom and bro by a day|pg||
nt|lestergold: Green will try to force/encourage the defence to open up something to his advantage|pg||
nt|bbramley: but joey may not know for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: needed to cash a second spade before the diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: if joey thought @Hs were the only key suit, then he could be missing a grand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharynr: I guess Jim made it easier|pg||
nt|sharynr: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: and as he will say.  NEXT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: a club exit is safe|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|shals: ok Gavin, I will bring my camera, then?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gavin: so when he knocks out the heart, he will be able to squeeze hughes in hearts and spades for his 11th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is a dim but it removes an exit card from north|pg||
nt|bbramley: some play first agreed suit, or the major, or whatever - for me it's clear that with a two-suited fit that all of the high honors in both suits are key|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gavin: he is being a little carefull here not wanting to discard a diamond until its late enough in the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if hughes ducks|pg||
nt|gavin: u got it :)|pg||
nt|gavin: so if he ducks he can still negotiate it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club of course may not have been safe from Grainer's point of view|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gavin: cashes a couple clubs and its the same squeeze in a different way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: run the spades now |pg||
nt|rlebi: hence super kcb|pg||
mc|12|nt|starkist: 3@s might just be a cuebid|pg||
nt|bbramley: and i mean KEY in the literal sense, as in IMPORTANT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if both suits bid first by same hand, is most convenient to use the higher ranking as the key suit|pg||
nt|rlebi: so then it wouldnt matter|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: has east had a peak at south's cards no screens? long necks!!!|pg||

pc|hA|nt|kastan88: but IMO East had to say 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL THE SYSTEM WORKED TO PREVENT E/W FINDING THEIR DIAMOND FIT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: I mean am i MAD OR DREAMING ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some IMPs to Denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie is @hQ a nice return|pg||
nt|roswolf: small  is the technical play - blocks the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i dont understand the advantages of this method - it simply randomises who plays the contract and therefore will produce random swings on what should be flat boards|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: we can se, that @S4 would have won the game - best for sure @SK best chance|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 6@D is makeable but requires good guessing for sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: does that show 5-4?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: at this vul probably could be 4-4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it came up in set 1|pg||
nt|caitlin: increasingly popular these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: opponents got to 5@D, and escaped undoubled but down 4|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good evening from Dublin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4H beatable?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|caitlin: Martin they haven't played this board??|pg||

nt|fabsayc: score detroit|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh from set one|pg||
nt|glen: S suspects what the minor is|pg||
nt|susieq: I'm a little surprised Grainger didn't open that 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hi Martin, George|pg||
nt|caitlin: Last year Carruthers came in second for Worlds|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT may be better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: is this worth a superaccept?|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suit is blocked and north endplayed|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes end play from the club of course as long as Green reads the position|pg||
mb|2H|nt|caitlin: 2-1 my boys are making a come back:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a 2@H opening in first set, caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: now I understand, thanks:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: duh|pg||
nt|starkist: 2@d 2.5@h bid?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like a diamond shift trick 2 does it in|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: apparently 1NT shows more than a bare 6 count|pg||
nt|bbramley: sure, an early @D ought to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for results so far http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/09files/BWeek09_results.html|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W's interference may have prevented NS from reaching their 5-5 @D fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: click on date time and event|pg||
nt|mittmouse: lets see if turner makes the good technical play of a low club back not that it helps|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi martin x2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi George|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi george|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best they can do is cash club, heart, and play a heart|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Making3|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Lost the play, will claim out the hand when they are done. sorry |pg||
nt|fabsayc: some partnerships use 2@S over 2@H as a relay, would have been handy here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will come close to duplicating the undertricks here|pg||
nt|caitlin: I actually like Bergen super accepts|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: perhaps only 2, declarer drawing 2 trumps and playing diamonds for safety|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would think most play 8-10|pg||
nt|caitlin: what do I really care.....the Maple Leafs going nowhere ever so let's have THREE teams here..Hamilton, downtown and Downsview park..let them ALL in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek needed to put in the queen, forcing declarer to win|pg||
nt|caitlin: and unblock?|pg||
mb|p|nt|shals: would all of you lead the j?|pg||
nt|caitlin: depending if you playing Jack denies|pg||
nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: if Eddie Kantar were here he would have a FIT re: lead of Jack:)|pg||
nt|shals: iguess that is where I'm coming from|pg||
nt|caitlin: regardless of HCP you super accept with 9 card fit.. and more to it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: enlighten us Ellen|pg||
nt|raghavan: llen - since S did not make a bid they must be opening with 12 Points ( We were seeing lighter openings in other USA matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes surprising|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8 loser hand I would open|pg||
nt|glen: it helps if W has two ways to bid 3H over 2@S, one to show a great hand|pg||
nt|glen: here E has two bullets (aces) and a fit, so 4@H regardless|pg||
nt|glen: now at this time declarer thinks N's minor is @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: guess they don't play that|pg||
nt|raghavan: any lead helps|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Darren is not shy|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a great lead for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only suit that really matters is spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w have 5 hearts to cash if they get the chance given a heart lead unlikely unless Green finds a double|pg||
nt|starkist: =|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|caitlin: I like Rusinow leads by far best|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes easier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is up to carruthers to figure this out|pg||
nt|bbramley: not an easy defense|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: especially in this case|pg||

nt|fabsayc: korbel wisely pulls|pg||

pc|c2|nt|shals: the 8 might make pd play the q|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes now he doesnt have to worry about the @Ha|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: the 4-1 spades may slow things down|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club and HK are favourably placed|pg||
nt|raghavan: another H may go on Clubs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharynr: 9 easy tricks here. should not take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n porbably going off as not likley to take dim finesse in 3n|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@S however, seems too much|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d has reasonable play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|shals: it still can do damage|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 10|pg||
nt|caitlin: look it how close this match is|pg||
nt|rlebi: he's likely gonna make it now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: took his 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: even Rolan would have doubts about playing 6d|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: arggh|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my money is with the defenc|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could make on cross ruff except that fourth heart will be overruffed|pg||
nt|lestergold: this slam has more holes in it than one of them mousetrap cheeses|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D 22 @S king  @C q ruffs out onside  too good for Roland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but it looks makeable|pg||
nt|glen: and the D took care of that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|caitlin: yes Jurek (North) might have made another move|pg||
nt|lestergold: can it be made double dummy?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 tricks looks difficult|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently no does not have quite the entries to south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: both made a cue bid too many - the KH metited an un cue bid if that were possible|pg||
nt|gowdy: ani nteresting push vs 3nt with big upside   sort of shows why slams should have better play thanthis as 5 @D could win big|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: i truely dont understand a club play|pg||
nt|caitlin: E-W played in safe 3D on board 17 for 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|glen: if S had given a @C ruff, it was just ruffing one of declarer's losers|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: good line of play for the rest|pg||
nt|starkist: now for sure|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|starkist: I like that play|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|caitlin: for 6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|starkist: that too|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ithought playing D A first and back with SQ good|pg||
pc|d7|nt|caitlin: this is not pretty for E-W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this was safer, although diamond ruff unlikely|pg||
pc|dA|nt|caitlin: but if East ducks what now?|pg||
nt|caitlin: low spade|pg||

nt|sybarra: Hi Bob@H@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|kastan88: still i don't like such advantages, too much pressure to partner, and i am with you Mike, i would bid 2@H not passing, partner could have  6S3-1D3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the theory becomes different- in the pass out seat you are  in the trap in effect weven though east hasnt spoken|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H or 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: or pass|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h and 5@d were easy, or 3NT by N|pg||

mb|1C|nt|haans: yes my vote 2 (just)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: South has the option to sit for it or to escape by showing both majors|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Precision or some other strong club opening, I presume|pg||
nt|talion: skuladotti is tempted to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Bob|pg||
nt|haans: must be transfer|pg||
nt|m_niemi: but do they play it in Sweden?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: 2@H by N might even make?|pg||

nt|roswolf: this might end up in a thin slam but very anti - odds|pg||
nt|m_niemi: like Greek gift?|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|m_niemi: so still 0-1|pg||

mb|p|nt|cenglund:  3NT is piece of cake|pg||
nt|lestergold: but doesnt want to push south out of spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the no science route|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so Â½-1|pg||

mb|p|pc|c4|nt|kastan88: Hi Bob, |pg||
nt|mcphee: just getting an idea whats being played|pg||

nt|pelu: 1@D = negavtiv, 1@H = nat or 20+|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: should make plenty |pg||
nt|mcphee: these sort of hands really offer little play choice|pg||

pc|c8|nt|haans: magic is allowed passing with strong hand forbidden|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|talion: yes it is, but it could have been very poor contract if nurmi has minimum 15 points for her opening|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: declarer may get home if she plays on the black suits however playing on dims looks doomed|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mcphee: this line is going to work even better|pg||
nt|pelu: and for rest of the bidding I need help :(:(:(|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think east perhaps with her two doubles had bid here values and that the fourth heart was optinmistic|pg||
nt|haans: yes worsed for sweden|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 4-7+@s|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: south covers dims set up hearts set up no  fast ntry six tricks for defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: club up would be good now |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes bjut south needed to cover altho not obvious |pg||
nt|asig: maybe not|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@c= 20+ ASK|pg||

nt|caitlin: with 15 and pd could have 17...last board... should make a move|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey great convention, gets you 400 every time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we missed the key defensive play|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dent in the lead perhaps altho could be in 3n in the open going off too|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: david grainger wins the Lord Yarborough cup|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: a little smaller than the Stanley Cup|pg||
nt|sharynr: is this 1NT an upgrade or part of the range?|pg||
nt|susieq: systemically that shows a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
mb|d|nt|susieq: at least according to what I have here|pg||
nt|caitlin: so this is the finals of the CNTC|pg||
nt|glen: 4@C is a splinter, and as you can see from the E hand, partnerships have to agree on how little it can have for working high card points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east hand may actually be above their minimum, but poorly placed|pg||
nt|glen: 4@D here, as played by many experts, is "last train" - last bid below 4@H - it says I like my hand, but may or may not have a @D card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so much depends on cue bid style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last train has its own set of problems|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: seems like a bid showing majors for me|pg||
nt|susieq: oh my mistake- it's a weak notrump, so it just shows values|pg||
nt|sharynr: or just a good old fashioned penalty double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they play Woolsey?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|sharynr: pretty good weakie :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if grainger establishes the spades west must ruff the fourth, leaving losing heart in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S  and I think bid now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid quickly and down quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the least of which is easts 4@S can be ace or king|pg||
nt|glen: for one of the famous Gitelman articles: http://www.imp-bridge.nl/articles/2over1b.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|glen: this is before in moved from toronto, and now names conventions on the songs of vegas acts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna is out of bids in my opinion|pg||
nt|glen: *this was before he|pg||
nt|glen: yup, he was worth 1 try, not 2|pg||
nt|glen: unless their splinters promise a moose (grizzly in BC)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ew needed to get in the bidding here|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N would fare fine|pg||
nt|mcarroll: who will bid NT?|pg||
nt|raghavan: W I presume|pg||
nt|caitlin: I might have bid 2H with Nader's hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if E bids 3@S W may venture 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will bid again S and W 3NT |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt by west down on spade lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: ah it will take a while |pg||
nt|mittmouse: 4s is cols from the n side|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: easy 3@S, and 2@D can be made|pg||
nt|sharynr: risky pass, David should expect a void|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bidding may be riskier|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this should go down|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is a skinny 2N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: several chances to lead spades|pg||
nt|mittmouse: cold|pg||
mb|3S|nt|caitlin: so then Canada and Mexico vie for spot in Brazil|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: possibly 3@S now|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna is President of Canadian Bridge Federation which sponsors the CNTC's|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like 2@D was cold also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: biddable is not so clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: RE has bid twice- 5 cards why develop|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Bermuda used to be part of that but has spot in Central American zone|pg||
nt|caitlin: for Canadian Bridge Federation CNTC see: http://www.cbf.ca/CNTC/|pg||
nt|caitlin: is this a 2NT catch up bid?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just an overbid in my view|pg||
nt|bbramley: must still guess the @SJ, although east is likely to help on lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bbramley: that lead won't cost|pg||
nt|gambit: every lead gives away something, endplayed trick ! ]\|pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: H lead prob|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: penguins win|pg||
nt|gavin: ship itttttt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|caitlin: Darren's 9 asks for spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: C 9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: declarer on the winning line|pg||
nt|lestergold: an auction likely to  be duplicated tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club club and club wuill give declarer a losing option to go down 2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharynr: excellent result for N-S|pg||
nt|caitlin: Darren Wolpert (not to be confused with his brother Galvin) and Czyzowicz are aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|raghavan: S can take 2 Spade only|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gowdy: not sure about that  north has an interesting hand  depends on meathods |pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4s bid is normal becuase either it makes or if it doesnt it prevents e/w  however here i think e/w liimit was 3 dims|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: indeed, 3NT makes EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the carnage if NS declare, nobody wants to know|pg||
nt|caitlin: I believe reverse smith echo here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moose here also|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry Gavin |pg||
nt|caitlin: it is Darren|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now turner is confused, looks like partner was trying to find entry for a heart through declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|raghavan: 2 S + C A + H A|pg||
nt|caitlin: so Wolpert's @C7 says I do not like hearts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: it needed an initial @S lead to beat 3NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|caitlin: well Roy did bid hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes but down only 1 this way|pg||
nt|caitlin: true|pg||
pc|s2|nt|caitlin: and Wolpert can't be the one to lead them:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Cliff Gillis|pg||

nt|caitlin: should find it|pg||
nt|raghavan: H  is 9th trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: He may duck again hoping D K with S|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting re: Green's 3@H bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: of course it ASKS|pg||
nt|caitlin: if Green had hearts he would bid 3N|pg||

nt|ralfwil: an optimistic 4@h in OR|pg||
nt|asig: Lots of action in the closed room on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had to use the 3@D jump i think i would try 3nt also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving 3@D for at most 1 loser suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward hand|pg||
nt|haans: you can find full text somewere at internet (i found it long ago)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@d I mean|pg||
nt|asig: Open, sorry|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kastan88: why? I have played here in Estonia long time in 80's early 90's Estonian strong pass system called "Otstavel" by co-author (or Tartu Stick). Was amazing time|pg||
nt|haans: trash bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s= unbal 8-11|pg||
nt|m_niemi: can they find @h fit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a valuation problem now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = natural|pg||
nt|m_niemi: their 1@c-def: X = Ms, 1NT = ms|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might not be able to show his shape|pg||
nt|pelu: suit - but no HCP?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|cenglund:  The play Weak NT, I suppose|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d= 0-7 or any GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: always bid over a strong club at this vul if you have any kind of long suit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|talion: 1NT is 12-14 in first & second position and 15-17 in third & fourth position|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone else not want to forgive him :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its unforgettable|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i confused unforgiveible with unforgettable|pg||
nt|mcphee: not so terrible a @D slam this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: but im english argggghhh|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes at this vul east chose 2s in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i fancy north didnt like to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|jakow: @D FG or weak|pg||
nt|jakow: 15-17nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: which may have supercharged the auction|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 11-rule:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the weak part of these systems is inspired/semi-lunatic intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Ducking is safe|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice surprise in @c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: here is a good test for any system lots of tricks but 2 fast losers - lets see what happens|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 15-17 now bidding start|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is extremely light for a penalty double|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A diamond preference would help partner|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: most english can neither speak or write their native language|pg||
nt|asig: This should make|pg||
nt|haans: @DK second so very easy make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: terrible...as in it doesnt make |pg||
nt|mcphee: not in favor of this 2N rebid at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: there speaks a retired headmaster|pg||
nt|kastan88: nice cold (or gold) humour, as usual, Mike :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well facing 8-11 he probably thought that this was a fair shot|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @s4= @d-signal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what discards are they using, lavinthal?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Roman|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: most headmaster can either by the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Now it's only about fighting for overtricks|pg||
nt|talion: now ahonen has double stopper in hearts. if danielsdot had lead high heart, then ahonen could have taken only one heart trick|pg||
nt|talion: but with no side entry, low heart lead seems reasonable|pg||
nt|asig: One loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence may put pressure when aqce and another club is played if north ducks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps E has a guess in @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: odd= pos, even= lavinthal|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: roland very dissapoined about no slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably right play by defence|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT-1 or -2 is cheap against 4@h|pg||
nt|haans: the text 'now bidding start' is standard for the system |pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: its not mps!|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer wont make many tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: no real exploration of the hands possibilites - just a close your eyes jump to 3nt|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jakow: Ask EBL!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will go off but it will be a few 50's only|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room N opens 17+ 1@d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: but teammates wont be|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: well if no @S lead it will make|pg||
nt|cenglund:  good defence so far|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|m_niemi: squeeeeez...|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps south should have cashed his club tricks first|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer should pitch clubs|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looked like only 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: we have to remember that there are also novices and low intermediates in spec who may not know when such bids are asking or telling|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not too many in penticton area however|pg||
nt|glen: the bears ate them|pg||
nt|glen: an ottawa bear is in pendiction for the tourney|pg||

nt|bbramley: how many tricks did he take, operator?  if he guessed spades he made 10|pg||
mb|p!|nt|mcbruce:  The CSTC is over after three quarters, with Hobart winning after a big 3Q.|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: welcome Cliff|pg||
nt|caitlin: so when is final game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: cheers guys|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer advance of 1@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: E-W make 3S on last hand|pg||
nt|gavin: this match ends tomorrow|pg||
nt|gavin: stanley cup is over ! |pg||
nt|caitlin: hockey Gavin:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are on at 9:30, 12, 4:30 and 7 tomorrow for the remaining 4 sets|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all time PDT|pg||
nt|caitlin: ohhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|glen: S has a good @H fit, but soft values in the other suits, and no ruffing value|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  his means we have two sets of boards, one at each table, so my duplication accuracy will be put to the test...but nobody will wait for a board|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the claim was for making 3 :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|gavin: 4-3 pittsburgh, thats practically like bringing the cup to canada|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double support|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: showing hearts, adds a lot of possible new sequences |pg||
nt|capercliff: is this only after a X?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure, is good any time in my opinion|pg||
nt|gavin: about as close as were gonna get for a while|pg||
nt|caitlin: "practically"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do you figure that gavin|pg||
nt|gavin: our young superstar wins|pg||
nt|lestergold: tame 3n here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a quackery|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: these transfer responses ar gaining popularity everywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: i quite like it after a double, puts the doubler on lead but requires lots of notes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this tricky lead is going to backfire|pg||
nt|fabsayc: erase my last comment, lost the plot :)|pg||
nt|gavin: vancouver is the only canadian team with a hope|pg||
nt|shals: I agree but great story  for the underdogs|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@C??|pg||
nt|shals: I hope!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hope springs eternal, go whitecaps|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|starkist: not beating now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: 3NT is the simplest bid available|pg||
pc|s7|nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: Gavin would you bid 3C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gosh i must be old, i pass in second seat|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is risky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but quite a play problem|pg||
nt|raghavan: Which is the 9th trick? |pg||
nt|mcarroll: He has to find one of the @SJ,@DQ or @CQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will probably attempt to combine chances|pg||
nt|raghavan: C Q difficult|pg||
nt|gowdy: looks like coffee ( or wine ) time here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|caitlin: 6@S|pg||
nt|caitlin: moi aussi|pg||
nt|shals: me too|pg||
nt|gavin: i wouldnt open :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash top cards in one minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: with hearts 3/3 and the qc as entry no probs in this contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that tame, saved by heart split and club ace right|pg||
nt|glen: dummy comes down and declarer thinks should I work out on how 4@S would do - no first, play this|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gavin: but no i wouldnt bid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|caitlin: 3@C Fit showing jump by passed hand|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect hand to pass and make an unusual 2NT bid later|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: not bergen?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey just asking|pg||
nt|caitlin: why not drury then?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|shals: yes it is|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why i said it was tame as the cards lie not in an absoluiter sense|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Karen our operator?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but does he have a losing alternative, perhaps not|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Karen:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I almost fell asleep in the sun:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so he has to establish clubs and that means spades will be established and he cannot lose the lead again|pg||
nt|lestergold: so its a one shot contract|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sharynr: good stop by E-W|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Gowdy:)|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  four rounds to play in COPC; we'll announce leaders when posted|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: down 1 or numerous overtricks on this defense|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome|pg||
pc|s3|nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: what if korbel ducks two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then the hearts squeeze hanna|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharynr: looks like N-S make 21H so even down 1 is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry, they are playing too fast and lost thread |pg||
nt|sharynr: but that was a reasonable shift|pg||
nt|mittmouse: technically hanna should now try a club if that is wrong he has to take a s finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: good point G|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so saved by the diamond 9 then|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: or possibly cash @Ss to check if they are 3-3 or the J falls, then 2 top @Cs|pg||
nt|raghavan: finessing towards w is likely - since W may not know that H K is alone|pg||
nt|caitlin: he will finesse West for @DQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna will try K then lead low to the Q better odds than playing anything else|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s9|nt|caitlin: I think any bid showing spade support would have turned Turner on:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: crosby doing pushups with the cup|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green gave count|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna knows that the ace will be held up otherwise|pg||
nt|caitlin: so David Grainger and Daniel Korbel|pg||
nt|lestergold: better unblock hearts now he will of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did he really pitch a heart?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he did hes dead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|shals: woops this is going to be tough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a crystal ball tuner, Mike|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gavin: 2 down with a winning finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks misere from here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching a spade gives up any chance of a make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: for me 3@C would be clubs only|pg||
nt|caitlin: I see 7 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good save against 2@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: upside down|pg||
nt|glen: yes, but he was doing it in hope to entice a @S play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|caitlin: no X no trouble?|pg||
nt|shals: maybe|pg||
nt|caitlin: let's remember these guys may be TIRED|pg||
nt|gavin: oh ya, this is a gruelling event to say the least|pg||
pc|c4|nt|caitlin: for me FSJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand and in competition|pg||
nt|caitlin: they didn't get here without lots of play|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't we all..|pg||
nt|gavin: its an achievement to be in the finals but the losing team probably wont feel that way|pg||
nt|shals: true..|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmm|pg||
pc|c2|nt|capercliff: this is going well for declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north will just keep discarding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open Room got to 4@D on 3|pg||
nt|gambit: To all you hockey fans Pitt wins 2-1 in a nailbiter |pg||
nt|glen: though the D can clearly see that a @H discard is called for|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. don't trust that @S discard at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry too fast |pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: down 2|pg||
mc|7|nt|caitlin: Yes Cam this has been a topic woven in with bridge:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Detroit is a big bridge city|pg||
nt|lestergold: why hold on to the pesky diamonds|pg||
nt|bbramley: south has a lock to play @Cs - east has shown 16 HCP already and is marked with at most 3 @Cs|pg||

nt|haans: bjarnason has an openin or ???|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if opponents preempt after 1@c-1@d NS may be in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1nt 15-17 start with stayman transfers etc etc|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Flannery, I presume|pg||
nt|m_niemi: par is 4NT by N|pg||
mb|1H|nt|talion: 2@d is both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a part score here not too high for either side|pg||
nt|mcphee: and this is the reason why I prefer to open 1@D as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s already probably too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h by n/s isnt guaranteed either|pg||
nt|asig: No|pg||
nt|asig: 5 apparent losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence  a spade a heart  2 clubs and a dim to lose|pg||
nt|haans: invite spade support|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 35 the danish west didnt find the spade lead and therefore declarer had no problem|pg||
nt|haans: 1D 17+++++++++|pg||
nt|haans: 1H neg|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: what does 1@H show?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@dX made in deal 1, 11 to Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: 1H show 0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt must be a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a trappy hand for n/s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D openeron the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: for weak to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 30 imps in 3 boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S may be 3 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: three spades|pg||
nt|haans: lucky he has more|pg||
mb|p|nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is another example of inadequate fighting ofr the part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: sensible idea to me also Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i can see how this made|pg||
nt|asig: Win the ace, to rounds of trumps an another diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ruffs with his mony and then fourth dim takes care of club an d a club is ruffed in dummy! what an extraordinary position|pg||
nt|asig: *two|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a perfectly normal defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets it thru|pg||
nt|asig: Einarsson should work this out on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Not among the best 3NTs I have seen|pg||
nt|talion: very optimistic bidding here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: u do not win letting vul opps play in 2 of a minor normally|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you havent notice yet,  Mike had his "wheaties" for breakfast this morning,   making quite agressive |pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW has 22 hcp and some long suits, no bids|pg||
nt|roswolf: that certainly kept e/w out but imo both e +w should have bid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cenglund:  If they lead 3rd and 5th best Q would have been a better card|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: declarer is unlikely to gey @Cs right, then it will be for S to find a @S switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: what planet is this the standard contract|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|cenglund:  Ahonen could work out that there is no hope in spades|pg||
nt|xenya: *get|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now -1|pg||
nt|asig: if the defence finds the club shift|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cenglund:  Duck is necessary|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|talion: at the other table south opened 3@c and played there|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: now she is home -- losing an imp|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh no|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think N should have doubled 3@h|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: how can east work this out ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: even now not too late|pg||
pc|c9|nt|m_niemi: he has great hand + defensive values|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|cenglund:  A few vulnerable undertricks to be expected|pg||

nt|sharynr: and Hanna must have taken that line|pg||
nt|gavin: hughest hand is way too strong for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
nt|gavin: very difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no down 1 on this defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the interesting defense would have been to start with a high club|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mittmouse: i think he must have done it right good technique by hanna|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needed 6 hearts for his overcall, so finesse long odds at the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator says it was a heart discarded|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: Would anyone open east hand and if so, what|pg||
nt|gavin: too strong for 2C then 2nt too|pg||
nt|shals: and hockey city|pg||
nt|gavin: so many slams where partner doesnt show interest|pg||
nt|gavin: 1D is a reasonable choice |pg||
nt|raghavan: Part score deal|pg||
nt|caitlin: a constructive 2@S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: in which case unless im missing something it was a bad error|pg||
mb|p|nt|susieq: I would open 3@D but I'm a little crazy|pg||
nt|caitlin: whereas if he were weaker he would first bid 1NT then 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise  2 spades 2 clubs 5 hearts and contract made|pg||
nt|starkist: all I know is I'm leading the @h j on this hand|pg||
nt|bbramley: @H8 is the key card|pg||
mb|2D|nt|capercliff: both k's are working|pg||
nt|susieq: that's fit showing|pg||
nt|caitlin: Turner will pass I assume|pg||
nt|gambit: Will C balance? I thk y|pg||
nt|gavin: this auction would almost always be 4-6 or 5-6|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to picture partner with a hand good enough for this action that doesnt have 6 diamonds |pg||
nt|gavin: turner has a monster|pg||
nt|gavin: (given the state of the auction)|pg||
nt|gavin: with  aspade stopper and 3 diamonds and the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|gavin: i think he owes hughes 2 or 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: 1nt = @C|pg||
nt|gowdy: suit or a lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: interesting choice to bid 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may regret not playing 4@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4333 often plays at least a trick better in 4 of a major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 4@S an easier contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: neither is very good|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, 3D, and the QH, extras given his pass, but monster, No.....a couiple modest redeeming features, |pg||
nt|mcarroll: On Board 1 I see they did prefer the Moysian @S fit rather than @Cs and it cost 11 imps|pg||
nt|caitlin: they play constructive so 2@S 8-10 HCP|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is not forward going, but Jurek still tempted|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3@S is preemptive not constructive|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes some play 1@S 2@S 3@S stop|pg||
nt|caitlin: I personally don't like it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as there is no entry to Dummy, on a @D lead to take advantage of a discard on the @HA 4 @S goes down|pg||
nt|raghavan: S is trying to prevent EW going to 3H and later if he ventured - may be doubled - Of course he does not know N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that does not automatically beat hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And there are slow @C losers|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: nice hand for fit showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: even with both K's working hard to see 10 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|caitlin: given their lead there is no reason to push to 4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gavin: he cant have a better hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: We cannot find fault with N for his bidding|pg||
nt|caitlin: well if they play 1S 2S 3S stop we can|pg||
nt|starkist: darn need to play xfer lead doubles|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharynr: 4@S might have been reached (and made)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think green should have tried 3@D in that case|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this is a steal im surprised green didnt bid 3d then hanna would bid 4s |pg||
nt|sharynr: but as is the case when both sides make a major suit game, the bidding might not have stopped at the 4 level|pg||
nt|gavin: funny to balance your opponents from 1D into 3NT|pg||
nt|caitlin: how true|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has maximum for his 2S bid|pg||
nt|glen: the 2/1 way to make a 3 card limit raise - 1NT (forcing/semi-forcing), then 3 of the major|pg||
pc|hA|nt|capercliff: good things H's are 3-3 or this would be really ugly|pg||
nt|capercliff: cancel that|pg||
nt|capercliff: even I could make 4 tricks with this @h suit:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in no trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: what out what you ask for|pg||
nt|gavin: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: czyz will have an easy time finding hte club shift|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems down if defense passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have stayed low nough to make  a plus|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gavin: the king of spades asks his partner to unblock an honor or give him upside down count|pg||
nt|caitlin: he showed it with constructive raise|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gambit: this will go down quickly |pg||
nt|gambit: as a plus |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict slowly|pg||
nt|gambit: you know David? Methodical |pg||
nt|gavin: when south gets in with the first diamond|pg||
nt|gavin: he will undoubtedly lead a spade|pg||
nt|gavin: since his partner lead the king, thats their power lead he knows that he has a GREAT spade suit|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to know if he has 5 or 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad spade break and poor communications with dummy would make higher level contracts very precarious|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|gambit: 3-2 diamonds would work losing 1 diamond, 3 spades|pg||
nt|rlebi: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: some problems now for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the simplest solution, finesse the club|pg||
nt|caitlin: he has to|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: brave play, minimizing the loss|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: why rush with ace of dim?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was a mistake but afraid hanna would draw partners lone trump|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: then how back to hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: finessing @Ds against North??|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharynr: i am sure NS would have pushed to th5 5-level|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky spade position|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mittmouse: look at what that fit showing jump did for graingers hand he would have bid to the 5 level if necessary|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had Hanna tried 8s it would have been very revealing!!|pg||
nt|mittmouse: carruthers must have missed a spot|pg||
nt|starkist: teasing @d10 play|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: this is why i hesistated with my comment, was not at all clear|pg||
nt|gavin: that was an odd play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond lead would have made this tougher, but i think still makes|pg||
nt|glen: yes, the @D lead head towards a forcing defense|pg||
pc|d5|nt|glen: the idea being to play @Ds at all chances|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: contract still in jeapordy tho|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gavin: and darren playing the queen of diamonds was bad also|pg||
nt|gavin: only lying to his partner|pg||
nt|caitlin: this has not been a lucky 3rd or beginning of 4th set for Carruthers team|pg||
nt|gowdy: a new variation  pitch a winner on a loser   but maintain control|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|pc|c2|nt|starkist: didn't he have to duck as the only hope?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: lucky for him partner didnt have a black ace|pg||
nt|bbramley: he had 2 hopes: @HAJ8 with west, or a @D entry with west|pg||

mb|1C|nt|haans: responses|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jakow: In original Magic D we opened 2S on this hand  55 S+C or D+H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant 1@H show 45?|pg||
nt|roswolf: another big @H fit for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: will e/w allow n/s play in 4@S?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in big club system S is so limited, that preempts should be quite sound = > W pass|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h= 8-11|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C?????????????????????????|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|lestergold: in bridge you musttighten the screw up to the maximum but not brwak the bolt by overdoing it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a close 3n with nothing to spare made in the open|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N pass!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing to stop them now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mcphee: good @C slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: so iceland really needs to flatten this board|pg||
nt|roswolf: bergen strikes|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: creeping about cautiously will win nothing|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no trumps, no @h-ruff|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jakow: About 12-14hcp and 3+H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in 3. seat vuln: 1Nt = 15-17, so N had to open 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: with spades and dims both breaking 3/3 this should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: easy 7 tricks - and a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: we've got our first comparison -- let's hope it will continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie but imagine you were in club slam and recieved a heart lead - you would not be a very happer sapper|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: your only entry to dummy under attack immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it i think even roland would baulk at this slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: life can be mean, i have this E hand and partner opens slam is going to be hard to avoid:)|pg||
nt|asig: Yes, even if W finds an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the lead helps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: easy to duck and then only one club  trick for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a horrible choice for east now|pg||
nt|haans: had been much harder to bid if sylvan first passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: i was once told by an international team captain in the southern hemisphere that he picked 1 pair playing an HUM system in all matches against what he thought were the weakest ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: teams and sat them out otherwise - the strategy worked the team won a medal|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|xenya: nicely done by NS|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4N simply does not do the hand any justice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: 29 combined points without a grat trump fit why have you got to be in slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: because it makes? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (just a joke)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|pelu: that from board 22 - board 17-18-19 = 8-0 for Sweden|pg||

nt|raghavan: Give credit to E playing small Spades. |pg||

mb|1C|nt|starkist: true|pg||

nt|fabsayc: joey cant have side ace?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gavin: its on a finesse but they have so many wasted points|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: but they always bid 3nt|pg||

nt|sharynr: Silver made 5@d on the second hand, for 8 imps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|rlebi: no take A no get A|pg||
nt|rlebi: @s|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: Silver laughed when he saw dummy: "and hope you make it partner" |pg||
nt|fabsayc: guess that answers my question :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: so i like to have a semblance of a side entry for 3 preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is "normal"|pg||
nt|gavin: ok obviously not as tough as i thought|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|gavin: i guess 2nt was 20-22|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 1 OR Silver bid 1@S over 1@H overcall......did Carruthers assume he had 5?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mcarroll: on the bidding declarer probably should finess through N for @SJ to cater for a 4-1 break - which does not cost in this instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h does jam the auction nicely, you know if you double partner is bound to bid 4m|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is better than 22|pg||
nt|gavin: so darren could see it wasnt going to be great even opposite a super accept|pg||
nt|gavin: i agree|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't you bid 2c then 2n?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah, opposite a passed hand|pg||
mc|11|nt|fabsayc: 6@D is a reasonable spot with the bonus of making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H will make|pg||

nt|haans: there are two versions after 1@H overcall x show spades or x deny spades|pg||
nt|haans: not @D lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, Jaak, that's even more difficult|pg||
nt|cenglund:  1 NT forcing I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: incredible|pg||
nt|haans: holy shit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well im not convinced that was theintention|pg||
nt|lestergold: at the time |pg||
nt|m_niemi: N hopes that S has 5-5 or better|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: this is a funny deal for denmark :))))|pg||
nt|haans: a natural penalty double!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cenglund:  On good day you make slam, but this not that day|pg||
nt|mcphee: this response range places a lot of pressure, 2N as N kinda forced in case S has more and works poorly when S has a 6 count|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E has good shape, and no wasting values|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: complain when he misses something, not before|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = non forcing|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: at the time declarer was more worried about his ninth trick than his tenth!|pg||
nt|asig: Sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Dead after a @s lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: yes sadly bcause Iceland needed a swing hwere|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 37 Finns in 4@h in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: good natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: bloddy bidding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: but notthis swing in the wrong direction|pg||
nt|roswolf: wise words martin|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N's bids been strange to me, played well|pg||
nt|roswolf: the results achieved are the proof of the pudding|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Nice lead, but not good enough to beat the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the finns have what they deserve|pg||
nt|m_niemi: even then that is too much|pg||
nt|haans: criminal?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N should have at least 4 cards in on minor|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: i like that (being swede)|pg||
nt|haans: not four losing diamonds :))|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh plenty good enough|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cenglund:  10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: by not telling his hand|pg||
nt|m_niemi: W can't get @d wrong if he decides to finess in @s|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes, declarer may try to drop the stiff queen after the ruff|pg||
nt|haans: gustawsson have done nothing wrong yes|pg||
nt|haans: yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but it shows what can happen when a p'ship makes an undisciplined intervention into the auction|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Our matches after the lunch break will be Iceland v Sweden (open) and Finland v Denmark (women)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: board 20 +1 to FIN|pg||
nt|m_niemi: played 4@s 11 tricks|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The merits of the good lead are gone now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cenglund:  The duck allowed partner to show diamond preference|pg||
nt|m_niemi: looks like 10 tricks to me|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @cA and @d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: After this match there is a break for dinner (almost 19.00 in Finland now). Play will resume at 21.00 local time, in 2 hours and a bit with Sweden v Norway (open) and Finland v ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland (women)|pg||

nt|haans: were are @D 2 3 4|pg||
nt|haans: low enc are not always better not always :)|pg||
nt|haans: askgaard are not happy|pg||
nt|haans: over 90 % of all nordic play low encourage|pg||
nt|haans: 0r say 95% +|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -2 at least|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cenglund:  10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|haans: killer|pg||
nt|haans: whatever sylvan do real killerrrrrrrrrrr|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart force might have got it off declarer should make now if he ruffs clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: well it worked very poorly here bidding 3n when opps can cash5 tops for starters|pg||
nt|m_niemi: spades 2-2 and @DAxx in S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: one off is very good bridge for denmark|pg||

nt|gavin: np|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is Gavin Wolpert|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing but weak caitlin, then 3@C would be limited reverse and not forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you think Mr Kokish will visit the open room|pg||
nt|shals: should we expcet him/|pg||
nt|caitlin: if so 110 isn't right score|pg||
nt|gowdy: thanks  nice job|pg||
nt|lestergold: my pleasure Caitlin|pg||
nt|bbramley: tough to give up on a beat|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: potentially 0 cover cards|pg||
nt|sharynr: A unusual weak 2 by Hanna|pg||
nt|susieq: that's a pretty heavy 2@S bid nv|pg||
nt|gavin: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is why Jurek did not try for slam over 4@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have been facing xxxx in diamonds for example|pg||
nt|shals: expect ie|pg||
nt|caitlin: just ask Eric to go to Peter Chung King and he will come to ANY table:)|pg||
nt|shals: ahh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not doubled|pg||
nt|caitlin: great response by Jim:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is East Jim Green|pg||
nt|glen: np, 1st priority is to get right result in|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2nd priority is to get Korbel to update his bridge blog|pg||
nt|glen: with actual play of hand|pg||
nt|rlebi: quite a few tricks available|pg||
nt|susieq: he's got some hands from the Cavendish in Vegas to put in as well before he gets to this :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: Korbel alerts pass of 2NT to mean "i'm not blogging this hand"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: opening 3@H would have blown out N/S|pg||
nt|starkist: I don't like to have 7 for wk 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: btw Mohmad Ali is at the NHL game wearing a Red Wing Jersey:) *IMPORTANT information:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have advertising space available on my chest also :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anybody know what 4@C is|pg||
nt|glen: well, we can't use the G word can we|pg||
nt|mittmouse: bart do u think its right in a long match where people are tired not to claim and let them work to try to beat it|pg||
nt|bbramley: agree about 7|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: silver asking for the same dummy this time|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharynr: i guess Jim has seen his partner's weak 2's before|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry won't go for what Ali's goes for:)|pg||
nt|gavin: go pittsburgh!|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|gavin: im in sweden for about 7 more hours, no hockey on normal TV here :( |pg||
nt|caitlin: we will keep you up to date Gavin|pg||
nt|caitlin: I have Tom in the lobby letting me know all:)|pg||
nt|gavin: looks like down a couple in 3 diamonds, ew can make 3C|pg||
nt|shals: what does that indicate?|pg||
nt|caitlin: raise in diamonds|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: limit|pg||
nt|caitlin: our vugraph operator, Karen, says it wasn't doubled|pg||
nt|gowdy: againd 4 @S and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4+|pg||
nt|caitlin: Korbel thinking of raising|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gavin: i think its a mixed raise , we will see based on norths response|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry I thought S doubled again and it was left in|pg||
nt|bbramley: george, not in general|pg||
pc|c4|nt|starkist: worked out well for him|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ellen and Martin - what will N play now after SQ - will he play club small??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably win and shift to a club, although that does not look hopeful|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he overtakes that is his only hope|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps a heart better|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Martin?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that is what he is thinking about, I would opt forsmall@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: attacking communication|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be the Green convention|pg||
nt|glen: yes, Green convention, asking for aces|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H likely showed 0 or 3 aces (E suspects 3)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: is fine if you don't do it also on garbage hands|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect!|pg||
nt|shals: yep|pg||
nt|caitlin: asking re minor which can't be clubs|pg||
nt|glen: 5@C confirms all aces, and now W has good playing value if E has the right hand opposite|pg||
pc|h2|nt|caitlin: I wonder whom you are rooting for Gavin?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: pittsburgh !!! oh my brother|pg||
nt|shals: good stop I think|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see......not so easy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|caitlin: and which is more important?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good choice |pg||
nt|capercliff: normal with a stiff honor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: anyone know what 2Nt asked for|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|starkist: what a steal this was|pg||
nt|bbramley: and he's going to make 2@H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|capercliff: @s lead will hold it to 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: may have been singleton?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Pittsburgh on a power play|pg||
nt|shals: no stoppers in clubs for nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: that would be too lucky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really ugly lead problem for hanna|pg||
nt|gowdy: may lose 2 @S here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gowdy: not now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh my|pg||
nt|glen: and only a ruff can beat this 7NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rlebi: unusual but effective auction|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't think this auction calls for trump lead either|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wouldnt think so|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I caught all the play on that one :)|pg||
nt|glen: lol :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all 139 spectators are sworn to not tell roland|pg||
nt|rlebi: 16 imp diff now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gavin: wheres the contract that consents if detroit wins my bro wins ? ill sign |pg||
nt|fabsayc: Jxx and Jx are ugly for trump lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: 8 boards - 2 imps a board until a playoff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: but is hard to see why a spade is best|pg||
nt|caitlin: nada tricks for NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this right??|pg||
nt|mcarroll: K worked better|pg||
nt|raghavan: fell in the trap- 2Club tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well now a heart seems clear|pg||
nt|caitlin: it's right he played North for KQ tight|pg||
nt|gowdy: tuff lead     this looks normal|pg||
nt|caitlin: what else to lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass right to dummy|pg||
nt|caitlin: underlead a heart to stiff @HK??|pg||
nt|caitlin: can't be or he would have clubs:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: a few|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart or club ace were clearly alternatives, also with their losing cases|pg||
nt|caitlin: low heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna thinking of winning clearing trump|pg||
nt|caitlin: ???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he cant do that, would have no chance then|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|caitlin: :) so blood is thicker than hockey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck again looks best|pg||
mc|10|nt|sharynr: well my predictions stink....bd 20 open room in 4@D DBL|pg||
nt|gavin: its amazing how often ducking to keep control in trumps is right when they break bad and you have length w/ the ace|pg||
nt|gavin: both as defender or declarer|pg||
nt|gavin: unless you clearly need to clear trumps ASAP , its better not to win your ace until the last chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or 3@D|pg||
nt|starkist: then a shoot off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely not two overtricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just making|pg||
nt|rlebi: sudden death|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: typo|pg||
nt|bbramley: all the same impwise, for making 110, 140 or 170|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: fixed it|pg||

nt|roswolf: slam zone hand|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club|pg||
mb|2D|nt|m_niemi: not a very good slam :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C now would have excited north|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Worth 1 IMP|pg||
nt|kastan88: how many tricks have N 5, 6, 7? what to do with S hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: medal for that for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we see ace setting tricks not always cashed today|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6-12 what option do they have but to raise?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: the teoretically correct way to play that suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|m_niemi: or biddable, but makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: they have an option to play a sensible bidding system|pg||
nt|mcphee: S more likely the player that erred going to game NV with flat 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe but the system and the way it was handled contradict basic principles of the game im not going to mince words here|pg||
nt|mcphee: W is about to be delighted to find the opps want to play in his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: from the frying pan into the fire now|pg||

mb|p|nt|jakow: Rather strickt by Conv card!|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Open Room replicated the 1NT-3NT auction on board 6|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting, both not wanting to miss an early Vul game|pg||
nt|sharynr: but they did|pg||
nt|gavin: his low heart play would work any time hearts were 3-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north forced to give east a spade trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4H + 2C+1D\|pg||
nt|gowdy: ruff a @C draw trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes john|pg||
nt|susieq: the cards are definitely going East-West this set|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@H both majors?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E thinks his hand is too good for an old fashioned 3@d bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes shows both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: he needed to keep his ace of hearts in his hand for an entry to draw trumps after he leads up towards his jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so always makes if declarer plays right|pg||
nt|raghavan: a part score deal I hope EW do not jump to game in a Major|pg||
nt|chorush: there was no flannery. what would he be upset about?|pg||
nt|starkist: chugging contest|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: in that case 2@S by east can be natural or artificial, you need to discuss a defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is S worth an immediate 4@S?|pg||
nt|gavin: very tough hand will be interesting to see the line in the other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 10-1 somebody bids game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Obviously he thinks so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe too strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S AND 4@H are both feasible|pg||
nt|gavin: unlikely he will leave them there|pg||
nt|gavin: 7-4 white vs red|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green does not have to accept transfer|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will reject transfer and bid 3S|pg||
nt|rlebi: wrong sided for @Ss already|pg||
nt|rlebi: better stay low for a plus|pg||
nt|starkist: canoe race|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 5@D in big trouble|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 5@c is better, best defence can get 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: must be a @h lead for 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: anything else is 500|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to lead a @H fromS, @S the obvious lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club ruff and heart heart switch works also|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont believe you can gain a trick by claiming if it is impossible to  make it....and in that defense they could not make a mistake?|pg||
nt|caitlin: best to lead trump|pg||
nt|starkist: snowball fight|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharynr: will any director out there agree?|pg||
nt|rlebi: sry, dreaming here|pg||
nt|glen: could declarer draw all the trumps and pick up @Ds?|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. just lose to the @D ace if guesses suit right|pg||
nt|rlebi: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S presumably no singleton and extras, and for that hand he is close to minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not clear, but more likely daniel ducked heart|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hoping declarer would play the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: or S and switch|pg||
nt|gowdy: coffee time |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast they may bid slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs three diamonds so percentage is finesse of queen|pg||
mb|3D|nt|capercliff: yes that works as well Martin|pg||
nt|capercliff: no doub!!!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: I guess that is what happened martin, since daniel apologized|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: must be joking|pg||
mb|3N|nt|capercliff: guess he didnt think he was taking even 1 @s trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was the problem with 4@S, did not invite partner to participate|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he did open|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb...barbecue going:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: or at least try for it|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 S  strong H raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: if Hanna is going to bid it should be 4@S|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S = he skipped a @H cuebid, since minimum for 3@S|pg||
nt|rlebi: he didnt bid 4@s,did he?|pg||
nt|glen: the question is whether he plays serious 3NT or not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have based on hand overall minimum|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 3@S was expected|pg||
nt|caitlin: a splinter with 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|gowdy: no 3S artifical|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh|pg||
nt|gowdy: smolen|pg||
nt|caitlin: smolen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a splinter, can be balanced or singleton spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or perhaps unspecified splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT asks for a second suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just in case partner has both majors|pg||
nt|rlebi: not too many imps gonna swing on this one|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gambit: trump switch?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe heart to king now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many ways to play that bid|pg||
nt|rlebi: running low on boards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: NV vs vul, shows 8 major cards and a lot of hope :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: from N's perspective his partner is weak for 4@s|pg||
nt|raghavan: If at all I have to bid - I will bid 4S - He has 2 Spades but no guarentee that E will have 2 Hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: serious 3nt would help a lot on this specific auction|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not sure what turner signal meant|pg||
nt|bbramley: will the bridge cops let them finish?|pg||
nt|starkist: flash suggested tree climb good for that area|pg||
nt|rlebi: there is a precedent for that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: hughes knows the entries wrong for trump leads|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah i think a trump lead on the go was best from his hand|pg||
nt|gavin: when partner bids vul against not , its very likely he was bidding to make|pg||
nt|gambit: Diamond to the queen/ King...then trump from my good friend, David Turner |pg||
nt|caitlin: Welcome gambit (Cam French)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is the Canadian Society of Commentators CSofC:)|pg||
nt|gambit: TY Caitlin great to see my compatriots competing|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed|pg||
nt|rlebi: l'ecuyer could slow down the pace - while in the lead - run em out of time|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|gowdy: yes 3 of the other major after 2c and a major response is artifical showing the strongest support raise |pg||
nt|fabsayc: here comes an imp|pg||
nt|bbramley: close matches automatically slow down at the end - and why not? when you KNOW it's close you grind out every imp|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gavin: in fact his only chance on this hand is to actually draw trumps then eventually guess clubs|pg||
nt|caitlin: end of first period 0-0 btw|pg||
nt|gavin: thx|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|gavin: he was hoping to see singleton jack of hearts so he could go over to dummy to lead clubs up twice (once with heart and once with diamond)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gambit: what does he pitch? all cards have a value....|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: so 1100 turned into 400|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gavin: this play would have him make the contract if kjx of diamonds were onside|pg||
nt|gambit: club|pg||
nt|gambit: and spade exit|pg||
nt|gavin: the play doenst matter much at this point he will just lose 2 clubs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gavin: one goes on diamond ace and one ruffed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bbramley: i think they should allow some extra time in the last stanza of a match|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|caitlin: spade now |pg||
nt|gavin: now if hughest plays a diamond declarer wont lose another club|pg||
nt|starkist: lets petition for it|pg||
nt|rlebi: the directors get hungry, thats what matters, doesn't it?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: he wouldn't|pg||

mb|p|nt|cenglund:  So the board was turned 90 degrees?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Excellent result|pg||
nt|cenglund:  But the play was sloppy|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 12 more to fin, from 1ntX-4 board|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: 2@S or 3@H????????|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cenglund:  They must strike it out|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: from "wrong" hand - 6NT making|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: he did, at some point|pg||
nt|jakow: Avery tricky 3NT to bid!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 37 Finns made 4@h in open room, +11|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: well perhaps she was right to go up: it was the setting trick |pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 5 level many play that A denies K|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so declarer missguessed the @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H seems damp too surely a clear pass assuming double was penalty|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cenglund:  This board is no good for a strong club opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably would fail in practice buut not a bad contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: here lebensohl is often used|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n the safe and obvious spot|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard now for the N hand|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT = good @s-raise?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another straightforward and therefore relatively boring hand|pg||
nt|haans: i do not know what 3@S show|pg||
nt|roswolf: will they get to slam?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: running scores:http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/res/results/o/bm10.html|pg||

nt|haans: i have done the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: can EW find 6NT?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcphee: I just bid 3N as N rather than dble|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandably north has made tyhesafest sensible bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, very awkward bidding problem for N |pg||
nt|haans: suprise passing???????|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = 0-7, 1@h = @h or bal?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cenglund:  Slam depends on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: hand is too good to bid only 2n partner would pass with two many hads where 3n was laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happesn this isnt one of them |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: best is to now cash @D A and see what takes place|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they know about controls - have they the tricks?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in other room sequence will be 1@s-3@s-?|pg||
nt|haans: N have 1 spade and @CA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|asig: No problems here making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: when east sees dummy hell be regretting the lead but sighing with relief when he find sthat declarer has a stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make on the dim position|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kastan88: but what else here to open, if 1@C means  all hands 15+? you can't open other way|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cenglund:  Slam is slightly over 50%, since Q singelton off-side makes as well|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h = 20+, 2NT = raise with single, 3@c = ask, 3@d = single @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT = 4441, with black single|pg||
nt|haans: fair|pg||
pc|sT|nt|m_niemi: this is easy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: from the West-hand 6NT sh be as good as 6@Cs (also in CR)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have thought east hand worth an upgrade to 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done Rimstedt and SjÃ¶berg. Deserved swing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, brilliantly bid|pg||
nt|pelu: the danish woman-team are going to Brazil (Venice Cup) and they are on the 1. step of training - 1 month physical! - the tecnik comes next month :):)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: this not of coutrse a bad line if the trumps were breaking normally that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: would virtually guarantee the contract but declarer in for a nasty shock|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then its only a push after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: iceland dont appear to be getting the breaks they need|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|cenglund:  Thet's very true, but two-suiters are vulnerable against high-level pre-empts|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 4@S makeable|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe is not forcing |pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 4@D if fit showing|pg||
nt|gavin: interesting choice in the other room to bid garbage stayman with this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D or 6NT cold|pg||
nt|raghavan: should bid 2S |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Courtesy raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna may get shut out now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and preemptive|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2S only |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S or some mixed raise|pg||
nt|rlebi: they will open E hand at other table|pg||
nt|glen: sure, but 1 hour from now|pg||
nt|rlebi: 2:00 am?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|susieq: right yes|pg||
nt|starkist: 2pm for a casino is kinda strict|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: ive never rlly thought of doing it on a 3352|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: yes even better|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems just plain weird|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really garbage stayman, intent is to pass any rebid|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky entry to diamonds with a heart|pg||
nt|gavin: isnt that what garbage stayman is ? sry if i missspoke|pg||
nt|caitlin: well Gavin I call it that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: KCB will identify a possible loser, so no 7|pg||
nt|gavin: this is a baby slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3nt here is a brick   4 H is in some trouble|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is away from the city so does not disturb anybody|pg||
nt|susieq: 2am is too... here they never close|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|gavin: and easy to avoid 7 as martin said|pg||
nt|gavin: but its definitely good practise to play 6NT|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 imps better and safer|pg||
nt|gavin: 2 imps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by N|pg||
nt|rlebi: big potential  swing hand here|pg||
nt|rlebi: very easy to get to nonmaking Slam |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: 5@H too expensive a sacrifice|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3nt only makes because diamonds blocked and club jack onside, single dummy 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D blocked  le tthem set them up  3nt is on the J or no club lead|pg||
nt|starkist: we play this position 10-12, cowards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|caitlin: but I know many WC Cohen Gitelman Bergen etc who call it takeout of 2C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: complications now|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oh oh|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharynr: drury auction,, should be a making contract|pg||
nt|gavin: spec points out east hand so strong for 4M that maybe its too strong to open 1NT, tough decision|pg||
nt|rlebi: very easy|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|capercliff: if the @c honors were split it wouldnt|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not realistic I think|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gavin: in the effort to getting to 6NT it would have been better for him to bid 3S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gavin: to hear from partner that they have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|gavin: he did what he did to find out about the king of spades i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i dont like any of these bids|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction calls for a trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: garbage stayman to me is when you rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek described an entirely different hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not in slam so no finesse|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|gavin: cool i just figured ur bidding stayman with garbage either way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops, hoping partner gets in|pg||
nt|bbramley: potential double-part-score swing here - joey avoided giving the 7th trick with a @D, but now declarer is home|pg||

nt|fabsayc: like gavin said, i dont agree with 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: the problem that happened here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless 4@H can be a singleton, but that does not make sense|pg||
nt|gavin: was his partner didnt bid 2NT over 2D|pg||
nt|gavin: so he really has no idea how good his hearts are|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: pittsburg|pg||
nt|gavin: i have complete sympathy in the auction he created for himself why he chose to end in 6D over 6NT|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 35 in majors with 9 count perhaps|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: what do you suggest Bob?|pg||

mb|p|nt|cenglund:  The gadget lets the contract to be played from the right side|pg||
nt|fabsayc: out of control auction|pg||
nt|jakow: Somethin strange with th double of 1H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs partner to cover 3 losers, surely then north would bid more than 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: instead its the greaqt danes in a little trouble 3n easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: however weight of cards is a factor here |pg||
nt|asig: I think this should make, though|pg||
nt|asig: Not many losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims favourable so u lose 2 or 3 tump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: still makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: just not the most elegant looking contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: !!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: there should be 2 tricks more in @h to than NT, that's not likely => 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: chicken|pg||

nt|lestergold: and here another 5 card suit too|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kastan88: yes, from S hand down with @S lead|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 4@S went down on diamond queen lead where leader had 10xxx in spades|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gavin: would get very lucky to make|pg||
nt|gavin: pass pass double i predict|pg||
nt|raghavan: Grand slam on a finesse will they bid or stop in 6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: result not horrible, ew were making 4@D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: 2@C majors, so hughes avoids spades|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Lots of big @D fits in this set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nickell 38 jacobs 25 in US2|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|gavin: ok double |pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: W has a very good hand for 1N, almost too strong|pg||
nt|raghavan: martin agreed but he need not waste his S K|pg||
nt|rlebi: onwards to game now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually 2@S would be forcing, but grainger a passed hand|pg||
nt|glen: yes, and does a @H lead from W set up the 4th trick?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nt range?|pg||
nt|bbramley: a normal unlucky game here|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 11-13|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gavin: wow!!!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S crowds the auction|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gavin: 3S!!!!|pg||
nt|raghavan: w = 4H|pg||
nt|gowdy: x|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 22, E-W in 3N in OR|pg||
nt|caitlin: here in 2@S|pg||
nt|starkist: easier to bid other table playing 12 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this looks down 3|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to overtake to play a club, easy play|pg||
nt|gavin: to overtake|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to decide wheather to play hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|gavin: seems like u can see that if u start hearts their club losers can go away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somehow silver made 6nt on 23|pg||
nt|gavin: very rare that u will need to take heart ruff and u dont get clubs back as a trade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which looks impossible unless a club opening lead|pg||
nt|gavin: a club lead is impossible|pg||
nt|gavin: but playing 6nt over 6s seems bizarre|pg||
nt|gavin: and a club lead vs 6s is impossible as well|pg||
nt|gavin: ok so the lecuyer team actually leads by 26|pg||
nt|fabsayc: impossible no. just strange|pg||
nt|raghavan: now go for slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not easy from here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: far from easy|pg||
nt|gowdy: Hi guys   I think 2@S was 3 controls|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Gowdy:))|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome home|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam yes, but finding what is needed for 7 a headache|pg||
nt|caitlin: are you home?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I missed you:))|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: Gowdy and I teach together|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi John|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even tougher if controls|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is John Gowdy a World Class expert who has coached every type of Canadian team|pg||
nt|glen: no, it looks like just 3 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: looks like it was E that was thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this has worked nicely|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Low @H lead beats it|pg||
nt|gavin: 7 card suit for me is game opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|gavin: no matter how bad my hand is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 3@C game forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: repeated diamond leads would beat this hand i think|pg||
nt|glen: swing to Carruthers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that hanna has any reason to find that defense|pg||
nt|glen: so 12+13|pg||
nt|glen: on boards 6+7|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: robinson 83 fleisher 33 in USA1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has 9 runners|pg||
nt|capercliff: or small @h next?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|caitlin: oh no|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes if controls in @C they are useless|pg||
nt|caitlin: that helps Hanna|pg||
nt|raghavan: w = 5D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes now he knows his controls are working|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bid deliberately to push board?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin: impossible because i know how they play|pg||
nt|gowdy: we E after 5D may could be off AK of S|pg||
nt|glen: and the 7NT board up next at the other table|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he might make wo a c lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: Not after @H9 played|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah could be GF 3C bid|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes always stiff|pg||
nt|capercliff: 10 if small @h|pg||
nt|gavin: i grew up with david and dan playing junior bridge|pg||
nt|starkist: they got to slam obviously, down with the club finesse off|pg||
nt|gavin: david my oldest regular partner|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi guys|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gowdy: but  now 5@S|pg||
nt|mittmouse: niv|pg||
pc|sK|nt|starkist: shaky|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|gavin: now jh|pg||
nt|gavin: to get out of the way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, else down 2|pg||
nt|gavin: or else they will be unable to seperate them later|pg||
nt|gavin: standout play|pg||
nt|gavin: jurek knows that darren doesnt have the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|gavin: fromt he 8 return|pg||
nt|mittmouse: nice play|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|rlebi: 4@S here is a great result|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes no defense now|pg||
nt|starkist: oh|pg||
nt|rlebi: 8 @s better|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gowdy: so well bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: controls identified now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mittmouse: much better|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: oh maybe i am wrong|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharynr: sorry, been on the phone|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|caitlin: then Turner MIGHT cue @CK|pg||
nt|rlebi: the partys .... over ???|pg||
nt|starkist: back in the dumper|pg||
nt|mittmouse: 10 imps to lecuyer running out of boards|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: heart ruff diamond back, heart|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: next :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i did last weeks dishes :)|pg||
nt|glen: ruffs next @H with @S T|pg||
nt|glen: cashes @S K|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no still ok|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: ok, careful defense to win 5|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mittmouse: ithink both defenders were wrong silver should have played 8 of s and carruthers should have played a club back anyways|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c4|pc|h4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Looking for board 12 - maybe at other table|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: slight break in the action :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 7 imps to Carruthers on 7 - chipping away at the lead|pg||
nt|caitlin: rehi Gowdy|pg||
nt|rlebi: therefore they are a well matched pair|pg||
nt|mittmouse: right|pg||
nt|starkist: voids the arguement|pg||
nt|bbramley: if declarer had the @CA and enough tricks to make he wouldn't have ducked at trick 1|pg||

nt|lestergold: and all the clubs went into the skip in 3n they would have had a better future|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H a make|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think that in the open room NS plays 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: good slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pelu: easy 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next matches in 1 hour and 20 minutes are Norway v Finland and Denmark v Iceland, both from the open series|pg||
mb|2C|nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 12-16 unbal or 15-17 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: 2@d = 8-11 5+ @d unbal|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no M|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so like 2@d opening|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the kind of hand where the 1@C can potentially cause problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w ge the straightforward hand now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: 1NT= 13-15(16)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mcphee: perhaps N sould consider raising 1N|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no problems any more|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: this is a rather solid 14 she holds|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 8+, 5+@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: do you know that you can se all hands you have seen in BBO? go to c:\Bridge Base Online\hands\yr bbo name|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: S had a hard choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: normally 1NT response indicates a better hand than this poor 6 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im in favour of aggressive take out doubles but with north's minimum bad spade suit an stiff diamond, i would not make this bid here very dangerous vul aginsty not|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would not dble as N either|pg||
nt|kastan88: in this part of Earth (East europa) we play that mostly 6..10, so I can't see reason to raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: let pard balance if east passes also much too much in heasrts|pg||
nt|lestergold: zip outside hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: 8-11, 7-10 range is more in tune here in NA|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like 8-11 a lot|pg||
nt|mcphee: however I make ligth t/o dble with the right shapes|pg||
nt|haans: you can see what happened at other table|pg||
nt|m_niemi: some alerts missing?|pg||
nt|haans: sylvan-gustawsson bid as per old carrots clubs|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S 3@C natural|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt did show 5 spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the contract|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@d= nat, 3@h = stopper|pg||
nt|m_niemi: sry, 2NT = 5+ @h|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: sorry i didnt see the first triick was distracted bgy breakfast appearing|pg||
nt|mcphee: 9@D lead the K winning onm table|pg||
nt|mcphee: and poor S wants to leave the room now!|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1N she asks, why did I bid so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: so do i please ignore my comments i took my eye off te ball dues to  PLATE OF SAUSAGES EGGS AND CHIPS APPEARING|pg||
nt|mcphee: no kippers?|pg||
nt|lestergold: provided by my der bridge widow|pg||
nt|kastan88: bon appetite|pg||
nt|lestergold: she doesnt like the smelll of kippers but i love em|pg||
nt|mcphee: delivery, back when done|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S asked singel?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: this must be a kind of asking bid - west thought so !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no need to use Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: some change there|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: a different auction but the same landing spot|pg||

pc|cA|nt|haans: old carrots is 40 years|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: not all chopped herring here|pg||

nt|asig: have to go now, see you later|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d A and @dK and crossruff|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: profitable save if he can get out for -3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: this is a silly contract and clearly the system has a serious flaw|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: with the clubs both offside and the spade losers needing to be ruffed not laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get diamond right|pg||
nt|roswolf: trick 1 was interesting though|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N was too aggressive in this board|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I think it's just bad judgement|pg||
nt|m_niemi: against 8-11 that is not so great hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: S can get a @H ruff, but it's still 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: the lead gives a @H-ruff - but cost a @C-trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: j of spades on tabel rather than another dim|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|m_niemi: claim|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: initial trump lead would have meant down 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannt afford any more club finesses|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
mc|10|nt|xenya: but, of course, S switches to a trump, which means -4 |pg||

nt|sharynr: it looks like my Bd 22 prediction was right at least.|pg||
nt|caitlin: but with long spades not much else probably happier to bid 4|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is not a commanding lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: ya  and that was going to be my team till it was not :(|pg||
nt|rlebi: wk nt|pg||
nt|glen: btw I'm watching the other room with the Chrome browser, and BBO (Fred, Uday etc.) have done great work supporting multiple browers - BBO is very fast in google's browser Chrome|pg||
nt|bbramley: 30 imps, 5 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: looks like the defense can hold this to 4 with a spade lead|pg||
nt|gavin: 4H looks like a pretty good spot, as does 5D but it looks like nothing can make|pg||
nt|raghavan: a dangerous hand for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: may land in 6H with bad results|pg||
nt|mcarroll: very true|pg||
nt|gowdy: now this " slam"  won't be as much fun|pg||
nt|mcarroll: their best suit fit is full of holes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|5C|nt|gavin: though the diamonds look like a standout from south, leavin north up to cashing the ace of spades when he gets in with the ace of hearts or it goes away|pg||
nt|rlebi: how many???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two way stayman|pg||
nt|bbramley: can E/W get to 3NT?|pg||
nt|bbramley: not any more!|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: north must have underlead spade when in with heart ace|pg||
nt|glen: 1NT is 12-14, 2@D game forcing stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact ew in the open room freely bid themselves to 5, lucky to survive|pg||
nt|caitlin: @DQ led and then declarer claimed it seems???|pg||
nt|gavin: though unlucky to catch AD opposite void|pg||
nt|gavin: specs suggesting 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt will make|pg||
nt|caitlin: So Czyz is from Ottawa|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not the Roland F wor?>|pg||
nt|raghavan: No they may stop in 4H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6NT is better but down also|pg||
nt|caitlin: capitol of Canada|pg||
nt|gowdy: Is this flannery  or weak with Majors |pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H shows 5-4 or vul 5-5|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is some strong 2@H bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|rlebi: the answer was 3|pg||
nt|gambit: other table 5c -1 |pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: or operator missed auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: good spot|pg||
nt|gavin: seems hard to unravvel your tricks but i guess they end up just coming to you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 44 possible not vul|pg||
nt|caitlin: not necessarily so weak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It will be very hard for S to stop in game opposite an opening bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: going out on a limb and predicting this will make in under 5 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you believe that story?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: they claimed very fast|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gowdy the teacher may approve  that having another Major- I should not pre empt. Also here N has 11 points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the best one we have seen|pg||
nt|caitlin: no 2@H shows both majors|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh are they playing Flannery?|pg||
nt|caitlin: either 5-4 or vul 5-5 or non vul could even be 4-4|pg||
nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not Flannery, is called Ekren in Europe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the winning amount|pg||
nt|rlebi: oops|pg||
nt|rlebi: just right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|capercliff: N/S playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|glen: so he drops 2@Ss, 2@Hs, and ummm?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|gowdy: if 2 D shows a bad weak two  then 2 H shows a very good one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharynr: i think you are right!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a bit harder from south seat|pg||
nt|gavin: yeh seems fine to win in either hand and knock out the king of diamonds, eventually u just cash your tricks and exit with a heart and the defense will be forced to give you your ...|pg||
nt|gavin: club and spade trick in dummy|pg||
nt|bbramley: on their way to 300|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: 2@C can be singleton, 2@D rebid promises 4|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes, 2c can be 2 or more|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4531 i think would rebid 2@C also|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: at least i think that's Wolpert just said :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: why? North wins HA can play SA|pg||
nt|caitlin: ooooooops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: here we go|pg||
nt|raghavan: Putting head under a sword?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: misplaced major jack, else a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: this should be double key card     6 key card  4 aces and 2 major suit kings|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wonder if this is asking re: 5 controls for hearts and spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6 I mean:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be double key card, not clear which suit is agreed|pg||
nt|caitlin: hearts|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gavin: after the 1D opening bid, south definitely should not lead a diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or underlead it for the set|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to pick from his doubletons|pg||
nt|gowdy: 11 to 13 |pg||
nt|caitlin: ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed vul against not with defense no reason to bid 4|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: he did not cash SA|pg||
nt|gavin: wrong one , now cyz has to cash ace of spades to hold to 5 |pg||
nt|gavin: fly ace|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact north should fly ace of hearts and play a club|pg||
nt|caitlin: on this lead clubs going nowhere nor hearts for defense..more likely to cash out|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Gavin?|pg||
nt|caitlin: this could be singleton?|pg||
nt|gavin: cause of the lead ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe in 4 that isnt such a winning defence since the club ruff would be 3rd trick, he needs a spade honor from partner to beat|pg||
nt|gavin: so might as well hope its kx and thats why partner was afraid to lead it|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is 5@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they get to 6@H E will be very careful not to double in case they run to a making 6NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: what does 5S mean |pg||
nt|glen: bonus for operator: play will be quick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: on this type of auction clubs often the weakest suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if responder has club fit would tend to rebid 2@S not 2nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: Wolpert taking his time with this one|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will overtake and finesse I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some minor communication issues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On a @C lead will succeed if the !Q is played, which is I think the correct technical play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a surprise this, a @c from the east hand cant hurt him|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needs to pitch a diamond if 3rd heart lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: i hear the fat lady warming up ..|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|capercliff: assuming he overtakes and finesses the @d again|pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: Martin you are right as always|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is good to read the Hobbit trilogy|pg||
nt|raghavan: I maeant NO DOUBLE|pg||
nt|caitlin: for sure no double|pg||
nt|caitlin: you never know if 6N will make which it does not here|pg||
nt|glen: in the other room, on board 8, they are also using the Green convention|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: director has been called|pg||
nt|glen: what for i wonder?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: a spade back would be embarassing if jack wrong|pg||
nt|mcarroll: small @H from N at trick 2 would have worked|pg||
nt|capercliff: yah and when @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4-2 sry|pg||
nt|capercliff: if the K@c was wrong he could go off now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Would have 4@H,3@D 1@C and 1@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtaking with the J at trick one was 100%|pg||
nt|gowdy: 9 @C  and the @H now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gavin: very thoughtfull play|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
mc|9|nt|glen: maybe its zero tolerance, as they have zero chance of beating the doubled contract|pg||

nt|m_niemi: so 6@c or 5@c+4@d|pg||
nt|haans: five clubs no majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: but promises in hcp? 8-11?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: but only if N hold-up with @DK x!|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make whout @C lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a hand for getting too high on here|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php  for this match soon|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not -3 still|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl 2nt now?|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-fit makes 4@H - on small values - a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S now might prevent that|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|m_niemi: so tie is the best Fin can score|pg||
nt|pelu: but again - I dont like 1NT with a solid major 5 card suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East has good hand, double 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass seems automatic|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have matti|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if w has 6 c m, there should be good spot for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am not sure south has any legitmate other choice here - 4@S WONT MAKE OPPOSITE A PASSED PARD|pg||
nt|m_niemi: on @d lead 4@s makes|pg||
nt|pelu: but is the pause by S who or West |pg||
nt|pelu: for sure W will lead his singleton @C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: move @dK to @sK, how many tricks in @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume screens are in use - in which case west may be considering bidding over 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h=ms|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: S plays a @H, if W discards a@D, S cashes @DK and plays another @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel 6d looks v good|pg||
nt|pelu: both!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah both thinking!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: minors|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: 3@C must have been transfer 4@C natural|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@s = ASK|pg||
nt|m_niemi: tx Sue|pg||
nt|haans: were they on the winning team last nordics?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: wow aggressive!! both of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lucky no double|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a hopeless spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: may even make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course every finesse in sight works|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: will require a defence worthy of that aginst the israelie raid on entebbe|pg||
nt|lestergold: and yes it may happen|pg||
nt|pelu: ok -100 against 140 :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D is just too undisciplined for me pard did bid 1nt and so has defence|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S is a super accept but W is not interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: but plenty of play even on a less favouravle layout|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As the cards lie  - yes, but 2 of 3 finesses is needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: its better than that Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: because played bu south with the spade protected the fourth heart will take care of possibloe spade loser so whenever club finesse is right its a very good contract and has chances ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when clubs finess is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland mandatory and porbably in the region of upwards of 50% in any case|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 16+, 1@d = 0-7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: clubs ruff beat it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|m_niemi: 3@h= 3cards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: her 2N was just a further transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: S need to take the @C-trick in on @HA|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus all the possible helpful leads too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @d in on N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 is makeable, though maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: the standing it 30-0 + board 20 where Denmark can loose many IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: always seems to me that their last bid is a punt|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cenglund:  3NT would have been cold, but this is more difficult, but should make on good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like a very resonable spot to this bozo|pg||
nt|haans: suprise|pg||
nt|kaapo: Score updates from the women's at http://www.bridgefinland.com/NM2009/res/bmsc.php|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cenglund:  Heart suit is blocked now|pg||
nt|pelu: @C now!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @h7 = suit pref to @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: could well be|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will do the right thing i am sure|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N should have led a high @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: from that bad suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has a real problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: he certainly hasnt been helped by his pard|pg||
nt|pelu: N coudn't help here - only tell that he has 3-card @H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I don't think that S needs N's count in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a suit preference situation|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 43 Finns in 3Nt in the other room as I predicted|pg||
nt|pelu: so another 6 IMPs for Finland|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not made yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: the more he thinks the more likely he is to get it wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: "all" way lead to 9 trivcks :(|pg||
nt|pelu: @CK - come on Gregers :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 9 tricks => :) not :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|pelu: I try again : @CK - @CK - :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: on a @c lead the slam is cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north wont object to the lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|cenglund:  Draw trumps and continue diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Bob stop compimenting urself|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its a perfectly normal lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: sorry could resist it!!|pg||
nt|mcphee: not really, I like bidding a game like this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|m_niemi: wish to hear how he decided to play @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: claim|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pelu: the count in @H = declayers ditribution - West is favorit to 7 card @D = 2-3-7-1|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: cards are lying very badly for decalrer -- likely -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do against weak defender|pg||
nt|mcphee: vul I think it is imperative you reach game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: but its absoutely a dreadful contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 4-1 trumps makes it hard|pg||
nt|lestergold: favourable spade position dims 3/3 fav lead etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: and still work to do|pg||
nt|mcphee: even with a @C lead this is not so horrid, 3-3 @D comes in as well|pg||
mc|11|nt|cenglund:  Oops!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a poor 4/4 trump fit misfitting side suit combs and a shotage f high card points- its a part score hand|pg||
pg||
qx|c29|st||md|3SAQ5HQ65DK762CJT6,S873HT843DACQ9532,SKT9HAKJ92DT8CAK8,SJ642H7DQJ9543C74|sv|b|nt|fabsayc: MAYBE!!|pg||
nt|gavin: so the actual score is 135-97|pg||
nt|fabsayc: push|pg||
nt|glen: could have been a misplayed card|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: I still wish I knew what 5@S response to 4N was|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphznx: they were discussing that here a bit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more than he had?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna seems to hold hearts a lot:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I also want to know what 5S is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Carruthers got another 5 imps on board 7|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S  E-W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H, does not fit any other overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: everyone agree with 2S?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by North?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is ok|pg||
nt|gavin: with 4 boards to go in the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe hanna should cash diamond before returning the club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure which way denies the club doubleton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: penalty card in hearts maybe|pg||
nt|glen: poor other table, when they try to work that out|pg||
nt|glen: 1 hour from now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey tough enough here|pg||
nt|bbramley: slam on 2 finesses, or 1 finesse and a miracle @D guess|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|gavin: wolpert bid 1NT here because he didnt think he was good enough for 2H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3@H also ok|pg||
nt|gavin: aggressive 4S bid|pg||
nt|gavin: rlly hate that bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gavin: and instead of risking his partner raising 1S to 2S and playing the wrong fit, he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|gavin: on that lead declarer will likely go 2 down, take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|bbramley: but only 30 HCP and no extra shape - it's a bad slam and normal to stay out of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Seemingly W cannot pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 800 possible|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt i would want to ever pass 3nt|pg||
nt|gavin: though the defense will need to cash their tricks int he right order|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room Joey opened 2@D and auction crowded opponents|pg||
nt|caitlin: can set up hearts to make 4S|pg||
nt|glen: btw board 8 is a push in 7NT, unless misplayed now|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@C blocking bid but sometimes taken seriously|pg||
nt|gavin: easy to allow them to escape for 1 down by trying to cash 2 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would be a better contract if north had 2 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: the A  then the 9  the green plays the last @H|pg||
nt|glen: nope, claim eliminated misplay chance|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: he can pass, and will when happy to see opponents bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe more|pg||
nt|starkist: omg|pg||
nt|caitlin: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@H is weird|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess 1@S can be a four card suit for them|pg||
nt|gowdy: normal   canadian  hmmm |pg||
nt|starkist: it's the exchange rate|pg||
nt|bbramley: north must be worth another try, assuming that 2@C was GF|pg||
nt|gracelin: both 6H / 6NT forced to make on DQ lead :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, private|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|bbramley: any time, patrick :)|pg||
nt|starkist: 4n coming|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hearts so much better here|pg||
nt|starkist: 13 imps|pg||
nt|gavin: better but still grim|pg||
nt|gavin: here it is no play|pg||
nt|gavin: like most of the time|pg||
nt|gavin: he is not playing with someone who is afraid to bid|pg||
nt|mittmouse: club back is best then 3 down|pg||
nt|gavin: needs a pure 3S bid to have hope|pg||
nt|susieq: when in doubt, claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this does have a play of sorts, but will fail|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Very lucky with the @C position|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: needs miracles including clubs 2-2 onside i believe|pg||
nt|capercliff: so long as N goes low with a @c|pg||
nt|capercliff: if N doesnt play small it will come in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmmmm|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice auction|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if he gets to 6 withqof d lead and he ducks and w returns the 9 of clubs he may still go down playing for a squeeze|pg||
pc|d5|nt|glen: also when in 7NT, claim|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: hey there fish...you finished in Open?|pg||
nt|caitlin: missed opportunity|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok i claim 5@C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: still losers in diamond to deal with|pg||
nt|gowdy: rebidding your 7 card suit ?  not so so thats bad|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still gaining imps however|pg||
nt|caitlin: true|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sharynr: sorry folks....gotta make dinner. Enjoy|pg||
nt|starkist: they ran out of hands|pg||
nt|caitlin: Carruthers team is going to have their work cut out this eve|pg||
nt|rlebi: 12 tricks now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin: hard hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: and that is the name of the game|pg||
nt|caitlin: so far 18 vs 9 IMPs to L'Ecuyer|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mittmouse: 4 down|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: right but 2@H is going nowhere with a promising hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gavin: south had a tough problem, conflicting rules|pg||
nt|gavin: most often when you have a 4-4 fit and a 5-3 fit you want to play the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gavin: though from the bidding there was a good chance his partner was 6-4, and with such bad spades it hink he made the wrong decision|pg||
nt|mittmouse: no 3|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hanna will make 3 only|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gavin: 135-107|pg||
pc|hK|nt|caitlin: and use 5-3 to dump losers if possible|pg||
nt|gavin: here north didnt even introduce spades|pg||
nt|rlebi: 37 imps with 3 boards|pg||
mc|12|nt|harmon: Hey everyone|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 13 to fin, this is the 5@h-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a delicate hand for a change|pg||
nt|m_niemi: the point is where is decl's top honour|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: board 8: +3 to Swe, they played 4@d -4!, this table 5@cX-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a real slam lets see how they bid this|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: other table 41h+1|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kastan88: Welcome, Tjolpe (Sven-Olov Flodqvist)!|pg||
nt|mcphee: N was marginal for 3@H true|pg||
nt|haans: Big Clubs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h+1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: propably N has both and decl KJxxxxx in @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mcphee: I think this has a lot to do with the neg dble showing 4@H for them|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Looks like the Icelanders are getting a hiding|pg||
nt|pelu: X = a takeout of @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is what he has!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@d= non forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: REALLY NON -FORCING - MAMA MIA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: ok last board :) - I hope that the connections will be better in next round|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They missed a cold game in hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D is max for EW|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finns scored 6 imp from 3NT mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT by S|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|mcphee: although 3@H is aggressive, if the S hands values are outside of @S it is not so bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but sometimes opps preempt you or if south expectsb pard to show 4 hts however minimum she is then she did not have here 4h raise you cant have it both ways|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: and to reach a close game vul at imps is good|pg||
nt|lestergold: desperation pushin i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might consider axing this|pg||
nt|pelu: no not in IMP - prob down 1 = 100/530|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will EW score their 3 @s tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcphee: S should not pass 2@S out in any case, and will dble again and now N should be considering 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is the question|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: no|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no punt so far|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: on th elead this will not pose an unsurmountable problem|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: well i know east is a passed hand but west is surely too good to only bid 2h|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: amazing that south isnt contemplating a grand with all those controls|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@s would have been very minimum raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h showed some values|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another good board for the Finns|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|xenya: S has to play a @D back now -- breaking communications -- difficult|pg||
nt|xenya: she has to read the situation perfectly well to do so|pg||
nt|haans: not nice for finland|pg||
pc|h8|nt|m_niemi: Kx,Axxxxx,Kx,Axx vs. nf bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you cant bid 6@D here then you really should change your methods|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: decl will have to fight for it|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E should have bid once more with 4th trump|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: even with the wasted Ks as a value this 4h is a much better contract thatn the last one for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: has his sisth tricvk only needs to find a 7th may even find an eight|pg||
nt|pelu: I was too slow - as always :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|cenglund:  In my book opening 1NT with this hand is out of question |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes their conservative approach has scored a few goals in this match|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|mcphee: indeed it is, I think personally W should have made a t/o dbl;e|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly e/w do not need to bid out of desperation but cant afford to miss good games- leads get reversed this way|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: now ill make 8|pg||

pc|s6|pg||

nt|starkist: 2@c is majors, shd survive|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and expect to survive|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcbruce:  This would be a good time to thank the commentators and the operators, who did a good job for us for two days!|pg||

nt|rlebi: a little rich i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is why i said double was shakey, is really at bottom end in tricks|pg||

pc|s3|nt|caitlin: hey Detroit is on a power play|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Club return causes problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed will still need to guess diamonds now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Has to hope that D!A is right|pg||
pc|c5|nt|harmon: GO BREWERS|pg||
nt|caitlin: Gowdy how come there are no results for Seniors?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or queen|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1c-1h-2d (West coast Polish convention showing balanced 18-19)|pg||
nt|starkist: thanks Roland/BBO/CBF|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|caitlin: sorry Hobart vs Jotcham|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|gavin: west can see without any entries to dummy that he might aswell lead clubs out of his hand|pg||
nt|glen: yes, otherwise known as no hope in heck|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rlebi: will Jim find the winnining return?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|capercliff: you cant always have 4-4 fits in the majors|pg||
nt|gavin: normally you would like to lead up towards the kq a couple times|pg||
nt|caitlin: which proves fruitful|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he did|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: 2h rebid (my hand sucks) - ok then 2s not forcing- thanks partner|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|gowdy: well n's 8 is suit pref for H  as opposed to netural  so it is gueesable  |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|gavin: with the 9 showing in north|pg||
nt|gavin: west carefully protected his 3rd club trick by leading low from his hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now a safety play|pg||
nt|gavin: 2nd rather|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: but will cost an imp or two|pg||
nt|starkist: pitt scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lost an imp not cashing the spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but had hanna ducked this would be very interesting|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gavin: 9 tricks secured with 1 spade 3 hearts 3 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he already has to assume heart ace right|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mittmouse: well i think 3h is the right bid if it just shows a lot of hearts and no cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as it should, with power you go thru 2NT|pg||
nt|starkist: i agree if it shows that|pg||
nt|starkist: because thats what he has|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah... though it would still typically have a card outside i thk|pg||
nt|gavin: 5 card support and a stiff and out seems like a bit much|pg||
nt|gavin: 145-107 if he makes this|pg||
nt|starkist: fellow commentators, starstudded... should put a team together and challenge the winners|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|gavin: if the vugraph operator can wish my bro and his team gl from me id appreciate it|pg||
nt|starkist: forgone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks pretty normal to me|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphznx: if that looks weird, i may have missed a trick|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|8|nt|fabsayc: well carruthers got the most out of this hand|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 10 tricks possible|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: but why save if you think it might be going off|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kastan88: this 1@C= 16+ unbal or 15+= bal, thats why stopped in 2NT only|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N would be more comfortable here|pg||

pc|s5|nt|m_niemi: 4@s-2 = 200 in the open room in "5@d" deal, 7 to Denmark|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is a hard spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w get the mps again|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: 5d is only a spade pip short of making!|pg||
nt|lestergold: swop 7 and 9 of spades an 5 is frigid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this was not the best return|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course imps not so many |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh more now a spade trick has been binned|pg||

pc|cA|nt|lestergold: at mps it is abetter proposiotn to save|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mcphee: however if 4@D is weak, the E hand has ZERO defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: match points off the scale to get away with one down|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S knew N has max 2@h so easy duck|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|pc|s8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: we have a delay now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: looks like +1 to Fin|pg||

mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Karen, good work|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am sure Karen can......from Gavin to the Darren and his team|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: looked fine Karen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and it looks like slam can be made EW in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: anybody for slam? everybody?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|capercliff: he stole his rebid|pg||
nt|starkist: actionne|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gowdy: no was spot on I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Inverted minor raise presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one of the surer applictions of the rabbi rule here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 6@D is still on a guess if no spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: wonder if 2@d was GF or not|pg||
nt|caitlin: Pittsburg 2 Detroit 0|pg||
nt|bbramley: tough for your main partner to be from a different country - much harder to make teams|pg||
nt|starkist: 3@h bit pusilanimous|pg||
nt|starkist: 2n|pg||
nt|bbramley: could try 2NT, get some info|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and to all the impartial commentators, spectators, roland, bbo, and the CBF|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Hazel with them?|pg||
nt|gowdy: this may be a chance to tightenthings up|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 61d is cold|pg||
nt|capercliff: @d|pg||
nt|capercliff: and bid in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the lead direct double just helped opponents on this board|pg||
nt|caitlin: two way stayman?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i cant spell that, so will use the british "wet" instead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: note|pg||
nt|caitlin: I assume|pg||
pc|h6|nt|starkist: gavin not impartial|pg||
nt|caitlin: and hello from Gavin to his mom|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why not W trasfer |pg||
nt|fabsayc: well an enjoyable and fast set, thanks again to Karen, our tireless operator|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rlebi: 6@c only slam that makes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one more board after this, again thanks to Karen for her hard work all today as operator|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|caitlin: the Wolperts are a famous bridge playing family in Toronto:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now all we need is another 500 spectators for the final set|pg||
nt|rlebi: or @ds|pg||
nt|glen: btw we have a USA1 winner in spec, and congrads to that team in a very tough and long event|pg||
nt|glen: hopefully they will concede once they see how strong Canada1 is|pg||
nt|glen: hmm, they promise a battle :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we will field the enforcers with 10 foot hockey sticks|pg||
nt|glen: he might just put 6@C on the table now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|caitlin: 5-3s often better in NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 H no chance let us see for 3NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks and chances for a ninth|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here the 5 never even mentioned|pg||
nt|caitlin: needs one minor suit trick|pg||
nt|caitlin: ????|pg||
nt|fabsayc: entries a problem|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  we're about 5 mins from COPC one round to go leaders|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: cunning play but should not work|pg||
pc|h9|nt|capercliff: huh?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: signing off, but this could be less safe than slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can be missing two aces|pg||
nt|capercliff: 5@s was a relay to play in 5N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so blackwood was not the right tool|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure what is however|pg||
nt|gowdy: needs a or k of d in N with  no C switch|pg||
nt|susieq: 5N transfers the blame to partner|pg||
nt|glen: no, its the your-fault 5NT (i.e. you pick it)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: one does not get 12 card fits that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: slam is 50/50 at best anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to gavin, caitlin, tony, george and cameos from cam and harmon |pg||
nt|fabsayc: so win and heart to 9 and diamond up|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|capercliff: happens to be the right side of 50 this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better than 50-50|pg||
nt|capercliff: you dont have time to try both finesses Martin:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually the defense will yield many clues to the best line|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hazel, the mom runs a great bridge club|pg||
nt|raghavan: North must be alert to play C and another C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is essentially the same|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is better, though Jurek should realize hearts likely solid|pg||
nt|rlebi: he picked swell|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a bid with a great track record lately, but worked here|pg||
nt|glen: on board 10, with the two offside black kings, EW made 6@S at the other table|pg||
nt|glen: sorry board 9|pg||
nt|glen: they bid 6@S for 13 imps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: they have to guard clubs also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: plus no spade lead, i would expect a lot of clues|pg||
nt|glen: and now in 6@S board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: tomorrow first session at 9:30 PDT, 12:30 in toronto, 2pm in newfoundland|pg||
nt|starkist: cameos and harmeos|pg||
nt|harmon: what time in Borneo???|pg||
nt|mcbruce: Special thanks from me to both of our operators today.  While they tolied I finished preduplicating the last of the 2,858 boards for the tournament.  :)|pg||
nt|gavin: yikes bruce i know that task|pg||
nt|rlebi: swing comes back as predicted|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|caitlin: nice 6@C by Turner and Hughes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: in answer to why they cancelled the board|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: thoughts on opener rebidding 2@C rather than 3@D|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: 8 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast|pg||
nt|raghavan: still Ck and C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and now is surely marked|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Has 9 but def can getb 5 first|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why H is not developped - means solid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|raghavan: so hope in C|pg||
nt|gowdy: works here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam on 9 was fair, on 10 horrible|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash the spade|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: if this session did not start on time, would be very noisy once the COPC ended|pg||
pc|dK|nt|raghavan: GOOOOOD|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to guess right at the end to get the 6 tricks he started with|pg||

nt|fabsayc: koistinen timid?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N aqqressive at the last moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|pelu: Long way up to Finland :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 2@H - I cant :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma SjÃ¶berg are still juniors I believe. Early 20's? Someone in the audience may be able to message me|pg||
nt|haans: I its time for me to thank Matti Niemi and Goeffrey Wolfarth Ybarra my  co-commentator and you all for watching. Welcome back an other day. Hope you have enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Sandra 22, Emma 24|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and rather few IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again - can u defeat 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Anni and she is having a hard time. Please bear with her|pg||
nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are stuck again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|pelu: Vladimir - I take @D 10 discard 2@Cs ruff a @S and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes that's true -- you need to play a small @D early|pg||
nt|pelu: are we still waiting for the lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: makes a lot more sense over artificial 1@C than natural 1@S to preempt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  After all that fruitful chickening Koistinen had to break the line|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2+2+3+2=9, any problems?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not really, but declarer doesn't know the location of the K|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Furthermore, diamonds may be 4-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 36 imps = 23-7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finns have played very well in both tables|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if 16 boards...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 15 boards/match now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 more to Fin, Salomaa run 4 rounds of @h to make 4@s with 6-1 fit|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The only snag on Finnish scoreboard is 3NT -1 on this board|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room was @s lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: has declarer gone to sleep here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed 3nt was makeable even after spade lead|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer ducked 2nd @d, so spades were cleared, -1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: dec played S to have @dQJxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same potential problem here|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I wonder how they managed to go down in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still he cant make till he plays to trick 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade, spade, diamond, diamond to jack, and spade|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in mps there is a lot more to gain at imps you may save a few but what a disaster if you make a big sac and they cant make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom at this level |pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: NS will bid game here -- 3N or 4@H?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cenglund:  Not a very good decision|pg||
pc|h3|nt|m_niemi: 17 imps is 19-11 to Finland|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another battle of communications and not helping declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@H looks hopeless, but this has a practical chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i cant see a defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm will north find the killing lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: restart scheduled in 58 mins time|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: so no second club trick and no way to make|pg||
nt|m_niemi: board 46 probably 6 imps to Den.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: but there it seems overtaking for spade lead is best for defense|pg||

nt|mcphee: needed to play 4@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: but will it be enough for sweden|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed 12 or 13 to Sweden|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|m_niemi: @c had given a chance|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes not easy bidding competition hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|c5|nt|m_niemi: even +1 with endplay|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 11 imps 17-13|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: now can actually make an overtrick|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||

nt|haans: to not think a bronze  is possible|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|m_niemi: @hK and W knows all cards|pg||

pc|h7|pc|c8|pg||

nt|gavin: i did that for the CNTCs when they were in toronto abt 7 years ago|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and thanks to Bruce Mcintyre and all involved behind the scenes|pg||
nt|gavin: and our machine broke so we had to do the entire tournament by hand|pg||
nt|bbramley: can't they put this match where it will stay quiet?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|caitlin: Hi Susie: )|pg||
nt|starkist: with braille cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a rather lukewarm endorsement|pg||
nt|starkist: hope they have marilla freni to sing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe they are in the convention center, is one big room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|susieq: hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently he guessed wrong, down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: and hockey gloves|pg||
nt|caitlin: may try 4|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|capercliff: strong @c systems always work well with those hands, can always play in 1N|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2D  1 major|pg||
nt|rlebi: well, it got close for a while - but congrats to the L'ecuyer squad|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: looks like a spade lead beats this|pg||
nt|caitlin: as Soloway always said/did when vul never invite to 3N with good 8-9 just bid it|pg||
nt|caitlin: other table also led spade|pg||
nt|starkist: miss him|pg||
nt|gavin: what happened in other room ?|pg||
nt|mcbruce: BTW, the commentators updates on the hockey game earlier were ahead of the CBC's "live" video feed by about ten seconds.  Had I known this earlier I could have made some money...  ...|pg||
nt|mcbruce: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many would try 4@S with hannas hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmm not an easy one whether you bid your clubs but as long as pd isn't going to drop you....you can show those diamonds again and again if need be|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is not a strong club system|pg||
nt|capercliff: in the other room both players stretched and ended up in a bad game|pg||
nt|gavin: thx for duplicating the boards without that we wouldnt have vugraph|pg||
nt|caitlin: or 3S|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was my thought|pg||
nt|gowdy: I would rebid 3 @D 100 %  but I'm home and he is playing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: i was taking them off my tv, bruce|pg||
nt|starkist: the town only has the one room for events|pg||
nt|rlebi: 2009 CNTC champs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|caitlin: same lead 3N making|pg||
nt|gavin: seems odd|pg||
nt|gavin: theres no hope at 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|gavin: ok good night thx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont need a maximum |pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: safe travel gavin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and get some sleep|pg||
nt|gavin: gotta leave in 2 hours, prob just finish packing :)|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i was just telling gavin i never thought i would see the day where a table with roy hughes and juryk would finish way ahead of other table|pg||
nt|caitlin: exactly|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the exotic 2nt strikes again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play record is incomplete|pg||
nt|caitlin: I still think 3@S as in other room|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank Kibits, Martin J, MartinC, ellen, Teacher Gowdy, VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO  This is last deal|pg||
pc|c6|nt|caitlin: a reminder that Canadian Bridge Federation, CNTC trials : http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/index.html|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: Thanks all, we will resume in a few hours.  Check the schedule for the time in your area|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: closing now|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes thanks Karen and Raghavan:)|pg||
nt|glen: he has 5@D, 1@S, 1@C and needs to develop an 8th trick - he can keep ducking @HS until the ace falls|pg||
nt|bbramley: thanks everyone - good show, and congrats to the l'ecuyer team|pg||
pc|h6|nt|starkist: what about when i said scored by mistake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4@H was somewhat easier contract than 3@D|pg||
pc|hT|nt|caitlin: sure is|pg||
nt|gowdy: :) see you all soon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good work again Karen, now on her 5th shift at this|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|caitlin: If I was going to show clubs it would be 3C |pg||
nt|caitlin: absolutely forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: they have zoomed way ahead of me on the play for this one|pg||
nt|caitlin: np|pg||
nt|caitlin: they aren't making this |pg||
nt|gowdy: remember 78  :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|starkist: didn't understand bidding then missed the play|pg||
nt|susieq: a claim was input after trick 1|pg||
nt|caitlin: I know brain cells start dying after AGE 29--TRUE-- but give it a shot Tony|pg||
nt|susieq: we didn't get to see any of the play after the lead|pg||
nt|gavin: the bidding was 2S range ask (basically a 2nt bid)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: simply better bidding at this table|pg||

nt|harmon: gn|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d9|nt|gavin: not 3nt|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club 4 looks wrong|pg||
nt|capercliff: he wanted the Q@s as an entry to finesse @c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes no way back to hand if the finesse works|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|gavin: operator error|pg||
nt|caitlin: Grainger and Korbel have made a terrific debut and promise to enrich bridge|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: i suspect was scoring error in open room|pg||
nt|starkist: my guess|pg||
nt|starkist: bidding and result wrong maybe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade and down|pg||
pc|s9|nt|caitlin: Karen how do we know that to be so?|pg||
nt|susieq: I am pretty sure the result is correct- I have talked to one of the players|pg||
