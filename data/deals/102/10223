nt|Walddk2: The winner of this match to play Fleisher over 90 boards for the USA2 berth. Hard work to earn a trip to Brazil ladies and gentlemen|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I guess Roy wanted to show a solid suit with 4@H, but Willenken also expected at least one more keycard|pg||

nt|kareno: I'm reminded that it was the late, great Sam Scaffidi of Mingo Junction, Ohio, who coauthored the Striped Tail Ape double with John Lowenthal.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H is the systemic rebid playing Kokish, but they may have a different agreement|pg||
