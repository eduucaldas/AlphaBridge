nt|roswolf: true but 5 of a minor looked too far away but perhaps not|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: instead of gaining a game swing from this judgment it is just another push|pg||
nt|roswolf: can they make 5@D?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: believe he wrote that 4@s showed 4-4 in the minors, after 3@d, not 100% sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 5@d ok|pg||
nt|othered1: but why should they pick @D over @C?  and might they try 4N, failing?|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think risky not to cash 2nd @C -- imagine North  3613|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@C now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- i'd like to retract that please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 = down 2|pg||

nt|westjava: that's why he was thinking a while|pg||

nt|ahollan1: frustrating when player at table finds better play seeing only 2 hands than i found looking at all 4 :(|pg||

nt|westjava: E has to ask what was 2@S..:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: very tough to accurately criticize auction, other than by result, without detailed system notes that just aren't available for most pair.|pg||
