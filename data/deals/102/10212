nt|rayhaa: i thk they will try 4@h at this vul|pg||
nt|serhat: 4h is makeable|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: or @S?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Rafa: last year was festival championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|Rafa: EW won last year the official pairs too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But agree at u. Attack from the cards u have|pg||
nt|levix: yes,sometimes,if weak hand, lead doubleton is not bad|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mostly anyway I agree at ure first. @C|pg||
nt|levix: still need guess DK,|pg||
nt|garnetts: It won't once South tried 2@H--|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead??|pg||
nt|davidstern: -1 I suspect|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rodal f: Looks like a 3NTEW for me but problems can be on the line|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is double better or 2@H?  |pg||
nt|yke: a phantom save, but 4@S is hard to resist|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Strange lead. Waited @C from 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|granguru: GOOD STOP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rayhaa: it depends on agreement i guess|pg||
nt|rayhaa: u can bid 2@h as non forcing and X as neg or invitational or vice versa|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes to some extent--but in my case it would be qa choice--could start with either--except that a subsequent heart bid would not be forcing if I doubled first|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i suppose it might have kept e/w out of a spade partscore|pg||
nt|serhat: yes only lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: So they have bid to the last making spot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: this looks -1 or even 2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|serhat: Ac and sp switch is not good enough|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|othered1: pinpoint bidding, with the @SK not in opening bidder's hand|pg||
nt|aldek: Last hand was unjust for Bep Vriend, here she overbid|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not to beat four but to beat 5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  3NT is not too bad, but it needs clubs 4-3 so will fail|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Michael Zhu|pg||
pc|sT|nt|beto: nice stop although 4@S looks good in this bidding seeing only NS cards|pg||

nt|granguru: I didnt know how to play bridge yet and was working in the Bridge Rama |pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Karakolev discarded 10@C not small and -1 |pg||
nt|levix: 4s for E-W|pg||
nt|rodal f: As told before the pairs play pressision so there 2 openings are not easy to know.|pg||
nt|davidstern: so a big scoring match here|pg||
mb|1N|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
nt|donatoru: a new  "good save" 5@d's ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: no save on this vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Polich club|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all, esp Roland and Geoffrey|pg||
nt|donatoru: 1@s i supose :) |pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: E-w might get higher if East splinters now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a hard fight NS vs EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug can help:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: West can get quite close to making 3NT I think but 4@S looks like losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult to predict the final contract|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rayhaa: another 4@s borderline|pg||
nt|donatoru: aginst double is KQJxx vs 1098x:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: West is going to like his hand a lot|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT is a lucky make here with a spade guess|pg||
nt|nickf: Support double from South, showing 3 spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may also consider 4S game now after the diamond bid by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi arifin|pg||
nt|yke: I think S is too strong for 3@C|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: At pess there came an auto 1@S|pg||
nt|yke: better 2NT but two small diamonds is a flaw|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: two cues and a signoff|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have as I see it. 5@C on a finding at @D and EW 9 in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: But a good spot for 4@S+1 here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: I'm not so sure about the signoff part|pg||
nt|Rafa: Other room play has stopped, Lucena called the director|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard choice for North but 2H is pessimistic|pg||
nt|rayhaa: might have tried 3@h hoping for 3NT|pg||
nt|aldek: some would bid 2@D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: well a not much extra 4H|pg||
nt|duschek: 4 so-called losers in East - will he stop?|pg||
nt|kit: East has easy pass -- he already forced to game|pg||
nt|beto: he should|pg||
nt|beto: @D are not that good and he already splintered to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he certainly could have more for splinter|pg||
nt|beto: like the @DK ; )|pg||
nt|levix: too aggressive|pg||
nt|rodal f: I feltthe whole time fore a re opening NS for fight. Did not need that.|pg||
nt|nickf: it was, I wonder what his options were?|pg||
nt|nickf: XX to show a maximum pass?|pg||
nt|nickf: 2NT perhaps to show 4S and just 2H ?|pg||
nt|donatoru: dont understand 5@d, an anticipated preemptive bid ? but Lion Heart Radu doubled !!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|levix: friendly lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Indeed. Better possibility for make it now|pg||
nt|levix: yes,makeable now even failed finesse of SQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the normal reading are K from a dobbleton|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many tricks Lerfald?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rayhaa: but this will prob be a push|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|granguru: can make 6 now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done, not really 50-50 slam|pg||
nt|granguru: or go down|pg||
nt|beto: down no|pg||
nt|granguru: no 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru: sorry|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes friendly lie of the cards|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d6|nt|beto: he can ruff the 3rd @D with the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: I'm not sure he can handle 12 tricks even without the spade being cashed|pg||
nt|beto: if he finesses on 1st trick|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is very hard to get to 3NT here--and to make it the sequence of play must be very precise|pg||
nt|serhat: an other dia finese ?|pg||
nt|serhat: may be not anymore|pg||
nt|davidstern: No diamond nine so may not but with East holding five hearts may try diamond ten|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nobody here except Barry and I an neither of us. I could try the operator|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|donatoru: a good chance for +5 Imp's missing by Erichsens |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|donatoru: a little "creme renverse"  7 Imp's |pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru: looks like it is not possible to make 12|pg||
nt|levix: second trump play S10 better|pg||
nt|rodal f: As I see i there are7. Correct|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|beto: well chile stoped in 1N on board 4 so a few imps coming back|pg||

nt|rodal f: A side witch can be interesting for some bridgeplayers. Bookmark it so u have it later.  http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: I am shure Roland have more of those.|pg||
nt|nickf: neither had a great hand|pg||
nt|donatoru: 1NT will be bid in few seconds:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  No and without 3-3 hearts they would be better off in a partscore|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@D at w?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|beto: 2 balanced 12 count|pg||
nt|donatoru: pass all with small @d lead 4-th best|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: EW have to be careful if defending a spade game|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|fabsayc: they will stop below game|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@H shows 4+@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting |pg||
nt|nickf: But West will know what to do.|pg||
nt|donatoru: :) my dear parts :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: dont think they will stop...|pg||
nt|nickf: and Lavazza did bid and make the 4-3 spade game on 5|pg||
nt|nickf: either West or North could be thinking here, I think the operator puts in 2 bids at a time.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru: or exactly 4 I believe|pg||
nt|kit: and the 1@S call probably shows exactly 3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Heavy 2@S|pg||
nt|rayhaa: looks like problems with connection between tables, so score in film is wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Lite 3@H |pg||
nt|ahalim: and a lot of tricks w/o a @H lead|pg||
nt|serhat: easy 3NT here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|nickf: was that 5C by North or East ?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Godefroy de Tessières|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: well, they did|pg||
nt|duschek: Or could show a small balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it also is usually dead minimum|pg||
nt|yke: E implied a 4 card spade because she bid double first|pg||
nt|yke: only 8 tricks |pg||
nt|davidstern: Bonjour|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yke: wow... they made 4@H in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|donatoru: hard work for the both : declarer and defence , i bet 5 ttricks for e-w , + 200 Romania|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Takes a lot of courage to stop at 2NT vulnerable -- a fine line to walk|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east could have a no trick 12 count|pg||
nt|duschek: Seems to make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|kit: and this time it looks like they were wrong|pg||
nt|granguru: agree but e has minimum minimum and 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is up to opener with anything extra|pg||
nt|kit: those 10's have a way of adding up on hand's such as these|pg||
nt|beto: i cw seen to many agressive openings by paca and ben|pg||
nt|duschek: There are three very valuable tens which they forgot to include in their HCP count|pg||
nt|beto: so here is where they pay the price for opening 10 and 11 counts|pg||
nt|levix: 3s good stop,but still down|pg||
nt|nickf: well 5m would have been a phantom save against 4S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|poussin: hello|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Was it right by W to press on?|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see an opening in E and 2@S fin|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: we had openning from N without comment on table|pg||
nt|serhat: slm|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even so doubt this is much over 30%|pg||
nt|beto: really?|pg||
nt|beto: wow|pg||
nt|kit: my general philosophy is:  If I don't accept a game invitation, it is because I think we may be too high already|pg||
nt|beto: argetnina reached 6@H and the @SA was lead on board 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: But I can not se Batov bidding @S after pards minor bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: I really dislike West's actions--if he consults partner they can defend 3@H which where they belong |pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: And Panev are a gooooood player|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT by those atone 15 at W? I would have upgraded them or made it the line under. 1@D and later bid|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well try it on a club lead|pg||
nt|granguru: this is board 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: atone was stone|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: In white the line always are easyer at HP|pg||
nt|donatoru: the best return is small @d , but impossibile in real life , Geta thinks that Radi is A@d sgltn |pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Board 5|pg||
nt|beto: sry board 5|pg||
nt|levix: no middle cards,or 3nt makeable for e-w,|pg||

nt|davidstern: Another diamond will make declarer a little nervous|pg||
nt|poussin: he can safely finesse the @s|pg||
nt|davidstern: Serf have doubled their lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: The spade finesse will now be ok as there are four spade tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: it is better--then so is redouble initially--then you can bid 2@S and go to sleep |pg||
nt|garnetts: east will now lose five more tricks|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|rayhaa: many use RD as 9+ without support|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer now forced to play another club I think - not knowing of doubleton spade king|pg||
nt|davidstern: Identical position in closed room|pg||
nt|poussin: I wonder why declarer didnt keep 4 @s in dummy and try to let the 10 of @s run|pg||
nt|serhat: he is worried if K is off side|pg||
nt|poussin: maybe he thought south would have routinely ducked this |pg||
nt|serhat: yes this wasnt the best line|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Rafa: Live with the two tables in screen at the O'higgins ball room with live commentary by Eduardo Scanavino, Maestro Argentino|pg||

nt|rodal f: By loosers. Only by loosers EW have 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: End for EW at 2@S|pg||
nt|nickf: not anymore though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: Lavazza is in 3NT next door NS, so here's a chance for a pickup for Buaijh|pg||
nt|yke: 6@H is not that bad|pg||
nt|aldek: you will make it if you bid it|pg||
nt|yke: after a spade lead, you can try to drop the @CK first which will work|pg||
nt|yke: 3@d now?|pg||
nt|yke: maybe the play it as NF|pg||
nt|aldek: but it's not a good contract, as we say it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: light 3rd seat opening -- may propel E-W to 4S, which I don't think they can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north is trying to make something happen with that 1@C semi-psych opening|pg||
nt|Rafa: 500 people from the audience saying hi from here |pg||
nt|beto: i think he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|donatoru: 2@s too conservative bid , 1NT is semiforcing here , 3@s is weak, 2@h is constructive raise , whihc is best bid ?|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3@c from Geta after 2@s i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: in @H best|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I agree with 3D, looks like the cards are poorly placed.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well if he thought 2@S was right then 3@S is clearly wrong in view of the third seat opening|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3@C are 9 or 10 but 5 are down|pg||
nt|rayhaa: what is Norths RD, just showing a honor?|pg||
nt|aldek: she should know if 3@D is forcing|pg||
nt|davidstern: N/S play standard style with weak 1NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: We can try|pg||
nt|levix: luck to click out HQJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be all from 8 til 10|pg||

nt|levix: better to erect D suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: A lot of cards NS, but there end are low|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might 3NT was better|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably |pg||
nt|garnetts: This looks like one off after the lead |pg||

pc|sJ|nt|granguru: Chile has the highest gap in the whole match now 34 IMPs|pg||
nt|Rafa: nice wave!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: /////\\\\\\\\/////////////\\\\\\\\//////////\\\\\\\\\\\   thanks to HedyG|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why? Need a @S ruff|pg||
nt|rayhaa: yes def, strange pass to see what happens|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: top spade lead ok here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: oops |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Clubs could be doubleton if 4-4-3-2 otherwise generally min of three|pg||
pc|hT|nt|beto: the gap will narrow sson as argentina is in 3N board 6, same lead as this room|pg||
nt|duschek: They missed a game at board 6 - they are certainly not going to miss two in a row, may be their philosophy|pg||
nt|kit: looks like declarer is getting the spades right, but I don't think that will get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: No. 4@H will run home|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahalim: yes but the @S 8 will then be a stopper|pg||
pc|h6|nt|beto: dont even to 8 kit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: But best def are to do. Play trumh|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club now is best|pg||
nt|davidstern: or ruff spade and then club|pg||
nt|poussin: maybe @s ruffed and @c|pg||
nt|poussin: trying to score 6@d 1@c and 2@h|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table same contract|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|beto: defence is in the right track|pg||
nt|kit: defense doing very well -- now may get 2 club tricks set up before ace of spades dislodged|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nickf: as a spectator points out, the key to the hand is to endplay East by leading a H to the 9 in the endgame|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|aldek: take 9 tricks and run|pg||
pc|c6|nt|davidstern: Also you thought North might 3@C but that would have meant south would be declarer - you havent played many mixed events I am guessing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|donatoru: a catastrophic score for Romania, a take-out passed in the Open,2 conservative bids in the closed and 21-2|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer deciding if North really would underlead the KQ of hearts twice|pg||
nt|poussin: lol|pg||
nt|serhat: this is better|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 and fin I belive|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|granguru: @S7|pg||
nt|duschek: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning Frank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7:50 am Sunday is it?|pg||
nt|kit: squeeze position can't really exist, and I think declarer realizes that|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes |pg||
nt|rodal f: But Batov are a bit afraid by his way of ruffing|pg||
nt|serhat: why did E duck Qc?|pg||
nt|poussin: my partners always play better than I do|pg||
nt|davidstern: As I said you obviously dont play in mixed events|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: concede four tricks and move oon|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nickf: and voila|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|granguru: needed @D10 instead of @D8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are there any way to go down?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahalim: Ok next|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d5|nt|duschek: I am sure Robles would enjoy such a double squeeze saving an undertrick when they chose the wrong board to bid a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sK|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|davidstern: So another flat board|pg||
nt|serhat: tricks are important in this match|pg||

nt|rodal f: Def a bit bad there|pg||
nt|garnetts: It was true that NS could make 4@S with a 3-3 spade break and a 3-2 club break but they will never be able to bid|pg||
nt|rayhaa: good sac in 4@s, can push ns to 5@h|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 96 teams entered the Mixed Teams. They are divided into 16 groups of 6|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am looking for material to write up in the Bulletin but this match wont produce anything I am guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|donatoru: the history was wrote in this match , nobody is prophet in his country:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kit: Some might overall the 4-card suit here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure that EW will bid 4@S ---I had though East would pre-empt--I like 3@S but 2@S is OK |pg||
nt|Walddk7: The results are now starting to appear at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/MixedRR.htm|pg||
nt|poussin: looks like they will play 2@h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Will be a fight bat level 2 I belive.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At 3 problems come in|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am told however that there is no shortage of offers for lladies to play with Godefroy....|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|levix: will N lead doubleton?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass is forcing |pg||
nt|poussin: :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|nickf: Well next door bocchi had a chance in the endgame to make 3NT but he didnt make the winning play|pg||
nt|garnetts: It also suggests that North should bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: The overcall works well, as 1NT is cold and 2@S has chances|pg||
nt|othered1: good lead|pg||
nt|beto: yes, very nice leaf|pg||
nt|beto: lead|pg||
nt|granguru: he he|pg||
nt|granguru: avoids a @c ruff|pg||
nt|kit: West is 4-3-3-3 so isn't gettng ruffs, so why should he let anybody else get ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We already see the result but 12 might was hard|pg||
nt|rayhaa: lucky @d J10, so 5@h makes|pg||
nt|donatoru: nothing to play a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Graded up the cards from 19 til a 20-21NT|pg||
nt|levix: it is ok with 5d |pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|levix: keep CK in dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: K109xx make one point|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as KJ10XX fore shure do|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D = a major 2@H=p/c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is a match from Group H|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@H is in fact the contract in the OR|pg||
pc|d4|nt|donatoru: only a thin slam or a pushed game can save our souls :) |pg||
nt|davidstern: :( Could you pass some on to me please...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|granguru: wise comment Kit|pg||
nt|levix: no overtrick with this lead|pg||
nt|nickf: easier when we see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: declarer might still make by setting up hearts, discarding a club on third heart rather than ruffing it|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well Lerfald. I missed at my quick analyce|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Clasic one|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|garnetts: If that was a strong club and north showed 5-7 then pass is surely forcing--if it wasn't a strong club then South must act|pg||
nt|yke: operator?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|olerfald: small C now |pg||
nt|rodal f: How many tricks at 1NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: It would have been the best Y|pg||
nt|serhat: this might go down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|granguru: but the menace of the @H establishment arises|pg||
nt|davidstern: So what will happen here - losing @Sx2 @Hx1 @D x1 @C x2 so maybe one down unless the defence slips|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: looks to be -1 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a plaine one|pg||
nt|kenyan1: an imp away|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Jimmy:) Nice to see u. Woorke hard to get one in|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see you after 15 min.|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty all|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|davidstern: So there were 90+ teams yesterday. There was five rounds of 10 boards. top 3 in each pool of six went into A Swiss and Bottom 3 into B Swiss|pg||
nt|serhat: E has to play dia on time|pg||
nt|davidstern: The A Swiss qill now qualify 27 of the 48 in the pool into the round of 32 while the B Swiss will provide the other 5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|aldek: @HJ would beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: tell me |pg||
nt|yke: yes, N has an entry in the @CQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: 32 teams then knockout all the way|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rayhaa: shd be possible for the norwegians to catch up some imps here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: U are a bit more concervatice at K109XX?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade now with sink this|pg||
nt|serhat: W knows E doesnt have K dia. |pg||
nt|serhat: or A now|pg||
nt|poussin: by the way, south would have done better to take the 1st trick with the ace of @d|pg||
nt|poussin: hiding the king|pg||
nt|serhat: so only sp left for defence|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: but it looks like the force in clubs will get him anyway|pg||
nt|yke: something went wrong in the diamond suit, but its ok now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|beto: maybe more|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will lead a heart and pitch a club|pg||
nt|beto: he will only get 3 more tricks now|pg||
nt|frankaus: started and finished with 6 top tricks|pg||
nt|kit: then opponents play on clubs, he ruffs, crosses to dummy, and plays another heart pitching diamond|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: West ruffs, but must break diamonds, so down 1 I believe|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mir mad a small egg there but hard to see|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|granguru: down 2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: oh right, king of diamonds will be gone|pg||
nt|rodal f: For to be onest. I am to:)|pg||
nt|levix: close room,lead S,this was great helps to declarer|pg||
nt|rayhaa: yes pass must be forcing|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|davidstern: The diamond trick has now vanished|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poussin: I guess she did, as voldoire wouldnt have play @d |pg||

nt|davidstern: minus one to plus 5 is  h-u-g-e in this mattch|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D!|an|bicolor !H !S|nt|beto: 3N by ns, down on a @S lead|pg||
nt|aldek: 12 tricks is plenty|pg||
nt|serhat: I think 5 imps 17-13 in 10b match|pg||
mb|d|nt|yke: 10 is more likely, but 4NT is never down|pg||
nt|poussin: I guess 2@d is transfer to @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|donatoru: now 21-9 converted in VP|pg||
nt|poussin: I prefer a bid showing both majors with this hand though|pg||
nt|davidstern: OR N/S in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: 1N - 3N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|duschek: Tough hand - seems 5@D is on a finesse (and diamonds 3-2)|pg||
nt|nickf: this hand is a bit more complex. East makes a lot of clubs, but how many ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: East should double for take out|pg||
nt|poussin: well it did show both majors|pg||
nt|poussin: then I prefer 3nt rather than DBL with south|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|beto: 1N 2@C 2@D 3N|pg||
nt|nickf: 12 if Mme Lavazza guesses clubs.|pg||
nt|garnetts: double is much more flexible than 3@D |pg||
nt|rayhaa: good x, can they stop in 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|duccino: Board 1 was deleted and they played a brand new one. So results of board 11 are correct but the cards are not|pg||
nt|serhat: 3nt is cold but carful play needed|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT is going to be a struggle no?|pg||
nt|poussin: letting the opponents guess which major to lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Without seeing all hands|pg||
nt|serhat: careful|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nickf: but what NS are doing is anyone's guess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nickf: I dont think duboin will drive this to slam tho|pg||
nt|davidstern: David Beauchamp is a fine declarer|pg||
pc|hK|nt|duschek: No alternative to the spade lead, so this hand is over quickly|pg||
nt|kit: Pretty hard to stay out of 3NT, even if N-S had methods where North could show his shape|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|kit: East will play 9 at trick 1, and b shocked when it holds|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|nickf: there's too much duplication in hearts for starters.|pg||
nt|aldek: in a short match overtricks add up to an IMP or even two|pg||
pc|h8|nt|donatoru: Mama mia , a good chance for Romania is a slam played by Erichsens|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3 keys |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: on normal play this is either -1 or2 but the defence have to be careful|pg||
nt|ahalim: N will have a fir when he finds out that the K was single :)|pg||
nt|serhat: N has to play for C's on side|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|nickf: the Irish have stopped in 5C next door|pg||
nt|nickf: the status of 3D is probably unclear ot Duboin|pg||
nt|nickf: if it was a stopper ask, he didnt have it.|pg||
nt|serhat: yes he will make this|pg||
nt|davidstern: defence in OR started with three rounds of hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|donatoru: but the defence must be carrefull|pg||
nt|donatoru: let's see @s lead|pg||
nt|donatoru: Geta must mark very well the shape |pg||
nt|donatoru: Radu thinking alsos about J@c lead |pg||
nt|donatoru: but is too dangerouse|pg||
nt|donatoru: bet again :) @s lead|pg||
nt|donatoru: lunch time , pls Radu lead :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nickf: and why did East open 1C ahead of 1D, anyway ?|pg||
nt|donatoru: lose again |pg||
nt|donatoru: R@h is the strong lead Q@h is from RDxx , |pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: every reason to be in 4@H after that start lol|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|serhat: now he can also make with end play|pg||
nt|davidstern: More likely play is @CA and @CK hoping for doubleton honour |pg||
nt|serhat: yes then end play|pg||
nt|poussin: when @d play for 4 tricks, he can safely strip squeeze east |pg||
nt|davidstern: declarer in OR pitched a club on the third heart it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: But made 9 tricks all the same|pg||
nt|poussin: east will show 3 cards in minors, and she has to be 4-6 for her 2@h bid (guess she would XX with 5-5)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think David will cash diamonds and clubs and exit heart|pg||
nt|poussin: actually declarer doesnt know he has 4@d tricks, else he would be claiming :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: East has presumably shown both majors|pg||
pc|c5|nt|aupillon: only not a heart|pg||
nt|donatoru: wow Geta signs pleasure with small , danger level 0 !!!!!!!|pg||
nt|aupillon: aïe|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to hold 3x@C - to kill the Squeeze against N|pg||
nt|donatoru: now J@c is easy , common boy , |pg||
nt|pelu: 26 IMPs on here|pg||
nt|aupillon: anything. Anything but a heart|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|aupillon: ok|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nickf: huh - she raised herself to 6. Hope she makes it now.|pg||
nt|nickf: however had stayed in game, and made, that was worth 12 imps anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they made the lead from the wrong side|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H might have had a chance|pg||
nt|serhat: thats the best play. almost 100% after seeing 4 dia tricks|pg||
nt|serhat: she also showed sp K|pg||
nt|davidstern: With West pitching a club the hand is almost an open book to declarer|pg||
nt|davidstern: I must bid you adieu and join my team - have a great day everybody|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphztg: the lead was 4@h|pg||
nt|nickf: lead from the wrong side?|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|kit: diamond discards speed things up|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jbgood: 32 imps is 25-5|pg||

pc|c8|nt|donatoru: but declerer must guess|pg||
nt|donatoru: 10 @d or J@h ?|pg||

pc|c9|pg||

nt|nickf: If I was declarer I'd accept the lead and let Duboin play the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|nickf: I think the speed the hand was played that may have been what happened|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: because mrs lavazza open the screen |pg||
nt|rayhaa: 7 imps and even match|pg||
nt|blueclub2: ciao|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be exciting|pg||
nt|ahalim: ciaoPietro|pg||
nt|jbgood: and get the kids away from the computer...|pg||
nt|donatoru: 25-5 this is the situation|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3NT |pg||
nt|aupillon: In OR they made 3NT in EW|pg||
nt|davidstern: But with risk|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nickf: doh!|pg||
nt|davidstern: If West does not split honours declarer may play king on second round hoping for doubleton honour in East hand|pg||
nt|poussin: east will be known to have 6@h and 4@s, and when she follows twice in @d, declarer can safely play ace of @c and @c to the 10|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|duschek: Depends a lot of the methods|pg||
nt|duschek: on|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has an obvious 4@D bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: rather 11C - 1@H - 2@H|pg||
nt|ahalim: right but how high will they gp ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry go|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|yke: 1@S=diamonds|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: it isn't like 3NT is the worst contract ever been in last hand -- sometimes spades are 4-4, sometimes they don't find the spade lead when 3-card holding is on lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west will relay with 1s|pg||
nt|ahalim: just :)|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3NT for e-w and a good score for Norvay , congrats Norvay, vae victis |pg||
nt|davidstern: That's why ducking second heart is best - stops count for declarer|pg||
nt|poussin: that is because 2@d was alerted as both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: amusing look to the auction|pg||
nt|ahalim: did Liz really bid 5@D ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk7: as choose a major I presume, showing equal length|pg||
nt|roswolf: logical explanation|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@D showed both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will have to decide whether to sac at some level|pg||
nt|serhat: the problem was if it was 55|pg||
nt|davidstern: OR in 2@S|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|ady: good morning Silvia|pg||
nt|ady: this should make with an overtrick|pg||
nt|serhat: so endplay is the safest line |pg||
mb|p|nt|rayhaa: 1NT  :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kit: relay this|pg||
nt|duschek: The normal contract, but stone dead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or not guess this time he did not care|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: practicality won out|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 3-3  would be 12 tricks|pg||
nt|rayhaa: is that correct opening?|pg||
nt|roswolf: more or less the par spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not in my view :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Unless it shows a good hand with 5-5 majors which I doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director was called|pg||
nt|rayhaa: strange defence too|pg||
nt|garnetts: Does anyone know?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Nicked a trick with the 8@C --which is odd too--|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: so if this is flat the Irish will record a 17-13 win over one of the favourites|pg||
nt|aupillon: sure. I'm asking myself the comments after discarding on board 9, at the apetizer, if one exists|pg||
nt|yke: 2 down on good defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this is going off|pg||
nt|ahalim: good judgment by Louk Verhees |pg||
pc|d7|nt|nickf: and probably have topay for their coffee for the rest of the week|pg||
nt|yke: now -1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|nickf: oh to be in San Remo and have coffee from one of the Lavazza girls|pg||
nt|nickf: it's a dream of mine|pg||
nt|rayhaa: looks like dir called than saw void|pg||
nt|garnetts: Have I been transported to an Alice in Wonderland game?  |pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6 finesse  :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: well it reminds me of an odd auction wherby it went 1NT    7NT   and not on lead the poor guy had AKQ10xx of clubs--the 7NT bidder added 5 points for a void which then added up to ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 37|pg||
nt|garnetts: All was well when his opartner who had xxx xxx xxx Jxxx found the odd lead of a low club|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: last board folks see you soon off to the usa|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|donatoru: :)oki andrei errare humanum est , good luck Romania for the next match|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: must be carefull not to shorten trumps too much in trying to get     back to hand to establish clubs|pg||
nt|ady: after ruffing 1 club   winning line is to draw trumps   and give up 2 club tricks    this works with either clubs 3-3  or  if not trumps 2-2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: Not a single expert led that :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|aupillon: Same here. For Norway too. |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 bad board at both table - and the match was over - hard life :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|duschek: I suspect this hand will be a push|pg||
nt|kit: I don't care for the lead from A10xx, but this time it came out ok -- not necessary to defeat the contract, of course|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is more surreal |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rayhaa: maybe will be a td ruling|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|serhat: Dec is playing for 8 safe tricks.. so an other flat board David. 4 imps victory for your team. congratulations|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|poussin: north might play king of @s, to get a signal by his partner|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|duschek: It's not that any other lead is attractive in view of the auction|pg||
nt|kit: the contract will be the same, but number of undertricks might vary|pg||
nt|duschek: Agree|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nickf: no, the coffee's back on the house. Duboin make this and Lavazza win 16-14.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 2 if he finesses hearts, 1 if he plays on diamonds|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|frankaus: at 3 imps a trick its quite a difference|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
mc|10|nt|fabsayc: good return|pg||
nt|serhat: may be not 4|pg||
nt|poussin: diamond was ok if partner had a trump left|pg||
