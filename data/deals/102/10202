mb|p|mb|6C|nt|daman: Who is who in this room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: you may want to keep an eye on the other match where winner becomes USA1  - tons of leader changes|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Chuck will get player names up as soon as he gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the Moss squad will be sitting on their hands waiting for breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chuck will enter names when he gets a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west is Sylvie Moss, North Sasha Cohen, East Migry Campanile, South Rozanne Pollack|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@S or 7@D all can make (all on Q@D hunt)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss in Closed Room bid the 6@S on board 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|daman: they are in 7 in the other room|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 4@H wasn't going to be pretty either|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kareno: No, with a spade lead (expected) that will go down as well.  Declarer can't see through the cards to figure out the club suit.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  no 2@D rebid I suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to try to multitask  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   then one window per table|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|jstokes: 9 tricks if played by W with a diamond lead, if declarer plays on hearts and takes 1st round finesse (lots of ifs but all reasonable)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: but in which denomination the 8 card fit or the 9 card fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: good thing South has the heart K|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT is a clear underbid|pg||
nt|jstokes: if they bid slam, that is|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d game forcing.  Diamonds are right-sided but.. break badly.  Slam will make, however, with the king of hearts with south on lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy -- another tortuous 3N with red Qx opposite Ax|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: in encyclopedia this is also called Rule of 15  [which has 2nd definition that covers a lead convention]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- we've found an 11 that I would NOT open :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: try Cansino Count Al,,,,,, easier to say :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i mean East -- not North|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: I knew Cansino as convention over opp 1N -- didn't know there was another meaning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 3@H [support DBL]|pg||
nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|an|SPL|mb|d|nt|mariner1: I was thinking they might find the A@C lead to beat 4....... no chance though on 83|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen not opening has really made things difficult for Pollack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: players closing eyes resting, while she thinks|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: is DBL takeout??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is 2N nat or scramble?|pg||

nt|lestergold: but what is happening to 4s?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kareno: Not making.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade dim and 2 club losers for example?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Not at this table, they won't.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS must define   2@S rebid guarantees 6  and either 2N=@C or 3@C needs sound opener|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone consider a 2@h overcall by west?  I sure would.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: 2N says not 6S, not 4D, not 4H|pg||

nt|kareno: 6@d makes n/s.  |pg||
mb|3S|nt|thegarve:  a tasy hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6s x looks like a pofitable save |pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it is, even with the break.  But you have to know absolutely that your two aces aren't cashing!!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  he doesn't know that the minor is such good @d to support |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is there such a word as frangible in this context and does it come up as often as its negative counterpart?|pg||
mb|5C|an|pass or correct|nt|lestergold: if n /s bid it then you will have a prettty good idea that ur two bullets arent cashing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think frangible exists but willin g to be  corrected|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute  open artificial forcing 1@C -- then make artificial Michaels Q|pg||
nt|thegarve:  double this and they can save in 6@s|pg||
nt|kareno: This is a high-pressure auction.  Great bid by north - he can support a red suit at that level.|pg||
nt|lestergold: im told by spec it does exist|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: If it's pass or correct, that would include clubs and one other suit, yes?|pg||
nt|jstokes: for the minor (pass or correct)|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd say frangible means breakable.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now 6@D?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  maybe he could bid 5@D to suggest a decent save|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Now the pressure is on Smith.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these guys should consider playing bridge professionally|pg||

nt|lestergold: u rarely see these hands saved vulnerbale but ive seen so many missed in this competition|pg||
nt|kareno: And Smith doesn't know if his clubs may produce a defensive trick.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  far too passive passing 5@C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Karen, OED frangible = breakable|pg||

nt|lestergold: ace clubs east shows out run 9 clubs and ruff out one ofr  the spade|pg||
