nt|jbgood: same contract - same result on   2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may well think that the @DQ lead has to be a singleton. On that basis, there is no great discrepancy in red-suit lengths between North and South - perhaps not enough to ...|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|s3|pg||

nt|jbgood: how to do that on a @d lead?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: someone had better bid it soon then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's always easier in the post-mortem. A 4@S cue-bid by Gunev would have done the trick. Popova would blackwood and count to 13 after the response|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Think 6@D showed the @DK, already knew about the @HK |pg||
