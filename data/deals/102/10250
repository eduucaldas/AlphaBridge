nt|xenya: 10-12 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|pelu: 1.2.3 seat nv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9½ - 11½|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit annoying for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still was in principle right to lead trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: and E's @D8 could have suddenly become a big card, had he exited witha small @D at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi peter|pg||
nt|haans: lsome|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bekkouche must hope that the double is negative; it usually is|pg||
nt|haans: easy really|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@HX will not be pretty|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so strong 1@c, 5 card majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: south makes a responsive double?|pg||
nt|pelu: a responsiv D sh show 4-3 in major|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: not this time Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she can escape for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ralf Willquist and Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D would work|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: fairly normal part score competitive auction|pg||
nt|asig: Ready for the football match tonight, Ralf?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h not a lead directive:)|pg||
nt|haans: 1C full opening bid direct 1M 2m weak opening bid 1@D BIG CLIUB|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S perhaps?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: 3@D or 3@S by N?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but a difficult hand|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C show only i have11-16 hcp|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW plays precision, 1@d can be void, 1NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another plus score for the Icelanders|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Seems overoptimistic after partner's sign-off|pg||
nt|kastan88: GE Christer, you are far South from us :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough boards to analyze, not sure the best defense here|pg||
nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: results so far: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is too optimistic by n/s imo|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -1 or -2|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: close, yes -- but not quite maybe -- i think EW can get 2 trumps, 2@Ds, 2@Cs and a @S|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 3NT ?|pg||
nt|xenya: they should do that quickly however|pg||

nt|kastan88: hot start, litlle bit overbid from Ahonen|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Definitely so aftwer a 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|m_niemi: stonger openings in 3rd and 4 th hand|pg||
nt|pelu: be nice - : "not the best"|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: your biew Shirley is a sensible view but not quite aggressive enough if you'll forgive me|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Denmark lost to Iceland in round 1 - Sweden won 24-6 agasit Estonia (not Nordic but the 6. team!)|pg||
nt|kastan88: and after sign off 3@H from partner|pg||
nt|haans: only 2@H|pg||

nt|haans: not many other can invite and stop at 2|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s= 11-16|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two weak spots, the 1@C can create problem, also the 1@D compared to precision|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: has east had a peak at south's cards no screens? long necks!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: E selecting "let pard play" option |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west promises a weak 2 in amajor why doesnt east want to play in the guaranteed 8 or even 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable for all she knows 4h is frigid|pg||
nt|asig: Christiansen on lead against 2@h in a moment|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems a system designed to make the opps do something stup[d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: (11)12-14|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR West (Cilleborg) found an opening i West: 1@H ???|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|asig: Better stay off his partner's suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the originator of big diamond systems of this general type was an american by the name of nail|pg||
nt|fabsayc: who played the "big diamond" in the 1960's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which of course we all played :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 6-9 no 3@h says cc|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cenglund:  4 clubs cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is very hard to comprehend am i missing something about their bidding asystem|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 7 tricks losing 5@c+@sA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: well it's 5-4-3-1 and 2 1/2 honour tricks|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Suggesting a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 13-15?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tjolpe:  so, what happened?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i guess on a @s lead from E|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike Gold here hi Raif|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon Mike!|pg||
nt|asig: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|fabsayc: these days i would need a hall pass to open a strong 1 diamond in north america|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm may be i should but even my darling wife would have defeated that contract|pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt = (11)12-14|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: bjarnarson kicked sweden down|pg||
nt|haans: OR may bid at least 3@H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I would play low from dummy:)|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt more then that up to 14/15|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cenglund:  Or maybe not, just showing extra values|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Kari Mäkikangas|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A lousy start for the Finnish ladies|pg||
pc|hA|nt|talion: hi all|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2NT= Lebensohl I guess, and still, now West riding on, with 18+, that's OK west has good support for both minors, that partner may have|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Anders|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: 2@D from East, 2@H and down 3 (300)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We lost all data in the closed room|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Hi|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kastan88: but IMO East had to say 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL THE SYSTEM WORKED TO PREVENT E/W FINDING THEIR DIAMOND FIT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: I mean am i MAD OR DREAMING ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some IMPs to Denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie is @hQ a nice return|pg||
nt|roswolf: small  is the technical play - blocks the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i dont understand the advantages of this method - it simply randomises who plays the contract and therefore will produce random swings on what should be flat boards|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: we can se, that @S4 would have won the game - best for sure @SK best chance|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: sorry keyboarditis|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kastan88: Hi Kari|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry presed caps lock by accident|pg||
nt|sybarra: very deep position by E |pg||
pc|s4|nt|kastan88: 2@D= 3...7 points only and may be 5+M; they have constructive 2M with 8...1 and 6-card|pg||
nt|m_niemi: next board|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: the advantage is to make opps go wrong|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cenglund:  The contract is not a great one|pg||
nt|lestergold: now shirley this is a bridge site|pg||
nt|haans: time for spades now|pg||
nt|haans: @C10 is a big card :)|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|c7|nt|pelu: but East sh have discard @S3 that will give decl the last trick|pg||
nt|talion: there was missunderstanding with the meaning on ahonens 2NT bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that explains some of it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cenglund:  probably 3 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i still cannot agree with  east's pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe E thought S would balance|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: safe line ensuring contract|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: and not :(|pg||
