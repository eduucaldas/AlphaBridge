mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This one is easy to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C starts the scramble |pg||
nt|lestergold: if easst bids hearts at some po9int theyll get there|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||

pc|s3|nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: 11 tricks shortly, if only Anni can stay connected|pg||
nt|kastan88: wake up all sleepers-kibitzers, come to watch!|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt leb? |pg||
nt|lestergold: i think this double is very unhelpful to partner|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: can it be made on a trump lead? -- easy 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: always 12|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good morning everybody|pg||

pc|s2|nt|xenya: 5@D is only -1|pg||
nt|xenya: or 2|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hearts 3-3 so not much ruffing needed|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kastan88: first  2 boards  success for Finland, how about this board?|pg||
nt|sybarra: should raise now,  W has a big hand for @H's and she did|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hi Ellen|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the 10 was unlucky|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gavin: west has to stop low|pg||
mb|3D|nt|capercliff: here is a slam im sure they will get to|pg||
nt|gavin: lets see if ew have some sort of lebensohl agreement here|pg||
nt|gavin: some people play 2nt here says i have a bad hand, some play it scrambling|pg||
nt|caitlin: not uncommon over this double to have such an agreement|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C on NS, 3NT down|pg||
nt|gowdy: @S and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot compete against this|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: 6NT by north the top spot, but 6@D also excellent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, drinks for all on me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict 4h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: assuming they have some kind of two way new minor available|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probs in this contract with the hands so well fitting|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what is 2@H, maybe a relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they opt for the Moysian @S fit it will be a problem|pg||
nt|caitlin: a support double?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: value showing|pg||
nt|lestergold: prob make 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Double or 4S bid will come|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|caitlin: shows the need for the 2NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if it is, doubling is likely to help opponents|pg||
nt|gavin: was wrong about the line up|pg||
nt|gavin: they did runt he same 4 again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even with lebensohl likely to try 4|pg||
nt|gavin: agree, west hand is so huge, hard to judge|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh What agood bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C good bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: great bidding|pg||
nt|raghavan: Martin did N hear you saying 5C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well yesterday he made good bids i did not say|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna can lead singleton spade but never gets partner in|pg||
nt|raghavan: North reasoningmay be S did not bid 3S over 3H so may be S 3 cards so clubs in S hand is assured|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: north can see at trick one that the only chance to beat this hand is his partner having the Jack of hearts since clubs are frozen if the Q and K are reversed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: wolperts main worry is xx in diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi folks!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hi Martin and Sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: and hello to our wonderful operator, Karen, aka macaw on BBO @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good analysis|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gavin: he will overtake the spade to play another spade|pg||
nt|gavin: hoping declarer leads a high heart from dummy|pg||
nt|gavin: giving him 1 extra chance to beat the hand |pg||
nt|gavin: if his partner has 9x of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho may be a prob for south with last club so mayube only 2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|capercliff: pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT i guess is pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will bid 6@d I would guess, holding 4 small @c's|pg||
nt|gavin: leading a 4th round and having his partner ruff high in hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Martin|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|sharynr: ty Roland|pg||

pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: misinterpreted the 5nt|pg||

nt|caitlin: CWTC, owns a major bridge club here|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphznx: lost the play :(|pg||
nt|gowdy: tell them to slow it down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not that exciting a hand  i think two spades made unless defence errs|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gavin: i guess the word faster|pg||
nt|gavin: and jurek|pg||
nt|gavin: dont go together that well|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you here?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|roswolf: nice start|pg||
nt|m_niemi: tx kibs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 9-12|pg||
nt|xenya: 10-12 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|pelu: 1.2.3 seat nv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9½ - 11½|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit annoying for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still was in principle right to lead trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: and E's @D8 could have suddenly become a big card, had he exited witha small @D at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi peter|pg||
nt|haans: lsome|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Bekkouche must hope that the double is negative; it usually is|pg||
nt|haans: easy really|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@HX will not be pretty|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so strong 1@c, 5 card majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: south makes a responsive double?|pg||
nt|pelu: a responsiv D sh show 4-3 in major|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: not this time Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she can escape for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ralf Willquist and Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D would work|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: fairly normal part score competitive auction|pg||
nt|asig: Ready for the football match tonight, Ralf?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h not a lead directive:)|pg||
nt|haans: 1C full opening bid direct 1M 2m weak opening bid 1@D BIG CLIUB|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D or 3@S by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but a difficult hand|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C show only i have11-16 hcp|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW plays precision, 1@d can be void, 1NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another plus score for the Icelanders|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Seems overoptimistic after partner's sign-off|pg||
nt|kastan88: GE Christer, you are far South from us :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough boards to analyze, not sure the best defense here|pg||
nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: results so far: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is too optimistic by n/s imo|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -1 or -2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: close, yes -- but not quite maybe -- i think EW can get 2 trumps, 2@Ds, 2@Cs and a @S|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 3NT ?|pg||
nt|xenya: they should do that quickly however|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to bid - and stop - after 3@C by East|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tjolpe:  can u bid it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 4c has play in any case|pg||
nt|asig: This hand should be over in a second - 10 easy tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@d= 5+M+5+m, weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: a combined 22hcp and no long suit - i think it is clear that someone overbid|pg||
nt|pelu: @C to K and @HQ will give S an chance|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N thought S has Ms|pg||
nt|pelu: and a responsiv X sh show major|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but really this sort of bidding is not suitable for a high level tournament|pg||
nt|pelu: the 3@H bid from S is - as I see it - the problem - that is FG on 10 HCP|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@d goes down too, 3@s is not fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but south paased originally - therefore north knows the values for game are not present|pg||
nt|m_niemi: with strong hand N can bid 4@c|pg||
nt|pelu: so N sh pass to 3@H - no|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so 3@d isn't that strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed peter but he should play bridge rather than slaveishly follow system|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: but pard (W) said she had zilch with the rais |pg||
nt|haans: gustavsson won swedish championships three years running. claimed he was lucky|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cenglund:  Heart lead would have been different story|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -1 if def makes an error in trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not really, I am staying in Finland for the moment|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: declarer is obliging -- back to 2 ruffs now|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he could have made it by playing a high @D|pg||
nt|pelu: just what I told him .)|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should really find it easy to take at least 5 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|pelu: easy for us|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kastan88: wow, I thought you in South Africa :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Shirley this is a bidders game |pg||
nt|lestergold: east knows pard is shor in  dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: so as long as there is good club support she can push|pg||
nt|sybarra: true but I also do not like going for 300/500 agst zip |pg||
nt|lestergold: you dont have to make everything u bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c can lose one club one spade and one heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: its actually a good point Mike |pg||
nt|lestergold: it wont be doubled into game on this sort of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: o vont to win or u want to sit there and let opps roll in easy contracts|pg||
nt|haans: would be interesting to know why they have left swedish clubs ( = weak/strong1@C) for pure Big Clubs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: but of course there is still room for a defensive error|pg||
pc|dK|nt|m_niemi: duck|pg||
nt|pelu: dont take @HJ - wait for a signal from pd!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but high level bridge is doing sensible things and avoiding mistakes|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S passed, so E has @sA|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N seems a make on a @S finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont know any players who dont makes mistakes .)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|m_niemi: or @dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: @D discart or @C10|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now -2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|m_niemi: ew uses Roman discard|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but maing the fewest wins matches|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so odd = pos, even is lavinthal|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 of spades would be cool|pg||
nt|pelu: so now West know that S has @DA + @CK + @HD = pd has @SA - sh Holmes!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @d9 is pos in @d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  It's surprising that West coul ddouble 2@H|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  most players use negative doubles here to day|pg||
nt|roswolf: pprecisely Dr Watson|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|m_niemi: NS: 1@c= 12-16 unbal or 15-17 bal, 1@d = 17+, 1@h@s/2@c/@d=8-11 nat, 1NT = 12-14|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: i think looking at the compeitive bidding on this hand your singleton heart and dummy's  marked singleton diamond or much more relevant than how many points partner has for her ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak raise|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I want to enjoy the lovely Finnish summer - whew|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|pelu: No low-high by EW|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: good fight - from both sides|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok dear|pg||
nt|m_niemi: !A -> @c10 from E=> no problems|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: terrible defence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: now can set|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: what did E had in mind when he returned a small @D i wonder? |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you are right Mike on reflection, you may not lose any @C'son the hand |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: at high level bridge many matches are determined on the part score judgement rather than the big hands which tend to produces pushes|pg||

nt|shals: Good evening this game is being played in beautiful Penticton B>C> I am joining Caitlin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy but "slow" 3nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: all 3 of these players, I believe are from Toronto, certainly Hanna Nader, Jim Green, Darren Wolpert|pg||
nt|caitlin: or Czyz may be Montreal, not sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: match tightened up a little in the last segment|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: don't ask me|pg||
mb|3D|nt|caitlin: welcome Shirley Laidaw|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: but i think if wolpert had heart ace, would have cued at some point, similarly with void|pg||

nt|raghavan: NS may play in 1NTor 2C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C has come|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades, double presumably hearts|pg||
nt|caitlin: at Open Table Carruthers, who has won many championships, is from Toronto, his partner Joey Silver from Montreal and L'Ecuyer and Fergani from Quebec|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: with the heart entries in easts hand , north can probably scramble together 10 or 11 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharynr: should East return to 4@S now?|pg||

pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: hi Glen|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: if defence open up hearts for example Green may end up with a trick|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unfortunate lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: and we end with a flat board - probably|pg||
nt|capercliff: there are many other ways he could have persued a grand slam on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this broadcast will continue all day, see bbo schedule for time|pg||
nt|capercliff: bye all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might have tried 5@S with hannas hand, he can be sure 6@C is down|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is your itenary, gavin?|pg||
nt|gavin: 8 1/2 hour flight to nyc, go into the city for a few hours (5 hour layover) to hang out with friends, then back to the airport for a 6 hour flight to calgary, another hour to banff ...|pg||
nt|gavin: before i quit for the night |pg||
nt|caitlin: Gavin is also a Wolpert .........Darren playing South:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: nice lead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: welcome to segment 3 of the Canadian finals from always sunny Penticton|pg||
nt|caitlin: for declarer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Karen, to the commentators, spectators for their comments, to BBO for allowing us to see bridge from everywhere, and to the CBF for arranging this broadcast|pg||
nt|gavin: then spending sunday driving through banff which ive never done before|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|shals: ok|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharynr: I wonder if  Daniel would have guess @D in 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: and finally get there sunday night , relax have breakfast monday and show up for the ko|pg||
nt|shals: Banff and the trip to the Okanagan is spectacular!|pg||
nt|caitlin: to Penticton??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: warning you will have your picture taken 20 times and be asked to take pictures at least that many times|pg||
nt|caitlin: where you going for KO?|pg||
nt|gavin: penticton|pg||
nt|gavin: regional starts monday night|pg||
nt|caitlin: awesome|pg||
nt|gavin: sucks that i will miss my mom and bro by a day|pg||
nt|lestergold: Green will try to force/encourage the defence to open up something to his advantage|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: needed to cash a second spade before the diamond|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharynr: I guess Jim made it easier|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: a club exit is safe|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|shals: ok Gavin, I will bring my camera, then?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin: so when he knocks out the heart, he will be able to squeeze hughes in hearts and spades for his 11th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is a dim but it removes an exit card from north|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gavin: he is being a little carefull here not wanting to discard a diamond until its late enough in the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if hughes ducks|pg||
nt|gavin: u got it :)|pg||
nt|gavin: so if he ducks he can still negotiate it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club of course may not have been safe from Grainer's point of view|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gavin: cashes a couple clubs and its the same squeeze in a different way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: run the spades now |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gavin: jurek can claim|pg||
nt|gavin: but fast ....|pg||
nt|gavin: this actually works as a double squeeze now|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|gavin: he has a complete claim because if turner has the 4th spade|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin: then he will be squeezed in spades and diamond|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: tightening up the position|pg||
nt|lestergold: hoping for an endplay here|pg||
nt|gowdy: now tighten them up with trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must guess to run the diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi martin|pg||

nt|kastan88: hot start, litlle bit overbid from Ahonen|pg||

nt|m_niemi: stonger openings in 3rd and 4 th hand|pg||
nt|pelu: be nice - : "not the best"|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: your biew Shirley is a sensible view but not quite aggressive enough if you'll forgive me|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: Denmark lost to Iceland in round 1 - Sweden won 24-6 agasit Estonia (not Nordic but the 6. team!)|pg||
nt|kastan88: and after sign off 3@H from partner|pg||
nt|haans: only 2@H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h= 11-16 unbal|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kastan88: time for game on EW-line, must be routine 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D=mulit,  weak in a major|pg||
nt|haans: sundelin nt 2@H invite|pg||
nt|haans: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|haans: sylvan has to many queens to bid|pg||
nt|haans: but 4 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: not many other can invite and stop at 2|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s= 11-16|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two weak spots, the 1@C can create problem, also the 1@D compared to precision|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: has east had a peak at south's cards no screens? long necks!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: E selecting "let pard play" option |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west promises a weak 2 in amajor why doesnt east want to play in the guaranteed 8 or even 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable for all she knows 4h is frigid|pg||
nt|asig: Christiansen on lead against 2@h in a moment|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems a system designed to make the opps do something stup[d|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: (11)12-14|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR West (Cilleborg) found an opening i West: 1@H ???|pg||
mb|4H|nt|asig: Better stay off his partner's suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the originator of big diamond systems of this general type was an american by the name of nail|pg||
nt|fabsayc: who played the "big diamond" in the 1960's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which of course we all played :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 6-9 no 3@h says cc|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  4 clubs cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is very hard to comprehend am i missing something about their bidding asystem|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 7 tricks losing 5@c+@sA|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well it's 5-4-3-1 and 2 1/2 honour tricks|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Suggesting a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 13-15?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  so, what happened?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i guess on a @s lead from E|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike Gold here hi Raif|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon Mike!|pg||
nt|asig: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|fabsayc: these days i would need a hall pass to open a strong 1 diamond in north america|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm may be i should but even my darling wife would have defeated that contract|pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt = (11)12-14|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: bjarnarson kicked sweden down|pg||
nt|haans: OR may bid at least 3@H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I would play low from dummy:)|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt more then that up to 14/15|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cenglund:  Or maybe not, just showing extra values|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Kari Mäkikangas|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A lousy start for the Finnish ladies|pg||
pc|cK|nt|talion: hi all|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2NT= Lebensohl I guess, and still, now West riding on, with 18+, that's OK west has good support for both minors, that partner may have|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Anders|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D from East, 2@H and down 3 (300)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: We lost all data in the closed room|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Hi|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kastan88: but IMO East had to say 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL THE SYSTEM WORKED TO PREVENT E/W FINDING THEIR DIAMOND FIT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: I mean am i MAD OR DREAMING ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some IMPs to Denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie is @hQ a nice return|pg||
nt|roswolf: small  is the technical play - blocks the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i dont understand the advantages of this method - it simply randomises who plays the contract and therefore will produce random swings on what should be flat boards|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: we can se, that @S4 would have won the game - best for sure @SK best chance|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: sorry keyboarditis|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kastan88: Hi Kari|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: sorry presed caps lock by accident|pg||
nt|sybarra: very deep position by E |pg||
pc|h5|nt|kastan88: 2@D= 3...7 points only and may be 5+M; they have constructive 2M with 8...1 and 6-card|pg||
nt|m_niemi: next board|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: the advantage is to make opps go wrong|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The contract is not a great one|pg||
nt|lestergold: now shirley this is a bridge site|pg||
nt|haans: time for spades now|pg||
nt|haans: @C10 is a big card :)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: good morning and welcome to the Canadian Bridge Federation Finals from Penticton, BC|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hello Martin x 2|pg||
nt|Walddk12: and George|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D is makeable but requires good guessing for sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: does that show 5-4?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: at this vul probably could be 4-4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it came up in set 1|pg||
nt|caitlin: increasingly popular these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: opponents got to 5@D, and escaped undoubled but down 4|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good evening from Dublin|pg||
mb|2S|nt|caitlin: Martin they haven't played this board??|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am confused|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score detroit|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh from set one|pg||
nt|glen: S suspects what the minor is|pg||
nt|susieq: I'm a little surprised Grainger didn't open that 3@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcarroll: Hi Martin, George|pg||
nt|caitlin: Last year Carruthers came in second for Worlds|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT may be better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: is this worth a superaccept?|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suit is blocked and north endplayed|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes end play from the club of course as long as Green reads the position|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2-1 my boys are making a come back:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: a 2@H opening in first set, caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: now I understand, thanks:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: duh|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: apparently 1NT shows more than a bare 6 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for results so far http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/09files/BWeek09_results.html|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W's interference may have prevented NS from reaching their 5-5 @D fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: click on date time and event|pg||
nt|mittmouse: lets see if turner makes the good technical play of a low club back not that it helps|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi martin x2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi George|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi george|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best they can do is cash club, heart, and play a heart|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Making3|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Lost the play, will claim out the hand when they are done. sorry |pg||
nt|fabsayc: some partnerships use 2@S over 2@H as a relay, would have been handy here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will come close to duplicating the undertricks here|pg||
nt|caitlin: I actually like Bergen super accepts|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: perhaps only 2, declarer drawing 2 trumps and playing diamonds for safety|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would think most play 8-10|pg||
nt|caitlin: what do I really care.....the Maple Leafs going nowhere ever so let's have THREE teams here..Hamilton, downtown and Downsview park..let them ALL in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek needed to put in the queen, forcing declarer to win|pg||
nt|caitlin: and unblock?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|shals: would all of you lead the j?|pg||
nt|caitlin: depending if you playing Jack denies|pg||
nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: if Eddie Kantar were here he would have a FIT re: lead of Jack:)|pg||
nt|shals: iguess that is where I'm coming from|pg||
nt|caitlin: regardless of HCP you super accept with 9 card fit.. and more to it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: enlighten us Ellen|pg||
nt|raghavan: llen - since S did not make a bid they must be opening with 12 Points ( We were seeing lighter openings in other USA matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes surprising|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8 loser hand I would open|pg||
nt|glen: it helps if W has two ways to bid 3H over 2@S, one to show a great hand|pg||
nt|glen: here E has two bullets (aces) and a fit, so 4@H regardless|pg||
nt|glen: now at this time declarer thinks N's minor is @Cs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|caitlin: guess they don't play that|pg||
nt|raghavan: any lead helps|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Darren is not shy|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a great lead for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only suit that really matters is spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: e/w have 5 hearts to cash if they get the chance given a heart lead unlikely unless Green finds a double|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|caitlin: I like Rusinow leads by far best|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes easier|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: especially in this case|pg||
nt|gowdy: well S has show a 3 suite|pg||
nt|fabsayc: korbel wisely pulls|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|caitlin: gets rid of one heart loser|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|shals: the 8 might make pd play the q|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes now he doesnt have to worry about the @Ha|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: the 4-1 spades may slow things down|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club and HK are favourably placed|pg||
nt|raghavan: another H may go on Clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: 9 easy tricks here. should not take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n porbably going off as not likley to take dim finesse in 3n|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@S however, seems too much|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d has reasonable play|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|shals: it still can do damage|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 10|pg||
nt|caitlin: look it how close this match is|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: took his 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: even Rolan would have doubts about playing 6d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: arggh|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my money is with the defenc|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could make on cross ruff except that fourth heart will be overruffed|pg||
nt|lestergold: this slam has more holes in it than one of them mousetrap cheeses|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D 22 @S king  @C q ruffs out onside  too good for Roland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but it looks makeable|pg||
nt|glen: and the D took care of that|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes Jurek (North) might have made another move|pg||
nt|lestergold: can it be made double dummy?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: 12 tricks looks difficult|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently no does not have quite the entries to south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: both made a cue bid too many - the KH metited an un cue bid if that were possible|pg||
nt|gowdy: ani nteresting push vs 3nt with big upside   sort of shows why slams should have better play thanthis as 5 @D could win big|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
mc|10|nt|fabsayc: i truely dont understand a club play|pg||
nt|caitlin: E-W played in safe 3D on board 17 for 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|glen: if S had given a @C ruff, it was just ruffing one of declarer's losers|pg||

nt|cenglund:  I thought it was Lebensohl, but I was wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|lestergold: with so many points what did she expect south to balance with- on a multi auction the [passout seat is not a balancing seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hi Bob@H@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|kastan88: still i don't like such advantages, too much pressure to partner, and i am with you Mike, i would bid 2@H not passing, partner could have  6S3-1D3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the theory becomes different- in the pass out seat you are  in the trap in effect weven though east hasnt spoken|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H or 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: or pass|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h and 5@d were easy, or 3NT by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yp|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|haans: any opening is to advantage|pg||
nt|m_niemi: it's a swedish system:)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: tjolpe & co|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kastan88: hmm I thought that was Lebensohl too|pg||
nt|talion: 1@c = 15+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes my vote 2 (just)|pg||
mb|3C|an|LR 4 trumps|nt|Walddk2: South has the option to sit for it or to escape by showing both majors|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Precision or some other strong club opening, I presume|pg||
nt|talion: skuladotti is tempted to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Bob|pg||
nt|haans: must be transfer|pg||
nt|m_niemi: but do they play it in Sweden?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@H by N might even make?|pg||
nt|xenya: or W might run?|pg||
nt|pelu: if S wont to run - the West can just sit and wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 boards compared now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the tables are not linked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: flat  3 and 5  to Sweden|pg||
nt|pelu: so 1-1 now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room Finns have 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: not really popular|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: Auken perhaps hoping pard is strong enuf to double again|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might end up in a thin slam but very anti - odds|pg||
nt|m_niemi: like Greek gift?|pg||
nt|haans: very few play magic|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: so still 0-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @s-lead was nice|pg||
mb|5C|an|splinter|nt|cenglund:  3NT is piece of cake|pg||
nt|lestergold: but doesnt want to push south out of spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm ok but the system has to deliver in constructive auctions - most international pairs know how to defend against such systems especially in major championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the no science route|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so ½-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a good day n/s would bid 6@S and it would roll home but today best keep low|pg||
nt|haans: yes that why Magic|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kastan88: Hi Bob, |pg||
nt|mcphee: just getting an idea whats being played|pg||
nt|haans: no double = good bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D = negavtiv, 1@H = nat or 20+|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: should make plenty |pg||
nt|mcphee: these sort of hands really offer little play choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant agree with the 3nt call - why cant 6@D be frigid |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: magic is allowed passing with strong hand forbidden|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|talion: yes it is, but it could have been very poor contract if nurmi has minimum 15 points for her opening|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: declarer may get home if she plays on the black suits however playing on dims looks doomed|pg||
nt|mcphee: why|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D Q is ok|pg||
nt|haans: may make|pg||
nt|haans: @HK a joker|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this would be in jeopardy if spade queen not falling|pg||
nt|haans: all bids in magic is allowed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|asig: It looks as if 9 tricks is the limit in hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that diamonds don't break 3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you play strong club then use your system tools to investigate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have to rebid 1@H forcing, if available|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can find NS's CC (2 pages) here (in two parts) http://www.bridgefinland.com/NM2009/bm/showteam.php?team=1|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: because defence can come to 3heqrts a dim and two bullets|pg||
nt|mcphee: although still needs to develop other tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: this line is going to work even better|pg||
nt|pelu: and for rest of the bidding I need help :(:(:(|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: i think east perhaps with her two doubles had bid here values and that the fourth heart was optinmistic|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: and continue with 2@D over a semi-forced 1@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|m_niemi: i@h = nat or bal|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N prob. has told his shape and strength|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|asig: Covering the @cQ was a mistake, I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorroh wrong sex|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Also this @s return!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph return is better |pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: here were n/s sacrificing or bidding to make ? sounds to me they were bidding to make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: this is likely to make, decalrer losing 2@Cs, a @S and 2 trumps |pg||
nt|haans: you can find longer text in swedish site syskon http://www.syskon.nu/frames/main.htm|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: Noe Jens has his chance|pg||
nt|asig: Now its making|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: With a  trumph return W had no chance to cover his 2 losers|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT and 2@c, tx to kibs|pg||
nt|pelu: In board 1 (33) the danes sold out to 2@S - with play for 4@H and a lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: a lot of bidding to a safe spot|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cenglund:  9 tricks are always cold even if the majors did not break|pg||
nt|jakow: HI, I can help with Magic Bidding comments|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I bet you can since you devised the system|pg||
nt|kastan88: hello Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk4: was it with Lasse Andersson?|pg||
nt|jakow: Yes Vitås Garozzo - Lars Andersson|pg||

nt|caitlin: with 15 and pd could have 17...last board... should make a move|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey great convention, gets you 400 every time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we missed the key defensive play|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dent in the lead perhaps altho could be in 3n in the open going off too|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: david grainger wins the Lord Yarborough cup|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: a little smaller than the Stanley Cup|pg||
nt|sharynr: is this 1NT an upgrade or part of the range?|pg||
nt|susieq: systemically that shows a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|susieq: at least according to what I have here|pg||
nt|caitlin: so this is the finals of the CNTC|pg||
nt|glen: 4@C is a splinter, and as you can see from the E hand, partnerships have to agree on how little it can have for working high card points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east hand may actually be above their minimum, but poorly placed|pg||
nt|glen: 4@D here, as played by many experts, is "last train" - last bid below 4@H - it says I like my hand, but may or may not have a @D card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so much depends on cue bid style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last train has its own set of problems|pg||
mb|4D|nt|fabsayc: seems like a bid showing majors for me|pg||
nt|susieq: oh my mistake- it's a weak notrump, so it just shows values|pg||
nt|sharynr: or just a good old fashioned penalty double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they play Woolsey?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|sharynr: pretty good weakie :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if grainger establishes the spades west must ruff the fourth, leaving losing heart in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S  and I think bid now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid quickly and down quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the least of which is easts 4@S can be ace or king|pg||
nt|glen: for one of the famous Gitelman articles: http://www.imp-bridge.nl/articles/2over1b.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|glen: this is before in moved from toronto, and now names conventions on the songs of vegas acts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna is out of bids in my opinion|pg||
nt|glen: *this was before he|pg||
nt|glen: yup, he was worth 1 try, not 2|pg||
nt|glen: unless their splinters promise a moose (grizzly in BC)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ew needed to get in the bidding here|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N would fare fine|pg||
nt|mcarroll: who will bid NT?|pg||
nt|raghavan: W I presume|pg||
nt|caitlin: I might have bid 2H with Nader's hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if E bids 3@S W may venture 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will bid again S and W 3NT |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt by west down on spade lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: ah it will take a while |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: easy 3@S, and 2@D can be made|pg||
nt|sharynr: risky pass, David should expect a void|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bidding may be riskier|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: this should go down|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is a skinny 2N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: several chances to lead spades|pg||
pc|s8|nt|caitlin: so then Canada and Mexico vie for spot in Brazil|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: possibly 3@S now|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna is President of Canadian Bridge Federation which sponsors the CNTC's|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|raghavan: RE has bid twice- 5 cards why develop|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: Bermuda used to be part of that but has spot in Central American zone|pg||
nt|caitlin: for Canadian Bridge Federation CNTC see: http://www.cbf.ca/CNTC/|pg||
nt|caitlin: is this a 2NT catch up bid?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just an overbid in my view|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|raghavan: H lead prob|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|caitlin: Darren's 9 asks for spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: C 9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: declarer on the winning line|pg||
nt|lestergold: an auction likely to  be duplicated tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club club and club wuill give declarer a losing option to go down 2|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|sharynr: excellent result for N-S|pg||
nt|caitlin: Darren Wolpert (not to be confused with his brother Galvin) and Czyzowicz are aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|raghavan: S can take 2 Spade only|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gowdy: not sure about that  north has an interesting hand  depends on meathods |pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4s bid is normal becuase either it makes or if it doesnt it prevents e/w  however here i think e/w liimit was 3 dims|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed, 3NT makes EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the carnage if NS declare, nobody wants to know|pg||
nt|caitlin: I believe reverse smith echo here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moose here also|pg||
mc|11|nt|caitlin: sorry Gavin |pg||

nt|ralfwil: an optimistic 4@h in OR|pg||
nt|asig: Lots of action in the closed room on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had to use the 3@D jump i think i would try 3nt also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving 3@D for at most 1 loser suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward hand|pg||
nt|haans: you can find full text somewere at internet (i found it long ago)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: 4@d I mean|pg||
nt|asig: Open, sorry|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kastan88: why? I have played here in Estonia long time in 80's early 90's Estonian strong pass system called "Otstavel" by co-author (or Tartu Stick). Was amazing time|pg||
nt|haans: trash bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s= unbal 8-11|pg||
nt|m_niemi: can they find @h fit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a valuation problem now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = natural|pg||
nt|m_niemi: their 1@c-def: X = Ms, 1NT = ms|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might not be able to show his shape|pg||
nt|pelu: suit - but no HCP?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  The play Weak NT, I suppose|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d= 0-7 or any GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: always bid over a strong club at this vul if you have any kind of long suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|talion: 1NT is 12-14 in first & second position and 15-17 in third & fourth position|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone else not want to forgive him :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its unforgettable|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i confused unforgiveible with unforgettable|pg||
nt|mcphee: not so terrible a @D slam this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: but im english argggghhh|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes at this vul east chose 2s in open room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: i fancy north didnt like to pass|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jakow: @D FG or weak|pg||
nt|jakow: 15-17nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: which may have supercharged the auction|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 11-rule:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the weak part of these systems is inspired/semi-lunatic intervention|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cenglund:  Ducking is safe|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice surprise in @c|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: here is a good test for any system lots of tricks but 2 fast losers - lets see what happens|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 15-17 now bidding start|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is extremely light for a penalty double|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A diamond preference would help partner|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: most english can neither speak or write their native language|pg||
nt|asig: This should make|pg||
nt|haans: @DK second so very easy make|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: terrible...as in it doesnt make |pg||
nt|mcphee: not in favor of this 2N rebid at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: there speaks a retired headmaster|pg||
nt|kastan88: nice cold (or gold) humour, as usual, Mike :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well facing 8-11 he probably thought that this was a fair shot|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @s4= @d-signal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what discards are they using, lavinthal?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Roman|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: most headmaster can either by the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|cenglund:  Now it's only about fighting for overtricks|pg||
nt|talion: now ahonen has double stopper in hearts. if danielsdot had lead high heart, then ahonen could have taken only one heart trick|pg||
nt|talion: but with no side entry, low heart lead seems reasonable|pg||
nt|asig: One loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence may put pressure when aqce and another club is played if north ducks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps E has a guess in @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: odd= pos, even= lavinthal|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland very dissapoined about no slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably right play by defence|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT-1 or -2 is cheap against 4@h|pg||
nt|haans: the text 'now bidding start' is standard for the system |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: its not mps!|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer wont make many tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: no real exploration of the hands possibilites - just a close your eyes jump to 3nt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jakow: Ask EBL!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: this will go off but it will be a few 50's only|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room N opens 17+ 1@d|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|fabsayc: we are on at 9:30, 12, 4:30 and 7 tomorrow for the remaining 4 sets|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all time PDT|pg||
nt|caitlin: ohhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|glen: S has a good @H fit, but soft values in the other suits, and no ruffing value|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|gavin: 4-3 pittsburgh, thats practically like bringing the cup to canada|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double support|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: showing hearts, adds a lot of possible new sequences |pg||
nt|capercliff: is this only after a X?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure, is good any time in my opinion|pg||
nt|gavin: about as close as were gonna get for a while|pg||
nt|caitlin: "practically"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do you figure that gavin|pg||
nt|gavin: our young superstar wins|pg||
nt|lestergold: tame 3n here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a quackery|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: these transfer responses ar gaining popularity everywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: i quite like it after a double, puts the doubler on lead but requires lots of notes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this tricky lead is going to backfire|pg||
nt|fabsayc: erase my last comment, lost the plot :)|pg||
nt|gavin: vancouver is the only canadian team with a hope|pg||
nt|shals: I agree but great story  for the underdogs|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@C??|pg||
nt|shals: I hope!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hope springs eternal, go whitecaps|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: 3NT is the simplest bid available|pg||
pc|h3|nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: Gavin would you bid 3C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gosh i must be old, i pass in second seat|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is risky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but quite a play problem|pg||
nt|raghavan: Which is the 9th trick? |pg||
nt|mcarroll: He has to find one of the @SJ,@DQ or @CQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will probably attempt to combine chances|pg||
nt|raghavan: C Q difficult|pg||
nt|gowdy: looks like coffee ( or wine ) time here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|caitlin: 6@S|pg||
nt|caitlin: moi aussi|pg||
nt|shals: me too|pg||
nt|gavin: i wouldnt open :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash top cards in one minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: with hearts 3/3 and the qc as entry no probs in this contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that tame, saved by heart split and club ace right|pg||
nt|glen: dummy comes down and declarer thinks should I work out on how 4@S would do - no first, play this|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gavin: but no i wouldnt bid|pg||
pc|d8|nt|caitlin: 3@C Fit showing jump by passed hand|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect hand to pass and make an unusual 2NT bid later|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: not bergen?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey just asking|pg||
nt|caitlin: why not drury then?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|shals: yes it is|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why i said it was tame as the cards lie not in an absoluiter sense|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Karen our operator?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but does he have a losing alternative, perhaps not|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Karen:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I almost fell asleep in the sun:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so he has to establish clubs and that means spades will be established and he cannot lose the lead again|pg||
nt|lestergold: so its a one shot contract|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharynr: good stop by E-W|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Gowdy:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: down 1 or numerous overtricks on this defense|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome|pg||
pc|d9|nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: what if korbel ducks two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then the hearts squeeze hanna|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharynr: looks like N-S make 21H so even down 1 is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry, they are playing too fast and lost thread |pg||
nt|sharynr: but that was a reasonable shift|pg||
nt|mittmouse: technically hanna should now try a club if that is wrong he has to take a s finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: good point G|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so saved by the diamond 9 then|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: or possibly cash @Ss to check if they are 3-3 or the J falls, then 2 top @Cs|pg||
nt|raghavan: finessing towards w is likely - since W may not know that H K is alone|pg||
nt|caitlin: he will finesse West for @DQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna will try K then lead low to the Q better odds than playing anything else|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|caitlin: I think any bid showing spade support would have turned Turner on:)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: crosby doing pushups with the cup|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green gave count|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna knows that the ace will be held up otherwise|pg||
nt|caitlin: so David Grainger and Daniel Korbel|pg||
nt|lestergold: better unblock hearts now he will of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did he really pitch a heart?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he did hes dead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|shals: woops this is going to be tough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a crystal ball tuner, Mike|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gavin: 2 down with a winning finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks misere from here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching a spade gives up any chance of a make|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: for me 3@C would be clubs only|pg||
nt|caitlin: I see 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good save against 2@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: upside down|pg||
nt|glen: yes, but he was doing it in hope to entice a @S play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: no X no trouble?|pg||
nt|shals: maybe|pg||
nt|caitlin: let's remember these guys may be TIRED|pg||
nt|gavin: oh ya, this is a gruelling event to say the least|pg||
pc|s6|nt|caitlin: for me FSJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand and in competition|pg||
nt|caitlin: they didn't get here without lots of play|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't we all..|pg||
nt|gavin: its an achievement to be in the finals but the losing team probably wont feel that way|pg||
nt|shals: true..|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmm|pg||
pc|s7|nt|capercliff: this is going well for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north will just keep discarding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open Room got to 4@D on 3|pg||
nt|gambit: To all you hockey fans Pitt wins 2-1 in a nailbiter |pg||
nt|glen: though the D can clearly see that a @H discard is called for|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: what does 1@H show?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@dX made in deal 1, 11 to Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: 1H show 0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: 2nt must be a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a trappy hand for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D openeron the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: for weak to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 30 imps in 3 boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S may be 3 cards|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: three spades|pg||
nt|haans: lucky he has more|pg||
mb|p|nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is another example of inadequate fighting ofr the part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: sensible idea to me also Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i can see how this made|pg||
nt|asig: Win the ace, to rounds of trumps an another diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ruffs with his mony and then fourth dim takes care of club an d a club is ruffed in dummy! what an extraordinary position|pg||
nt|asig: *two|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a perfectly normal defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets it thru|pg||
nt|asig: Einarsson should work this out on the bidding|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cenglund:  Not among the best 3NTs I have seen|pg||
nt|talion: very optimistic bidding here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: u do not win letting vul opps play in 2 of a minor normally|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you havent notice yet,  Mike had his "wheaties" for breakfast this morning,   making quite agressive |pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW has 22 hcp and some long suits, no bids|pg||
nt|roswolf: that certainly kept e/w out but imo both e +w should have bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cenglund:  If they lead 3rd and 5th best Q would have been a better card|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: declarer is unlikely to gey @Cs right, then it will be for S to find a @S switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: what planet is this the standard contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cenglund:  Ahonen could work out that there is no hope in spades|pg||
nt|xenya: *get|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now -1|pg||
nt|asig: if the defence finds the club shift|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cenglund:  Duck is necessary|pg||
pc|sK|nt|talion: at the other table south opened 3@c and played there|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: now she is home -- losing an imp|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh no|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think N should have doubled 3@h|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: how can east work this out ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: even now not too late|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|m_niemi: he has great hand + defensive values|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|cenglund:  A few vulnerable undertricks to be expected|pg||

nt|sharynr: and Hanna must have taken that line|pg||
nt|gavin: hughest hand is way too strong for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
nt|gavin: very difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no down 1 on this defense|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: i think he must have done it right good technique by hanna|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needed 6 hearts for his overcall, so finesse long odds at the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator says it was a heart discarded|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharynr: Would anyone open east hand and if so, what|pg||
nt|gavin: too strong for 2C then 2nt too|pg||
nt|shals: and hockey city|pg||
nt|gavin: so many slams where partner doesnt show interest|pg||
nt|gavin: 1D is a reasonable choice |pg||
nt|raghavan: Part score deal|pg||
nt|caitlin: a constructive 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in which case unless im missing something it was a bad error|pg||
mb|2H|nt|susieq: I would open 3@D but I'm a little crazy|pg||
nt|caitlin: whereas if he were weaker he would first bid 1NT then 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise  2 spades 2 clubs 5 hearts and contract made|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: both k's are working|pg||
nt|susieq: that's fit showing|pg||
nt|caitlin: Turner will pass I assume|pg||
nt|gambit: Will C balance? I thk y|pg||
nt|gavin: this auction would almost always be 4-6 or 5-6|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to picture partner with a hand good enough for this action that doesnt have 6 diamonds |pg||
nt|gavin: turner has a monster|pg||
nt|gavin: (given the state of the auction)|pg||
nt|gavin: with  aspade stopper and 3 diamonds and the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|gavin: i think he owes hughes 2 or 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: 1nt = @C|pg||
nt|gowdy: suit or a lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|capercliff: interesting choice to bid 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may regret not playing 4@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4333 often plays at least a trick better in 4 of a major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 4@S an easier contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: neither is very good|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, 3D, and the QH, extras given his pass, but monster, No.....a couiple modest redeeming features, |pg||
nt|mcarroll: On Board 1 I see they did prefer the Moysian @S fit rather than @Cs and it cost 11 imps|pg||
nt|caitlin: they play constructive so 2@S 8-10 HCP|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is not forward going, but Jurek still tempted|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3@S is preemptive not constructive|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes some play 1@S 2@S 3@S stop|pg||
nt|caitlin: I personally don't like it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as there is no entry to Dummy, on a @D lead to take advantage of a discard on the @HA 4 @S goes down|pg||
nt|raghavan: S is trying to prevent EW going to 3H and later if he ventured - may be doubled - Of course he does not know N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that does not automatically beat hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And there are slow @C losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: nice hand for fit showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: even with both K's working hard to see 10 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|caitlin: given their lead there is no reason to push to 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: he cant have a better hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: We cannot find fault with N for his bidding|pg||
nt|caitlin: well if they play 1S 2S 3S stop we can|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharynr: 4@S might have been reached (and made)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think green should have tried 3@D in that case|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this is a steal im surprised green didnt bid 3d then hanna would bid 4s |pg||
nt|sharynr: but as is the case when both sides make a major suit game, the bidding might not have stopped at the 4 level|pg||
nt|gavin: funny to balance your opponents from 1D into 3NT|pg||
nt|caitlin: how true|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has maximum for his 2S bid|pg||
nt|glen: the 2/1 way to make a 3 card limit raise - 1NT (forcing/semi-forcing), then 3 of the major|pg||
pc|s2|nt|capercliff: good things H's are 3-3 or this would be really ugly|pg||
nt|capercliff: cancel that|pg||
nt|capercliff: even I could make 4 tricks with this @h suit:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in no trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: what out what you ask for|pg||
nt|gavin: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: czyz will have an easy time finding hte club shift|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: seems down if defense passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have stayed low nough to make  a plus|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gavin: the king of spades asks his partner to unblock an honor or give him upside down count|pg||
nt|caitlin: he showed it with constructive raise|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gambit: this will go down quickly |pg||
nt|gambit: as a plus |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict slowly|pg||
nt|gambit: you know David? Methodical |pg||
nt|gavin: when south gets in with the first diamond|pg||
nt|gavin: he will undoubtedly lead a spade|pg||
nt|gavin: since his partner lead the king, thats their power lead he knows that he has a GREAT spade suit|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to know if he has 5 or 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad spade break and poor communications with dummy would make higher level contracts very precarious|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|gambit: 3-2 diamonds would work losing 1 diamond, 3 spades|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some problems now for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the simplest solution, finesse the club|pg||
nt|caitlin: he has to|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: brave play, minimizing the loss|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: why rush with ace of dim?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was a mistake but afraid hanna would draw partners lone trump|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|caitlin: then how back to hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: finessing @Ds against North??|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharynr: i am sure NS would have pushed to th5 5-level|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky spade position|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mittmouse: look at what that fit showing jump did for graingers hand he would have bid to the 5 level if necessary|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had Hanna tried 8s it would have been very revealing!!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is why i hesistated with my comment, was not at all clear|pg||
nt|gavin: that was an odd play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond lead would have made this tougher, but i think still makes|pg||
nt|glen: yes, the @D lead head towards a forcing defense|pg||
mc|10|nt|glen: the idea being to play @Ds at all chances|pg||
pg||

nt|mcphee: defenders lost a trick I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: bridge is believe me anaggressive game- i relearned it after thirty years from a ounger relative who retaught me the basics|pg||
nt|mcphee: E gets all the gooddies|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 300 is not that bad score for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
nt|roswolf: a hand of possibility|pg||
nt|haans: four @H may have longer minor transfer resonses|pg||
nt|haans: respones|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: responses|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jakow: In original Magic D we opened 2S on this hand  55 S+C or D+H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant 1@H show 45?|pg||
nt|roswolf: another big @H fit for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: will e/w allow n/s play in 4@S?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in big club system S is so limited, that preempts should be quite sound = > W pass|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h= 8-11|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C?????????????????????????|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: in bridge you musttighten the screw up to the maximum but not brwak the bolt by overdoing it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a close 3n with nothing to spare made in the open|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N pass!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing to stop them now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: good @C slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: so iceland really needs to flatten this board|pg||
nt|roswolf: bergen strikes|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: creeping about cautiously will win nothing|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no trumps, no @h-ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jakow: About 12-14hcp and 3+H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: in 3. seat vuln: 1Nt = 15-17, so N had to open 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: with spades and dims both breaking 3/3 this should make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: easy 7 tricks - and a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: we've got our first comparison -- let's hope it will continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie but imagine you were in club slam and recieved a heart lead - you would not be a very happer sapper|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: your only entry to dummy under attack immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it i think even roland would baulk at this slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: life can be mean, i have this E hand and partner opens slam is going to be hard to avoid:)|pg||
nt|asig: Yes, even if W finds an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the lead helps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: easy to duck and then only one club  trick for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a horrible choice for east now|pg||
nt|haans: had been much harder to bid if sylvan first passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: i was once told by an international team captain in the southern hemisphere that he picked 1 pair playing an HUM system in all matches against what he thought were the weakest ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: teams and sat them out otherwise - the strategy worked the team won a medal|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: nicely done by NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: now spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: ionically a heart lead may have been threatening|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcphee: 4N simply does not do the hand any justice|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: 29 combined points without a grat trump fit why have you got to be in slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: because it makes? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (just a joke)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: that from board 22 - board 17-18-19 = 8-0 for Sweden|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcphee: I have 8 tricks in my hand an partner opens I certainly do more than a tiny invite|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 tricks if clubs are behaving |pg||
nt|mcphee: missing slam at imps is cowardly here|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a passive lead you have 6c tricks heart finesse for 2 tricks 3 sapdes and then a dim guess fo the contract when spades dont break that is if you havent mangled up your ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: i strongly disagree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ht switch now surely|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|m_niemi: nice def|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kastan88: neede to jump in with @HK and lead @D thru|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer should try to score dummy's spades by ruffing|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok would anyone pass throughout with the north hand - losing tactics to me|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: did Einarsson have time to mess around with that club|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The defence drew the longest straw|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: all true what you say, W has a complete minimum as well|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: it is a hand full of holes and hazards|pg||
nt|haans: nothing to it :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcphee: and it still has good play|pg||
nt|sybarra: so if you are so interested in slam, perhaps 4 @c is better bid over 3 nt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|m_niemi: !!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: 4@C is clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: now i think declarer is in tyrouble|pg||

nt|gavin: can still find spade shift|pg||
nt|caitlin: they haven't played this board yet|pg||
nt|raghavan: Give credit to E playing small Spades. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think he unblocked hearts before club ruff|pg||
nt|raghavan: and not SJ|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|capercliff: what to bid...|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 4 OR smart to be in 3@D making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 22|pg||
nt|shals: intersting all over the scoe bd|pg||
nt|caitlin: Karen how did you land up operating in Penticton if you are American?|pg||
nt|glen: for a close final quarter, this table is moving quickly, which is nice for everybody watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not for me :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|capercliff: 2@h is never enough these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: British Columbia|pg||
nt|glen: true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess "dont watch" wont work|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gavin: monster super accept for cz|pg||
nt|gavin: tough to avoid slam on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: its on a finesse but they have so many wasted points|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: but they always bid 3nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: how does everyone feel about 3N?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Silver made 5@d on the second hand, for 8 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: tell us later:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so i like to have a semblance of a side entry for 3 preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is "normal"|pg||
nt|gavin: ok obviously not as tough as i thought|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|gavin: i guess 2nt was 20-22|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 1 OR Silver bid 1@S over 1@H overcall......did Carruthers assume he had 5?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: on the bidding declarer probably should finess through N for @SJ to cater for a 4-1 break - which does not cost in this instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h does jam the auction nicely, you know if you double partner is bound to bid 4m|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is better than 22|pg||
nt|gavin: so darren could see it wasnt going to be great even opposite a super accept|pg||
nt|gavin: i agree|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't you bid 2c then 2n?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah, opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: 6@D is a reasonable spot with the bonus of making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H will make|pg||
nt|glen: this setups a possible @H discard, and a lot depends on how declarer places the cards|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: 2@H makes|pg||
nt|caitlin: loses 1@H 2@S 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c makes as played by west|pg||
nt|caitlin: very tough to get to|pg||
nt|gowdy: Karen  if there is a break in the action tell Green that I shot 78 today   Thanks :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: hey Gowdy awesome:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharynr: but both bd 20 and 22 will swing the match the other way, i predict|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6D makes 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but assuming a direct raise of diamonds was forcing, this is not a strong sequence |pg||
nt|caitlin: run clubs get rid of 2 hearts ruff a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: all up to North to shoot for it or not|pg||
nt|caitlin: don't love my J9 of @D but hey...life isn't perfect|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades 2-2 so this "should" not present problems|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|shals: wow spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my par 3 score|pg||
nt|caitlin: and I know nada about golf except a) scores b) I love Tiger:)|pg||
nt|glen: for us seeing all 4 hands, use @D K to discard @H, ace and another @H ruff, draw trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: simplest approach is ruffing heart hook|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if it loses defense can not hurt you|pg||
nt|glen: @H lead would have set it if rest of D okay|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would agree with 3NT|pg||
nt|capercliff: he also knows now it was based on 6 card suit so rates to have a singelton somewhere|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H was a FSF even tho a forcing auction|pg||
nt|caitlin: letting pd know game is there |pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: maybe, but that is not the only way to play 2@H|pg||
nt|gavin: im not a fan of trump lead w/ xxx in clubs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gavin: thk u need to be more aggressive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart king seems very normal lead|pg||
nt|gavin: when you dont have controls in reversers opening suit|pg||
nt|shals: 6 do you think could be made?|pg||
nt|shals: I guess|pg||
nt|caitlin: sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: that may NOT be a push|pg||
nt|shals: probably not|pg||
nt|shals: 2c might have helped|pg||
nt|shals: toobad|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: not in Canada|pg||
nt|caitlin: good point made: what doesn't Wolpert bid 3@D instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|gavin: i think 2H they use as their slowdown bid|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really??|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|lestergold: the only lead to hold this to 4|pg||
nt|glen: establishing 1@H, 2@C, 1@D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gavin: it says ive got garbage and i will likely pass ur next bid|pg||
nt|gavin: thats why cyz had to bid more than 3C |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|caitlin: it is 100% forcing|pg||
nt|gavin: cause he was afraid of his partner passing|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Gavin|pg||
mc|12|nt|fabsayc: aha he must have pitched a heart on the diamond|pg||

mb|2N|nt|kastan88: not easy for defence , as we saw|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead would have set 4@H, but how could W find it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "conservative" e/w pair here are winning imps nevertheless |pg||
nt|lestergold: i probabbly wouldnt wheelout the fourth suit just make a straight quantitative invite|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: The Danes were in 5@S here after N-S competed to 5@C|pg||
nt|asig: So, "messing around with the club" was in order to rectify the count :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no 3@c by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@S had the obvious two losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|haans: i think :)))|pg||
nt|m_niemi: aggressive bid by Nyberg|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H OR EVEN 4|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C better bid i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I pass|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcphee: wow quite the response range|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are here to comment on thye bidding and play of hand with respecto the best expert actions- results arealamost  irrelevant to that process|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6-12 NT|pg||
nt|haans: usually no spades|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Koistinen is very passive today|pg||
nt|roswolf: green cards are the norm in northern finland it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a thin 4@S getting through|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the max|pg||
nt|haans: liking his @C honors|pg||
nt|haans: @D honors|pg||
nt|roswolf: now n/s need some judgment|pg||
nt|m_niemi: trump lead kills|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might bid on|pg||
nt|haans: 2 spades 2 diamonds = 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|7N|nt|lestergold: we all know about the amount of luck there is in this game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in chess the best players always win in bridge chaque chien a son jour|pg||
nt|haans: there are two versions after 1@H overcall x show spades or x deny spades|pg||
nt|haans: not @D lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, Jaak, that's even more difficult|pg||
nt|cenglund:  1 NT forcing I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: incredible|pg||
nt|haans: holy shit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well im not convinced that was theintention|pg||
nt|lestergold: at the time |pg||
nt|m_niemi: N hopes that S has 5-5 or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: this is a funny deal for denmark :))))|pg||
nt|haans: a natural penalty double!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cenglund:  On good day you make slam, but this not that day|pg||
nt|mcphee: this response range places a lot of pressure, 2N as N kinda forced in case S has more and works poorly when S has a 6 count|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E has good shape, and no wasting values|pg||
mc|13|nt|fabsayc: complain when he misses something, not before|pg||

nt|caitlin: welcome:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing but weak caitlin, then 3@C would be limited reverse and not forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you think Mr Kokish will visit the open room|pg||

nt|caitlin: if so 110 isn't right score|pg||

mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: potentially 0 cover cards|pg||
nt|sharynr: A unusual weak 2 by Hanna|pg||
nt|susieq: that's a pretty heavy 2@S bid nv|pg||
nt|gavin: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is why Jurek did not try for slam over 4@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have been facing xxxx in diamonds for example|pg||
nt|shals: expect ie|pg||
nt|caitlin: just ask Eric to go to Peter Chung King and he will come to ANY table:)|pg||
nt|shals: ahh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not doubled|pg||
nt|caitlin: great response by Jim:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is East Jim Green|pg||
nt|glen: np, 1st priority is to get right result in|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2nd priority is to get Korbel to update his bridge blog|pg||
nt|glen: with actual play of hand|pg||
nt|rlebi: quite a few tricks available|pg||
nt|susieq: he's got some hands from the Cavendish in Vegas to put in as well before he gets to this :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: Korbel alerts pass of 2NT to mean "i'm not blogging this hand"|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|caitlin: btw Mohmad Ali is at the NHL game wearing a Red Wing Jersey:) *IMPORTANT information:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have advertising space available on my chest also :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anybody know what 4@C is|pg||
nt|glen: well, we can't use the G word can we|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharynr: i guess Jim has seen his partner's weak 2's before|pg||

nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|gavin: im in sweden for about 7 more hours, no hockey on normal TV here :( |pg||
nt|caitlin: we will keep you up to date Gavin|pg||
nt|caitlin: I have Tom in the lobby letting me know all:)|pg||
nt|gavin: looks like down a couple in 3 diamonds, ew can make 3C|pg||
nt|shals: what does that indicate?|pg||
nt|caitlin: raise in diamonds|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: limit|pg||
nt|caitlin: our vugraph operator, Karen, says it wasn't doubled|pg||
nt|gowdy: againd 4 @S and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4+|pg||
nt|caitlin: Korbel thinking of raising|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: i think its a mixed raise , we will see based on norths response|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry I thought S doubled again and it was left in|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|raghavan: Ellen and Martin - what will N play now after SQ - will he play club small??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably win and shift to a club, although that does not look hopeful|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he overtakes that is his only hope|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps a heart better|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Martin?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that is what he is thinking about, I would opt forsmall@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: attacking communication|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be the Green convention|pg||
nt|glen: yes, Green convention, asking for aces|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H likely showed 0 or 3 aces (E suspects 3)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: is fine if you don't do it also on garbage hands|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect!|pg||
nt|shals: yep|pg||
nt|caitlin: asking re minor which can't be clubs|pg||
nt|glen: 5@C confirms all aces, and now W has good playing value if E has the right hand opposite|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: I wonder whom you are rooting for Gavin?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: pittsburgh !!! oh my brother|pg||

nt|caitlin: we shall see......not so easy|pg||
mb|7N|nt|caitlin: and which is more important?|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good choice |pg||
nt|capercliff: normal with a stiff honor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: anyone know what 2Nt asked for|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: @s lead will hold it to 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: may have been singleton?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Pittsburgh on a power play|pg||
nt|shals: no stoppers in clubs for nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: that would be too lucky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really ugly lead problem for hanna|pg||
nt|gowdy: may lose 2 @S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: not now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh my|pg||
nt|glen: and only a ruff can beat this 7NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rlebi: unusual but effective auction|pg||

nt|lestergold: i cannot believe that north can invite game with a balanced 14 count no 5 card suit opposite a no trump response that could be as few as 6 so that it accepts with 9 or ten- not in ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: my book|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E cashing the A of clubs, so no mistake |pg||
nt|lestergold: he sweat a little himself|pg||

nt|haans: I lost a trick sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jakow: 3Sp? Anyone?|pg||
nt|kastan88: How destructive is 3@S here by agreements?|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam zone hand|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: not a very good slam :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C now would have excited north|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cenglund:  Worth 1 IMP|pg||
nt|kastan88: how many tricks have N 5, 6, 7? what to do with S hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: medal for that for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we see ace setting tricks not always cashed today|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6-12 what option do they have but to raise?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: the teoretically correct way to play that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: or biddable, but makes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: they have an option to play a sensible bidding system|pg||
nt|mcphee: S more likely the player that erred going to game NV with flat 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe but the system and the way it was handled contradict basic principles of the game im not going to mince words here|pg||
nt|mcphee: W is about to be delighted to find the opps want to play in his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: from the frying pan into the fire now|pg||

nt|kastan88: wrong result :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: likely same contract here as in CR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 2nt on S. I want a better @s stopper and I have a 4-card suit in @h|pg||

mb|3S|nt|lestergold: well this is a strange gesheft|pg||

nt|lestergold: i can see three easy tricks for declarer a club and two aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the other 4 im searching for|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: scarey|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont survive|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S is bold|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 18% says kib|pg||
nt|haans: sundelin nt = invite with spades|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jakow: Rather strickt by Conv card!|pg||
nt|asig: Both South players enter the auction with 2NT dispite holding the singleton @dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult bid for south no one likes a takeout double with a singleton iin one of the suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: well has more than 3|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3-3 36 % + 50% @h finess|pg||
nt|roswolf: just my type of odds!:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible contract|pg||
mb|4D|nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north so likely to respond in that singleton too|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u qxx in spades not a very robust stopper|pg||
nt|lestergold: all possible bids bu asouth have huge downsides|pg||
nt|roswolf: very scarey this|pg||

mb|4H|nt|xenya: well not quite...|pg||
nt|pelu: almost .)|pg||
nt|kastan88: I don't open this N hand 3@S, on 1st 2nd pos never|pg||
nt|kastan88: I like here more classical, to have my 6 playing tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be made if he plays for 3-3 @Ds rather than a finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well more than 3 anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anything else has to be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: @H now from W is best as we see, but not so clear cut|pg||
nt|m_niemi: has to top @c|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: agree martin|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lestergold: well declarer will emerge with another trick in the wash somehow or other but this will be a fair bloodbath aginst as shirley would put it.... ZIP!|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Open Room replicated the 1NT-3NT auction on board 6|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting, both not wanting to miss an early Vul game|pg||
nt|sharynr: but they did|pg||
nt|gavin: his low heart play would work any time hearts were 3-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north forced to give east a spade trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4H + 2C+1D\|pg||
nt|gowdy: ruff a @C draw trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes john|pg||
nt|susieq: the cards are definitely going East-West this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: 2@H both majors?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E thinks his hand is too good for an old fashioned 3@d bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes shows both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: he needed to keep his ace of hearts in his hand for an entry to draw trumps after he leads up towards his jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so always makes if declarer plays right|pg||
nt|raghavan: a part score deal I hope EW do not jump to game in a Major|pg||
nt|chorush: there was no flannery. what would he be upset about?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in that case 2@S by east can be natural or artificial, you need to discuss a defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is S worth an immediate 4@S?|pg||
nt|gavin: very tough hand will be interesting to see the line in the other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 10-1 somebody bids game|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: Obviously he thinks so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe too strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S AND 4@H are both feasible|pg||
nt|gavin: unlikely he will leave them there|pg||
nt|gavin: 7-4 white vs red|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green does not have to accept transfer|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will reject transfer and bid 3S|pg||
nt|rlebi: wrong sided for @Ss already|pg||
nt|rlebi: better stay low for a plus|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: 5@D in big trouble|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 5@c is better, best defence can get 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: must be a @h lead for 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: anything else is 500|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to lead a @H fromS, @S the obvious lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club ruff and heart heart switch works also|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont believe you can gain a trick by claiming if it is impossible to  make it....and in that defense they could not make a mistake?|pg||
nt|caitlin: best to lead trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: will any director out there agree?|pg||
nt|rlebi: sry, dreaming here|pg||
nt|glen: could declarer draw all the trumps and pick up @Ds?|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. just lose to the @D ace if guesses suit right|pg||
nt|rlebi: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S presumably no singleton and extras, and for that hand he is close to minimum|pg||
mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: not clear, but more likely daniel ducked heart|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hoping declarer would play the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: or S and switch|pg||
nt|gowdy: coffee time |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast they may bid slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs three diamonds so percentage is finesse of queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: yes that works as well Martin|pg||
nt|capercliff: no doub!!!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: I guess that is what happened martin, since daniel apologized|pg||
mb|4S|nt|capercliff: must be joking|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: guess he didnt think he was taking even 1 @s trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was the problem with 4@S, did not invite partner to participate|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he did open|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb...barbecue going:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: or at least try for it|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 S  strong H raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: if Hanna is going to bid it should be 4@S|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S = he skipped a @H cuebid, since minimum for 3@S|pg||
nt|rlebi: he didnt bid 4@s,did he?|pg||
nt|glen: the question is whether he plays serious 3NT or not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have based on hand overall minimum|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. EW|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: 3@S was expected|pg||
nt|caitlin: a splinter with 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|gowdy: no 3S artifical|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh|pg||
nt|gowdy: smolen|pg||
nt|caitlin: smolen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a splinter, can be balanced or singleton spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or perhaps unspecified splinter|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gambit: trump switch?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe heart to king now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many ways to play that bid|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NV vs vul, shows 8 major cards and a lot of hope :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: from N's perspective his partner is weak for 4@s|pg||
nt|raghavan: If at all I have to bid - I will bid 4S - He has 2 Spades but no guarentee that E will have 2 Hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: serious 3nt would help a lot on this specific auction|pg||

mb|2S|nt|xenya: he did, at some point|pg||
nt|jakow: Avery tricky 3NT to bid!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 37 Finns made 4@h in open room, +11|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well perhaps she was right to go up: it was the setting trick |pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 5 level many play that A denies K|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so declarer missguessed the @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H seems damp too surely a clear pass assuming double was penalty|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cenglund:  This board is no good for a strong club opening|pg||

nt|haans: i have done the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: can EW find 6NT?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mcphee: I just bid 3N as N rather than dble|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandably north has made tyhesafest sensible bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, very awkward bidding problem for N |pg||
nt|haans: suprise passing???????|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = 0-7, 1@h = @h or bal?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Slam depends on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: hand is too good to bid only 2n partner would pass with two many hads where 3n was laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happesn this isnt one of them |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|mcphee: best is to now cash @D A and see what takes place|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they know about controls - have they the tricks?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in other room sequence will be 1@s-3@s-?|pg||
nt|haans: N have 1 spade and @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: No problems here making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: when east sees dummy hell be regretting the lead but sighing with relief when he find sthat declarer has a stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make on the dim position|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|kastan88: but what else here to open, if 1@C means  all hands 15+? you can't open other way|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Slam is slightly over 50%, since Q singelton off-side makes as well|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h = 20+, 2NT = raise with single, 3@c = ask, 3@d = single @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT = 4441, with black single|pg||
nt|haans: fair|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: this is easy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: from the West-hand 6NT sh be as good as 6@Cs (also in CR)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have thought east hand worth an upgrade to 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: well done Rimstedt and Sjöberg. Deserved swing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, brilliantly bid|pg||
nt|pelu: the danish woman-team are going to Brazil (Venice Cup) and they are on the 1. step of training - 1 month physical! - the tecnik comes next month :):)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: this not of coutrse a bad line if the trumps were breaking normally that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: would virtually guarantee the contract but declarer in for a nasty shock|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then its only a push after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: iceland dont appear to be getting the breaks they need|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cenglund:  Thet's very true, but two-suiters are vulnerable against high-level pre-empts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: sad b ut the discard here of no real use|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|capercliff: 3@d here on the way?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S makeable|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe is not forcing |pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 4@D if fit showing|pg||
nt|gavin: interesting choice in the other room to bid garbage stayman with this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D or 6NT cold|pg||
nt|raghavan: should bid 2S |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Courtesy raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna may get shut out now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and preemptive|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2S only |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S or some mixed raise|pg||
nt|rlebi: they will open E hand at other table|pg||
nt|glen: sure, but 1 hour from now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gavin: ive never rlly thought of doing it on a 3352|pg||
mb|4S|nt|capercliff: yes even better|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems just plain weird|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really garbage stayman, intent is to pass any rebid|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky entry to diamonds with a heart|pg||
nt|gavin: isnt that what garbage stayman is ? sry if i missspoke|pg||
nt|caitlin: well Gavin I call it that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: KCB will identify a possible loser, so no 7|pg||
nt|gavin: this is a baby slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3nt here is a brick   4 H is in some trouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin: and easy to avoid 7 as martin said|pg||
nt|gavin: but its definitely good practise to play 6NT|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 imps better and safer|pg||
nt|gavin: 2 imps|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|raghavan: good bid by N|pg||
nt|rlebi: big potential  swing hand here|pg||
nt|rlebi: very easy to get to nonmaking Slam |pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: 5@H too expensive a sacrifice|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3nt only makes because diamonds blocked and club jack onside, single dummy 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D blocked  le tthem set them up  3nt is on the J or no club lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: but I know many WC Cohen Gitelman Bergen etc who call it takeout of 2C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: complications now|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oh oh|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sharynr: drury auction,, should be a making contract|pg||
nt|gavin: spec points out east hand so strong for 4M that maybe its too strong to open 1NT, tough decision|pg||
nt|rlebi: very easy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|capercliff: if the @c honors were split it wouldnt|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not realistic I think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gavin: in the effort to getting to 6NT it would have been better for him to bid 3S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gavin: to hear from partner that they have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|gavin: he did what he did to find out about the king of spades i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i dont like any of these bids|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction calls for a trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: garbage stayman to me is when you rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek described an entirely different hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh sorry west!!|pg||
nt|asig: A push at down 1|pg||
nt|haans: pass 0-11 bal or 0-7 unbal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|cenglund:  Veikko Jokinen, one of the old-time Finnish internationals said that it's always right to bid a slam when the finesse is working|pg||
nt|jakow: 1H=0-7|pg||
nt|lestergold: i thought the same commentators curse of course|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: 2@D must be weakkkkkkk 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: short toilet break|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: declarer took a diff line and his line was actually probably better|pg||
nt|lestergold: just unlucky on the break|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: trf|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the double|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@c = @d unlimited|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kastan88: 2NT = Preempt in minors or majors|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3@H = forcing|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3NT= majors|pg||
nt|asig: Good pass by Jonsson here - a 3@c opening would have led to trouble|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c= 16+, 1@d= 0-7|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: that tghe advantage with transfer|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s better I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i am not a lover of this sort of opening bid|pg||
nt|pelu: easy way to 4@H - transfer - 2NT invit aND 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i agree|pg||
nt|haans: 18 is double fist (in scandinavia)|pg||
nt|haans: but very weak 18|pg||
nt|m_niemi: that is more like 16 than 18|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: what do you suggest Bob?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i pass personally|pg||
nt|kastan88: and i am not lover to say 2NT on 2nd round, I would bid just 2@S, I am rabbit here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sorry Bob you and I are not on the same planet|pg||
nt|mcphee: stiff K does nothing for me|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will be able to bid later|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like ity but the day i pass 12 points with 5 spades is when hell freezes over|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cenglund:  The gadget lets the contract to be played from the right side|pg||
nt|fabsayc: out of control auction|pg||
nt|jakow: Somethin strange with th double of 1H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs partner to cover 3 losers, surely then north would bid more than 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: instead its the greaqt danes in a little trouble 3n easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: however weight of cards is a factor here |pg||
nt|asig: I think this should make, though|pg||
nt|asig: Not many losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims favourable so u lose 2 or 3 tump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: still makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: just not the most elegant looking contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: !!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: there should be 2 tricks more in @h to than NT, that's not likely => 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: chicken|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: fortunately for NS, it's just another -50 against a makeable 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: and here another 5 card suit too|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, from S hand down with @S lead|pg||
nt|talion: i gues the 5@h asked about quality of openers hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Beautiful contract and good bidding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: But E must be careful. No @c to the Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: no losers now outside trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well normal play this|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Safe contract; investigating slam without getting overboard. Excellent technique|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4 rounds @h to make this|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcphee: you count it  as 12 points all you like, to me it's a pail of poor values|pg||
nt|mcphee: K@H and Qx@C not exactly features I am anxious to rave about|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bob you are right to view the hand with circumspection but i promise you that not an expert this side of the antarctic would agree with a pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fast 4 hearts for the make|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|m_niemi: I think it may be the correct way even single dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: a long travel from Copenhagen to Turku to play 3@H|pg||
pc|s7|nt|m_niemi: KQxxxx, AKxx,AQ,x good 18|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: but so what  |pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: shortening south's trumps helps control|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer going down loke a gentleman|pg||
nt|roswolf: like|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|cenglund:  Claim|pg||
nt|haans: we have to wait before results are compared working on it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kastan88: if double showed 5...7 points, i can't see reason to bid 6@C over partner sign off, or what was double?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kastan88: then I am some Antarctic person too, I open this hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: by the way i forgot to comment that north should have given simple pref to 2s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bid 2n|pg||
nt|kastan88: but as I said i would personally bidding 2@S after partners 2@D and waiting, may be she can do someting with her 15-pointer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @d!|pg||
nt|asig: I think he is down now|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think a trump should have been played before that spade ruff|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: claim|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: I heartily agree|pg||
pc|c4|nt|asig: Two more trumps to lose|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it was more than inelegant this contract |pg||
nt|asig: Down a lot if he tries a heart in search of 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a few back for iceland who i think actually deserve some|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cenglund:  You could hardly imagine that declarer can dispose of all the spades from dummy|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4 more to Fin, this table 3@h-3 vul, other 3@s =|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: easy in CR: 1NT (12-14) 3NT|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well he could have gone down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: skipping board 10 for the omment|pg||
nt|gavin: impossible play of a diamond, even if declarer has 2 D it would cost him a trick|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: moment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was a guess on a random jack|pg||

mb|1H|nt|gavin: 4 imps at stake if ew find the sac, and then if north south compete to 5|pg||

nt|caitlin: 3@C??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S went down on diamond queen lead where leader had 10xxx in spades|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gavin: would get very lucky to make|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|gavin: ok double |pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: W has a very good hand for 1N, almost too strong|pg||
nt|raghavan: martin agreed but he need not waste his S K|pg||
nt|rlebi: onwards to game now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually 2@S would be forcing, but grainger a passed hand|pg||

nt|caitlin: here in 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this looks down 3|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to overtake to play a club, easy play|pg||
nt|gavin: to overtake|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to decide wheather to play hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|gavin: seems like u can see that if u start hearts their club losers can go away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somehow silver made 6nt on 23|pg||
nt|gavin: very rare that u will need to take heart ruff and u dont get clubs back as a trade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which looks impossible unless a club opening lead|pg||
nt|gavin: a club lead is impossible|pg||
nt|gavin: but playing 6nt over 6s seems bizarre|pg||
nt|gavin: and a club lead vs 6s is impossible as well|pg||
nt|gavin: ok so the lecuyer team actually leads by 26|pg||
nt|fabsayc: impossible no. just strange|pg||
nt|raghavan: now go for slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not easy from here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: far from easy|pg||
nt|gowdy: Hi guys   I think 2@S was 3 controls|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Gowdy:))|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome home|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam yes, but finding what is needed for 7 a headache|pg||

nt|caitlin: Gowdy and I teach together|pg||

nt|fabsayc: even tougher if controls|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is John Gowdy a World Class expert who has coached every type of Canadian team|pg||
nt|glen: no, it looks like just 3 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|capercliff: looks like it was E that was thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this has worked nicely|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Low @H lead beats it|pg||
nt|gavin: 7 card suit for me is game opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|gavin: no matter how bad my hand is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 3@C game forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: repeated diamond leads would beat this hand i think|pg||
nt|glen: swing to Carruthers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that hanna has any reason to find that defense|pg||
nt|glen: so 12+13|pg||
nt|glen: on boards 6+7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: robinson 83 fleisher 33 in USA1|pg||

pc|h8|nt|caitlin: oh no|pg||

mb|d|nt|mcphee: perhaps N sould consider raising 1N|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no problems any more|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: this is a rather solid 14 she holds|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 8+, 5+@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: do you know that you can se all hands you have seen in BBO? go to c:\Bridge Base Online\hands\yr bbo name|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: S had a hard choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: normally 1NT response indicates a better hand than this poor 6 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im in favour of aggressive take out doubles but with north's minimum bad spade suit an stiff diamond, i would not make this bid here very dangerous vul aginsty not|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would not dble as N either|pg||
nt|kastan88: in this part of Earth (East europa) we play that mostly 6..10, so I can't see reason to raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: let pard balance if east passes also much too much in heasrts|pg||
nt|lestergold: zip outside hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: 8-11, 7-10 range is more in tune here in NA|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like 8-11 a lot|pg||
nt|mcphee: however I make ligth t/o dble with the right shapes|pg||
nt|haans: you can see what happened at other table|pg||
nt|m_niemi: some alerts missing?|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the contract|pg||

pc|s2|pg||

nt|mcphee: 9@D lead the K winning onm table|pg||
nt|mcphee: and poor S wants to leave the room now!|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1N she asks, why did I bid so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: so do i please ignore my comments i took my eye off te ball dues to  PLATE OF SAUSAGES EGGS AND CHIPS APPEARING|pg||
nt|mcphee: no kippers?|pg||
nt|lestergold: provided by my der bridge widow|pg||
nt|kastan88: bon appetite|pg||
nt|lestergold: she doesnt like the smelll of kippers but i love em|pg||
nt|mcphee: delivery, back when done|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S asked singel?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: this must be a kind of asking bid - west thought so !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no need to use Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: some change there|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: a different auction but the same landing spot|pg||
nt|m_niemi: kibs know better|pg||

nt|asig: have to go now, see you later|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d A and @dK and crossruff|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: profitable save if he can get out for -3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: this is a silly contract and clearly the system has a serious flaw|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: with the clubs both offside and the spade losers needing to be ruffed not laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get diamond right|pg||
nt|roswolf: trick 1 was interesting though|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N was too aggressive in this board|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I think it's just bad judgement|pg||
nt|m_niemi: against 8-11 that is not so great hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: S can get a @H ruff, but it's still 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: the lead gives a @H-ruff - but cost a @C-trick|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: j of spades on tabel rather than another dim|pg||

nt|sharynr: it looks like my Bd 22 prediction was right at least.|pg||
nt|caitlin: but with long spades not much else probably happier to bid 4|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is not a commanding lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: ya  and that was going to be my team till it was not :(|pg||
nt|rlebi: wk nt|pg||
nt|glen: btw I'm watching the other room with the Chrome browser, and BBO (Fred, Uday etc.) have done great work supporting multiple browers - BBO is very fast in google's browser Chrome|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gavin: looks like the defense can hold this to 4 with a spade lead|pg||
nt|gavin: 4H looks like a pretty good spot, as does 5D but it looks like nothing can make|pg||
nt|raghavan: a dangerous hand for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: may land in 6H with bad results|pg||
nt|mcarroll: very true|pg||
nt|gowdy: now this " slam"  won't be as much fun|pg||
nt|mcarroll: their best suit fit is full of holes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|gavin: though the diamonds look like a standout from south, leavin north up to cashing the ace of spades when he gets in with the ace of hearts or it goes away|pg||
nt|rlebi: how many???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two way stayman|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: north must have underlead spade when in with heart ace|pg||
nt|glen: 1NT is 12-14, 2@D game forcing stayman|pg||
mb|d|nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact ew in the open room freely bid themselves to 5, lucky to survive|pg||
nt|caitlin: @DQ led and then declarer claimed it seems???|pg||
nt|gavin: though unlucky to catch AD opposite void|pg||
nt|gavin: specs suggesting 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt will make|pg||
nt|caitlin: So Czyz is from Ottawa|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not the Roland F wor?>|pg||
nt|raghavan: No they may stop in 4H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6NT is better but down also|pg||
nt|caitlin: capitol of Canada|pg||
nt|gowdy: Is this flannery  or weak with Majors |pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H shows 5-4 or vul 5-5|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is some strong 2@H bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|rlebi: the answer was 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: or operator missed auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: good spot|pg||
nt|gavin: seems hard to unravvel your tricks but i guess they end up just coming to you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 44 possible not vul|pg||
nt|caitlin: not necessarily so weak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It will be very hard for S to stop in game opposite an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: going out on a limb and predicting this will make in under 5 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you believe that story?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: they claimed very fast|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gowdy the teacher may approve  that having another Major- I should not pre empt. Also here N has 11 points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the best one we have seen|pg||
nt|caitlin: no 2@H shows both majors|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh are they playing Flannery?|pg||
nt|caitlin: either 5-4 or vul 5-5 or non vul could even be 4-4|pg||
nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not Flannery, is called Ekren in Europe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the winning amount|pg||
nt|rlebi: oops|pg||
nt|rlebi: just right|pg||
pc|d5|nt|capercliff: N/S playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|glen: so he drops 2@Ss, 2@Hs, and ummm?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|gowdy: if 2 D shows a bad weak two  then 2 H shows a very good one|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharynr: i think you are right!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a bit harder from south seat|pg||
nt|gavin: yeh seems fine to win in either hand and knock out the king of diamonds, eventually u just cash your tricks and exit with a heart and the defense will be forced to give you your ...|pg||
nt|gavin: club and spade trick in dummy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: 2@C can be singleton, 2@D rebid promises 4|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes, 2c can be 2 or more|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4531 i think would rebid 2@C also|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: at least i think that's Wolpert just said :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: why? North wins HA can play SA|pg||
nt|caitlin: ooooooops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: here we go|pg||
nt|raghavan: Putting head under a sword?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: misplaced major jack, else a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: this should be double key card     6 key card  4 aces and 2 major suit kings|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wonder if this is asking re: 5 controls for hearts and spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6 I mean:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be double key card, not clear which suit is agreed|pg||
nt|caitlin: hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gavin: after the 1D opening bid, south definitely should not lead a diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or underlead it for the set|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to pick from his doubletons|pg||
nt|gowdy: 11 to 13 |pg||
nt|caitlin: ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed vul against not with defense no reason to bid 4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|caitlin: he did not cash SA|pg||
nt|gavin: wrong one , now cyz has to cash ace of spades to hold to 5 |pg||
nt|gavin: fly ace|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact north should fly ace of hearts and play a club|pg||
nt|caitlin: on this lead clubs going nowhere nor hearts for defense..more likely to cash out|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Gavin?|pg||
nt|caitlin: this could be singleton?|pg||
nt|gavin: cause of the lead ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe in 4 that isnt such a winning defence since the club ruff would be 3rd trick, he needs a spade honor from partner to beat|pg||
nt|gavin: so might as well hope its kx and thats why partner was afraid to lead it|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is 5@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they get to 6@H E will be very careful not to double in case they run to a making 6NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: what does 5S mean |pg||
nt|glen: bonus for operator: play will be quick|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this type of auction clubs often the weakest suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if responder has club fit would tend to rebid 2@S not 2nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: Wolpert taking his time with this one|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will overtake and finesse I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some minor communication issues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On a @C lead will succeed if the !Q is played, which is I think the correct technical play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a surprise this, a @c from the east hand cant hurt him|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needs to pitch a diamond if 3rd heart lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|capercliff: assuming he overtakes and finesses the @d again|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|raghavan: Martin you are right as always|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is good to read the Hobbit trilogy|pg||
nt|raghavan: I maeant NO DOUBLE|pg||
nt|caitlin: for sure no double|pg||
nt|caitlin: you never know if 6N will make which it does not here|pg||
nt|glen: in the other room, on board 8, they are also using the Green convention|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: director has been called|pg||
nt|glen: what for i wonder?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: a spade back would be embarassing if jack wrong|pg||
nt|mcarroll: small @H from N at trick 2 would have worked|pg||
nt|capercliff: yah and when @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4-2 sry|pg||
nt|capercliff: if the K@c was wrong he could go off now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Would have 4@H,3@D 1@C and 1@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtaking with the J at trick one was 100%|pg||
nt|gowdy: 9 @C  and the @H now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gavin: very thoughtfull play|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|glen: maybe its zero tolerance, as they have zero chance of beating the doubled contract|pg||
mc|10|nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no overtrick|pg||
nt|susieq: was there a ruling?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: made 3 exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: there was a one trick transfer by director, i don't know why, sorry|pg||
nt|rlebi: not likely|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no promotion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: clashes with natural diamond trick|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  the @CK cost an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think Fins will not win the previous board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you, 3nt was not cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be more competitive|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice bidding by EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I agree, but they may reach 3NT in the other table, probably -1|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: oh well another tortured sequence likely|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@c denies M|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so 6@c or 5@c+4@d|pg||
nt|haans: five clubs no majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: but promises in hcp? 8-11?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: but only if N hold-up with @DK x!|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make whout @C lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a hand for getting too high on here|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php  for this match soon|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not -3 still|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl 2nt now?|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-fit makes 4@H - on small values - a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S now might prevent that|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4C|nt|m_niemi: so tie is the best Fin can score|pg||
nt|pelu: but again - I dont like 1NT with a solid major 5 card suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East has good hand, double 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass seems automatic|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have matti|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if w has 6 c m, there should be good spot for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am not sure south has any legitmate other choice here - 4@S WONT MAKE OPPOSITE A PASSED PARD|pg||
nt|m_niemi: on @d lead 4@s makes|pg||
nt|pelu: but is the pause by S who or West |pg||
nt|pelu: for sure W will lead his singleton @C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: move @dK to @sK, how many tricks in @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume screens are in use - in which case west may be considering bidding over 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h=ms|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|xenya: S plays a @H, if W discards a@D, S cashes @DK and plays another @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel 6d looks v good|pg||
nt|pelu: both!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah both thinking!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@C must have been transfer 4@C natural|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@s = ASK|pg||
nt|m_niemi: tx Sue|pg||
nt|haans: were they on the winning team last nordics?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: wow aggressive!! both of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lucky no double|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a hopeless spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: may even make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course every finesse in sight works|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: will require a defence worthy of that aginst the israelie raid on entebbe|pg||
nt|lestergold: and yes it may happen|pg||
nt|pelu: ok -100 against 140 :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D is just too undisciplined for me pard did bid 1nt and so has defence|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: 2@S is a super accept but W is not interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: but plenty of play even on a less favouravle layout|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As the cards lie  - yes, but 2 of 3 finesses is needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: its better than that Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: because played bu south with the spade protected the fourth heart will take care of possibloe spade loser so whenever club finesse is right its a very good contract and has chances ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when clubs finess is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland mandatory and porbably in the region of upwards of 50% in any case|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 16+, 1@d = 0-7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: clubs ruff beat it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|m_niemi: 3@h= 3cards|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: her 2N was just a further transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: S need to take the @C-trick in on @HA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: plus all the possible helpful leads too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @d in on N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 is makeable, though maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: the standing it 30-0 + board 20 where Denmark can loose many IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: always seems to me that their last bid is a punt|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cenglund:  3NT would have been cold, but this is more difficult, but should make on good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like a very resonable spot to this bozo|pg||
nt|haans: suprise|pg||
nt|kaapo: Score updates from the women's at http://www.bridgefinland.com/NM2009/res/bmsc.php|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart suit is blocked now|pg||
nt|pelu: @C now!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @h7 = suit pref to @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: could well be|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will do the right thing i am sure|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N should have led a high @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: from that bad suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has a real problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: he certainly hasnt been helped by his pard|pg||
nt|pelu: N coudn't help here - only tell that he has 3-card @H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I don't think that S needs N's count in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a suit preference situation|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 43 Finns in 3Nt in the other room as I predicted|pg||
nt|pelu: so another 6 IMPs for Finland|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not made yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: the more he thinks the more likely he is to get it wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: "all" way lead to 9 trivcks :(|pg||
nt|pelu: @CK - come on Gregers :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 9 tricks => :) not :(|pg||

mb|d|nt|vugraphznx: they were discussing that here a bit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more than he had?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna seems to hold hearts a lot:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I also want to know what 5S is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Carruthers got another 5 imps on board 7|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S  E-W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H, does not fit any other overcall|pg||
mb|3C|nt|caitlin: everyone agree with 2S?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by North?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is ok|pg||
nt|gavin: with 4 boards to go in the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe hanna should cash diamond before returning the club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure which way denies the club doubleton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: penalty card in hearts maybe|pg||
nt|glen: poor other table, when they try to work that out|pg||
nt|glen: 1 hour from now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey tough enough here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|gavin: wolpert bid 1NT here because he didnt think he was good enough for 2H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3@H also ok|pg||
nt|gavin: aggressive 4S bid|pg||
nt|gavin: rlly hate that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: and instead of risking his partner raising 1S to 2S and playing the wrong fit, he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|gavin: on that lead declarer will likely go 2 down, take a spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Seemingly W cannot pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 800 possible|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt i would want to ever pass 3nt|pg||
nt|gavin: though the defense will need to cash their tricks int he right order|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room Joey opened 2@D and auction crowded opponents|pg||
nt|caitlin: can set up hearts to make 4S|pg||
nt|glen: btw board 8 is a push in 7NT, unless misplayed now|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: 3@C blocking bid but sometimes taken seriously|pg||
nt|gavin: easy to allow them to escape for 1 down by trying to cash 2 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would be a better contract if north had 2 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: the A  then the 9  the green plays the last @H|pg||
nt|glen: nope, claim eliminated misplay chance|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: he can pass, and will when happy to see opponents bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe more|pg||
nt|starkist: omg|pg||
nt|caitlin: right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: 2@H is weird|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess 1@S can be a four card suit for them|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: hearts so much better here|pg||
nt|starkist: 13 imps|pg||
nt|gavin: better but still grim|pg||
nt|gavin: here it is no play|pg||
nt|gavin: like most of the time|pg||
nt|gavin: he is not playing with someone who is afraid to bid|pg||
nt|mittmouse: club back is best then 3 down|pg||
nt|gavin: needs a pure 3S bid to have hope|pg||

nt|capercliff: so long as N goes low with a @c|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 13 to fin, this is the 5@h-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a delicate hand for a change|pg||
nt|m_niemi: the point is where is decl's top honour|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: board 8: +3 to Swe, they played 4@d -4!, this table 5@cX-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a real slam lets see how they bid this|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: other table 41h+1|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kastan88: Welcome, Tjolpe (Sven-Olov Flodqvist)!|pg||
nt|mcphee: N was marginal for 3@H true|pg||
nt|haans: Big Clubs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h+1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: propably N has both and decl KJxxxxx in @d|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|mcphee: I think this has a lot to do with the neg dble showing 4@H for them|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Looks like the Icelanders are getting a hiding|pg||
nt|pelu: X = a takeout of @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is what he has!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@d= non forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: REALLY NON -FORCING - MAMA MIA|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pelu: ok last board :) - I hope that the connections will be better in next round|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They missed a cold game in hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D is max for EW|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finns scored 6 imp from 3NT mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT by S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mcphee: although 3@H is aggressive, if the S hands values are outside of @S it is not so bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but sometimes opps preempt you or if south expectsb pard to show 4 hts however minimum she is then she did not have here 4h raise you cant have it both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: and to reach a close game vul at imps is good|pg||
nt|lestergold: desperation pushin i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might consider axing this|pg||
nt|pelu: no not in IMP - prob down 1 = 100/530|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will EW score their 3 @s tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S should not pass 2@S out in any case, and will dble again and now N should be considering 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is the question|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: no|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no punt so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on th elead this will not pose an unsurmountable problem|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: well i know east is a passed hand but west is surely too good to only bid 2h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: amazing that south isnt contemplating a grand with all those controls|pg||
pc|dT|nt|m_niemi: 2@s would have been very minimum raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h showed some values|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another good board for the Finns|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: S has to play a @D back now -- breaking communications -- difficult|pg||
nt|xenya: she has to read the situation perfectly well to do so|pg||
nt|haans: not nice for finland|pg||
pc|c3|nt|m_niemi: Kx,Axxxxx,Kx,Axx vs. nf bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you cant bid 6@D here then you really should change your methods|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: decl will have to fight for it|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E should have bid once more with 4th trump|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: even with the wasted Ks as a value this 4h is a much better contract thatn the last one for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: has his sisth tricvk only needs to find a 7th may even find an eight|pg||
nt|pelu: I was too slow - as always :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|cenglund:  In my book opening 1NT with this hand is out of question |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes their conservative approach has scored a few goals in this match|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: indeed it is, I think personally W should have made a t/o dbl;e|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly e/w do not need to bid out of desperation but cant afford to miss good games- leads get reversed this way|pg||

mb|3D|nt|rlebi: 6@c only slam that makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: one more board after this, again thanks to Karen for her hard work all today as operator|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|caitlin: the Wolperts are a famous bridge playing family in Toronto:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now all we need is another 500 spectators for the final set|pg||
nt|rlebi: or @ds|pg||
nt|glen: btw we have a USA1 winner in spec, and congrads to that team in a very tough and long event|pg||
nt|glen: hopefully they will concede once they see how strong Canada1 is|pg||
nt|glen: hmm, they promise a battle :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we will field the enforcers with 10 foot hockey sticks|pg||
nt|glen: he might just put 6@C on the table now|pg||
mb|5N|nt|caitlin: 5-3s often better in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 4 H no chance let us see for 3NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks and chances for a ninth|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here the 5 never even mentioned|pg||
nt|caitlin: needs one minor suit trick|pg||
nt|caitlin: ????|pg||
nt|fabsayc: entries a problem|pg||
mb|6C|nt|fabsayc: cunning play but should not work|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: huh?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: signing off, but this could be less safe than slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can be missing two aces|pg||
nt|capercliff: 5@s was a relay to play in 5N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so blackwood was not the right tool|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure what is however|pg||
nt|gowdy: needs a or k of d in N with  no C switch|pg||
nt|susieq: 5N transfers the blame to partner|pg||
nt|glen: no, its the your-fault 5NT (i.e. you pick it)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: one does not get 12 card fits that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: slam is 50/50 at best anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to gavin, caitlin, tony, george and cameos from cam and harmon |pg||
nt|fabsayc: so win and heart to 9 and diamond up|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: happens to be the right side of 50 this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better than 50-50|pg||
nt|capercliff: you dont have time to try both finesses Martin:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually the defense will yield many clues to the best line|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hazel, the mom runs a great bridge club|pg||
nt|raghavan: North must be alert to play C and another C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is essentially the same|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is better, though Jurek should realize hearts likely solid|pg||
nt|rlebi: he picked swell|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a bid with a great track record lately, but worked here|pg||
nt|glen: on board 10, with the two offside black kings, EW made 6@S at the other table|pg||
nt|glen: sorry board 9|pg||
nt|glen: they bid 6@S for 13 imps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: they have to guard clubs also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: plus no spade lead, i would expect a lot of clues|pg||

nt|fabsayc: apparently he guessed wrong, down 2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|starkist: and hockey gloves|pg||
nt|caitlin: may try 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|capercliff: strong @c systems always work well with those hands, can always play in 1N|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2D  1 major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: looks like a spade lead beats this|pg||
nt|caitlin: as Soloway always said/did when vul never invite to 3N with good 8-9 just bid it|pg||
nt|caitlin: other table also led spade|pg||
nt|starkist: miss him|pg||
nt|gavin: what happened in other room ?|pg||
nt|mcbruce: BTW, the commentators updates on the hockey game earlier were ahead of the CBC's "live" video feed by about ten seconds.  Had I known this earlier I could have made some money...  ...|pg||
nt|mcbruce: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many would try 4@S with hannas hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmm not an easy one whether you bid your clubs but as long as pd isn't going to drop you....you can show those diamonds again and again if need be|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is not a strong club system|pg||
nt|capercliff: in the other room both players stretched and ended up in a bad game|pg||
nt|gavin: thx for duplicating the boards without that we wouldnt have vugraph|pg||
nt|caitlin: or 3S|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was my thought|pg||
nt|gowdy: I would rebid 3 @D 100 %  but I'm home and he is playing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: i was taking them off my tv, bruce|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: same lead 3N making|pg||
nt|gavin: seems odd|pg||
nt|gavin: theres no hope at 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|gavin: ok good night thx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont need a maximum |pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: safe travel gavin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and get some sleep|pg||
nt|gavin: gotta leave in 2 hours, prob just finish packing :)|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i was just telling gavin i never thought i would see the day where a table with roy hughes and juryk would finish way ahead of other table|pg||
nt|caitlin: exactly|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the exotic 2nt strikes again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play record is incomplete|pg||
nt|caitlin: I still think 3@S as in other room|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank Kibits, Martin J, MartinC, ellen, Teacher Gowdy, VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO  This is last deal|pg||
pc|h4|nt|caitlin: a reminder that Canadian Bridge Federation, CNTC trials : http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/index.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 2nt is pretty normal these days with east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Thanks all, we will resume in a few hours.  Check the schedule for the time in your area|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: closing now|pg||
nt|caitlin: the Carruthers team has represented Canada in past but lost finals in trials last year|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes thanks Karen and Raghavan:)|pg||
nt|glen: he has 5@D, 1@S, 1@C and needs to develop an 8th trick - he can keep ducking @HS until the ace falls|pg||
pc|d3|nt|starkist: what about when i said scored by mistake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4@H was somewhat easier contract than 3@D|pg||
pc|d9|nt|caitlin: sure is|pg||
nt|gowdy: :) see you all soon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good work again Karen, now on her 5th shift at this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|caitlin: If I was going to show clubs it would be 3C |pg||
nt|caitlin: absolutely forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: they have zoomed way ahead of me on the play for this one|pg||
nt|caitlin: np|pg||
nt|caitlin: they aren't making this |pg||
nt|gowdy: remember 78  :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|capercliff: o more last @d|pg||
nt|capercliff: no|pg||
nt|caitlin: Tony do you remember?|pg||
nt|starkist: I was away|pg||
nt|caitlin: so Karen lives on the US border right by Penticton|pg||
nt|caitlin: our vugraph operator|pg||
nt|caitlin: she is getting a good taste of Canadian bridge players:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: GN all   thanks for the input and the laughs  see u later|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: will be back in 2.5 hours|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the other room a bit behind, if you want to see the rest of the story for this round :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Gowdy Fabsayc (Martin) Karen our operator specs....|pg||
nt|caitlin: be sure to keep your seat warm|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: i'll wait to close this table until the other room finishes play|pg||
nt|caitlin: Carruthers is giving them a run for their money now|pg||
nt|caitlin: you can close|pg||
nt|caitlin: go take a GOOD break|pg||
nt|caitlin: we will all go to open room|pg||
nt|caitlin: you can close here...all to open room lots of boards left there|pg||
nt|caitlin: Karen get your deserved break|pg||
nt|gavin: i love you have a nice nights sleep|pg||
nt|gavin: oops :)|pg||
nt|gavin: that was to the wife :)|pg||
nt|rlebi: +90|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|starkist: didn't understand bidding then missed the play|pg||
nt|susieq: a claim was input after trick 1|pg||
nt|caitlin: I know brain cells start dying after AGE 29--TRUE-- but give it a shot Tony|pg||
nt|susieq: we didn't get to see any of the play after the lead|pg||
nt|gavin: the bidding was 2S range ask (basically a 2nt bid)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: simply better bidding at this table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gn folks|pg||
nt|harmon: gn|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: good night all, see you tomorrow :)|pg||
nt|mcbruce: thanks again to the commentators and operators|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|capercliff: was the 10 right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make but not certain|pg||
nt|rlebi: betcha|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gavin: it probably went 3C 3NT though|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|gavin: not 3nt|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club 4 looks wrong|pg||
nt|capercliff: he wanted the Q@s as an entry to finesse @c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes no way back to hand if the finesse works|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|caitlin: 1N-2S  3N|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gavin: naw|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Thanks all|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: good lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: moment of truth soon|pg||
pc|sA|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|rlebi: small @h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gavin: it went 1N - 2S - 3C - 3N|pg||
nt|gavin: even if it says what it says|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Gowdy|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :) very fun|pg||
nt|raghavan: Thanks Karen very good work|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two potentially good results for carruthers yet to score|pg||
nt|caitlin: so when are we back?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: we will be starting again in about 20 minutes.  the other room still playing so you might want to migrate to that room :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: that gives us a LONG time:))|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but my guess will be a little late starting|pg||
nt|raghavan: In India now it is past midnight - So Good night BYEEEE |pg||
nt|caitlin: see you soon |pg||
nt|caitlin: bye Raghavan|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|starkist: thts what I tht|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gavin: thats what they play|pg||
nt|caitlin: look at upper left corner Open Room 3N E and put cursor over it|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|gavin: operator error|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: i suspect was scoring error in open room|pg||
nt|starkist: my guess|pg||
nt|starkist: bidding and result wrong maybe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade and down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|caitlin: Karen how do we know that to be so?|pg||
nt|susieq: I am pretty sure the result is correct- I have talked to one of the players|pg||
nt|caitlin: see you back in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: see you all shortly - closing now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|glen: thanks all, it will take some time for the other table to complete, and the final set promises fireworks plenty :)|pg||
mc|8|nt|fabsayc: maybe not south sort of endplayed|pg||
nt|rlebi: 1 big swing coming for L'ecuyer|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I will keep the table open until the other room is done, lots of boards left over there|pg||
nt|rlebi: 1 potential swing for Carruthers, we shall see|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks everybody, next set in about 50 minutes, perhaps longer|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: director just announced 1/2 hour left in this segment|pg||
