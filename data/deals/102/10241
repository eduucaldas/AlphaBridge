nt|barnets: slam on finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: see how north likes to bid over 1@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: Rodwell thinking about it..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: if W has no wasted @S values then slam looks good,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: here W does have As though and its on a hook so still good spot|pg||
nt|barnets: some players like to bid over strong club non vul with any 13 cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: N using the NV  to  VUL position to dream up a call|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true Barnet.......|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think one needs to "strain" to bid,,,,,, boundaries are the issue then|pg||
nt|barnets: if rodwell could visualise a finesse at worst he would bid on|pg||
nt|mariner1: he is trying though|pg||
nt|barnets: if it was a finesse at best he would not go for slam|pg||

mb|3H|nt|cherdano:  Meckstroth can show both his suits if he wants to (assuming 2@D shows hearts)|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can play 2@D :)|pg||
nt|cherdano:  true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sartaj1: I think 2@D is natural because they play 2@H as a good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: no easy entry to dummy hurts|pg||

mb|p|nt|cherdano:  normal 3rd seat opening for Willenken i think|pg||
nt|ronpa: NS sure likes to bid|pg||
nt|cherdano:  E planning to double and bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherdano:  which should get them to game|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cherdano:  others might open 1M with his hand, but that risks losing the other major|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sartaj1: I would guess that 70 players out of the world top 100 would open that hand in 3rd seat; choosing 1@C, 1@H or 1@S|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|cherdano:  1@H might be the plurality choice?|pg||
nt|barnets: hearts and spade are for a lead|pg||
nt|ronpa: Chris had Q@H lead for 3NT but now its not an option anymore|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough 3N to play here|pg||
nt|cherdano:  redouble showed diamonds|pg||
nt|sartaj1: A couple of days ago, we saw Meckstroth open KJ9x and out (in 3rd seat favourable)|pg||
nt|ronpa: Rodwell knows Meck is @S short so he considers a 4@H bid|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has only 7 top tricks here|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 short|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|barnets: if he could see norths hand he could get another diamond trick|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ronpa: seems like only high @C lead will give 3NT a chance but its all over, 4@H will need a @D lead to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is likely off 1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: might be better than playing 3N though|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|barnets: yes  agreed|pg||
nt|cherdano:  how does the high club lead help? not enough entries to set up club suit as far as i can see|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Assuming the redouble showed diamonds, Rodwell will try to squeeze South between the hypothetical @S Jack and the diamond queen|pg||
nt|ronpa: Even if J@S was in south hand, north would just have to duck the first @S and squeeze would be terminated|pg||
nt|mariner1: note 4 @H has more play if @H were 3  3|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|pc|h9|nt|barnets: unluck contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 3-3 clubs or 3-3 hearts or @D finesse|pg||
nt|ronpa: As kib mentioned, a @S duck would terminate squeeze but also would terminate the @S loser :)|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as jdonn points out, East and North will read the lead as a singleton|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Rodwell is probably considering a diamond to the king right here to avoid the trump promotions and ensure making the contract when hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|barnets: if he leads a spade now and north ducks he can make|pg||

nt|barnets: can n x?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  here is one i like (but don't actually play):|pg||
nt|cherdano:  X = takeout with @S+@D|pg||
nt|cherdano:  1@H = takeout with @S+@C |pg||
nt|ronpa: I play with my partner that X = @D's, 1@H=T/O and 2@H=Nat and looks like Meck does the same (but rodwell does not)|pg||
nt|barnets: any tell me why wests bidding?|pg||
nt|ronpa: Because he doesnt understand East has @H's|pg||
nt|cherdano:  because he thinks East showed takeout of hearts?|pg||
nt|barnets: ok tks|pg||
nt|ronpa: Always good to see that the best in the world also has some disasters sometimes|pg||
nt|mariner1: Meck doing a lot of bidding here|pg||
nt|barnets: just when they were coasting|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i think one of them forgot the system|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibs asking if 1@D was alerted to Rodwell?|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Yesterday, Meckwell played a slam with a combined trump suit of Jxx opp Kxxx ...so yes, even the best in the world have their share of accidents|pg||
nt|ronpa: Question is if NS are going to X something here or let them off the hook|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if East passes they will get off the hook i think|pg||
nt|sartaj1: "It was J9x" says a kib|pg||
nt|barnets: i think east may pass but if he bid s3@H north will surely x|pg||
nt|ronpa: still going to lose a bunch of Imps also not dbled but... |pg||
nt|cherdano:  i think North will double anything from here|pg||
nt|barnets: its becomung clear a wheel is loose |pg||

nt|mariner1: 1@D does he know what it is|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|mariner1: S can't be sure N has anything of value|pg||

mb|p|mb|6C|nt|cherdano:  of course, they could still forget momentarily|pg||
nt|sartaj1: This is the upside of bidding with screens. Without screens, 1@H would have been alerted by West and a whole new ballgame would be in play|pg||
nt|barnets: i guessed the pass|pg||
nt|barnets: and nobody x|pg||
nt|barnets: so 100 a trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|ronpa: someone is going to play trump and leave declarer very short of tricks|pg||
