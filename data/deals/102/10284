mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be juicy if north finds a double and south plays for penalties|pg||
nt|bobh1: escape manuevers underway|pg||
nt|bobh1: perhaps this shows a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but escape to where?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: 2@c i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@C wont play too well|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they have a game i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: but south lets them off|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Shi gave it a decent amount of thought b4 deciding on 2@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm sure 2@h shows some values|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|roswolf: they must be the game now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: did yang think this was a transfer?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@S will do the trick - is it a fit jump|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: wow some wheel has come off here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: yang has a look of dismay on his face when he saw the tray come back passed out|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: probably a re-transfer then|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Yang says systems on over double of weak NT, Shi seems to disagree|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|bobh1: systems on is a common arrangement|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: there appears to have been a misunderstanding of the initial double as well it seems, shi explained double as major/minor or something, so stansby explained redouble as showing ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: values|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s might easily bid game here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: looks like 1@H was a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|bobh1: so the weak notrump creates havoc because players are not familiar with their agreements after it|pg||
nt|roswolf: wouldnt happen in england|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: would expect them to bid it given the state of the match|pg||

nt|bobh1: 3@s asks for shortness, 4@s prob kickback|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: now we will see if shi gambles knowing the trump Q is missing|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may sign off now|pg||
nt|roswolf: should sign off perhaps|pg||

nt|bobh1: now lets see him make it|pg||
nt|bobh1: the @h T in dummy complicates life|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphu3: 3nt showed shortness in spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a safe lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: the lack of a trump lead might be an indicator about where the Q is in some circles but not at this level|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: A good choice of contract.   Makes and you may begin to start getting back into it.  Lose it and you may be able to go do dinner early.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: goodish slam for e/w is defeated by the spade break|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: does pass show values?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and that may be diagnosed by e/w because of the overcall|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Guess the vulnerability influenced north's simple raise|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: did the overcall promise both majors?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: mabe the chinese/taiwanese bridge over troubled water torture|pg||
nt|othered1: a large lead and the vulnerability doesn't deter Stansby from taking an aggressive action.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems pre-destined|pg||
nt|bobh1: to me this is a normal double|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: partner is a passed hand, he should not hang you|pg||
nt|othered1: in a vacuum, best play in @S for 4 tricks?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: pass by north?   Double must be near-absolutely for takeout.|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: double is for takeout but n is 4by3|pg||
nt|bobh1: pass has to be considered|pg||
nt|bobh1: if his minors were reversed pass would be clear|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but he may play for penalties here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if he does bid 4@s it will be david's turn to find the missing Q|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: that will easier here|pg||
