nt|sybarra: here we go again playing 3 nt with voids|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: I think EW will soon think they are cursed with void in Partner's long suit - unable to develop|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|benjent: This is a much worse 3NT, but the @hJ lead has been very helpful|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|raghavan: this lead helps declarer 3 tricks|pg||
nt|benjent: I'm just trying to figure out if he can engineer a squeeze on South ... pretty unlikely, looks like he'll need some defensive help to get it done|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|raghavan: + 3 S+1C+1D - should look for 9th where??|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: can take all 4 ht tricks  |pg||
pc|s6|nt|raghavan: defense is helping to set up 2 in Diamond|pg||
nt|benjent: @d switch is not bad, but Zhuang's @s is better because it attacks the communication suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: has to be careful to be able to get back to hand, AND he needs all the @H tricks |pg||
nt|benjent: not a great duck by Liu - this gives declarer an entry to his hand to play @h's, while still having a @s entry|pg||

nt|ronpa: I wonder if 2@D shows @H's so North showed @D's with his X|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cherdano:  Meckstroth can show both his suits if he wants to (assuming 2@D shows hearts)|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can play 2@D :)|pg||
nt|cherdano:  true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sartaj1: I think 2@D is natural because they play 2@H as a good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: no easy entry to dummy hurts|pg||
nt|mariner1: however NS will have to give him an in eventually|pg||
nt|ronpa: I guess Rodwell's pass showed no 3 @H's so meck was hoping for some @D fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: kibbers reminding me this is a violation of Burn's Law (Rules)|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sartaj1: I would guess that 70 players out of the world top 100 would open that hand in 3rd seat; choosing 1@C, 1@H or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|cherdano:  1@H might be the plurality choice?|pg||
nt|barnets: hearts and spade are for a lead|pg||
nt|ronpa: Chris had Q@H lead for 3NT but now its not an option anymore|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough 3N to play here|pg||
nt|cherdano:  redouble showed diamonds|pg||
nt|sartaj1: A couple of days ago, we saw Meckstroth open KJ9x and out (in 3rd seat favourable)|pg||
nt|ronpa: Rodwell knows Meck is @S short so he considers a 4@H bid|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has only 7 top tricks here|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 short|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|barnets: if he could see norths hand he could get another diamond trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ronpa: seems like only high @C lead will give 3NT a chance but its all over, 4@H will need a @D lead to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is likely off 1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: might be better than playing 3N though|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: yes  agreed|pg||
nt|cherdano:  how does the high club lead help? not enough entries to set up club suit as far as i can see|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Assuming the redouble showed diamonds, Rodwell will try to squeeze South between the hypothetical @S Jack and the diamond queen|pg||
nt|ronpa: Even if J@S was in south hand, north would just have to duck the first @S and squeeze would be terminated|pg||
nt|mariner1: note 4 @H has more play if @H were 3  3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: unluck contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 3-3 clubs or 3-3 hearts or @D finesse|pg||
nt|ronpa: As kib mentioned, a @S duck would terminate squeeze but also would terminate the @S loser :)|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as jdonn points out, East and North will read the lead as a singleton|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Rodwell is probably considering a diamond to the king right here to avoid the trump promotions and ensure making the contract when hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|barnets: if he leads a spade now and north ducks he can make|pg||

nt|sartaj1: Declarer knew that the spades were 4-4; diamonds were probably 5-1; if clubs were 5-1 as well, hearts would be 3-3...|pg||

pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  of course, they could still forget momentarily|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: but what do you do with E?|pg||
nt|sybarra: huge hand but for @S's|pg||
nt|benjent: Curse Howard Shenken for popularising that crazy weak 2 idea :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Watch many vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't,  Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: 3NT is by no means a ridiculous contract, but with @c's 5-1, just about the only hope is a @s lead to the Q and K|pg||

pc|h9|nt|sybarra: has to duck a @H at some point |pg||
nt|benjent: Still, South may wind up accidentally endplayed to give West a spade trick .. 1@s, 3@h, 2@d and 3@c looks a lot like 3NT to me3|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  S may well end up on lead towards the end  |pg||
nt|raghavan:  I feel E shold pass 2 S esp with void in S|pg||
nt|benjent: I agree, Rag. West has a decent hand for his 2@s and 3NT is not an appealing contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: you may well be right, and god help them if opps balance |pg||
