mb|1C|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Hi all and welcome, will be interesting to see the Hackett brothers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Typical modern light opening here and we will probably see a landing in 3NT.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pelu: not so light - 6 losers - ok opening|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|justin c: y, they are both imaginative players, and very nice guys|pg||
nt|werge: Here|pg||

nt|pelu: hi Jordan and Urban - US - Sweden- Denmark - good cocktail :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3nt by south at the other table|pg||
nt|werge: Should lead to 3 NT with 9 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nubmaster: yes it is :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnc: The Apteker team is a mixed of South Africa and Sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: But there might be a danger - only give away ONE red trick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|werge: The job is easier with North as declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk3: Hello Calle and Avram|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi Roland and Avram|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|hantveit: Now south will be pushed to make it. He must take the diamond finesse. I cannot see other ways to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: No other way |pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe south could go wrong if east ducked the heart lead?|pg||
nt|werge: No - he would just fines in @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|april7: either W plays S having the ace of @H or might endplay N to lead away from K of @S, I thing he will choose the later|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and Avram|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt again - but some work|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: south will be looking for slam here, dont you think? nice cards though|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|werge: This double - just what East was hoping for|pg||
nt|werge: East has 13 loosers|pg||
nt|justin c: if this is a penalty double it looks quite aggressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: No majors call by E.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|.|nt|april7: on careful defence S should go down in 4@H losing 2@S and 2 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: What has South showed - to me it can just as well go for a 15-17 as for 12-14|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nubmaster: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pelu: I like the pas from East - 5-5 in major, but too weak - 2@D (Michael) only help opp to find the right play|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: I learned: In the middle = 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: East has an easy defence here|pg||
nt|pelu: to bid 2@D = hi opp - can I help u .)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: Looks like 3nt can be made EV Hans? 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades and one heart. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nubmaster: yes, in pairs you ca be more agressive but no reason to act here...|pg||
nt|werge: West ducks the @H-lead, and best for defence will now be a @S-shiftm killing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: If North continues @H, 9 tricks look safe|pg||
nt|hantveit: and south is not overtaking, he might overtake with K|pg||
nt|werge: Sout´s hesitation shows West, that she has K-x|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: In you unblock the King, West is home|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, good point. And his partner...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk3: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|werge: Over now 400 E/W|pg||
nt|werge: What´s problem - with @H 4-3 yoy just loose 4 red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: you|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: the 2@D in Open = 2@HX by East!|pg||
nt|jcwla: I paid my entry fee, I am in there helping them out at these colors. :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR east plays 2@hx|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - 5...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nubmaster: just after a cue-bid showing M's|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: perhaps 2@c wass conventional by EW...?|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding the double - you have an open bridge-book for playing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: At the other table W plats 1NT doubled|pg||
nt|nubmaster: plays|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, the @S Jack is saving a lot for E/W|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: rather easy to see that there are 2 tricks in @d|pg||
nt|werge: But home now|pg||
nt|werge: claim|pg||
nt|hantveit: The contract can always be made, if south is not overtaking the hearts, dec can take the first trick and play diamonds. THAT wuold be a prize play :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|werge: But in France no 1 @H-opening, I thins|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: South has a 5 loser hand. North a 6 loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: That´s why he should have won the @c trick earlier and not be squeezed on the @d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: ok for me, but I have a passed partner, |pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tiny.cc/eegFD  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: aI open a lot of 11 HCP-hands - but this time closer to pass - bad suit - no Aces and problems to show the good @Cs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3!nt is better than 5@d|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: Marty Bergen believes, "Virtually any hand that is worth opening will contain at least two quick tricks."|pg||
pc|d7|nt|justin c: I think they play that 2@C is either natural and GF or a 9-13 @S raise|pg||
nt|nubmaster: He has showed 9-13 3c support and 5c @c|pg||
nt|justin c: presumably 2@D asked and 2@S showed the good raise|pg||

nt|werge: Why keep the @D-entry in North - South is short of entries|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|werge: Might bring him 8 tricks, if he plays @c immediately|pg||
nt|jcwla: West might also have handled this hand differently.  An action double instead of 3@S would be my preference having bid 2@S on the previous round.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR south bid 1NT showing @hs and a m and thet were in 3@h but east bought the contract there with 3@s.. another push here?|pg||

pc|h7|nt|april7: oh, I see|pg||
nt|april7: E bid 1@S not N|pg||
nt|sybarra: or if N bid 1 sp,  1 @H was gf, and pass was forcing is what on spec suggested |pg||
nt|april7: if W plays on @C with the finesse then its easier to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now they will bid 6@h|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|desert: ;)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|hantveit: should unblock club 6 there, in case it is an endplay later.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|werge: @C-ruff and a trump - still I only see 7 tricks, but you might do better|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|april7: its better to take @C finesse first, because even if it works, has to make @C finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|april7: if @S finesse works W has to take @C finesse anyway|pg||
nt|rnc: Remains to play it cautiously|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead for the defence is @h9|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hantveit: when you know the spade honors are behind the king - play low from the king.|pg||
nt|hantveit: I cannot see how now. Maybe ruff a dia and play low spade from K, but too late now. Vest will play spade J and Game over|pg||
nt|werge: When I was a child, we just ruffed and plaued the @H 10 - but that´s long time ago|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - born during second world war...|pg||
nt|hantveit: So, you are still semi-young|pg||
nt|werge: West, please - it´s my lunch-time we are playing with now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c5|nt|april7: then @C finesse @C@Cruff ace of @D @C ruff and pull trumps and so on|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|werge: Fast and easy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: don´t play on @c too early. S will discard a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after this lead W must have a good count on N|pg||
nt|april7: if 9 of @H fourth with S then its more difficult, but  S will play for 3-2|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|werge: Does this 10 really show the Jack?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hantveit: spade T??|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnc: This board will bring Apteker back in the match|pg||
nt|april7: ruff @C, Q of @H, K of @H and again @C ruff high and to ace of @D|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hantveit: Now at least - spade J|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: No @s discard!|pg||

mb|p|nt|hantveit: 12+13 EV, but no fit in majors. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|nubmaster: not clear yet, Nick at east still's thinking|pg||
nt|nubmaster: or 3NT directly|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|nubmaster: he passed, same contract at both tables|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 12 points and a good 5 card suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A Roland slam here.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not in teams, they have to investigate the @s's|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 12-14 - and open for bidding by pd if he is very strong|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hantveit: and 2 aces?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: are they playing pass system?|pg||
nt|hantveit: That makes more sence|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|desert: This board doesnt look very exciting, too....|pg||
nt|werge: What is the E/W system . Jump to 3 NT...?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting contract, there are ways to reach 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess is that they play some kind of pass system Hans.|pg||
nt|werge: EaST HAS APPARENTLY OPNENED 1 @c !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|justin c: this looks like it is going to be very close|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C,3@D,6@H and 1 @S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @d lead at the other table so we keep the average, another imp to NS :)|pg||
nt|werge: This should end up with at least 9 tricks - |pg||
pc|c8|nt|hantveit: hmm, now vest has no entry to the diamons if defence play hearts.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: u are almost right - but East can just play up @D 2x - so not a standard "fork"|pg||
nt|werge: It would be nice to turn back to the flat boards - the big swing in board 5 was tuff|pg||
nt|hantveit: must take the dia finesse now, |pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, hard to play when all those imps are running out...|pg||

nt|Walddk3: After this round there will a long break before the Swiss begins. Restart at 17.30 Paris, 4:30 pm London, 8:30 am Los Angeles, 11:30 am New York|pg||
nt|hantveit: I forgot the bidding in hand 2. East did open pass with a pass hand, so pass system was out the window. :-)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnc: And these two teams will qualify for Swiss A, if only nothing big happens.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|werge: But the @s-duck is not subject to a TEAM-match|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|werge: West is Thomas, East Keaveney, Ireland|pg||

nt|hantveit: I have learned one thing from my father. Look at your cards, ask if you should bid again, if the cards says no, take a green bidding pad that says PAS and put it on the table.|pg||

nt|nubmaster: last one|pg||
nt|justin c: another slam hand|pg||
nt|nubmaster: when in doubt, bid 3NT...|pg||
nt|werge: No big cake here|pg||
nt|hantveit: Last hand arriving, but we have not score from the other room|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: lookd like an easy 4@s on NS with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: @S 2-2, how could they know in OR?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I told them|pg||
nt|werge: Nice man, Wald|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I sdaid: this grand slam makes 4 times out of 10, this is one of the 4|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 18 - only a very good defense could defeat 4@H - played by S a winner - By N @SJ to q and K - AND @S2 back to !10 and now ! = -1|pg||
nt|nubmaster: some action here? NS make 5@c...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If W believes in banging down aces, this could be a Roland Slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks....|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 3@S I propose|pg||
nt|hantveit: there it is, 2nt -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: OK - let´s see it this way. Do´nt bid too GOOD at this board|pg||
nt|werge: 2 NT? Do they play 18-20...?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|april7: otherwise N might pass|pg||
nt|rnc: He took your advise!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nubmaster: hahaha... but they needed that one though... could be 13 imp here|pg||
nt|hantveit: A desperate invite?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nubmaster: Are they playing lebesohl here?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Lebensohl|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: he even herd me|pg||
nt|brolucius: With spades agreed, instead of hearts as in the other room, N-S will surely identify that the queen of trumps is missing.|pg||
nt|werge: Bad luck to pay 13 IMP here - maybe|pg||
nt|justin c: the trouble with agreeing @S is that you get to find out the @SQ is missing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: obviously not...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: so a flat boars. Thanks all and see you again 17.30  CET|pg||

nt|ralfwil: board... I have to change keyboard to a one with better spelling|pg||
nt|rnc: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right there|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: a good convention to be used at this board, then south maybe can go further with 4@c|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnc: Bye and thanks|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play the @SK and the @SJ or @SQ falls from East, you can follow Restricted Choice by finessing the @S10, which increases your chances slightly from that of a 2-2 break. |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|werge: IF  E/W has a 3 NT here - then East has NOT a 1 NT-opening!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|pelu: why not? - even oif N has a semi-positiv hand, there are long way to 5@C|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
