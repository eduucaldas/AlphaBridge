nt|sga1: Cuzzi in a fix.|pg||
nt|genesaxe: with two small in each black suit with W, E has a play for game; now, the question is, how many losers in H does partner have?|pg||
nt|rado: it's commonly accepted cue (2@D) followed by new suit (2@S) to be forcing at least 1 round|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes I agree|pg||
nt|rado: so repeting cue 3@D might misguide W that @h fit was available|pg||

nt|rado: and then 3@S sounds like slam interest cue|pg||

nt|josj: play safe for an overtrick on this lead|pg||

nt|genesaxe: Lucky for E/W the S ten is right (no overruff on the third round of diamonds).  the best play here is a low spade, toward the QJ.  It also happens to work.  |pg||
