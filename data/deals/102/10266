nt|werge: Oh- really|pg||
nt|cicus: strange habit|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: even when they can do better double-dummy :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|werge: Should be a silent 4/5 @H at both tables|pg||
mb|3H|an|.|nt|irwinbo: not so silent but blackwod will save the day|pg||
nt|cicus: NS probably playing NF free bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H INV???  [otherwise why alert]|pg||
nt|werge: A brave 2 @C-bid Versace seems to know, that penalty-double in no part of the game any longer|pg||
mb|4C|an|.|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H would be Non-Force, so 3@H=forcing  hence alerts|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|werge: OR stopped in 5 @H at this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: almost wonder why not immediate ace ask from South|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe 4C was that|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i agree totally with the 2C overcall and think it normal, if a bit dangerous. if opps are on way to 3N, you had better pipe up now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: fun with the international group of commentators Gabor Szots [Hungary], Hans Werge [Denmark], Marshall Lewis [USA]|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i think that 5M making on the nose should be scored as 470. win an IMP against 4M with overtrick. and tie with 480|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: and always the spectators -- thanks for the giggles, insights and corrections|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|cicus: now S may feel 2@H too few, 2NT too much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would open 3D with W hgand, even vul|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|werge: Interesting 3 NT on a @D-lead - no @C-finesse is recommanded|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cicus: I am told that 1@h is limited 6-12 forcing|pg||
nt|cicus: can be, as N promised either real clubs or 15+ HCP's|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a three diamond opener would have propelled ns|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Play will resume tomorrow at 10:00 CET, 4:00 am New York, 9:00 am London, 6:00 pm Sydney. Welcome back then|pg||
