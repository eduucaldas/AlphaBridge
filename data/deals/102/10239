nt|pef: but the last 15 boards here will decide who becomes USA II for the world championship in Brazil in the fall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@H EW will be interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also welcome to our Meckwell expert, Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@c = 16+ Unbal. or 17+ Bal|pg||
nt|pef: n/s might, even at this vul. bid 4s|pg||
nt|lc: Can we get a Weichsel-Ekeblad expert, too?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That would be tough to do :)|pg||
nt|lc: Even they aren't sure at times.. :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|0-7|mb|p|nt|pef: well we've learned about their 2 bids, one level responses, and responses to overcalls|pg||
mb|2N|an|21-23|nt|bigtrain: 2NT =  21-23|pg||
nt|pef: but passing over a strong club with the south hand surprises me a bit|pg||
nt|lc: Many play that direct interference over big @C shows a bad hand.  Maybe that is why Weichsel waited.|pg||
nt|lc: But, now it is too hight.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|transfer|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mtvesuvius: Delayed action over strong @c is used to show a good hand, but it's too late now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|pef: so an unrestricted path to a likely 4h|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: If trailing, West might easily have tried something funny dealer Fav -- but up 23, Meck went the normal way by passing.|pg||
nt|barnets: can declarer overcome the bad heat break?|pg||
nt|pef: seems like even on a trump lead, ew should come to 5 hearts in hand, two ruffs in dummy, two clubs, and a spade|pg||
nt|pef: i don't see too much that n/s can do about it|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|barnets: if he ruffs twice he has a trump loser|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pef: maybe a trump switch now, and then giving partner a ruff with a low diamond|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|pef: so he can play a second trump?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Might need to ruff 1@d or 2 in hand, but nothing too much with the @c working|pg||
nt|pef: no,barnet because he can get his low trumps with either club or spade ruffs depending on what north pitches|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hi all went to open room in error and there is an exciting auction in place|pg||
nt|lc: Very complicated hand to defend.  Weichsel doesn't want declarer to throw dummy's @S3 on @C, but doesn't want to lay down @SA and set up winners for declarer.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hi Martin :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Fleischer won't be pleased|pg||
nt|pef: it seems like the only chance for the defense is the trump switch now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The option would be @d underlead, @s back and trump return, but declarer can still prevail|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The J@D return would give declarer a little trouble|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|c9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|pef: i don't think that's true unless he plays a trump first, still the ten tricks I mentioned|pg||
nt|lc: From Weichsel's point of view, there was room for his partner to have @HQ.  So, by taking his 3 tricks, he is likely to set the hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@CXX in othe rroom|pg||
nt|lc: The @HQ will score even if @HQxx.|pg||
nt|lc: Which way?|pg||
nt|barnets: a bidding misunderstanding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That won't make many overtricks|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w|pg||
nt|pef: hold on to your hats, granovetter and rubin are in 5c redoubled in the closed room|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Uh oh. Granovetter is playing 5@c XXed.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: what is the contract?|pg||
nt|lc: That is not good news for those wanting a close match.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: 5 said it already|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lc: But, good news for Nickell and Freeman, watching us.|pg||
nt|barnets: the very first board|pg||
nt|pef: so this will be a 16 or 17 imp swing to the Nickell team|pg||
nt|lc: Funny that Making 4@H or -1 in 4@H now has very little swing value.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: the Irony :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|barnets: rubin bid 4N over 4@S to show a 2 suiter|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|pef: this format is in some ways awfully cruel, particularly to the Fleisher team if they lose this match.  They will have played for 11 grueling days, beaten many, many super teams, ...|pg||
nt|pef: including Nickell in 120 boards, and have nothing but pride to show for it|pg||

mb|1S|nt|capercliff: here is a slam im sure they will get to|pg||
nt|gavin: lets see if ew have some sort of lebensohl agreement here|pg||
nt|gavin: some people play 2nt here says i have a bad hand, some play it scrambling|pg||
nt|caitlin: not uncommon over this double to have such an agreement|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C on NS, 3NT down|pg||
nt|gowdy: @S and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot compete against this|pg||
mb|p|an|0-4 or trap|mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: 6NT by north the top spot, but 6@D also excellent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, drinks for all on me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict 4h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: assuming they have some kind of two way new minor available|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probs in this contract with the hands so well fitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to the last 16 boards of an exciting match|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: what is 2@H, maybe a relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they opt for the Moysian @S fit it will be a problem|pg||
nt|caitlin: a support double?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: value showing|pg||
nt|lestergold: prob make 3|pg||
mb|4N|nt|raghavan: Double or 4S bid will come|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|caitlin: shows the need for the 2NT bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: if it is, doubling is likely to help opponents|pg||
nt|gavin: was wrong about the line up|pg||
nt|gavin: they did runt he same 4 again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even with lebensohl likely to try 4|pg||
nt|gavin: agree, west hand is so huge, hard to judge|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh What agood bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C good bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: great bidding|pg||
nt|raghavan: Martin did N hear you saying 5C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well yesterday he made good bids i did not say|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna can lead singleton spade but never gets partner in|pg||
nt|raghavan: North reasoningmay be S did not bid 3S over 3H so may be S 3 cards so clubs in S hand is assured|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
mb|r|nt|gavin: north can see at trick one that the only chance to beat this hand is his partner having the Jack of hearts since clubs are frozen if the Q and K are reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wolperts main worry is xx in diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi folks!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hi Martin and Sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: and hello to our wonderful operator, Karen, aka macaw on BBO @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good analysis|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: he will overtake the spade to play another spade|pg||
nt|gavin: hoping declarer leads a high heart from dummy|pg||
nt|gavin: giving him 1 extra chance to beat the hand |pg||
nt|gavin: if his partner has 9x of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho may be a prob for south with last club so mayube only 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT i guess is pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will bid 6@d I would guess, holding 4 small @c's|pg||
nt|gavin: leading a 4th round and having his partner ruff high in hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Martin|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|h4|nt|sharynr: ty Roland|pg||

nt|caitlin: CWTC, owns a major bridge club here|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|vugraphznx: lost the play :(|pg||
nt|gowdy: tell them to slow it down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not that exciting a hand  i think two spades made unless defence errs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gavin: i guess the word faster|pg||
nt|gavin: and jurek|pg||
nt|gavin: dont go together that well|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you here?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: i play weak no trump, when they double, always run, rarely gets any worse|pg||
nt|glen: do you have methods that get to your 4-4 fit?|pg||
nt|gambit: out of the frying pan...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i will settle for a 4-3, even a chunky 4-2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||

nt|thegarve:  LNW result for those who know|pg||
nt|lc: One rule that many expert pairs have is : Redouble of Game Contract always business.|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d!|nt|mtvesuvius: It works well, and avoids alot of those types of problems.|pg||
nt|lc: East must have thought that West would run to  5@D with reds.  |pg||
nt|pef: yes, I don't understand why rubin redoubled instead of bidding 5d, he'd already shown a two-suiter|pg||
nt|lc: No doubt, they will discuss it -- but alas, too late.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  redouble is bizarre, surely 5@D is equal or better @D|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He was worried it would show a @d 1 suiter|pg||
nt|lc: 4NT first had to be 2 suits.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Me: "sorry, but personally I do not like it when people misspell my name and I don't think that Fleisher does either"|pg||
nt|barnets: sigm of tiredness I think|pg||
nt|thegarve:  waaaaahhhhh|pg||
nt|lc: Fleisher just phoned me -- I think after watching board 76, he has more concerns than spelling.  :(|pg||
mb|2S|an|FG, clubs I think|mb|4S|nt|thegarve:  yesa silly comment|pg||
nt|pef: 4s is cold e/w by n/s have two big minor fits so may take the sack|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Note that Meckwell, of course, have an understanding as to the X od the artif. 2@D.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: By the way, 2@c was 10-15 and 6+@c or 5+@s 4+@c|pg||
nt|lc: Some people would play X=@D,  some play it as takeout,  most haven't discussed it, nor wish to.|pg||
nt|barnets: one reason for the big swing is that hamman - zia bid up to 4@S while weichsel passed with the south cards|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, if Weichsel had bid 1@S, I doubt it would have induced 1,600 from Meck.  :)|pg||
nt|barnets: unlikely|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that's an interesting point.  if bidding over the strong club shows weak hands, every so often when you have a good hand you've got real problems|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Him: "pathetic grow up" "your not sorry but high-brow" "so learn a lesson" "and grow up"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Maybe 200, but still...|pg||
nt|lc: Not all West's would be brave enough, VUL, to enter on this Deal (77) with Meck's hand -- but nobody ever accused him of being shy.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lc: In fact, I play (with David) that X=!, so might have gotten blown out and missed 620.|pg||
nt|lc: X = @D|pg||
mc|11|nt|lc: X of most artif bids show that suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm sorry, that was ll supposed to be going to a specific person - I don't know how the gremlins put the whole room in the to box|pg||
nt|lc: Today, more than ever, you need to know what X's mean -- "everyone" has these newfangled artificial bids in so many auctions.|pg||

nt|shals: Good evening this game is being played in beautiful Penticton B>C> I am joining Caitlin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy but "slow" 3nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: all 3 of these players, I believe are from Toronto, certainly Hanna Nader, Jim Green, Darren Wolpert|pg||
nt|caitlin: or Czyz may be Montreal, not sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: match tightened up a little in the last segment|pg||
nt|glen: hi bart, glad to hear you are joining the kast of katz|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: don't ask me|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: welcome Shirley Laidaw|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, ralph & I will be warming up shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but i think if wolpert had heart ace, would have cued at some point, similarly with void|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to envisage 5NT as GSF|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS may play in 1NTor 2C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C has come|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades, double presumably hearts|pg||
nt|caitlin: at Open Table Carruthers, who has won many championships, is from Toronto, his partner Joey Silver from Montreal and L'Ecuyer and Fergani from Quebec|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gavin: with the heart entries in easts hand , north can probably scramble together 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gavin: welcome shirley|pg||

nt|fabsayc: welcome Shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you have come to a Canadian zoo:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/ cannot come in at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 2s may already be overboard|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2@S looks like an underbid  perfect on this hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharynr: should East return to 4@S now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: important here for the defence to give nothing away|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: good plan if they let you do it|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sharynr: i type too slow|pg||
nt|shals: really..I am going to play ther next week ..wonderful tournament|pg||
nt|gavin: me too|pg||
nt|gavin: im about to start my trip around the world in about 4 hours when i leave for stockholm airport|pg||
nt|shals: hope we can meet|pg||
nt|glen: good evening all|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Glen|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: these X  allow the XX,  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: if defence open up hearts for example Green may end up with a trick|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: i guess they dont play super KCB|pg||
nt|sybarra: only helps opps imo |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and we end with a flat board - probably|pg||
nt|capercliff: there are many other ways he could have persued a grand slam on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this broadcast will continue all day, see bbo schedule for time|pg||
nt|capercliff: bye all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might have tried 5@S with hannas hand, he can be sure 6@C is down|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is your itenary, gavin?|pg||
nt|gavin: 8 1/2 hour flight to nyc, go into the city for a few hours (5 hour layover) to hang out with friends, then back to the airport for a 6 hour flight to calgary, another hour to banff ...|pg||
nt|gavin: before i quit for the night |pg||
nt|caitlin: Gavin is also a Wolpert .........Darren playing South:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: nice lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: 6 aces for @H and @s|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: welcome to segment 3 of the Canadian finals from always sunny Penticton|pg||
nt|caitlin: for declarer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Karen, to the commentators, spectators for their comments, to BBO for allowing us to see bridge from everywhere, and to the CBF for arranging this broadcast|pg||
nt|gavin: then spending sunday driving through banff which ive never done before|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|shals: ok|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: fortunately wont have any effect here, but i see no point in this double|pg||
nt|bbramley: another case for 6RKC|pg||
nt|bbramley: good to have some rules for what's trump in ambiguous keycard auctions|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt @H set with raise of @H?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or could be @S with cue bid?|pg||
nt|bbramley: not the way i play - for me 3@S makes both suits key - immed fits in two suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the rule i use is partners suit is the key suit|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharynr: I wonder if  Daniel would have guess @D in 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: and finally get there sunday night , relax have breakfast monday and show up for the ko|pg||
nt|shals: Banff and the trip to the Okanagan is spectacular!|pg||
nt|caitlin: to Penticton??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: warning you will have your picture taken 20 times and be asked to take pictures at least that many times|pg||
nt|caitlin: where you going for KO?|pg||
nt|gavin: penticton|pg||
nt|gavin: regional starts monday night|pg||
nt|caitlin: awesome|pg||
nt|gavin: sucks that i will miss my mom and bro by a day|pg||
nt|lestergold: Green will try to force/encourage the defence to open up something to his advantage|pg||
nt|bbramley: but joey may not know for sure|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: needed to cash a second spade before the diamond|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|bbramley: if joey thought @Hs were the only key suit, then he could be missing a grand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sharynr: I guess Jim made it easier|pg||
nt|sharynr: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: and as he will say.  NEXT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: a club exit is safe|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|shals: ok Gavin, I will bring my camera, then?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gavin: so when he knocks out the heart, he will be able to squeeze hughes in hearts and spades for his 11th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is a dim but it removes an exit card from north|pg||
nt|bbramley: some play first agreed suit, or the major, or whatever - for me it's clear that with a two-suited fit that all of the high honors in both suits are key|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gavin: he is being a little carefull here not wanting to discard a diamond until its late enough in the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if hughes ducks|pg||
nt|gavin: u got it :)|pg||
nt|gavin: so if he ducks he can still negotiate it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club of course may not have been safe from Grainer's point of view|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin: cashes a couple clubs and its the same squeeze in a different way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: run the spades now |pg||
nt|rlebi: hence super kcb|pg||
pc|dA|nt|starkist: 3@s might just be a cuebid|pg||
nt|bbramley: and i mean KEY in the literal sense, as in IMPORTANT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if both suits bid first by same hand, is most convenient to use the higher ranking as the key suit|pg||
nt|rlebi: so then it wouldnt matter|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gavin: jurek can claim|pg||
nt|gavin: but fast ....|pg||
nt|gavin: this actually works as a double squeeze now|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|gavin: he has a complete claim because if turner has the 4th spade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gavin: then he will be squeezed in spades and diamond|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||

nt|lc: Does it ASK?|pg||
nt|lc: Does it SHOW?|pg||
nt|lc: The answer is  ....|pg||
nt|lc: "Forcing, good hand."|pg||
nt|lc: It might or might not show/ask.|pg||
nt|lc: But, the partner typically bids 3NT with a stopper.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think with 1 suit bid it should ask, 2 it should show... A better definition would be "do something intelligent, partner"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell: "don't take too long here"|pg||

nt|Walddk12: Hello Martin x 2|pg||
nt|Walddk12: and George|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D is makeable but requires good guessing for sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: does that show 5-4?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: at this vul probably could be 4-4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it came up in set 1|pg||
nt|caitlin: increasingly popular these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: opponents got to 5@D, and escaped undoubled but down 4|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|mcarroll: Good evening from Dublin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4H beatable?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|caitlin: Martin they haven't played this board??|pg||

nt|fabsayc: score detroit|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh from set one|pg||
nt|glen: S suspects what the minor is|pg||
nt|susieq: I'm a little surprised Grainger didn't open that 3@C|pg||
mb|d!|an|support|nt|mcarroll: Hi Martin, George|pg||
nt|caitlin: Last year Carruthers came in second for Worlds|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT may be better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: is this worth a superaccept?|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suit is blocked and north endplayed|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes end play from the club of course as long as Green reads the position|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2-1 my boys are making a come back:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a 2@H opening in first set, caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: now I understand, thanks:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: duh|pg||
nt|starkist: 2@d 2.5@h bid?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like a diamond shift trick 2 does it in|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: apparently 1NT shows more than a bare 6 count|pg||
nt|bbramley: sure, an early @D ought to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for results so far http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/09files/BWeek09_results.html|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W's interference may have prevented NS from reaching their 5-5 @D fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: click on date time and event|pg||
nt|mittmouse: lets see if turner makes the good technical play of a low club back not that it helps|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi martin x2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi George|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi george|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best they can do is cash club, heart, and play a heart|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Making3|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Lost the play, will claim out the hand when they are done. sorry |pg||
nt|fabsayc: some partnerships use 2@S over 2@H as a relay, would have been handy here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will come close to duplicating the undertricks here|pg||
nt|caitlin: I actually like Bergen super accepts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: perhaps only 2, declarer drawing 2 trumps and playing diamonds for safety|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would think most play 8-10|pg||
nt|caitlin: what do I really care.....the Maple Leafs going nowhere ever so let's have THREE teams here..Hamilton, downtown and Downsview park..let them ALL in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek needed to put in the queen, forcing declarer to win|pg||
nt|caitlin: and unblock?|pg||
mb|p|nt|shals: would all of you lead the j?|pg||
nt|caitlin: depending if you playing Jack denies|pg||
nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: if Eddie Kantar were here he would have a FIT re: lead of Jack:)|pg||
nt|shals: iguess that is where I'm coming from|pg||
nt|caitlin: regardless of HCP you super accept with 9 card fit.. and more to it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: enlighten us Ellen|pg||
nt|raghavan: llen - since S did not make a bid they must be opening with 12 Points ( We were seeing lighter openings in other USA matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes surprising|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8 loser hand I would open|pg||
nt|glen: it helps if W has two ways to bid 3H over 2@S, one to show a great hand|pg||
nt|glen: here E has two bullets (aces) and a fit, so 4@H regardless|pg||
nt|glen: now at this time declarer thinks N's minor is @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: guess they don't play that|pg||
nt|raghavan: any lead helps|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Darren is not shy|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a great lead for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only suit that really matters is spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w have 5 hearts to cash if they get the chance given a heart lead unlikely unless Green finds a double|pg||
nt|starkist: =|pg||
pc|c3|nt|caitlin: I like Rusinow leads by far best|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes easier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is up to carruthers to figure this out|pg||
nt|bbramley: not an easy defense|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: especially in this case|pg||
nt|gowdy: well S has show a 3 suite|pg||
nt|fabsayc: korbel wisely pulls|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|caitlin: gets rid of one heart loser|pg||
pc|dT|nt|shals: the 8 might make pd play the q|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes now he doesnt have to worry about the @Ha|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: the 4-1 spades may slow things down|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club and HK are favourably placed|pg||
nt|raghavan: another H may go on Clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharynr: 9 easy tricks here. should not take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n porbably going off as not likley to take dim finesse in 3n|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@S however, seems too much|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d has reasonable play|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|shals: it still can do damage|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 10|pg||
nt|caitlin: look it how close this match is|pg||
nt|rlebi: he's likely gonna make it now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: took his 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: even Rolan would have doubts about playing 6d|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: arggh|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my money is with the defenc|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could make on cross ruff except that fourth heart will be overruffed|pg||
nt|lestergold: this slam has more holes in it than one of them mousetrap cheeses|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D 22 @S king  @C q ruffs out onside  too good for Roland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but it looks makeable|pg||
nt|glen: and the D took care of that|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: yes Jurek (North) might have made another move|pg||
nt|lestergold: can it be made double dummy?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 tricks looks difficult|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently no does not have quite the entries to south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: both made a cue bid too many - the KH metited an un cue bid if that were possible|pg||
nt|gowdy: ani nteresting push vs 3nt with big upside   sort of shows why slams should have better play thanthis as 5 @D could win big|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: i truely dont understand a club play|pg||
nt|caitlin: E-W played in safe 3D on board 17 for 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|glen: if S had given a @C ruff, it was just ruffing one of declarer's losers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: good line of play for the rest|pg||
nt|starkist: now for sure|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|starkist: I like that play|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c8|nt|caitlin: for 6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|starkist: that too|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ithought playing D A first and back with SQ good|pg||
pc|d9|nt|caitlin: this is not pretty for E-W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this was safer, although diamond ruff unlikely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|caitlin: but if East ducks what now?|pg||
nt|caitlin: low spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy spade exit|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: lost the thread|pg||

mb|2H|an|transfer|nt|susieq: at least according to what I have here|pg||
nt|caitlin: so this is the finals of the CNTC|pg||
nt|glen: 4@C is a splinter, and as you can see from the E hand, partnerships have to agree on how little it can have for working high card points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east hand may actually be above their minimum, but poorly placed|pg||
nt|glen: 4@D here, as played by many experts, is "last train" - last bid below 4@H - it says I like my hand, but may or may not have a @D card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so much depends on cue bid style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last train has its own set of problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: seems like a bid showing majors for me|pg||
nt|susieq: oh my mistake- it's a weak notrump, so it just shows values|pg||

nt|fabsayc: they play Woolsey?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|sharynr: pretty good weakie :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if grainger establishes the spades west must ruff the fourth, leaving losing heart in dummy|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid quickly and down quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the least of which is easts 4@S can be ace or king|pg||

nt|raghavan: W I presume|pg||
nt|caitlin: I might have bid 2H with Nader's hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if E bids 3@S W may venture 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will bid again S and W 3NT |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt by west down on spade lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: ah it will take a while |pg||
nt|mittmouse: 4s is cols from the n side|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: easy 3@S, and 2@D can be made|pg||
nt|sharynr: risky pass, David should expect a void|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bidding may be riskier|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this should go down|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is a skinny 2N|pg||

nt|mittmouse: cold|pg||
pc|c7|nt|caitlin: so then Canada and Mexico vie for spot in Brazil|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: possibly 3@S now|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna is President of Canadian Bridge Federation which sponsors the CNTC's|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like 2@D was cold also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: biddable is not so clear|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|raghavan: RE has bid twice- 5 cards why develop|pg||

nt|caitlin: Bermuda used to be part of that but has spot in Central American zone|pg||

pc|s5|nt|sharynr: excellent result for N-S|pg||

pc|s3|nt|gowdy: not sure about that  north has an interesting hand  depends on meathods |pg||

nt|caitlin: ohhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|glen: S has a good @H fit, but soft values in the other suits, and no ruffing value|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  his means we have two sets of boards, one at each table, so my duplication accuracy will be put to the test...but nobody will wait for a board|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the claim was for making 3 :)|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|gavin: 4-3 pittsburgh, thats practically like bringing the cup to canada|pg||

nt|caitlin: "practically"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do you figure that gavin|pg||
nt|gavin: our young superstar wins|pg||
nt|lestergold: tame 3n here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a quackery|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: these transfer responses ar gaining popularity everywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: i quite like it after a double, puts the doubler on lead but requires lots of notes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this tricky lead is going to backfire|pg||

nt|gavin: vancouver is the only canadian team with a hope|pg||

nt|shals: I hope!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hope springs eternal, go whitecaps|pg||
mb|4S|nt|starkist: not beating now|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3NT is the simplest bid available|pg||
mb|p|nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: Gavin would you bid 3C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gosh i must be old, i pass in second seat|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is risky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but quite a play problem|pg||
nt|raghavan: Which is the 9th trick? |pg||
nt|mcarroll: He has to find one of the @SJ,@DQ or @CQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will probably attempt to combine chances|pg||
nt|raghavan: C Q difficult|pg||
nt|gowdy: looks like coffee ( or wine ) time here|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 6@S|pg||
nt|caitlin: moi aussi|pg||
nt|shals: me too|pg||
nt|gavin: i wouldnt open :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: cash top cards in one minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: with hearts 3/3 and the qc as entry no probs in this contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that tame, saved by heart split and club ace right|pg||
nt|glen: dummy comes down and declarer thinks should I work out on how 4@S would do - no first, play this|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gavin: but no i wouldnt bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|caitlin: 3@C Fit showing jump by passed hand|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not bergen?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey just asking|pg||
nt|caitlin: why not drury then?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|shals: yes it is|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why i said it was tame as the cards lie not in an absoluiter sense|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Karen our operator?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but does he have a losing alternative, perhaps not|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Karen:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I almost fell asleep in the sun:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so he has to establish clubs and that means spades will be established and he cannot lose the lead again|pg||
nt|lestergold: so its a one shot contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharynr: good stop by E-W|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Gowdy:)|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  four rounds to play in COPC; we'll announce leaders when posted|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: down 1 or numerous overtricks on this defense|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what if korbel ducks two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then the hearts squeeze hanna|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharynr: looks like N-S make 21H so even down 1 is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry, they are playing too fast and lost thread |pg||
nt|sharynr: but that was a reasonable shift|pg||
nt|mittmouse: technically hanna should now try a club if that is wrong he has to take a s finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: good point G|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so saved by the diamond 9 then|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: or possibly cash @Ss to check if they are 3-3 or the J falls, then 2 top @Cs|pg||
nt|raghavan: finessing towards w is likely - since W may not know that H K is alone|pg||
nt|caitlin: he will finesse West for @DQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna will try K then lead low to the Q better odds than playing anything else|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think any bid showing spade support would have turned Turner on:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: crosby doing pushups with the cup|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green gave count|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna knows that the ace will be held up otherwise|pg||
nt|caitlin: so David Grainger and Daniel Korbel|pg||
nt|lestergold: better unblock hearts now he will of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did he really pitch a heart?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he did hes dead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|shals: woops this is going to be tough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a crystal ball tuner, Mike|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin: 2 down with a winning finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks misere from here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching a spade gives up any chance of a make|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me 3@C would be clubs only|pg||
nt|caitlin: I see 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: good save against 2@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: upside down|pg||
nt|glen: yes, but he was doing it in hope to entice a @S play|pg||
pc|d5|nt|caitlin: no X no trouble?|pg||
nt|shals: maybe|pg||
nt|caitlin: let's remember these guys may be TIRED|pg||
nt|gavin: oh ya, this is a gruelling event to say the least|pg||
pc|d9|nt|caitlin: for me FSJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand and in competition|pg||
nt|caitlin: they didn't get here without lots of play|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't we all..|pg||
nt|gavin: its an achievement to be in the finals but the losing team probably wont feel that way|pg||
nt|shals: true..|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmm|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is going well for declarer|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: north will just keep discarding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open Room got to 4@D on 3|pg||
nt|gambit: To all you hockey fans Pitt wins 2-1 in a nailbiter |pg||
nt|glen: though the D can clearly see that a @H discard is called for|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. don't trust that @S discard at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry too fast |pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: down 2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|caitlin: Yes Cam this has been a topic woven in with bridge:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Detroit is a big bridge city|pg||
nt|lestergold: why hold on to the pesky diamonds|pg||
nt|bbramley: south has a lock to play @Cs - east has shown 16 HCP already and is marked with at most 3 @Cs|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|capercliff: then he will be endplayed|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is not going to make this way|pg||
pc|dK|nt|raghavan: comes to S J|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: no, 3 tricks to defense|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|caitlin: wd|pg||

nt|lc: Here is the Ekeblad-WEichsel summary :  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=418&pid=131|pg||
nt|thegarve:  e/w have mirror hands - certainly not N/S|pg||
nt|lc: They really should have the deceny to sit East-West, because every time I go to abbreviate their names I think better of it ( too confusing to call them E - W ).|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I was thinking that a few rounds ago also :)|pg||
mb|2N!|an|FG, asking|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|thegarve:  7 card support for a two-suiter and only a 2NT response|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Spec suggests it's time for exclusion blackwood in a black suit :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|barnets: a good convention for south might be blackwood|pg||
nt|lc: That's George Jacobs' favorite ...|pg||
nt|barnets: or redwood|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: But Weichsel sits East, so it would still be confusing to use E & W|pg||
nt|lc: I suspect 4@D is ace-asking.|pg||
nt|pef: judging from the amount of time being spent--not clear if ekeblad believes that to be the case|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|an|2 keycards, no Q|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: apparently not|pg||
nt|barnets: forget?|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, South had the hand for it.|pg||
nt|lc: They have not exactly been steady --  a tough system to learn for a not-regular partnership.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@d over 2@D is RKB?|pg||
nt|pef: seems like he meant it as blackwood, but ekeblad didn't think so.  now weichsel tring to decide what to do|pg||
nt|lc: 5@D would not be a possible response.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad wrote that 5@d showed he likes his hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is why there are screens :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  he'll pass|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@d could be void showing with some   of KCs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel said that 4@d just showed he was coming in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Although Blackwood is not alertable anyway, so this wouldn't cause an ethical problem.|pg||
nt|pef: ok, a bit of thrill for the crowd but arrived at a normal contract that shouldn't take more than a moment to play|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now verbally, Russ says he's shown a good hand, 6-4 in hearts & diamonds, 2 keycards, no Q (I don't know why he wrote "I like my hand"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'm told that 4@d was "Optional RKC" and 5@d is a Max w/2 Aces|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lc: So, Ekeblad likes his hand,  Weichsel thought 4@D was not BW -- but  5@D is now showing 2 keycards?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|mc|11|nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, when Weichsel wrote @d on the pad I guess he meant Keycard in @ds - might have said that softly and I didn't hear it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Short break for Meck and Eke to smoke|pg||
nt|lc: Earlier this week, the teams up 40 seemed to get dealt VERY swingy boards at the end.|pg||
nt|lc: They were complaining that it was "fixed."|pg||
nt|lc: Now today, these boards are just wat the NICKELL team ordered.  So far, anyway.|pg||
nt|lc: Did they go outside to smoke?|pg||
nt|lc: Earlier this week, there was an incident.|pg||
nt|barnets: nickell were down by over 100 to fleisher the first time and lost by 7|pg||
nt|lc: Without naming names, let's just say that smoking in the hotel is not allowed.|pg||
nt|pef: oh comeon, name names, we won't tell anyone :)|pg||
nt|lc: Several years ago, there was also a smoking incident in this same hotel.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: If you want the names, you can do the research yourself :)|pg||
nt|lc: Again, not naming names.|pg||
nt|lc: The one in 2006 (?) involved a fire alarm during play.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The answers are hidden secretly at www.usbf.org :)|pg||
nt|pef: thanks, specs for the names!|pg||
nt|lc: THis year, all play is in private hotel rooms -- the beds were removed.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Interesting idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what a shame, I need one|pg||
nt|lc: Each hotel room (on the floor above the lobby) has the beds removed, the mirrors covered, etc.|pg||
nt|lc: Each room has 1 table with screen -- 4 chairs -- room for Vugraph operator -- not much else.|pg||
nt|lc: Every board in this event was played that way.  No main "ballroom."|pg||
nt|lc: The "smoking incident" was when some players thought it a good idea to smoke in the bathroom of the hotel room.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Interesting, nice format for a smaller event|pg||
nt|pef: Connie Goldberg tells me the women had balconies in their playing rooms at the women's trials--so no problems there in that much more civilized event|pg||
nt|lc: While I am chatting, there are so many people that made this event run well.|pg||

mb|p|nt|mittmouse: i think he must have done it right good technique by hanna|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needed 6 hearts for his overcall, so finesse long odds at the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator says it was a heart discarded|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharynr: Would anyone open east hand and if so, what|pg||
nt|gavin: too strong for 2C then 2nt too|pg||
nt|shals: and hockey city|pg||
nt|gavin: so many slams where partner doesnt show interest|pg||
nt|gavin: 1D is a reasonable choice |pg||
nt|raghavan: Part score deal|pg||
nt|caitlin: a constructive 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in which case unless im missing something it was a bad error|pg||
mb|3S|nt|susieq: I would open 3@D but I'm a little crazy|pg||
nt|caitlin: whereas if he were weaker he would first bid 1NT then 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise  2 spades 2 clubs 5 hearts and contract made|pg||
nt|starkist: all I know is I'm leading the @h j on this hand|pg||
nt|bbramley: @H8 is the key card|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: both k's are working|pg||
nt|susieq: that's fit showing|pg||
nt|caitlin: Turner will pass I assume|pg||
nt|gambit: Will C balance? I thk y|pg||
nt|gavin: this auction would almost always be 4-6 or 5-6|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to picture partner with a hand good enough for this action that doesnt have 6 diamonds |pg||
nt|gavin: turner has a monster|pg||
nt|gavin: (given the state of the auction)|pg||
nt|gavin: with  aspade stopper and 3 diamonds and the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|gavin: i think he owes hughes 2 or 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: 1nt = @C|pg||
nt|gowdy: suit or a lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|capercliff: interesting choice to bid 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may regret not playing 4@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4333 often plays at least a trick better in 4 of a major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 4@S an easier contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: neither is very good|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, 3D, and the QH, extras given his pass, but monster, No.....a couiple modest redeeming features, |pg||
nt|mcarroll: On Board 1 I see they did prefer the Moysian @S fit rather than @Cs and it cost 11 imps|pg||
nt|caitlin: they play constructive so 2@S 8-10 HCP|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is not forward going, but Jurek still tempted|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3@S is preemptive not constructive|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes some play 1@S 2@S 3@S stop|pg||
nt|caitlin: I personally don't like it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as there is no entry to Dummy, on a @D lead to take advantage of a discard on the @HA 4 @S goes down|pg||
nt|raghavan: S is trying to prevent EW going to 3H and later if he ventured - may be doubled - Of course he does not know N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that does not automatically beat hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And there are slow @C losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: nice hand for fit showing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|capercliff: even with both K's working hard to see 10 tricks|pg||

mb|d|nt|gavin: he cant have a better hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: We cannot find fault with N for his bidding|pg||
nt|caitlin: well if they play 1S 2S 3S stop we can|pg||
nt|starkist: darn need to play xfer lead doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 4@S might have been reached (and made)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think green should have tried 3@D in that case|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this is a steal im surprised green didnt bid 3d then hanna would bid 4s |pg||
nt|sharynr: but as is the case when both sides make a major suit game, the bidding might not have stopped at the 4 level|pg||
nt|gavin: funny to balance your opponents from 1D into 3NT|pg||
nt|caitlin: how true|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has maximum for his 2S bid|pg||
nt|glen: the 2/1 way to make a 3 card limit raise - 1NT (forcing/semi-forcing), then 3 of the major|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: good things H's are 3-3 or this would be really ugly|pg||
nt|capercliff: cancel that|pg||
nt|capercliff: even I could make 4 tricks with this @h suit:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in no trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: what out what you ask for|pg||
nt|gavin: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: czyz will have an easy time finding hte club shift|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fabsayc: seems down if defense passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have stayed low nough to make  a plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: the king of spades asks his partner to unblock an honor or give him upside down count|pg||
nt|caitlin: he showed it with constructive raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: this will go down quickly |pg||
nt|gambit: as a plus |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict slowly|pg||
nt|gambit: you know David? Methodical |pg||
nt|gavin: when south gets in with the first diamond|pg||
nt|gavin: he will undoubtedly lead a spade|pg||
nt|gavin: since his partner lead the king, thats their power lead he knows that he has a GREAT spade suit|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to know if he has 5 or 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad spade break and poor communications with dummy would make higher level contracts very precarious|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|gambit: 3-2 diamonds would work losing 1 diamond, 3 spades|pg||
nt|rlebi: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: some problems now for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the simplest solution, finesse the club|pg||
nt|caitlin: he has to|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: brave play, minimizing the loss|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: why rush with ace of dim?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was a mistake but afraid hanna would draw partners lone trump|pg||
pc|d3|nt|caitlin: then how back to hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: finessing @Ds against North??|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharynr: i am sure NS would have pushed to th5 5-level|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky spade position|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mittmouse: look at what that fit showing jump did for graingers hand he would have bid to the 5 level if necessary|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had Hanna tried 8s it would have been very revealing!!|pg||
nt|mittmouse: carruthers must have missed a spot|pg||
nt|starkist: teasing @d10 play|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: this is why i hesistated with my comment, was not at all clear|pg||
nt|gavin: that was an odd play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond lead would have made this tougher, but i think still makes|pg||
nt|glen: yes, the @D lead head towards a forcing defense|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|glen: the idea being to play @Ds at all chances|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: contract still in jeapordy tho|pg||
mc|12|nt|gavin: and darren playing the queen of diamonds was bad also|pg||
nt|gavin: only lying to his partner|pg||
nt|caitlin: this has not been a lucky 3rd or beginning of 4th set for Carruthers team|pg||
nt|gowdy: a new variation  pitch a winner on a loser   but maintain control|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: hmm... we can talk in the meantime I assume :)|pg||
nt|pef: larry, jan just told us, the bidding and board does not match here|pg||
nt|lc: P 1NT  -- Jan???|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So let's try to be quiet while Jan is our radio reporter|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell: A42, At, QT987m K83; Meck: 76, K763, A642, T54|pg||
nt|barnets: correct board up|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel had KJxxx of spades and led one|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell won and started on diamonds.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: NS took the first diamond, continued spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: NS then played a club and Rod played more diamonds. WEichsel is cashing spades. NS have 4 spades and 2 diamonds so far|pg||

nt|caitlin: they haven't played this board yet|pg||
nt|raghavan: Give credit to E playing small Spades. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think he unblocked hearts before club ruff|pg||
nt|raghavan: and not SJ|pg||
nt|bbramley: but still no reason to duck 2nd @H in either case|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|starkist: true|pg||
mb|1S|nt|capercliff: what to bid...|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 4 OR smart to be in 3@D making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 22|pg||
nt|shals: intersting all over the scoe bd|pg||
nt|caitlin: Karen how did you land up operating in Penticton if you are American?|pg||
nt|glen: for a close final quarter, this table is moving quickly, which is nice for everybody watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not for me :)|pg||
nt|starkist: throwing away down tricks|pg||
mb|d|an|cards|mb|2H|an|spade raise?|nt|capercliff: 2@h is never enough these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: British Columbia|pg||
nt|glen: true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess "dont watch" wont work|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no try?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gavin: monster super accept for cz|pg||
nt|gavin: tough to avoid slam on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: joey cant have side ace?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: its on a finesse but they have so many wasted points|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but they always bid 3nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: how does everyone feel about 3N?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Silver made 5@d on the second hand, for 8 imps|pg||
mb|3D|nt|caitlin: tell us later:)|pg||
nt|rlebi: no take A no get A|pg||
nt|rlebi: @s|pg||
nt|starkist: risky to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Silver laughed when he saw dummy: "and hope you make it partner" |pg||
nt|fabsayc: guess that answers my question :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so i like to have a semblance of a side entry for 3 preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is "normal"|pg||
nt|gavin: ok obviously not as tough as i thought|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|gavin: i guess 2nt was 20-22|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 1 OR Silver bid 1@S over 1@H overcall......did Carruthers assume he had 5?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: on the bidding declarer probably should finess through N for @SJ to cater for a 4-1 break - which does not cost in this instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h does jam the auction nicely, you know if you double partner is bound to bid 4m|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is better than 22|pg||
nt|gavin: so darren could see it wasnt going to be great even opposite a super accept|pg||
nt|gavin: i agree|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't you bid 2c then 2n?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah, opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@D is a reasonable spot with the bonus of making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H will make|pg||
nt|glen: this setups a possible @H discard, and a lot depends on how declarer places the cards|pg||
nt|bbramley: good cash|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcarroll: 2@H makes|pg||
nt|caitlin: loses 1@H 2@S 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c makes as played by west|pg||
nt|caitlin: very tough to get to|pg||
nt|gowdy: Karen  if there is a break in the action tell Green that I shot 78 today   Thanks :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: hey Gowdy awesome:)|pg||
mc|9|nt|sharynr: but both bd 20 and 22 will swing the match the other way, i predict|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6D makes 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but assuming a direct raise of diamonds was forcing, this is not a strong sequence |pg||
nt|caitlin: run clubs get rid of 2 hearts ruff a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: all up to North to shoot for it or not|pg||

nt|lc: So many others -- but back to bridge.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: we'll be skipping board 82 for the moment - one of the players inadvertently saw a few cards from another player's hand and the director is making a new board 82. We won't be able ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: to show it to you but I will do the best I can to tell you what's happening when we play it|pg||
mb|1D!|an|can be short, can have longer !ss|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|mtvesuvius: Does the CR know this also I assume?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: radio transmission kind of|pg||
nt|lc: That happened to David and me a few days ago. We bid to +2210 and then were told they screwed it up at the other table -- and redealt it.  Ugh.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Yes, the board has been removed from both rooms|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|an|denies 3!ss|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lc: Supposedly, PASS denying 3-card support (when playing SUPP X's) is not alertable (in normal non-screen) events.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|lc: I think it should be.  And I alert it. |pg||
nt|lc: It is info -- I think opps are entitled to it.|pg||
nt|lc: So, I am breaking the rules. Sue me.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, I don't think it makes any sense that double is alerted and pass isn't--someone is going to have to explain the logic of that to me|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The pass used to have to be alerted I think|pg||
nt|lc: Also, I alert the raise promising 4.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Before we started this board, Meck said "remind me or I'll mess up my scorecard" After he lead, Rod reminded him, but it was too late|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, maybe we should talk about why N-S are in a 5-1 fit here.|pg||
nt|lc: If North wanted to compete, I'd expect X -- "cards" at his second turn.|pg||
nt|lc: Not a rebid in his 5-card suit when partner can't have decent support.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@CX more interseting contract|pg||
nt|lc: Had he doubled (cards), South would gladly have passed.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

mc|6|nt|lc: The LAW of Total Tricks (haven't mentioned it all session) says :  With a 5-1 fit and a 5-3 fit, it is better to play the 5-3.|pg||

nt|caitlin: that is East Jim Green|pg||

nt|glen: with actual play of hand|pg||
nt|rlebi: quite a few tricks available|pg||
nt|susieq: he's got some hands from the Cavendish in Vegas to put in as well before he gets to this :)|pg||

nt|shals: what does that indicate?|pg||
nt|caitlin: raise in diamonds|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: limit|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4+|pg||
nt|caitlin: Korbel thinking of raising|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: i think its a mixed raise , we will see based on norths response|pg||

nt|bbramley: george, not in general|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: worked out well for him|pg||
mb|2C|nt|raghavan: Ellen and Martin - what will N play now after SQ - will he play club small??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably win and shift to a club, although that does not look hopeful|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he overtakes that is his only hope|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps a heart better|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Martin?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that is what he is thinking about, I would opt forsmall@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: attacking communication|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be the Green convention|pg||
nt|glen: yes, Green convention, asking for aces|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H likely showed 0 or 3 aces (E suspects 3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is fine if you don't do it also on garbage hands|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect!|pg||
nt|shals: yep|pg||
nt|caitlin: asking re minor which can't be clubs|pg||
nt|glen: 5@C confirms all aces, and now W has good playing value if E has the right hand opposite|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: I wonder whom you are rooting for Gavin?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: pittsburgh !!! oh my brother|pg||

nt|caitlin: we shall see......not so easy|pg||
mb|2D|nt|caitlin: and which is more important?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good choice |pg||
nt|capercliff: normal with a stiff honor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: anyone know what 2Nt asked for|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|starkist: what a steal this was|pg||
nt|bbramley: and he's going to make 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: @s lead will hold it to 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: may have been singleton?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Pittsburgh on a power play|pg||

mb|p|nt|gowdy: not now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh my|pg||
nt|glen: and only a ruff can beat this 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|rlebi: unusual but effective auction|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: i don't think this auction calls for trump lead either|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wouldnt think so|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I caught all the play on that one :)|pg||
nt|glen: lol :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all 139 spectators are sworn to not tell roland|pg||
nt|rlebi: 16 imp diff now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gavin: wheres the contract that consents if detroit wins my bro wins ? ill sign |pg||
nt|fabsayc: Jxx and Jx are ugly for trump lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: 8 boards - 2 imps a board until a playoff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: but is hard to see why a spade is best|pg||
nt|caitlin: nada tricks for NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this right??|pg||
nt|mcarroll: K worked better|pg||
nt|raghavan: fell in the trap- 2Club tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well now a heart seems clear|pg||
nt|caitlin: it's right he played North for KQ tight|pg||
nt|gowdy: tuff lead     this looks normal|pg||
nt|caitlin: what else to lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass right to dummy|pg||
nt|caitlin: underlead a heart to stiff @HK??|pg||
nt|caitlin: can't be or he would have clubs:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: a few|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart or club ace were clearly alternatives, also with their losing cases|pg||
nt|caitlin: low heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna thinking of winning clearing trump|pg||
nt|caitlin: ???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he cant do that, would have no chance then|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|caitlin: :) so blood is thicker than hockey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck again looks best|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharynr: well my predictions stink....bd 20 open room in 4@D DBL|pg||
nt|gavin: its amazing how often ducking to keep control in trumps is right when they break bad and you have length w/ the ace|pg||
nt|gavin: both as defender or declarer|pg||
nt|gavin: unless you clearly need to clear trumps ASAP , its better not to win your ace until the last chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or 3@D|pg||
nt|starkist: then a shoot off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely not two overtricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just making|pg||
nt|rlebi: sudden death|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: typo|pg||
nt|bbramley: all the same impwise, for making 110, 140 or 170|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: fixed it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: yes very imaginative by jurek|pg||

nt|caitlin: declarer has to play diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this defense may cost a trick|pg||
nt|shals: would one think of 1n first?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: claim time|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is not going to make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gavin: unless he guessed the singleton king of hearts in the first place he couldnt make after turner ducked two rounds of spades|pg||
nt|gavin: which could not happen|pg||
nt|caitlin: true enough|pg||
nt|caitlin: so N will get his diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now a diamond, but which one|pg||

nt|barnets: in3@D e.w in closed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Back to boards where the bidding will match what you see on the screen|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol Larry|pg||
nt|pef: and back to another dull one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|lc: Yup  flat 4@H, you'd think.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: although I suppose there's some chance they will stop below game|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5+ clubs, FG|nt|mtvesuvius: These are just when Nickell wants|pg||
nt|lc: Weichsel overcalls now, but didn't on 76.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = NAT GF|pg||
nt|lc: "Stop below game" and Meckwell should not be mentioned in the same sentence.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: yes, anyone who considers that a game force opposite a 16+ club is not to be trifled with at the partscore level|pg||
nt|lc: In a GF already.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|5+ !hs|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 5+@H, asking|pg||
nt|thegarve:  seems weird that 2@c is nat GF and not a transfer|pg||
nt|lc: As Meckstroth always tells me, "They pay a bonus for vulnerable games."|pg||
mb|2S!|an|0-2 !hs, minimum, not 4 controls|nt|bigtrain: 2@S = <3@H, minimum hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|barnets: 3n works better than 4@H i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2NT = waiting|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: great spot|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lc: Not clear if 3N or 4@H is better. Is it?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@H is easy too|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nice spot|pg||
nt|barnets: try making 4@H on a spade lead|pg||
nt|pef: a diamond lead makes this very nervouse (need specifically a doubleton k of hearts in the north hand), but fate seems to be with Nickell at the moment|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck confirms that Rodwell's 2@d showed 5+ @hs - "wanted to make 100% sure we got the right explanations"|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lc: Not clear how to play 3NT.|pg||
nt|lc: If you know @D 4-4, you rely on @C -- not @HKx on.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 82 scored now. 1 IMP to Fleisher|pg||
nt|lc: It might depend on def. signals -- as to whether Rodwell can read the situation.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|pef: true, 44 diamonds and still you do need the heart finesse, though|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Small @h from Ekeblad in tempo would be great|pg||
nt|pef: i wish clubs had split, that would make it more interesting on the finesse vs. squeeze line|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lc: Of course, we see that he can't go wrong.|pg||
nt|pef: well, perhaps he can, if south has the k of hearts he's squeezed, right?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: So much easier when we play double dummy :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lc: When @C don't come in, sqz not enough tricks.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now small @H back in tempo|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pef: although now clubs don't split, so we are back to kx of hearts onside|pg||
nt|lc: I think he will have to rely on @HKx after all.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I wanted to see that :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|lc: Surely, Rodwell will be thinking about sqz -- and Adam is right -- a low @H back would force him to go wrong prematurely.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|barnets: I was asked about 4@H by specs dec has different options how to play it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s6|pc|cQ|nt|lc: Oh yes -- he had extra entry -- so no problem.|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Open Room replicated the 1NT-3NT auction on board 6|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting, both not wanting to miss an early Vul game|pg||
nt|sharynr: but they did|pg||
nt|gavin: his low heart play would work any time hearts were 3-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north forced to give east a spade trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4H + 2C+1D\|pg||
nt|gowdy: ruff a @C draw trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes john|pg||
nt|susieq: the cards are definitely going East-West this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@H both majors?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E thinks his hand is too good for an old fashioned 3@d bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes shows both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: he needed to keep his ace of hearts in his hand for an entry to draw trumps after he leads up towards his jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so always makes if declarer plays right|pg||
nt|raghavan: a part score deal I hope EW do not jump to game in a Major|pg||
nt|chorush: there was no flannery. what would he be upset about?|pg||
nt|starkist: chugging contest|pg||
mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|fabsayc: in that case 2@S by east can be natural or artificial, you need to discuss a defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is S worth an immediate 4@S?|pg||
nt|gavin: very tough hand will be interesting to see the line in the other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 10-1 somebody bids game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Obviously he thinks so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe too strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S AND 4@H are both feasible|pg||
nt|gavin: unlikely he will leave them there|pg||
nt|gavin: 7-4 white vs red|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green does not have to accept transfer|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will reject transfer and bid 3S|pg||
nt|rlebi: wrong sided for @Ss already|pg||
nt|rlebi: better stay low for a plus|pg||
nt|starkist: canoe race|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-8|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 5@D in big trouble|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 5@c is better, best defence can get 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: must be a @h lead for 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: anything else is 500|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to lead a @H fromS, @S the obvious lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club ruff and heart heart switch works also|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont believe you can gain a trick by claiming if it is impossible to  make it....and in that defense they could not make a mistake?|pg||
nt|caitlin: best to lead trump|pg||
nt|starkist: snowball fight|pg||
mb|1H|an|possible canape|nt|sharynr: will any director out there agree?|pg||
nt|rlebi: sry, dreaming here|pg||
nt|glen: could declarer draw all the trumps and pick up @Ds?|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. just lose to the @D ace if guesses suit right|pg||
nt|rlebi: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S presumably no singleton and extras, and for that hand he is close to minimum|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: not clear, but more likely daniel ducked heart|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hoping declarer would play the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: or S and switch|pg||
nt|gowdy: coffee time |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast they may bid slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs three diamonds so percentage is finesse of queen|pg||
mb|2C|nt|capercliff: yes that works as well Martin|pg||
nt|capercliff: no doub!!!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: I guess that is what happened martin, since daniel apologized|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: must be joking|pg||
mb|2H|nt|capercliff: guess he didnt think he was taking even 1 @s trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was the problem with 4@S, did not invite partner to participate|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he did open|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb...barbecue going:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: or at least try for it|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 S  strong H raise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|caitlin: if Hanna is going to bid it should be 4@S|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S = he skipped a @H cuebid, since minimum for 3@S|pg||
nt|rlebi: he didnt bid 4@s,did he?|pg||
nt|glen: the question is whether he plays serious 3NT or not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have based on hand overall minimum|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 3@S was expected|pg||
nt|caitlin: a splinter with 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|gowdy: no 3S artifical|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh|pg||
nt|gowdy: smolen|pg||
nt|caitlin: smolen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a splinter, can be balanced or singleton spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or perhaps unspecified splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT asks for a second suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just in case partner has both majors|pg||
nt|rlebi: not too many imps gonna swing on this one|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gambit: trump switch?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe heart to king now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many ways to play that bid|pg||
nt|rlebi: running low on boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: NV vs vul, shows 8 major cards and a lot of hope :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: from N's perspective his partner is weak for 4@s|pg||
nt|raghavan: If at all I have to bid - I will bid 4S - He has 2 Spades but no guarentee that E will have 2 Hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: serious 3nt would help a lot on this specific auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well not sure what turner signal meant|pg||
nt|bbramley: will the bridge cops let them finish?|pg||
nt|starkist: flash suggested tree climb good for that area|pg||
nt|rlebi: there is a precedent for that|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: hughes knows the entries wrong for trump leads|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah i think a trump lead on the go was best from his hand|pg||
nt|gavin: when partner bids vul against not , its very likely he was bidding to make|pg||
nt|gambit: Diamond to the queen/ King...then trump from my good friend, David Turner |pg||
nt|caitlin: Welcome gambit (Cam French)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is the Canadian Society of Commentators CSofC:)|pg||
nt|gambit: TY Caitlin great to see my compatriots competing|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed|pg||
nt|rlebi: l'ecuyer could slow down the pace - while in the lead - run em out of time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gowdy: yes 3 of the other major after 2c and a major response is artifical showing the strongest support raise |pg||
nt|fabsayc: here comes an imp|pg||
nt|bbramley: close matches automatically slow down at the end - and why not? when you KNOW it's close you grind out every imp|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gavin: in fact his only chance on this hand is to actually draw trumps then eventually guess clubs|pg||
nt|caitlin: end of first period 0-0 btw|pg||
nt|gavin: thx|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|gavin: he was hoping to see singleton jack of hearts so he could go over to dummy to lead clubs up twice (once with heart and once with diamond)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gambit: what does he pitch? all cards have a value....|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: so 1100 turned into 400|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gavin: this play would have him make the contract if kjx of diamonds were onside|pg||
nt|gambit: club|pg||
nt|gambit: and spade exit|pg||
nt|gavin: the play doenst matter much at this point he will just lose 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gavin: one goes on diamond ace and one ruffed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bbramley: i think they should allow some extra time in the last stanza of a match|pg||
pc|sT|nt|caitlin: spade now |pg||
nt|gavin: now if hughest plays a diamond declarer wont lose another club|pg||
nt|starkist: lets petition for it|pg||
nt|rlebi: the directors get hungry, thats what matters, doesn't it?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|caitlin: he wouldn't|pg||
pc|s2|nt|capercliff: how did they make 3NT they will ask when comparing|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Except it takes longer to type USAII|pg||
nt|lc: USA2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1 key over then :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@c isn't bad actually here|pg||
nt|barnets: have nickell played every bermuda bowl since 1995?|pg||
nt|lc: Lots of work in 6@C -- but down 64 it ain't bad.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell asks Weichsel if they're playing anything on the 4 -level over 3@s. W: "the only thing I could bid is 4@s to show a big hand"|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs say yes|pg||
nt|lc: Doesn't seem fair.|pg||
nt|barnets: I was in beijing in 1995 to see them beat canada in the final|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: when canada came back from 100 down|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|barnets: george mittelman says he was there too|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pef: another large gain for nickell on board 83, where ekeblad and weichsel played 2s, granovetter and rubin played 3c for -300|pg||
nt|barnets: playing|pg||
nt|lc: Now, declarer will have to be careful.  (@HA, @HQ is no good).|pg||
nt|lc: Presumably he will go to dummy in @C for @H finesse.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He was indeed. Gitelman-Mittelman|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Granovetter is having a "below par " set as East|pg||
nt|lc: Which would lose if LHO remains with blank @HK.|pg||
nt|pef: but that would require the 3s preempter to also have 4h and therefore possibly zero clubs|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 4@S makeable|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe is not forcing |pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 4@D if fit showing|pg||
nt|gavin: interesting choice in the other room to bid garbage stayman with this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D or 6NT cold|pg||
nt|raghavan: should bid 2S |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Courtesy raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna may get shut out now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and preemptive|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2S only |pg||

nt|rlebi: 2:00 am?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|susieq: right yes|pg||
nt|starkist: 2pm for a casino is kinda strict|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: ive never rlly thought of doing it on a 3352|pg||
mb|2N|nt|capercliff: yes even better|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems just plain weird|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really garbage stayman, intent is to pass any rebid|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky entry to diamonds with a heart|pg||
nt|gavin: isnt that what garbage stayman is ? sry if i missspoke|pg||
nt|caitlin: well Gavin I call it that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: KCB will identify a possible loser, so no 7|pg||
nt|gavin: this is a baby slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3nt here is a brick   4 H is in some trouble|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is away from the city so does not disturb anybody|pg||
nt|susieq: 2am is too... here they never close|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|gavin: and easy to avoid 7 as martin said|pg||
nt|gavin: but its definitely good practise to play 6NT|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 imps better and safer|pg||
nt|gavin: 2 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|raghavan: good bid by N|pg||
nt|rlebi: big potential  swing hand here|pg||
nt|rlebi: very easy to get to nonmaking Slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 5@H too expensive a sacrifice|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3nt only makes because diamonds blocked and club jack onside, single dummy 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D blocked  le tthem set them up  3nt is on the J or no club lead|pg||
nt|starkist: we play this position 10-12, cowards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|caitlin: but I know many WC Cohen Gitelman Bergen etc who call it takeout of 2C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: complications now|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: drury auction,, should be a making contract|pg||
nt|gavin: spec points out east hand so strong for 4M that maybe its too strong to open 1NT, tough decision|pg||
nt|rlebi: very easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: if the @c honors were split it wouldnt|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not realistic I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: in the effort to getting to 6NT it would have been better for him to bid 3S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gavin: to hear from partner that they have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|gavin: he did what he did to find out about the king of spades i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i dont like any of these bids|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction calls for a trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: garbage stayman to me is when you rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek described an entirely different hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not in slam so no finesse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gavin: cool i just figured ur bidding stayman with garbage either way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops, hoping partner gets in|pg||
nt|bbramley: potential double-part-score swing here - joey avoided giving the 7th trick with a @D, but now declarer is home|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|gavin: so why not include all options in garbage stayman|pg||

nt|sharynr: are we stuck|pg||
nt|fabsayc: like gavin said, i dont agree with 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: the problem that happened here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless 4@H can be a singleton, but that does not make sense|pg||
nt|gavin: was his partner didnt bid 2NT over 2D|pg||
nt|gavin: so he really has no idea how good his hearts are|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: pittsburg|pg||
nt|gavin: i have complete sympathy in the auction he created for himself why he chose to end in 6D over 6NT|pg||
nt|gavin: i just think he should have constructed the auction better to help himself get to 6NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 35 in majors with 9 count perhaps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gavin: i guess some ppl dont play 2H is weak over 2D so if youre discussing garbage stayman , thats what you are talking about|pg||

mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|Walddk2: Don't you want to be in 6@D, Larry?|pg||
nt|pef: 6d by south looks very reasonable here, espeically for a team behind by that much|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: They might find 6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: I suppose 6@D is nice --  hard to find, though.|pg||
mb|1H!|an|8+ HCP, BAL or 3-suited|nt|lc: Lots of work and handling.|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: (25 bids later...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: If they do reach 6@D, it is MUCH better from SOUTH -- so @H lead can't make it as awkward.|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|1N!|an|12-14|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, in the South gives it a bit of extra room|pg||

nt|barnets: where there is no spade ruff|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Using their space efficiently :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|an|asking|nt|pef: 11 bids below the level of 3s, very efficient|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Both N & S, I think said that 3@d showed 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Maybe if East-West run out of Pass Cards they have to forfeit the match.|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|Walddk2: It's no doubt an excellent system, but I'm glad I won't have to remember all this|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: You don't like Ironing, Roland?|pg||
nt|pef: too bad nothing got doubled as the passes and redoubles would then add to the overall bidding efficiency :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: wow, after all that 3nt seems to unsatisfying|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well.... all that to get to 3NT :(|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I had hopes of a 20 bid auction|pg||
nt|lc: I said 3NT 10 minutes ago.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Peter now said that Russ showed 5-3-4-1. Russ agrees. And he's the declarer :)|pg||
nt|pef: gee, all us old folks could have bid 1d p 1s p 2nt p 3d p 3nt to do that|pg||

nt|lc: 6@D would have taken a while to play, but likely would have made on this layout (some good breaks, some bad).|pg||

mb|2N|nt|capercliff: W has a very good hand for 1N, almost too strong|pg||

nt|gavin: needs to overtake to play a club, easy play|pg||
nt|gavin: to overtake|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to decide wheather to play hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|gavin: seems like u can see that if u start hearts their club losers can go away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somehow silver made 6nt on 23|pg||
nt|gavin: very rare that u will need to take heart ruff and u dont get clubs back as a trade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which looks impossible unless a club opening lead|pg||
nt|gavin: a club lead is impossible|pg||
nt|gavin: but playing 6nt over 6s seems bizarre|pg||
nt|gavin: and a club lead vs 6s is impossible as well|pg||
nt|gavin: ok so the lecuyer team actually leads by 26|pg||
nt|fabsayc: impossible no. just strange|pg||
nt|raghavan: now go for slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|capercliff: looks like it was E that was thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this has worked nicely|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Low @H lead beats it|pg||
nt|gavin: 7 card suit for me is game opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|gavin: no matter how bad my hand is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 3@C game forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: repeated diamond leads would beat this hand i think|pg||
nt|glen: swing to Carruthers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that hanna has any reason to find that defense|pg||
nt|glen: so 12+13|pg||
nt|glen: on boards 6+7|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: robinson 83 fleisher 33 in USA1|pg||

nt|fabsayc: bid deliberately to push board?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|gavin: impossible because i know how they play|pg||

nt|caitlin: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|rlebi: the answer was 3|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 44 possible not vul|pg||
nt|caitlin: not necessarily so weak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It will be very hard for S to stop in game opposite an opening bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: going out on a limb and predicting this will make in under 5 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you believe that story?|pg||

nt|raghavan: Gowdy the teacher may approve  that having another Major- I should not pre empt. Also here N has 11 points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the best one we have seen|pg||
nt|caitlin: no 2@H shows both majors|pg||

nt|caitlin: either 5-4 or vul 5-5 or non vul could even be 4-4|pg||
nt|caitlin: no|pg||

mb|3D|nt|sharynr: i think you are right!|pg||

nt|gavin: club and spade trick in dummy|pg||
nt|bbramley: on their way to 300|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@C can be singleton, 2@D rebid promises 4|pg||

nt|caitlin: ooooooops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: here we go|pg||
nt|raghavan: Putting head under a sword?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: misplaced major jack, else a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: this should be double key card     6 key card  4 aces and 2 major suit kings|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wonder if this is asking re: 5 controls for hearts and spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6 I mean:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be double key card, not clear which suit is agreed|pg||
nt|caitlin: hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gavin: after the 1D opening bid, south definitely should not lead a diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or underlead it for the set|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to pick from his doubletons|pg||
nt|gowdy: 11 to 13 |pg||
nt|caitlin: ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed vul against not with defense no reason to bid 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: he did not cash SA|pg||
nt|gavin: wrong one , now cyz has to cash ace of spades to hold to 5 |pg||
nt|gavin: fly ace|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact north should fly ace of hearts and play a club|pg||
nt|caitlin: on this lead clubs going nowhere nor hearts for defense..more likely to cash out|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Gavin?|pg||
nt|caitlin: this could be singleton?|pg||
nt|gavin: cause of the lead ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe in 4 that isnt such a winning defence since the club ruff would be 3rd trick, he needs a spade honor from partner to beat|pg||
nt|gavin: so might as well hope its kx and thats why partner was afraid to lead it|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is 5@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they get to 6@H E will be very careful not to double in case they run to a making 6NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: what does 5S mean |pg||
nt|glen: bonus for operator: play will be quick|pg||
mb|4C|an|singleton spade (according to w)|nt|fabsayc: on this type of auction clubs often the weakest suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if responder has club fit would tend to rebid 2@S not 2nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: Wolpert taking his time with this one|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will overtake and finesse I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some minor communication issues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On a @C lead will succeed if the !Q is played, which is I think the correct technical play|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a surprise this, a @c from the east hand cant hurt him|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needs to pitch a diamond if 3rd heart lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: i hear the fat lady warming up ..|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|capercliff: assuming he overtakes and finesses the @d again|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Martin you are right as always|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is good to read the Hobbit trilogy|pg||
nt|raghavan: I maeant NO DOUBLE|pg||
nt|caitlin: for sure no double|pg||
nt|caitlin: you never know if 6N will make which it does not here|pg||
nt|glen: in the other room, on board 8, they are also using the Green convention|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: director has been called|pg||
nt|glen: what for i wonder?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a spade back would be embarassing if jack wrong|pg||
nt|mcarroll: small @H from N at trick 2 would have worked|pg||
nt|capercliff: yah and when @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4-2 sry|pg||
nt|capercliff: if the K@c was wrong he could go off now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Would have 4@H,3@D 1@C and 1@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtaking with the J at trick one was 100%|pg||
nt|gowdy: 9 @C  and the @H now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gavin: very thoughtfull play|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|glen: maybe its zero tolerance, as they have zero chance of beating the doubled contract|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no overtrick|pg||
nt|susieq: was there a ruling?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: made 3 exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: there was a one trick transfer by director, i don't know why, sorry|pg||
nt|rlebi: not likely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow|pg||
pc|cA|nt|caitlin: there are SIX hungry university guys in my backyard doing the barbecue|pg||
nt|gavin: hughes sees that the one layout that will defeat him is 2 club ruffs|pg||
nt|gavin: so he ditches a club on the ace of diamonds and leads a heart up towards his hand (north is marked with ace of hearts from auction)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make from here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gavin: well played|pg||
nt|caitlin: when declaring you always have to think about worse case scenario|pg||
nt|caitlin: what if? what if?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: lost the play on this one, too fast|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or in this case, best case, doubleton ace of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: np what is outcome?|pg||
nt|raghavan: I hope he plays H 6 on lead from N - then 3 down - |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 down|pg||
nt|caitlin: Karen we understand...I could NEVER do your job|pg||
nt|raghavan: sorry 2 down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: likely a pus or 3 imps maximum|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm the J is interesting, he must know declarer has the 10?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|gowdy: the @C 2 was a mistake|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 43-3 this set so far for Nickell|pg||
nt|lc: Not that any of them were vintage MEckwell -- they actually had lots of HCP on all of them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: and the prior set was what, 42-3 or something like that?|pg||
nt|lc: So, 3nT or 5@C?|pg||
nt|lc: 5@C better here.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@c I would think|pg||
mb|3S!|an|5 !ss, FG|nt|mtvesuvius: just needs @c to behave|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Hamman is in 6@d on  86|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: But, no wrong lead coming here.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: meanwhile, hamman and zia did get to 6d in the closed room|pg||

nt|barnets: gran may lead low heart from KX|pg||
nt|pef: those guys are definitely going to have to work on their bidding methods :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck & Peter discussing the change here where 2@h shows a Major and 2@s denies - think it's a big improvement|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, they are incredibly inefficient :)|pg||
nt|lc: This should be the worst contract they ever reach.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|mtvesuvius: Only 5 bids to get to 3NT! :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: more than he had?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna seems to hold hearts a lot:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I also want to know what 5S is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Carruthers got another 5 imps on board 7|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S  E-W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H, does not fit any other overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: everyone agree with 2S?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by North?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is ok|pg||
nt|gavin: with 4 boards to go in the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe hanna should cash diamond before returning the club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure which way denies the club doubleton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: penalty card in hearts maybe|pg||
nt|glen: poor other table, when they try to work that out|pg||
nt|glen: 1 hour from now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey tough enough here|pg||
nt|bbramley: slam on 2 finesses, or 1 finesse and a miracle @D guess|pg||
mb|2D!|an|canape|mb|p|nt|gavin: wolpert bid 1NT here because he didnt think he was good enough for 2H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3@H also ok|pg||
nt|gavin: aggressive 4S bid|pg||
nt|gavin: rlly hate that bid|pg||
mb|2H!|an|relay|nt|gavin: and instead of risking his partner raising 1S to 2S and playing the wrong fit, he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|gavin: on that lead declarer will likely go 2 down, take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|bbramley: but only 30 HCP and no extra shape - it's a bad slam and normal to stay out of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Seemingly W cannot pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 800 possible|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt i would want to ever pass 3nt|pg||
nt|gavin: though the defense will need to cash their tricks int he right order|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room Joey opened 2@D and auction crowded opponents|pg||
nt|caitlin: can set up hearts to make 4S|pg||
nt|glen: btw board 8 is a push in 7NT, unless misplayed now|pg||
mb|2S!|an|hearts and longer clubs|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@C blocking bid but sometimes taken seriously|pg||
nt|gavin: easy to allow them to escape for 1 down by trying to cash 2 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would be a better contract if north had 2 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: the A  then the 9  the green plays the last @H|pg||
nt|glen: nope, claim eliminated misplay chance|pg||
mb|2N!|an|relay|nt|fabsayc: he can pass, and will when happy to see opponents bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe more|pg||
nt|starkist: omg|pg||
nt|caitlin: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@H is weird|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess 1@S can be a four card suit for them|pg||
nt|gowdy: normal   canadian  hmmm |pg||
nt|starkist: it's the exchange rate|pg||
nt|bbramley: north must be worth another try, assuming that 2@C was GF|pg||

nt|bbramley: yes|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well this does have a play of sorts, but will fail|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Very lucky with the @C position|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: needs miracles including clubs 2-2 onside i believe|pg||
nt|capercliff: so long as N goes low with a @c|pg||
nt|capercliff: if N doesnt play small it will come in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmmmm|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice auction|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if he gets to 6 withqof d lead and he ducks and w returns the 9 of clubs he may still go down playing for a squeeze|pg||

nt|fabsayc: right but 2@H is going nowhere with a promising hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin: south had a tough problem, conflicting rules|pg||
nt|gavin: most often when you have a 4-4 fit and a 5-3 fit you want to play the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gavin: though from the bidding there was a good chance his partner was 6-4, and with such bad spades it hink he made the wrong decision|pg||

nt|capercliff: I dont mind passing, dont want to encourage partner to bids lots|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gavin: jurek is a sick sick animal :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Club return causes problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed will still need to guess diamonds now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Has to hope that D!A is right|pg||
pc|h5|nt|harmon: GO BREWERS|pg||
nt|caitlin: Gowdy how come there are no results for Seniors?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or queen|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1c-1h-2d (West coast Polish convention showing balanced 18-19)|pg||
nt|starkist: thanks Roland/BBO/CBF|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c8|nt|caitlin: sorry Hobart vs Jotcham|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gavin: west can see without any entries to dummy that he might aswell lead clubs out of his hand|pg||
nt|glen: yes, otherwise known as no hope in heck|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rlebi: will Jim find the winnining return?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|capercliff: you cant always have 4-4 fits in the majors|pg||
nt|gavin: normally you would like to lead up towards the kq a couple times|pg||
nt|caitlin: which proves fruitful|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he did|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: 2h rebid (my hand sucks) - ok then 2s not forcing- thanks partner|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gowdy: well n's 8 is suit pref for H  as opposed to netural  so it is gueesable  |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|gavin: with the 9 showing in north|pg||
nt|gavin: west carefully protected his 3rd club trick by leading low from his hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now a safety play|pg||
nt|gavin: 2nd rather|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: but will cost an imp or two|pg||
nt|starkist: pitt scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lost an imp not cashing the spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but had hanna ducked this would be very interesting|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gavin: 9 tricks secured with 1 spade 3 hearts 3 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he already has to assume heart ace right|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mittmouse: well i think 3h is the right bid if it just shows a lot of hearts and no cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as it should, with power you go thru 2NT|pg||
nt|starkist: i agree if it shows that|pg||
nt|starkist: because thats what he has|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah... though it would still typically have a card outside i thk|pg||
nt|gavin: 5 card support and a stiff and out seems like a bit much|pg||
nt|gavin: 145-107 if he makes this|pg||
nt|starkist: fellow commentators, starstudded... should put a team together and challenge the winners|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|gavin: if the vugraph operator can wish my bro and his team gl from me id appreciate it|pg||
nt|starkist: forgone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks pretty normal to me|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphznx: if that looks weird, i may have missed a trick|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|barnets: thanks to all the specs for their valuable input-- |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lc: Ekeblad-Weichsel clearly played the best of the 3 Fleisher pairs in this match.|pg||
nt|lc: Without the preempt here, it would have been much easier for E-W to bid slam.|pg||
nt|pef: we are all looking forward to your recounting of the top matches in print, Larry!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lc: I don't know where to start. Too many boards. Too many mathces.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and the Fleisher team has played extremely well,  a good match indeed|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Make sure you include Rubin's 6@d hand, Larry :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lc: Someone suggest the article should be called "White Pains."|pg||
nt|lc: No typo :)|pg||
nt|lc: And, for those who asked: White Plains is a Northern suburb of NYC  (about 15 miles).|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think that would be appropriate|pg||
nt|lc: Turned out to be a very good venue.  Had everything a bridge tournament should have.|pg||
nt|barnets: the 4 handed team got better as the match went longer|pg||
nt|lc: Unless you want sightseeing. :)|pg||
nt|lc: There wasn't too much strain on the 4-handed team.  They didn't have to show up until halfway through the tournament.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  experience of these long stanzas showed|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: In addition to only being 4 handed for the final also|pg||
nt|lc: And, they didn't have to play 4-handed until yesterday.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: looked fine Karen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and it looks like slam can be made EW in hearts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|glen: anybody for slam? everybody?|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: he stole his rebid|pg||
nt|starkist: actionne|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gowdy: no was spot on I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Inverted minor raise presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one of the surer applictions of the rabbi rule here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 6@D is still on a guess if no spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: wonder if 2@d was GF or not|pg||
nt|caitlin: Pittsburg 2 Detroit 0|pg||
nt|bbramley: tough for your main partner to be from a different country - much harder to make teams|pg||
nt|starkist: 3@h bit pusilanimous|pg||
nt|starkist: 2n|pg||
nt|bbramley: could try 2NT, get some info|pg||
mb|4N|an|keycard for clubs|nt|fabsayc: and to all the impartial commentators, spectators, roland, bbo, and the CBF|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Hazel with them?|pg||
nt|gowdy: this may be a chance to tightenthings up|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 61d is cold|pg||
nt|capercliff: @d|pg||
nt|capercliff: and bid in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the lead direct double just helped opponents on this board|pg||
nt|caitlin: two way stayman?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i cant spell that, so will use the british "wet" instead|pg||
mb|5D|an|3 keycards|nt|fabsayc: note|pg||
nt|caitlin: I assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: gavin not impartial|pg||
nt|caitlin: and hello from Gavin to his mom|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why not W trasfer |pg||
nt|fabsayc: well an enjoyable and fast set, thanks again to Karen, our tireless operator|pg||
mb|6C|nt|rlebi: 6@c only slam that makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: one more board after this, again thanks to Karen for her hard work all today as operator|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: the Wolperts are a famous bridge playing family in Toronto:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now all we need is another 500 spectators for the final set|pg||
nt|rlebi: or @ds|pg||
nt|glen: btw we have a USA1 winner in spec, and congrads to that team in a very tough and long event|pg||
nt|glen: hopefully they will concede once they see how strong Canada1 is|pg||
nt|glen: hmm, they promise a battle :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we will field the enforcers with 10 foot hockey sticks|pg||
nt|glen: he might just put 6@C on the table now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|caitlin: 5-3s often better in NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|raghavan: 4 H no chance let us see for 3NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks and chances for a ninth|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here the 5 never even mentioned|pg||
nt|caitlin: needs one minor suit trick|pg||
nt|caitlin: ????|pg||
nt|fabsayc: entries a problem|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  we're about 5 mins from COPC one round to go leaders|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: cunning play but should not work|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|capercliff: huh?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: signing off, but this could be less safe than slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can be missing two aces|pg||
nt|capercliff: 5@s was a relay to play in 5N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so blackwood was not the right tool|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure what is however|pg||
nt|gowdy: needs a or k of d in N with  no C switch|pg||
nt|susieq: 5N transfers the blame to partner|pg||
nt|glen: no, its the your-fault 5NT (i.e. you pick it)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: one does not get 12 card fits that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: slam is 50/50 at best anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to gavin, caitlin, tony, george and cameos from cam and harmon |pg||
nt|fabsayc: so win and heart to 9 and diamond up|pg||
pc|h9|nt|capercliff: happens to be the right side of 50 this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better than 50-50|pg||
nt|capercliff: you dont have time to try both finesses Martin:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually the defense will yield many clues to the best line|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hazel, the mom runs a great bridge club|pg||
nt|raghavan: North must be alert to play C and another C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is essentially the same|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is better, though Jurek should realize hearts likely solid|pg||
nt|rlebi: he picked swell|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a bid with a great track record lately, but worked here|pg||
nt|glen: on board 10, with the two offside black kings, EW made 6@S at the other table|pg||
nt|glen: sorry board 9|pg||
nt|glen: they bid 6@S for 13 imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: they have to guard clubs also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: plus no spade lead, i would expect a lot of clues|pg||
nt|glen: and now in 6@S board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: tomorrow first session at 9:30 PDT, 12:30 in toronto, 2pm in newfoundland|pg||
nt|starkist: cameos and harmeos|pg||
nt|harmon: what time in Borneo???|pg||
nt|mcbruce: Special thanks from me to both of our operators today.  While they tolied I finished preduplicating the last of the 2,858 boards for the tournament.  :)|pg||
nt|gavin: yikes bruce i know that task|pg||
nt|rlebi: swing comes back as predicted|pg||
pc|dA|nt|caitlin: nice 6@C by Turner and Hughes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: in answer to why they cancelled the board|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thoughts on opener rebidding 2@C rather than 3@D|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: 8 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast|pg||
nt|raghavan: still Ck and C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and now is surely marked|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Has 9 but def can getb 5 first|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why H is not developped - means solid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|raghavan: so hope in C|pg||
nt|gowdy: works here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam on 9 was fair, on 10 horrible|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: cash the spade|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this session did not start on time, would be very noisy once the COPC ended|pg||
pc|d9|nt|raghavan: GOOOOOD|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to guess right at the end to get the 6 tricks he started with|pg||
