nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if east bids 6@S, Sabine had better lead the right ace!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|brgpro: looks like 12 tricks in @s for E. why? well, you tend to lead from your short AK....|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but not when west has shown hearts perhaps|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: as he now surely will|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok - maybe he won't get the chance|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||

nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
pc|d4|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||

nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
mb|5D|an|1|nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||

nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||

nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think W shd take more blame|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H showed a strong slam try and demanded control-bid then 3@S didn't promise any extras|pg||
nt|brgpro: his 2@h rebid might not have shown 6|pg||
nt|athene: in which case maybe west should do more|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: is not so easy @@ the table, this is made by the great masters :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panja: well, count of not, the only play available is to drop @HJ or Q stiff in 7@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: and 3@s was sort of "on the way" cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: but if 3@H was only a mild slam try, then 3@S was showing west had a decent hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||

nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||

nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
