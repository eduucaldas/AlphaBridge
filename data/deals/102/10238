pc|h5|nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Fleisher-Kamil|pg||

nt|ahollan1: all other pairs playing big club|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: you're right :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

mc|12|nt|kareno: Why didn't he pitch that last diamond from dummy?|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess he did :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H was Kokish  either strong with @H or very big NT hand|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Chuck will get player names up as soon as he gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the Moss squad will be sitting on their hands waiting for breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chuck will enter names when he gets a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west is Sylvie Moss, North Sasha Cohen, East Migry Campanile, South Rozanne Pollack|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam chance here NS|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mariner1: can make 7 finding Q@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter to 4@C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump shift to 3@D??|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@S or 7@D all can make (all on Q@D hunt)|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss in Closed Room bid the 6@S on board 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: I would have bid 5@D    S must have first round @C control|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|daman: they are in 7 in the other room|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|daman: 7 will make on a dummy reversal with 2 @C ruffs I believe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: send out a call for Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley -- what is BEST line for 12???|pg||

nt|hedyg: tststs|pg||
nt|hedyg: does this mean the 3@d would have been nf?|pg||
nt|scotty: no|pg||
nt|kareno: In 2/1 no, it would not.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: he was temporizing, look for support|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: No, unless specifically agreed|pg||
nt|kareno: 2NT was 100% forcing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2/1 pairs out there -- make sure you discuss whether your 2M rebid promises 6+ suit -- don't assume and it is not standard|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I don't play it promises 6, just a min. hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Slam is too much of a reach here.  |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: EW play "5 card majors, semi-forcing NT, Eastern Scientific style"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not much works for declarer|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: it barely makes 4NT|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|scotty: in fact 4N can be defeated, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h was making with 98 dropping|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond king makes 3nt just fine.   but 4nt is too high with the spade that will no doubt be led.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|d|nt|scotty: Even 51h, maybe|pg||
nt|scotty: 5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 hands in a row using 5N Choice of Slam|pg||
nt|kareno: So they have stretched a bit too far here.  West has a pretty hand but east doesn't fill the diamond gaps needed.|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome back Michael :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Michael :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Michael :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're into the final 30 boards to determine which team will be USA2 in the Sao Paulo Brazil Bermuda Bowl in late august/early sep|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Breaking News. The next World Bridge Series will be held from October 1Â–16, 2010, at the Marriott Hotel in Philadelphia. This will be the first time this Championship has been held ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: in the United States for 16 years|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Zia wants the extra IMP or 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2010philadelphia/default.asp  for more information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher team has been playing since day 1 - when round robin began|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Wow, fantastic! Thanks Roland :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: except yesterday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell team began in USA1 Semi-Final where they were beaten by .... Fleisher|pg||
nt|scotty: West's 4@d bid looks attractive, but he needs 3 key cards to make 6@d - and partner might have tried 3@d with a hand that suitable|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: So maybe West should content himself with 4N over 3N|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Zia had to double this also I think|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: That's no better! but not doubled.  Hmmm.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell team now playing 4-handed  Freeman went home sick :(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: Recurrence of heart problems if you know?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Did they find out what was wrong?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure of ailment|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: they found out|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: what is it?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: but it's not up to me to broadcast ailments|pg||
nt|kareno: West marked with only one heart.|pg||
nt|hedyg: did Fleisher think double was a Lightner?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Probably... that would explain 6NT.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|scotty: West was influenced by their 2M opening style which is very sound - maybe he expected E to open that with this hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 8-12 According to their CC|pg||
nt|kareno: Too much outside of hearts!!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: agree|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: that would show a better suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would open that 1@h without thinking :)|pg||
nt|scotty: The slam West was most likely to miss by going low was 6@h, excellent opposite Axx, KJ10xxx, x, Axx and fair opposite @hKJ9xxx|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: But then I also pre-empt on trash|pg||

nt|scotty: On @d lead in 6@d, you are basically cold if @d, 2-2 OR hearts 4-4 OR @hQ with W and hearts 5-3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hard to convert to penalties at this vul|pg||
nt|scotty: Really tough hand to play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This will be a tough hand for Kamil, since he has extreme entry problems, and has alot of work to do|pg||

nt|scotty: How did Hamman know that?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He doesn't, but I don't think it can hurt to win?|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Zia does best to duck to maintain communications|pg||
nt|scotty: It would hurt to win first heart if declarer knocked out partners club trick, then later your @d trick - since partner would have no hearts to clear them|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not play @d for an entry to hand?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|barnets: no im in europe for 3 weeks|pg||

mb|p|pc|d6|nt|kareno: You always want to force your opponent to make the last guess.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|scotty: I don't think West's double would be the popular choice in the MSC - though it would certainly get votes.  I think 2N would be the top choice|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 2N much easier if 3rd @S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not really, especially at this vul... Partner could still in theory have QTxxx or something... 2NT is strangely appealing with the West hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: Zia really wanted a @d to play @c|pg||
nt|kareno: That was such a shout for a diamond lead, not a spade, so Zia could get trumps on the table.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: zia pitched the @d3 somewhat angrily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another @H looks best now|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is frustrating when your partner ignores your cards|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|scotty: Advantage of 2N was that he was 5-4 the "right" way, so if partner with 3-3 bid 3@c (as he usually would) he'd find an 8-card fit|pg||

nt|hedyg: why did he switch?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now K@D and 9@d through|pg||
nt|scotty: Zia switched to a heart hoping his partner had the jack.  He did not want to let declarer elope with small trumps easily.  He has no idea what the spade situation is|pg||
nt|scotty: Or little idea, anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell 26-3 this set|pg||

nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|scotty: Partscore is quite a prediction.  N-S have 24 HCP and a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Anyone for a 1NT opener from North (specs are interested :))|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: teams can agree to restart early -- do don't rely upon the posted schedule|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|mtvesuvius: @s will let this through|pg||
nt|hedyg: would, Adam, would!|pg||
nt|kareno: Why should west not lead his partner's suit?  |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: would* :)|pg||
nt|scotty: But would anyone even THINK of the @hQ lead if dummy had @hA10x facing Kxx and a spade lead were successful?|pg||
nt|kareno: Generally when you overcall it is because you want your suit led.|pg||
nt|hedyg: W has no excuse to lead anything else|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right, @s seems to be a normal lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East DBL or 1@S -- they've only been discussing that since takeout doubles invented in late 1920s -- don't hold your breath for a definitive answer until next millenium - and maybe ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not then|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: East could have doubled 1@d, that would give an option of a @h lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: East can't do anything now - heart lead would give up trick nine.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|scotty: I think Meckwell prefer to double with the East hand.  I never know what to do.  if you double, you might miss a 5-3 spade fit (and you are not strong enough for further action) If ...|pg||
nt|scotty: you bid 1@s...well, you saw what happened here |pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, but I generally overcall and so do many players - it's a matter of style.|pg||
nt|kareno: I generally overcall, intending to take further action.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|hedyg: for the exciting last segment|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: didn't this make with an overtrick?|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks all :) |pg||
nt|hedyg: it did|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye for now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dbl with 4@S & 5@H makes more sense to me than 5@S & 4@H  [because partner MAY bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S]|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thx all :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're starting last board in other room now|pg||
nt|scotty: Also, the "SLOW" N-S auction - 1N, 2N 3N was more suggestive of a spade lead.  Had N jumped to 3N, now you picture the possibility of long @d, and you might attack somewhere else ...|pg||
nt|scotty: (though normally you'd at least like to have a 5-card suit)|pg||
