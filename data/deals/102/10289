pc|dJ|nt|henryb: I use 3@c to start auctions where I have only four hearts|pg||

nt|fabsayc: many ways to play a hand like this|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: but reversing the dummy is attractive |pg||
nt|henryb: Other partnerships use transfers: 3@d would transfer to 3@h, and then 3@s would show 4-5; 3@h would transfer to @s and show 4+ and by inference either 4-4 or 5-6 in the majors|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|leao: agree... suit contract MUCHO better|pg||
nt|othered1: If I were east, @S are 5-3 and led.  I never get lucky when I keep my long suit out of the auction.  Chagas obviously has has different experience.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this is not one of the ways|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|othered1: rare, nowadays, to get to open with a flat 13 in 4th seat.|pg||

nt|othered1: 7@D by a team that was being outplayed isn't surprising|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|henryb: Its a good thing that single imps are not crucial in this match since many boards are being misclaimed|pg||

nt|fabsayc: here i expect void to be irrelevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our East splintered with 3@S over 2@D |pg||
nt|othered1: Are they playing something like Blue Team Club, where the rebid of the 5-card suit was mandatory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so, but i might do it anyway to save space with aceless hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wow - sorry that was delayed retort to Ed's question about 4 card support|pg||

nt|sybarra: 5 @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do we know to bid that?|pg||
nt|leao: director called|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we can all see ways to make 3nt here, but the normal line will fail|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: were we all bidding a different board?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|leao: they had another board there|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|leao: the "heavy" 1NT will not gain here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1NT probably semi-forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if they do, probably can not get into trouble|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|leao: it is, but chagas was a passed hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: Is west allowed to rebid, say, 2@C in their style?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if semi-forcing, west continues only with a real suit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|othered1: nonvul swing.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: with support that good and game-forcing values, I like to get the support into the auction.  Lots of time to work the rest out.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: since you can anticipate the problem if you open 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like taking @C finesse into "safe" hand, but also East slight favorite to hold the Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|othered1: Anyone for 1@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this way can handle 4-1, else i would be inclined to take the opposite way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been interesting to assume @S 43, then win 2nd and exit with @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like 4@S should make|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|leao: i agree, merit to campos' bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: maybe|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: at least you won't have to make an ugly rebid over 1@S without getting your best suit in.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "interesting" means -- i don't know if that is good odds or not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I can rebid 2@C (1N is meant as forcing, passed at opener's risk) and we'll get to 3N if east tries.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: But that's not the style we're watching here|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: 1@D became much easier when Checkback mechanisms were invented|pg||
nt|henryb: you have to avoid 2@c losers|pg||

nt|fabsayc: d'orsi sequence showed invite with 5 spades only|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 5@S and NOT 4@H|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|leao: well played|pg||
nt|leao: can go -2 now|pg||
nt|othered1: isn't duck=duck best defense in @S?|pg||
nt|henryb: or ducks the first spade, wins the second and plays a third|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: well he makes now by this play|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense had nothing special to do, so no reason to win in either hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very astute of Junka to notice @C9 is good - unblock=guaranteed entry|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so only 6 double digit swings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator, who kept up well with the brazilian speedsters :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: are we back to night ? |pg||
nt|leao: next set of hands to begin in 15 min|pg||

nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator, good work|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: eschewing a 2-suited bid, if available|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and thanks to shirley (sybarra), who got blown off the net by a local storm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play will continue after a short break with 16 more boards today|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2nt for all?|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on opening standards, maybe the question is 2@D for all?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: even if my analysis was double dummy WRONG?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|othered1: Agree as to north's rebid.  And if I were to start south with 2 GF @D, I'd rebid 2N, too.  Or maybe with 2 non-GF @D, too.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|othered1: this isn't a bad start at all for south in 2@H.  Keeping the nature of his hand relatively unknown helped a bunch.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more spectator comments would be appreciated , was a silent bunch till chagas table closed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit - i'm a long time Chagas fan too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is a character, i kibitzed him in 1984 in Seattle, combating the new zealand "fert" bids|pg||
nt|othered1: south wondering did they put me here to make a losing @D play?  But all will be well|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: i suppose i am a minority, but to me this is a 2@s rebid over 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: less commital bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Not me.  But that has to do with how far 2@D uis forcing, etc.|pg||
