mb|d|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  Tricky position for North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I must admit, I don't like double ... what do you do over 3C? Now 3H is an overbid|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: NS have done well here |pg||
nt|rhelle:  of course, he has limited his hand by not doubling first and then bidding @h ... but still, I'd expect more if I was South|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle:  still the end result is a pretty decent contract|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||

nt|justin c: East's only high card to date has been the @SA|pg||

nt|vugraphztf: ok.. i change it at the end of the hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|an| |mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rhelle:  a lot of people play 2@d in this sequence as a general GF bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mmmakela: yes, nthng to do with dias|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as is, after 1X - 1Y - 1NT: 2C = transfer to 2@d, and everything is invitational after|pg||
nt|rhelle:  And 2@d = any GF hand, nothing to do with @d|pg||

nt|mmmakela: good treatment, shd be included in BBO2/1(or even sayc)|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S looks better than 3NT on the EW cards|pg||
nt|justin c: if one defender had five @C and the @DA, this could turn nasty|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I have some sympathy for East ... often the 5 @s tricks work just as well in 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: with @C 4-3, this is ok|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|rhelle:  I think this was a well-controlled sequence - East gave West a clear choice|pg||

nt|rhelle:  if the horros scenario of 5@c and the @d Ace (in south) were to appear, 4@s would be in trouble too ... overruffs!|pg||

mb|5C|nt|justin c: making it quite an overbid|pg||

mb|2H|an|3 s|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: all 3 of the suit games are better contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: i cant believe chagas is thinking|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: whew|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 3@S by south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey they are bidding in a way i approve of|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 nt cant be right |pg||
nt|sybarra2: in other room, wonder who thought they had a @C stopper|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now is very close|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: It looks like 4@S can be made but that's an illusion|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: yes looks good but.........|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|justin c: cant get to dummy enough times to do everything|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You will get a club lead and a C return|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Even if you ruff with the 8 and 9 it won't work|pg||
nt|ady: looking at the tow hands there seems some play for 4@S   but hopeles as cards lay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as West has a singleton heart. You can't reach dummy twice|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|enotsrevli: lots of values but no game makes- 3NT fine without club lead- 4 spades no chance on lie|pg||
nt|rnc: Declaring from South, EW will find their @D-ruff |pg||
nt|enotsrevli: south wants to bid NTbut no club stop|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: will be no good if he is declarer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this might do better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It may because it won't get a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs dias lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard for Jens maybe|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|enotsrevli: good bid I think and unlucky- he sensed the danger in spades after the 2D bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|enotsrevli: needs to sneak 1 diamond through|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: c queen and low diamond quickly - or d king quickly- speed is vital - already too slow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so declarer will go 1 or 2 down depending on what he does when a club comes back at trick 2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the other room declarer pitched a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West did not rebid clubs, so he did not know they were 6-1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Ophir knows they are here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This was a good start but still not enough|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but -1 to win the board |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|rnc: Yes, it seems like either spades are 4-1 or you suffer from a @D-ruff. So 3NT is after all not so bad a decision|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: doqn 1|pg||
nt|justin c: y, still worth 3 imps for one off|pg||
nt|ady: down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Indeed. 24-12 to Israel|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: That's all for now folks, backc in 25 minutes or so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
nt|rnc: Thx all, bye|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: this is the kind of hand where a declarer like Martin Hoffman who plays as soon as dummy hits scores many successes. A "routine" duck by East before he has given it enough thought ...|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: and Bingo|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: thx all|pg||
nt|raghavan: This session is over here|pg||
