nt|Walddk7: 4-handed according to the website and bulletin|pg||
nt|jbgood: best possible result for NS is pass before they bid slam|pg||
nt|werge: First time I see a second-round pre-empt, strange|pg||
nt|raghavan: I am not talking of this hand - in principle - whether  2C-2D-2S is forcing for 1RD|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: comfy make, thanks to the @S109|pg||
nt|raghavan: Declarer has 3 checks in S - no problem. will he get his 9th from H?|pg||

nt|raghavan: E must pass |pg||

pc|d4|nt|xenya: don't know how they managed that|pg||

pc|h7|nt|Walddk7: Sandqvist-Nevena Senior in the other room for De Botton|pg||

nt|wwalter: only 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 down? 7 spades and a club - right?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: good 4@H for E/W here|pg||
nt|werge: Fo r me, that means 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Walter > will it be a partial in Spade?|pg||
nt|wwalter: probably|pg||
nt|ampelman: NS play weak NT, 5card M, forcing NT, 2./4. leads, direct discards|pg||
nt|j li: A very thin 3NT for N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|jbgood: seems likely|pg||
nt|paulg: nothing is gruesome at this vul|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @C might get away for 300, but 500 more likely|pg||
nt|raghavan: and south did not gain but lost 200 IMP Here also 150 so net gain to Hauge is 8 IMP |pg||
nt|jbgood: you must be cheating with a pocked calculator, Hans:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: Hi operator - is Tor West?|pg||
nt|xenya: are W and S really namesakes?|pg||
nt|werge: By defending to hands, where both pairs must have been very close to a DOUBLE!|pg||
nt|wwalter: operator?|pg||
mb|d|nt|raghavan: Tobias Tx what do NS follow?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what esle than Pass|pg||
nt|athene: west will probably open 1nt but 4@H still going to be reached|pg||
mb|4S|nt|raghavan: looks like EW playing in 1NT|pg||
nt|ampelman: udca|pg||
nt|rado: kibs asking for previous board : 2@H was @C and forcing 1 round I suppose, and 4@H completed the picture |pg||
nt|raghavan: and a push|pg||
nt|raghavan: should be in a part score |pg||
nt|xenya: yes they are i'm told|pg||
nt|raghavan: Walter you are a prophet - again Spade bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  the 1@h overcall suggests that he is East|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good afternoon to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2@C by Ferraro?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Tobias|pg||
nt|raghavan: E may bid 3C|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Is this normal dutch-style bidding?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: will come a 2NT , or not? :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: this could be ade|pg||
nt|star6ija: made|pg||
nt|star6ija: without playing trumps at all|pg||
nt|xenya: in OR, W did overcall|pg||
nt|rado: standart pup Stayman, 3@D= have Major, 3@H showing @S|pg||
nt|paulg: De Botton should perhaps double 3@h to show some values, as she has already denied a penalty double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H is bold|pg||
nt|serhat: David is abit agresive here|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@h does take away the stopper asking bid|pg||
nt|werge: I think, West has weak diamond as one of 2-3 possible hands - and East prefers 2 @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: chi e il operatore?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wwalter: the 1Nt is limited to 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 14-16 yes|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - but dont be sure :) - Gun is a hard bidder also|pg||
nt|jbgood: impregnable|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Harald Skjæran|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Harald|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Hi all|pg||
nt|werge: Here 10 tricks, If they continue counting as in the previous board|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wwalter: Vivi starts to write again|pg||
nt|wwalter: 8 Imps|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't know what happened afterwards|pg||
nt|pelu: EW can make 10 tricks in @C - and NS 9-10 in @H|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: the 'transfer route' one way to go about those north shapes ...|pg||
nt|paulg: which would have been Janet's call I think|pg||
nt|jstokes: 4@C makes it tough, but all will end well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: 8 or 9 tricks with the spades 3-3 |pg||
nt|serhat: 100 is okay after all for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 Spades + CA if defense starts on S.  But if H E makes|pg||
nt|jbgood: just 2 spades for def|pg||
nt|raghavan: but W may duck 2 times|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: possible but might not be easy -- it's a complex hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes defenders should play trump immediately after taking @C trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: so makes No entry to S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: many play it with 5-5|pg||
nt|viren169: pushy 1N here|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and club switch will probably be a flat board|pg||
nt|jbgood: when bidding 4@c you have often already bid your prd's cards twice |pg||
nt|skjaeran: Still no entry to south.|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|skjaeran: Gunev-Popova bid 6@s on previous board, winning Hauge 14 IMPs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: probably 9, if E reads W's @D return as a singleton|pg||
nt|viren169: worked out well though...|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 4@H contract due to good location of Q of @S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwi_joker: ..smolen another way to deal with them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|raghavan: may be9|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|jbgood: so Rado was right about the roads ....|pg||
nt|jbgood: going for the spade finesse of course |pg||
pc|s5|nt|thegarve:  paul believes men are fixed North and West - certainly fixed not definite in thos e positions|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this contract potentially in jeopardy|pg||
nt|viren169: alternatively 1@H-3@H-4@H auction|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: no the @S-trick go on @D|pg||
nt|haans: simple finesse in spade and its a make|pg||
nt|rado: 5NT seemes as pick a slam |pg||
pc|d3|nt|wwalter: or only 7 :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: i think 7|pg||
nt|wwalter: no|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think now declarer will prevail|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|wwalter: wait & see :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wwalter: y|pg||
nt|wwalter: 7|pg||
nt|viren169: or use some form of drury|pg||
nt|xenya: Why N didn't continue @Ss i wonder|pg||
nt|jbgood: 8 discouraging=|pg||
nt|jbgood: ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|thegarve:  so East is Mrs Helness and South Ms/Misss/Mrs Bertheau|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @H just need one black suit behaving well|pg||
nt|athene: north doing what he can to take declarer's options away|pg||
nt|april7: both decisions ok|pg||
nt|athene: also there is the chance of diamond ruff for partner|pg||
nt|werge: West shall tke the @D Queen - and play the show-up squeeze against North|pg||
nt|raghavan: T all boils down to finding SQ or DJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: It all|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: North will lose six tricks|pg||
nt|paulg: no double, no trouble means a good result for NS|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: so with a singleton small spade, West is to remove 2@S to something else? Or live with it?|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 620 - excitement was in the bidding - not the play|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Yes, Anna discouraged, having no entry.|pg||
nt|werge: Might have been easier for E/W if West just ducks the @S Jack!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ampelman: lots of action at the other table in board no. 12|pg||
nt|werge: Do´nt know|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hmm. Seems less than watertight method to me  :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|raghavan: still more|pg||
nt|star6ija: has to ruff with the king now|pg||
nt|xenya: trump promotion lurkung somewhere it seems|pg||
nt|star6ija: and to hope for wrong discard|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: top trump first, then lead towards K-10?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: But okay - the @d will be played before by North|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be considering the merits of stripping the minors before playing a trump|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jbgood: a spade lead and another spade won the contract OR when S ducked a heart for 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|werge: In my younger days, I claimed for one down|pg||
nt|jbgood: these days you claim 2 down? |pg||
nt|werge: Maybe|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: ah ah ah|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: In Denmark free place - we call it discrimination to force women to sit South :)|pg||
nt|athene: just in case someone has singleton @HA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwi_joker: oops|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: not maany entris in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: so she wanted partner to switch to @Hs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: I suppose in these 10-board matches, overtricks can mean a bit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d9|nt|star6ija: this was not a wrong discard|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see u need @S in trick 1 to defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now 10|pg||
nt|timb: Hmm not sure about @CJ|pg||
nt|april7: no show up squeeze anymore|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: a kibs : the rule is that women can sit on the same side of the screen and chat :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT is interesting ... both black suits break badly|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: but the chance of running into a ruff makes it probably not worth while|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: E forgot to clean trumps|pg||
nt|werge: Probably West is NOT passing with singleton @S - and East can play 3 @D with a reasonable @D-suit by West|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: W will score 2 trumps eventually|pg||
nt|xenya: if she ruffs a @C now|pg||
nt|star6ija: it seems 3 IMPs back to Herbst|pg||
nt|xenya: but a good try by declarer |pg||
pc|s8|nt|wwalter: this was not the best declar|pg||
pc|cT|nt|raghavan: After 2 S switching to H means make 9 only|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|werge: No chance on a @H-lead!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: thats true|pg||
nt|werge: And now @S 10 from South|pg||
nt|april7: good card!!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just double-checking what he knows about the hcp and distribution|pg||
nt|athene: north is a passed hand with @HA, @CK, @DJ|pg||
nt|athene: but can still have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: so no reason to get cute in spades|pg||
nt|april7: 2 of @D is 5th best?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Books say- when there is only one way to win do that hoping cards lay favourable as wanted.|pg||
nt|werge: Where can I buy tgat book?|pg||
nt|werge: that|pg||
nt|viren169: You can have mine!|pg||
nt|werge: To go down here is a vu-graph case|pg||
nt|raghavan: Here if he expects SQ with S, then S 10 should be with N - 2  against simple finesse of Q|pg||
nt|athene: you would only play the backwards finesse (lead @SJ) if you had very strong indications that south held the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: for example if NS played mini-NT|pg||
nt|viren169: taking a long time!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c9|nt|raghavan: He probably feared S may be 42 |pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Operator, do you have the result from board one?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|timb: A nice @D shift, guaranteeing that the defenders get two more trump tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: good|pg||
nt|jbgood: as the cards lie you have to duck a heart and hope for a misdefense|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|star6ija: this was the winning line if @HQueen was with E|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|star6ija: ruff @D high ruff @C with the Ace and en passant for the last high @h|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow, +3 imps for playing in the right strain|pg||
nt|viren169: all over now!|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbgood: but spade finesse is best I gather|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|thegarve:  lol - about their men?l|pg||
nt|ampelman: 5@dX from South that is|pg||
nt|ampelman: in 12 Open room|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: maybe get there (3NT) via 2 S, 2H, 2 D, 3 C tricks|pg||
nt|werge: But let´s face it another way - East and West are both top european platt|pg||
nt|werge: No harm - 420|pg||
nt|werge: Her may-be we will get both, bad breaks coming up|pg||
nt|jbgood: doesnt pay to be too aggressive on this layout...|pg||
nt|raghavan: even now 0 only|pg||
nt|skjaeran: 4@h EW now|pg||
nt|raghavan: again 4H to EW|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Routine|pg||
nt|raghavan: 50m-50 chance for finesse|pg||
nt|werge: OK - East might switch to a @S, but more likely a @D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Walter - is it going to be Spade?|pg||
nt|werge: 10 tricks in @S - 11 in a red suit|pg||
nt|wwalter: should be :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@H?|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Martin, Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: ok 12 toptricks in 6@S|pg||
nt|werge: players - they know, twhat they do!|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice result for Hauge in the OR|pg||
nt|raghavan: Both Vul -|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: mosian fit in 4@S?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|thegarve:  hi Paul, you didn't make it either|pg||
nt|jbgood: a disaster in the OR where the Brogelands bit to the 5 level without being pushed - and went down|pg||
nt|werge: what|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing much NS can do about that at these colours|pg||
mb|d|nt|wwalter: interesting, NS can make 10 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a heart stop, partner, do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, true of course, Peter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: defence must have slipped on bd 2 in Open room to allow 3Nt thru ..seemingly 4 hearts and that offside club king to lose|pg||
nt|jbgood: bid even|pg||
nt|serhat: nice 4h here if they can bid|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: simple 4@S here ... time for a coffee break if anyone needs it|pg||
nt|werge: Both East-players shoed a one-suiter...|pg||
nt|werge: showed|pg||
nt|wwalter: Popova &Gunev r one of the mixt pairs in europa|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: He made it to the pc at home I guess|pg||
nt|raghavan: and what was the result Bd 12 - or still playing?|pg||
nt|ampelman: still playing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubtful now|pg||
nt|werge: This meight be the most boring board of to-day, 650 claim|pg||
nt|wwalter: BEST LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: referring to the last board|pg||
nt|j li: 4M looks easy on E/W, until both majors break 4-1|pg||
nt|xenya: and on this auction|pg||
nt|raghavan: De Botton gat back - since in OR they played in 3D back to almost equal score|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: seems likr flat board|pg||
nt|paulg: i'm going to Washington instead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: no now I see it ...defence cant untangle their 4 heart tricks (bd 2)|pg||
nt|haans: its a long way to game|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: what??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ampelman: the current rank of Erichsen is 27 and Gladiators rank is 29|pg||
nt|jbgood: wonder why E didnt double 2 spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting  N couldn´t resist 5@c|pg||
nt|viren169: good auction to 4@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ampelman: the first 27 qualify for the K.O. round|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by E|pg||
nt|rado: N was brave to bid vulnerable 2@S in "sandwich"|pg||
nt|serhat: this will also make with careful play|pg||
nt|paulg: a club lead would probably beat this, but no problem on a heart lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT might have had some chances - but not this time|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d = Majors 5-4?|pg||
nt|werge: Claim|pg||
nt|raghavan: Some how I would prefer 3S bid - keep doubles for 4 card suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: board 1 entered - thanks operator|pg||
nt|pelu: lazy bid by East|pg||
nt|pelu: from kibs: 13 tricks in 1H!|pg||
nt|xenya: very|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: that's better|pg||
nt|jbgood: talked out of the spade game - still gaining 5 imps|pg||
nt|wwalter: 3@s would be a F bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|star6ija: unless @s return after winning the @c lead|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a decent slam in 6@d - ruff @s out and try @H finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D is negativ, but 4@S = let go to next board :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@S bid in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think it may even be 4-4 at least nonvul|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: Tislevoll is a very international team: Norway-Phillipines + Australia-New Zealand|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that east led a spade, rather than a diamond, so promptly|pg||
nt|viren169: 2nd from poor suits|pg||
nt|viren169: traditional MUD lead from 3 small|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|viren169: lots of possible lines to think about|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead is much better for E/W, but 10 tricks should still be easy|pg||
nt|april7: another 4@H contract ,but not so easy to pla after @H leads,but cross ruff is best|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer doesn't know he has a no-loser trump suit|pg||
nt|athene: with @DA right|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@hy made it difficult|pg||
nt|wwalter: she has not shch a hand|pg||
nt|wwalter: such|pg||
pc|c5|nt|raghavan: So this will be abig tense fight|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|ampelman: 5@dX on 12 went 3 off|pg||
nt|j li: If the defense tries for a spade ruff after @HA, that will pick the trump position for declarer|pg||
nt|jbgood: in retrospective a double of 2 spades may of course be for penalty|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yep|pg||
nt|rado: with favourable @H and @C E will make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg: and no reason for Stern to lead a club (and every reason not to)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: flirthing with disaster now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: flirting|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it looks hard to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks in @s for EW|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will bid|pg||
mb|1D|nt|raghavan: WC Malik may be but depends on a dinesse od DQ and droping CQ -|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: so it doesnt look like good sacrifise except against the grand :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C enterprising|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S again NS ... but then, I said that LAST time  :-)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: imps flying about|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@c puppet stayman|pg||
nt|j li: So far the boards haven´t been too exciting, and this is no exception|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS ending up in 2H is about best|pg||
nt|rado: but normaly when vulnerable EW will bid quickly to 4@H and opponents may go to level 5|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 4@h one down (di lead and club return) is a good save:)|pg||
nt|werge: Another 650...|pg||
nt|april7: no its a misklick by vuegraph|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @D is nice on a @H-lead|pg||
nt|werge: Solid 1 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: on finesse of DQ+drop CQ|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@d = 1 4Major|pg||
nt|paulg: 3NT is okay if East leads her better major|pg||
nt|werge: better wait and see|pg||
nt|timb: Easy for Senior to bid 4@S now.|pg||
nt|jbgood: agree|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: but impossible to stop that low i think|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - but 1 @d??|pg||
nt|wwalter: now 3|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: the 4@H was lucky : no losers on 6-1 missing the Q|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@s = I have 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: west was pushy to double 4@H at the other table|pg||
nt|werge: No - in fact a @s is the best solution|pg||
mb|4H|nt|raghavan: yes I hope they dont against 6C|pg||
nt|wwalter: no Q found @@ the other Ttable|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Here I think, S should bid 3 @C - must be a @h-supporting hand|pg||
nt|jstokes: missing a pass?|pg||
nt|jstokes: not clear what is passive from south's point of view -- spade lead looks good|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Does south bids show long S and 4 in H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 1@H is @S or mm|pg||
nt|xenya: however they managed something like that on 12|pg||
nt|raghavan: Computer dealt hands produce more voids and singletons |pg||
nt|skjaeran: Overtrick here, losing two hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: W thinking??|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: yes he is|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx |pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes an extra bow|pg||
nt|rado: we see all 52 cards, players only 13 or 26|pg||
nt|paulg: Now Janet has to put her hand down as dummy :)|pg||
nt|paulg: to general amusement I expect|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 91 teams entered the Mixed Teams. We are now down to 16. Losers are eliminated, winners advance to the quarter-finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|serhat: not a very good save when 3nt is down|pg||
nt|james_h: Nick Sandqvist is a very talented player and troublesome opp|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT balanced invite|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 Hearts may go in clubs |pg||
nt|skjaeran: If the program is as it should be, it deals according to odds - in the long run.|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Still losing two tricks though.|pg||
nt|josj: hand-shuffled deals often are not fully random, that causes the difference|pg||
nt|werge: Best to be said about South´s bidding here - it does´nt hurt the opponents|pg||
pc|d5|nt|raghavan: with 11 against a1C precision w should think of hame esp in C is it 5 or 6-|pg||
nt|j li: I expect a diamond lead|pg||
nt|j li: and eleven tricks|pg||
nt|haans: suprise i though @H were lost |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ampelman: 10 tricks ?|pg||
nt|j li: Ten tricks, if East switches to a heart in time|pg||
nt|timb: (I've never liked the Rosencranz redouble - to show @SA, K or Q - in this auction)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: 5@C only down 1 = 3IMP for Norway|pg||
nt|thegarve:  could cash a@c first|pg||
nt|thegarve:  picks up stiff honour offside |pg||
nt|jbgood: hm |pg||
nt|duccino: RUNNING SCORE AT: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=32|pg||
nt|rado: yours are too optimistic Jon:) do you know who is who EW?|pg||
nt|serhat: which one is good Paul:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows NS will have normal 3NT-type values, so he can work out East can't have much - may have bid 4@H as a save|pg||
nt|werge: Good lead - no 650|pg||
nt|viren169: nicely avoided the obvious -500|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: If S passed - would have been good score for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always feel that you have to be active earlier with the North hand |pg||
nt|star6ija: still no way to make it|pg||
nt|raghavan: +1D|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C would be more descriptive if guaranteeing hearts but it's borderline whether to play that i think|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable to be in 4 - but no chance as the cards lie|pg||
nt|werge: Passive lead is recommanded|pg||
nt|jbgood: you mean a trump?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|raghavan: Walter and MOm what were we talking about sacrifice????|pg||
nt|wwalter: I did not consider any sacrifice :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thought of 6, Mom thought of 7 in Clubs|pg||
nt|wwalter: with the open cards I would claim 7 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: there is a short break|pg||
nt|wwalter: in minors, ofcouse :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Walter > will Spade force creat problem for declarer?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Here also probably making 2H|pg||
nt|xenya: S has an ideal hand for garbage stayman |pg||
nt|j li: no, always ten tricks, you are right|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2H +1D may be losers|pg||
nt|werge: Ah still possible|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: the @C-layout very friendly for decl. - all way = 5 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: I have been told that the men are N and W - but think I have seen men also sitting E (difficult for me to see them clearly from here)|pg||
nt|werge: Play a little faster this time|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|wwalter: he needs to find the Qs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no slam thoughts on E. With a singleton in @d on W...|pg||
nt|jbgood: still gaining a fiver! (or 6)'|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: although perhaps nothing is ideal - but if opps go to 3@D, you are kippered |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, North might well have called 1NT there. Then it was up to south to judge to remove that to 2@H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: this was a bidding contest where all agreed that 2 down was better than 1 down:)'|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: trouble for declarer|pg||
nt|raghavan: may go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: now he is thinking|pg||
nt|jbgood: thank you for not leading a trump Hans:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: She has only 4 losers As Hans said a direct 5D would have been good atleast after 1S by E|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: does show extra in my book|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which may turn out to be quite a profitable one|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: apparently I lose my bet - well, nothing new there|pg||
nt|xenya: no chance really on a @H return now, but it will be 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: and a a 2-imp gain|pg||
nt|april7: for 3 @C hand must be a little stronger|pg||
nt|werge: But how could you bid a passed hand to 3 @C - if NOT supporting partners suit???|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|wwalter: if he plays 4 -2 the @c :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: now he should be home :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Sunil Varghese|pg||
nt|raghavan: He himself gives|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: though tempting at matchpoints to take the heart discard on the third diamond before touching trumps - a folly at IMPs, risking the contract |pg||
nt|viren169: most people would have bid 2/3 spades over 2@H|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sunil|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|star6ija: only 1 down - 2 IMPs for Indemini|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|werge: But only with @D ´s 6-1...|pg||
nt|athene: some people might|pg||
nt|viren169: couple more imps in...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans ur question is very pertinent|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rado: vulnerable vs not often produces such overbiddings, everybody whants to add a little to the bids:)|pg||
nt|timb: A club lead would have removed any chance of an overtrick|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|nt|xenya: worked out nicely here|pg||
nt|skjaeran: de Botton sort of endplayed|pg||
nt|jbgood: W's 8 of hearts endplayed E|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Yes|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|raghavan: curtains|pg||
pc|sT|nt|raghavan: throw D?|pg||
nt|paulg: one reason to bid 4@h is that you know partner is almost certainly leading the wrong major|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|raghavan: ok|pg||
nt|raghavan: only 120 IMp difference will be there - may be 4IMP|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|serhat: is that Murphy law?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Some play that a redouble by North shows a heart honour.  |pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Sunil|pg||
nt|xenya: though 1N is even better|pg||
nt|ampelman: Erichsen made 3N in open room with the help of @s4-4 when south played 3@c+1 in this room|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H opening|pg||
nt|rado: and all started from a modes lead directing 3@D bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: so the 3 @d bid actually backfired..|pg||
nt|rado: will W risk opnenig now?|pg||
nt|paulg: a good partner will say, "well done partner, i was leading a spade"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, if South was to declare 3NT, it would be a good hand for the NT trick 1 signals outlined in Sabine Auken's book|pg||
nt|timb: Sorry - that's wrong because dummy has a trump entry|pg||
nt|werge: When you play safe like this, a lot of IMP´s will leave your pocket|pg||
nt|athene: i think you would need to be a bit of a law fanatic to bid 3@S on that hand at adverse|pg||
nt|jbgood: Sill sleeping - or he just wanted to take the club finesse after W had thrown away a couple|pg||
nt|raghavan: still neck to neck 38 vs 37 IMP|pg||
nt|skjaeran: If it's a draw after 28 boards, they play some more boards?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 3@c from North?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: 6@h on EW. can they find it?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D by E and X|pg||
nt|werge: Interesting bidding in OR|pg||
nt|raghavan: a part score deal|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @S - 2 @D - 4 @H...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|thegarve:  its a league format I guess - must check exactly how many get through|pg||
nt|j li: On a good day E/W will bid and make 6@C here|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like E/W got pushed around in th OR|pg||
nt|raghavan: u are wc|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't know|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @H is COLD - and lucky|pg||
nt|werge: Even the @S 9 is needed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzku: sry misunderstanding of the deal's No|pg||
nt|raghavan: Walter > 1 H shows Spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR: NS in 3@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course it was just a coincidence that 4@h would fail - so in  principle 5@d was a good save. And i guess the old cliche will pop up again when people speak of the board: the ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5-level belongs to the opps....|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: must be support redouble|pg||
nt|haans: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: a lot of people play 4@C when there is nothing of value outside the trump suit. May as well have pard's tenaces led into!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Say West decides to lead @HA. East plays her lowest card, which shows either two or five  |pg||
nt|jstokes: on 4, where N-S here bid to 3NT, N-S in the other room never got in the auction and collected 300 defending 2@S for a nice pickup|pg||
mb|2S|nt|raghavan: NP Mom|pg||
nt|ampelman: 2@h, wow I really didn't expect that|pg||
nt|rado: nowadays it's extended to 6 level belong ....|pg||
nt|werge: Will there be any doping-test with the man, who bid 4 @H as North?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@S doomed on a club lead if they get there|pg||
nt|xenya: strong 1@C here?|pg||
nt|wwalter: 4@h direct is a manly bid in mixt pairs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but East might bid 4NT now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and then EW go down instead of NS|pg||
nt|wolker28: i think here 1C strong club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so A,3,5,4 and EW run five heart tricks as easy as pie|pg||
nt|werge: Take the money|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 5 of minor is a good save|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i must confess i will bid 4 nt too|pg||
nt|werge: After Easts opening bid, I would put a great deal of my money on 4 @H as a winner, but...|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|werge: Never overcall such a bad suit, pls|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately wrong K of @C |pg||
nt|viren169: and reopen to introduce spades if possible...|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS should not go over board North should remember that S made a over call|pg||
nt|jbgood: ...in 4@s - |pg||
nt|james_h: y, they had a problem with bidding 2@h with the passed hand |pg||
nt|skjaeran: You didn't read the CoC?:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzku: they play inverted Majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's only a good save if 4@S makes|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Budkin may get a bit uncomfortable if heart suit is run ..must keep an exit card|pg||
nt|werge: Can they avoid 6 @S now? I doubt it!|pg||
nt|werge: A revers dummy, ruffing all @D ´s seems to be the best try|pg||
nt|timb: 4@S should show a bad opening so West should pass - even though 6@S is makeable|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 6@S is a good challenge ..draw trumps, play @Hking first, noting fall of jack, and finesse next round ..|pg||
nt|timb: exactly :0|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: even if play @Hace first, its ok ..leaves 10-x to lead up to|pg||
nt|timb: tru|pg||
nt|timb: e|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: how about a dummy reversal, even...ruff three diamonds in the long trump hand ... EVERYTHING works  |pg||
nt|athene: west has a double of 2@H, i think|pg||
nt|xenya: no, what about you? :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wwalter: I can't get those bid :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I am asking gor myself and many other kibts|pg||
nt|raghavan: for myself and|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cant risk missing vul game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may go 5@S |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that will be the sacrifice :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and then NS will go down instead of EW|pg||
nt|raghavan: Julius - as u said thin 3NT open room they bid and made what they gave in 5DV-3 they got back in this - some|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead - @d back, ducked by East|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wwalter: probablly 1!= misclick from Momchil :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@h :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: Momchil , so they bid @h4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: their 1@H bid means @S and 1@S means @H|pg||
nt|paulg: this is a match from Swiss A .. they play Swiss all day and 27 teams will qualify for the KO stages tomorrow|pg||
nt|pelu: correct to pass - 4@S down|pg||
nt|werge: Unbelieveable|pg||
nt|timb: Yes a DR is better, Ds4-4 (about 32-33%) or South has 5@D (about 24%) as long as spades are 3-2 (68%)|pg||
nt|viren169: difficult if pd bids 2@C over our dble|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|paulg: all the teams here finished in the top 3 of their round robin group yesterday|pg||
nt|paulg: everyone else is in Swiss B, from which 5 will qualify|pg||
nt|pelu: S very pleaced - but I exp 9 tricks for decl|pg||
nt|april7: with K of @S and AQ of @C S should have made a move|pg||
pc|dK|nt|werge: How can East be in position of an opening bid - and you stop in game as West...?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: chance for de Botton team to pick up IMPs, then|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: par bidding i suppose|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes  |pg||
pc|d8|nt|star6ija: depends on the @s guess|pg||
nt|thegarve:  looks to be swiss - but I can't tell how many qualify|pg||
nt|pelu: or 8 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: @S to Q - @D to Jack|pg||
nt|paulg: The running scores can be seen from http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScores.htm|pg||
nt|pelu: and close to 10!!!!|pg||
nt|duccino: IS SWISS, 27 FROM GROUP A AND FIVE FROM GROUP B|pg||
nt|thegarve:  can certainly get close after q@s and @d to jack|pg||
nt|paulg: would you all show the good raise in hearts or rebid 3NT?|pg||
nt|werge: But they can also loose 650/680 + 100... |pg||
nt|werge: A clever East takes only 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|timb: perhaps 4@S was consitent with @SQxxxx @HKxxx @DQx @CAxx|pg||
nt|timb: @CAx|pg||
nt|werge: Keeps partner in good shape|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, understandable bidding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  how are groups A and B decided then?|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Nope. But I've seen them...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: Before Spades are setup, there are 2D+1H+1C losers - will E get them|pg||
pc|sT|nt|serhat: good switch|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|skjaeran: Actually, I read some of it, but not that part.|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s take it this way: I will follow every step for North in OR from now on...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|star6ija: which is a little bit tougher after the double|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@s, 1 @d and 2 @c makes 1 down|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Just four IMPs seperating the team in the other semi now.|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity W trying to help declarer by playing Spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: she will get that wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: how is it down, Peter?|pg||
nt|raghavan: should be 11 e nw|pg||
pc|hK|nt|raghavan: D8 shows H entry|pg||
nt|j li: easy 12 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh made +3|pg||
nt|werge: Follow your partners ideas now and then - much better here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: now the defence should cash 3 @D tricks to beat it -- not easy perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: still she can work it out i think|pg||
nt|pelu: now down|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hmm a few off now|pg||
nt|paulg: Group A is the top 3 teams from each of yesterday's round robin groups|pg||
nt|skjaeran: OR bid to 5@s on previous board. Going one light.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|april7: its only bad luck because of @C K|pg||
pc|s5|nt|star6ija: contract is home now|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|raghavan: No par bidding is 4 S |pg||
nt|jstokes: still time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: @H4 (1D-ruff was the 10. trick|pg||

nt|paulg: yes|pg||
nt|j li: infact, after the 2@H bid 6NT is a very fine contract|pg||
nt|werge: We now expect a spring from Nederland|pg||
nt|werge: sprint...|pg||
nt|werge: in spring|pg||
nt|april7: now we have a grand!|pg||
nt|werge: - and we got it - or?|pg||
nt|werge: And the comment "still  time" is cancelled...(danish homor)|pg||
nt|jstokes: :)|pg||
nt|werge: humor|pg||
nt|jbgood: so more money in 4@s |pg||
nt|james_h: North weaseled another +|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess S might have discardet a di from hand and dummy - she needs only 1 di trick to make seven - now it was too easy to  shift to clubs|pg||
nt|raghavan: Vladimir 4 Bds _ if need be 4BD + 1 bd if needed|pg||
mb|1C|nt|raghavan: but not played|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: maybe someone can let us know whether EW climb to 6@S on bd 6 in the Open Rm ...|pg||
nt|werge: Seems to need some presents to make 140, at least 6 loosers|pg||
mb|1S|nt|raghavan: Yes I also feel 1 down|pg||
nt|ampelman: so the 2@h bid should have pushed EW to 6N|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 91 teams entered the Mixed Teams. We are now down to 32. Losers are eliminated, winners advance to the Round of 16 later today|pg||
nt|werge: They are on their way - they wo´nt stop in game!!!|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to bid the grand...|pg||
mb|d|nt|raghavan: down 2 - 1C+2D+1H =4|pg||
nt|paulg: hard to think of a friendly layout of the cards for North-South|pg||
nt|serhat: 4S is on.. I think NS will bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H-double?|pg||
nt|paulg: this auction could end anywhere|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: declarer lost 2@D, 1@C and 1@H |pg||
nt|jbgood: some good results EW have come in - may be a match after all!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it might end in a double|pg||
nt|paulg: 2@s i think, good raise|pg||
nt|paulg: now 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West will transfer to spades|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT is a good contract for EW, but the diamond layout is not friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  ii would have been cool to make 4@h|pg||
nt|j li: still, difficult to bid with only 29 hcp and two essentially balanced hands|pg||
nt|ampelman: this should end in 4@h I guess|pg||
nt|j li: yes, and only a low spade lead will trouble declarer|pg||
nt|ampelman: both black kings are placed favourably|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is majors, less than normal opening, i presume?|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Guess so - the Ekren convention.|pg||
nt|raghavan: Viladmir I think so too but 3C is enquiry|pg||
nt|werge: French system had no opening in South in OR|pg||
mb|2D|nt|thegarve:  cashing both @h slightly precipitous|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: have been told they ARE in slam there|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @H is very important but not really biddable, or???:)|pg||
nt|athene: tough is one way of putting it|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as the cards lie, no difference between 3@C and 4@Ss|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@h = forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: May be tough to stop short of trouble!|pg||
nt|athene: "completely bonkers" is another|pg||
nt|werge: This is no GRAND slam, absolutely not|pg||
nt|james_h: South will go|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and as expected, the OR is way behind|pg||
nt|rado: W has a reaosnable pass after 2@S|pg||
nt|werge: Are penalty doubles unfair?|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  another thin slam|pg||
nt|paulg: it's actually repechage .. from the French "to go out fishing again"|pg||
nt|thegarve:  on the layout 6NT is best|pg||
nt|xenya: all very normal|pg||
nt|pelu: 26 also 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes, 3N is destined to fail...|pg||
nt|viren169: East may (should) pass this.|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead  dia finesse and then what?|pg||
nt|duccino: RUNNING SCORE AT: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=32|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh shutting out?|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for S now -- she wants to be in game, but with @Cs wide open, 3N is out of the question |pg||
nt|jbgood: with a diamond finesse to lose, this is a downer|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: best for N/S to take their penlty|pg||
nt|lestergold: west with two bullets but nothing else of any value would have been best advised to pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: this rarely produces a game|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@D might not be very easy|pg||
nt|paulg: very disciplined bidding by everyone, especially E-W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: E did well not to double. |pg||
nt|paulg: playing 4-card majors helped to curb any excess zeal|pg||
nt|serhat: yes I wd dbl|pg||
nt|paulg: well, North did not have to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|serhat: at least for sp lead|pg||
nt|athene: even bidding 6 is by no means certain|pg||
nt|viren169: even more difficult with the 3N bid!|pg||
nt|werge: Where is the GS???|pg||
nt|werge: I forderes a sprint from NL - bedankt|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@S fsf and support clubs|pg||
nt|raghavan: E could not show her extra strength|pg||
nt|april7: 32 HP is not enough???|pg||
nt|viren169: poor bidding!|pg||
nt|athene: apparently not, no :)|pg||
nt|werge: 9 tricks - without a @s-lead|pg||
nt|james_h: I am surprised|pg||
nt|jbgood: or...|pg||
nt|werge: When I was young, we now and then took our 800|pg||
nt|raghavan: Here lost 2DX|pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: Closed room 4SX made by S here 3NT by ES !!! -|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3NT by EW|pg||
nt|wwalter: will be a 12 4 Vivi|pg||
nt|wwalter: or could be a 16 :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: e/w got away undbled|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@C was nat so no need to mastermind the auction...|pg||
nt|werge: They were close to 32½|pg||
nt|werge: But most of us would lead a @D!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: Russia does not want a negative in both rooms now|pg||
nt|pelu: good lead|pg||
nt|werge: This 4 @H I would prefer to play double-dummy..|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, your trump suit for slam is clubs, and no-one has ever raised clubs since about 1985|pg||
nt|jstokes: was that a 15-17 NT?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: need 6 @D-tricks + 2@H + 1@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Julius to bid 6NT on 29 points is difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: just refresh running scores now and then...|pg||
nt|serhat: now easy make|pg||
nt|jbgood: a careful N being afraid of a spade lead only invited - guess 3 on the other table|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C + 1D  Spades of hand may in established Diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: might have been afraid of getting them to 2@h instead..|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why W has 4 Hearts |pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: oh dear on the way skywards to which unmakeable spot?|pg||
nt|paulg: if you trust West, which I would not recommend, then he should hold 1444 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hmm ..one needs mirrors to play this trump suit for just 2 losers .....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: dia finesse and then what singel K in clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: not the best lead... but N will find the heart switch when in with the @D|pg||
nt|viren169: Budkin should signal a dislike for @cs|pg||
nt|viren169: De botton had no idea of the club fit, hence pass|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: must confess having some difficulty in trying to understand the auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead solved all problems for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: easy bidding in OR|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead -- an unbid suit on this kind of auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least they are playing in the best of their multitude of 4/3 fits|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the double helps South as it would be far more awkward if forced to bid as North|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Redouble is strange - normally first round control say Axx|pg||
nt|haans: i say this is a make fast dia finesse|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - I also would have passed as North. A South hans winning game with this North hand, is too strong for 1 NT|pg||
nt|skjaeran: They need to play spades to defeat it.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 club tricks and a spade will beat it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|raghavan: Will S play H|pg||
nt|werge: Big mirrors|pg||
nt|raghavan: may be discarded in Diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|nt|thegarve:  Pass seems normal - nothing to say|pg||
nt|paulg: are we slamming yet or just looking for the best game? Perhaps just trying to show @sHx|pg||
nt|werge: But should be a totally flat board|pg||
nt|jbgood: E doesnt know that - and N might be 5-5 in reds on this auction i guess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: but now he cant ruff the 4. @H|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|star6ija: flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: oh sorry -- @Ds were bid by E -- missed that|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am going for coffee|pg||
nt|thegarve:  pass and allow South to XX if wanting a semi-stop or bid 4m |pg||
nt|paulg: 6@h looks the best slam, at least you have some options in the play|pg||
nt|thegarve:  seems the Norwegains play  reverse - pass = 1/2 or full stop and xx = two/theree small. Unusual but highly playable if all play this way|pg||
nt|werge: But how could South pass 2 NT?|pg||
nt|werge: Thanks jbgood + for you|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Making now|pg||
nt|jbgood: another spade in on the @d king would ruin transportation|pg||
nt|jbgood: now he is fine|pg||
nt|xenya: the point is that @D switch would break communications for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: @S switch, sorry|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|j li: all roads lead to 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|ampelman: due to the very friendly distribution all roads lead to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: the moment of truth!|pg||
nt|werge: I had´nt even seen it|pg||
nt|jbgood: by using the green card..|pg||
nt|raghavan: Partner has bis 1S  so |pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: this contract looks like one off with a clubs 2 spades and 2hearts tolose|pg||
nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
nt|jbgood: she has 8 tricks, so the finesse in hearts was too dangerous|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i mean Swedes|pg||
nt|paulg: Will Helness lead @c10?|pg||
nt|jstokes: cashing the spade ace and setting up a trick for declarer means declarer can play hearts either way, needing only 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: he cannot go wrong really - even a di off dummy sees him home|pg||
nt|raghavan: He has to go by SA, remove trumps and play to DQ|pg||
nt|xenya: now it's simple -- cross to @SA, draw trumps -- 2 if needed -- then play @Ds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|viren169: all over!|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Running scores from all 4 quarterfinals:|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF|pg||
nt|werge: Excuse me - did´nt West bi 1 @S? YES Did East lead a "S? NO|pg||
pc|s6|nt|thegarve:  its when half your team play one way and half the other that agreements become doubtful|pg||
nt|viren169: I think they are playing 4 card majs, and 1@C is nat with 4|pg||
nt|xenya: is N still thinking?|pg||
nt|werge: @S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|raghavan: May be making Sunil|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 1 off from here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: heather might have dumped the king there|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not with this def surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may well run the @D9 here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: A bit of national pride for me, with a New Zealand team in the quarters ('bridge akarana') ..that has to be a first|pg||
nt|xenya: he had a blind spot, no doubt|pg||
nt|xenya: or am I missing something?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|raghavan: yes agreed|pg||
nt|serhat: hmm|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: an uptrick ..|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy for Mayantz|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: i meant that even if E hadn't bid @Ds, E should lead a red suit|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is on it´s way DOWN in OR...! What did I say - 650 + 100 = 13 IMPS|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|viren169: good bidding in the OR|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, I am born before the pocket calculators - North has a BADF hand|pg||
nt|werge: UPS|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wwalter: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: W rather|pg||
nt|haans: no help from partner|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ok he hsa done|pg||
nt|xenya: please tell me :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: spade was the 8th|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu: will S take the extra chance: @C to A and @C-ruff?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes she'll love the sight of KT@C|pg||
nt|paulg: the problem with that line is that you could not pick up @dQxxx|pg||
nt|jstokes: he will know,however, that west has more hearts than east|pg||
pc|cK|nt|viren169: tough hand for defence|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|kiwi_joker: North fails (understandably?) Bidding suggested a bunch of diamonds coming for decl.... and North saw spade lead misfire .. I think finding a low heart was not impossible|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: it appears he could have made it double dummy by winning 1st @D with the Ace (Queen drops), then ruffing 4th @H with the K and finessing trumps |pg||
nt|raghavan: It is West whould have shown more force in bidding - |pg||
pc|dT|pc|cJ|nt|thegarve:  worth it |pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: and thats another 4 imps in the bin|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: but then she is short of entry if 1D are 4-1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d9|pc|cQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: agree|pg||
pc|s7|nt|viren169: more imps for Vriend|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|werge: By doubling 2 @D here, you might loose 180 instead of 90 - but you might have 800 instead of 300. Case for calculators to decide, what is best.|pg||

nt|raghavan: a part score contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: May be 1NT by N|pg||
nt|xenya: seems there's no other way to make it |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: as this is a knock-out, time beginning to run out for Budkin|pg||
nt|viren169: partscore hand now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT made on board 5 - spade lead|pg||
nt|serhat: unnecessary sp finese..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead  looks like a favour but isn´t|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@H promises 5 clubs or 4144 shape... (thks Victor)|pg||
nt|werge: More sprint now?|pg||
nt|viren169: need a time-out now I guess!|pg||
nt|raghavan: De Button is having  great happy hands  |pg||
nt|april7: now EW might bid the slam,but go down|pg||
nt|werge: OR is playing 3 NT, so a swing if sure|pg||
nt|jbgood: she, actually|pg||
nt|jstokes: i was thinking they were in 3 :)|pg||
nt|skjaeran: He played for @D 3-2. Needed trumps 3-3 if doubleton @D with LHO.|pg||
nt|wwalter: Hauge is a real fighter|pg||
nt|werge: 140 N/S seems possible with a @C-guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  with no overcall 3-2 breaks become far more common than 4-1|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 14 boards|pg||
nt|viren169: Will East open in 3rd seat?|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 3 NT made 10 on 18 in the OR|pg||
nt|paulg: 19-point slam here |pg||
nt|werge: So were I|pg||
nt|raghavan: We are told - usually Ladies sit in E and S positions in Europe|pg||
nt|werge: Once more, we might see North open - passed in OR|pg||
mb|1D|nt|raghavan: After 6 Boards the scores are level 13 each|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh 1NT by W!!!!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  with a 6313 you would see a WJO|pg||
nt|ampelman: 12-14|pg||
nt|j li: 3NT is down on a black suit lead|pg||
nt|ampelman: 5 Major possible|pg||
nt|haans: of course :)|pg||
nt|paulg: but pretty impossible to bid unless you have help|pg||
nt|skjaeran: That IS in the CoC.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: slam is quite poor here -- NS won't bid it here|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@c Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|ampelman: by North|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I guess 28 bds in match? Havent checked sorry|pg||
nt|viren169: yes you are right...|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is probable...|pg||
nt|athene: they won't bid a slam; they will bid 4@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|raghavan: You might have played against him in European championships|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's VERY double dummy :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but on the lead almost impossible to go on @DA|pg||
nt|viren169: dble or 2@S?|pg||
nt|werge: @C- og @H-lead defeats 6 @S I think|pg||
nt|athene: well, if east doubles now, west is a bit stuck|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: difficult for n/s to stay out of spade game hee|pg||
nt|haans: play by North|pg||
nt|athene: he might bid 2@S but that is underbidding by two aces|pg||
nt|xenya: the whole thing is a complete mystery to me (last hand)|pg||
nt|skjaeran: OR went down in 3NT on 21. Hauge by 23 now.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wwalter: never been there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't think so :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes corrected|pg||
nt|athene: fortunately 3@S solves all problems|pg||
nt|werge: May-be some squeeze will work|pg||
nt|athene: now west just has to choose between 3nt and 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 2 teams here both won their grupe|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3N denies any 4+ Major|pg||
nt|viren169: may get N/S too high... |pg||
nt|viren169: 2N now should end the auction...|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|skjaeran: 22-24|pg||
nt|raghavan: they may go to 6 NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: unfrtunately as cards lie it looks like one off|pg||
nt|pelu: now N shy correct to 2@H|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: how did they manage to play 6@S off in the other room, hans?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya:  even in 4@H, there might be some problems |pg||
nt|j li: even on a heart lead the defense has to time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: maybe 2H now, then North 2NT? Yes, too hugh|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: high|pg||
nt|jbgood: opps so unfriendly as to cash five club tricks..|pg||
nt|werge: 8 tricks are enough to make 6 IMP|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: a slip of the tongue might help|pg||
nt|ampelman: @d are blocked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, the singleton diamond is rather useful|pg||
nt|april7: no troubles with p in 4@S!!!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: but it will of ocurse be a push|pg||
nt|haans: but a small winner|pg||
nt|viren169: South will push over 2N... |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: sure will ..hoping for 5 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N by South seems enough with that hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 4@h made on 19 - looks as if it is all over now|pg||
nt|rado: agresive 2@S fit ( 3334 and dubious K@H)|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh!!!!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: the only good news as in the club suit|pg||
nt|pelu: a weak hand with 5 card major sh be played in major!|pg||
nt|viren169: flat(ish) board... next hand...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|raghavan: going towards slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not often that you can make 7 tricks in nt with 19 pts and no 5 card suit|pg||
nt|pelu: also if pd only has 2 card in the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: perfect cards ... Roland of course would be considering the grand|pg||
nt|raghavan: If made - Hauge gets + scores in both rooms |pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: excellent point, Peter|pg||
nt|werge: If South can guess the @C-situation, she can afford a double-finesse in @S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|star6ija: 5 IMPs herbst|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract -- 4@H is cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: reverse the red queens and 4s is cold|pg||
nt|ampelman: well, but unblocking will be no problem|pg||
nt|viren169: 4333 dont produce many tricks!|pg||
nt|haans: none ever pass 2nt today '3nt was so close'|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|viren169: defence off to a great start...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this will be painful ..club, then heart thru....then..|pg||
nt|serhat: at least 4C harmless|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: no, looks like it made|pg||
nt|werge: Finessing the @S Jack to make the 1430|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raghavan: E could have shown club A - for EW good|pg||
nt|werge: If North takes the second @S, he can play @H to dummy and a @C - loosing three tricks only|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: odd lead, with a diamond sequence in her hand|pg||
nt|werge: But @D´s bid by South|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: all it might do is set up Norths 8@S|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, a @D-lead complicates the play for North, because @C´s are 4-1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wwalter: I supose Vivi is winning|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Mr Walters looks so - now lead of 22 + this bd|pg||
nt|viren169: It is painful for me... and I am only watching!|pg||
nt|haans: see it positive. @SK is at right place|pg||
nt|james_h: North will play diamonds for 10?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|raghavan: another 10 here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ducking was NOT best (on this layout)  |pg||
nt|werge: @D back will be good|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Thomas Mac Cormac|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: I know that for 45 years playing :)|pg||
nt|mccormac: Good afternoon |pg||
nt|james_h: no|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|duccino: Board 1 was deleted and they played a brand new one. So results of board 11 are correct but the cards are not|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wshould ponder - If s had spade 10 he need not play SJ so E has it|pg||
nt|ampelman: if one of the low @H were @h10 there would be chance for a squeeze against east|pg||
nt|werge: @S Ace now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: but he does not know of the lucky @S position|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice sacrifice by EW - they would be disappointed, losing 5 IMPs from this board|pg||
nt|j li: Gladiator might fake a club finesse for the ninth trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: must go  down |pg||
nt|athene: if you duck a diamond you might make 12|pg||
nt|viren169: nice play...|pg||
nt|raghavan: no there is no entry to W to enjoy the winner D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: 4@S is an excellent sacrifice, limiting the loss|pg||
nt|duccino: Board 1 was deleted and they played a brand new one. So results of board 11 are correct but the cards are not|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H prob also down - but 1NT need @HK x - and some help|pg||
pc|s2|nt|thegarve:  best link for groups please|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still can't make seven unless the defence slips|pg||
nt|ampelman: if there a chance to get east endplayed ?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ampelman: *Is*|pg||
pc|sK|nt|j li: Not really|pg||
nt|jbgood: making 9 without the heart finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: re last hand: of course it was i who had a blind spot -- thought NS had the @DJ as well -- my apologies|pg||
pc|s5|nt|thegarve:  it can take a while for folks to trail the websites|pg||
nt|mccormac: So 10 tricks look likely |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would have played Heart to king and finesse - also before Club A is knocked out or else they will run thru in minors|pg||
nt|athene: no, but if north throws a club there is a @H-@C squeeze on south now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|raghavan: W has SQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|viren169: West needs to be careful not to end play pd|pg||
nt|haans: time for @H now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: pain has been reduced .. i remain convinced the 8@H was best card at trick 2 ... clubs can come in their own good time. Now Arnolds has tossed 2 hearts away|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that S has found the right line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mccormac: will have to play small if east switches a @c|pg||
nt|mccormac: but you should do that to protect your King|pg||
nt|raghavan: thinking to develop a club|pg||
nt|werge: If South plays @S to the 8m East shall not play @D - that will tell Souht the @s-situation|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm is the best place to start|pg||
nt|j li: East can discard two clubs and a spade painlessly|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|viren169: It is easy for us to see from here!|pg||
nt|athene: run all the spades then cross to @DA|pg||
nt|werge: Still a very close match|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|xenya: EW did really well to find the save here|pg||
nt|haans: as always :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: very true!!|pg||
nt|viren169: must play a @H now!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence has slipped. @H9 sets up|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Raghavan.. that is the line i was thinking of|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now can endplay east unless she drops @Ck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to see, but West needed to play a club through rather than the third diamond |pg||
nt|paulg: and, for running scores, http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScores.htm|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: @SQ|pg||

nt|lestergold: the sort of hand that tends to poduce a swing|pg||
nt|xenya:  S played it very well |pg||
nt|viren169: Budlin of the mark!|pg||
nt|viren169: another p/s hand here|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D-2@D-x-p-"@S|pg||
nt|rado: how much @h from S now?|pg||
nt|paulg: harmless unless it helps them find a club save|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C by North would get 4@D by South - now jumping to 6@H not unreasonable |pg||
nt|serhat: exactly|pg||
nt|mccormac: Board 20 in open room was bid to the good slam another 13 goes to Neve |pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: a big hand on W!|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Nine tricks the limit here.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|star6ija: this looks like missed game by EW in the OR|pg||
nt|pelu: Norway missed 3Nt in board 15 (playing 3@C)|pg||
nt|xenya: just what W wants to hear|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like to show 6-4 as majors - if pd bid 2@S on a 3 card suit we play on 4-3 and not 6-2|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C for the majors|pg||
nt|raghavan: Julius - any further news from Open|pg||
nt|haans: not 2@D 21H|pg||
nt|serhat: huge hand|pg||
nt|serhat: after 3H|pg||
nt|mccormac: Will e/w reach game with a combined 26 count if south opens|pg||
nt|viren169: a thin 3N here for N/S|pg||
nt|april7: a not very easy to reach 3NT with only 1 stopp in @H|pg||
mb|2D|an|TRANSF !H|nt|rado: hard reopening problem for E|pg||
nt|rado: too much honours and no bid available|pg||
nt|rado: partner may have for example Kxxxxx x xxx Kxx for an easy game|pg||
nt|jbgood: E has no good bid - cannot double with 2 spades, no good 2 NT either . pass a good alternative|pg||
nt|mccormac: does any game make |pg||
nt|skjaeran: In spades.|pg||
nt|xenya: 6 boards to go |pg||
nt|raghavan: South's bid will stop E from going to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: was tuff< but he made :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 more deals let us see|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/ a minor part score n/s potential to get too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South not tempted opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|viren169: with no entry to West's hand...|pg||
nt|werge: You have only one bid now: 3 NT|pg||
nt|april7: the only possible bid is 3@H and N???|pg||
nt|raghavan: again I am wrong|pg||
nt|werge: Who can explain one bid from OR: 1 @C - 1 @S - 2 @C from South, what is that???|pg||
nt|raghavan: 675 kibits watching this fight|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ampelman: 1N = 6-11, 5-7 with 3@s this time|pg||
nt|jbgood: popova knew w had long hearts in the open room - still took the finesse the wrong way and down in 3 NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: same as in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: on the other hand, it might help to uncover a magic 5-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|rado: every bid might be right or wrong|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Callaghan will lose 10 imps for last board|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes unfortunaely E has singletom H and W has no entry - so 3NT makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: passed hand X- S may bid 2S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: shd get to the @C game now|pg||
nt|j li: Even 2@S is in danger on a trump lead|pg||
nt|werge: East never leads @d...|pg||
nt|werge: On the @D-lead you get 430 - here only 400 |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT is comfortable here ... 6@C would make on a good day .. (spades 3-3, heart ace onside) not today|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: at least|pg||
nt|pelu: now NS has problems |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht arises in his might|pg||
nt|april7: same bidding in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - she may not have known - but indications were there|pg||
nt|werge: OK frenct spectators tell, us, that 2 @C is Rodrique, but North forgot it|pg||
nt|nickf: yawn|pg||
nt|nickf: sorry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|star6ija: 4@h is very hard for defeating|pg||
nt|lestergold: now south couldnt come in warned of misfit by opening bid|pg||
nt|viren169: Will East reopen if it comes to them?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|viren169: the vul is wrong...|pg||
nt|raghavan: breathing time provided to declarer|pg||
nt|april7: give up a @D quick and......|pg||
nt|werge: So we have 2 West-players, who can be proud of their overcall - which drove N/S to a terrible game...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|raghavan: deal 8  down 2 in OR because of bidding system - N opened 1 D and S passed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 2@H is fourht suit forcing - the pitiful crutch|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: if Rd = ½ stopper S can bid 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: But N has extra strength|pg||
nt|jbgood: she landed on double - my last bid - even 2 NT better|pg||
nt|rado: well that's the worst|pg||
nt|mccormac: 2@d is bid there to make partner bid again|pg||
nt|mccormac: A lot of the times you should undervalue big hands as they are much more difficult to play as no entries to dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbgood: Tor doesnt like this much...|pg||
nt|serhat: or 11?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a well-known author described it|pg||
nt|paulg: again the cards lie favourably for declarer|pg||
nt|ampelman: I can't see more than 8 tricks|pg||
nt|j li: This will go down unless the defense touches diamonds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting lead from N|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SA then duck @D?|pg||
nt|april7: cash ace of @S first|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise a club back kills the entry to @SK?|pg||
nt|athene: of course as it happens, only west can win the diamond when you duck, so the club can't be attacked|pg||
nt|raghavan: communication problem may be there for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer doesn't know that|pg||
nt|april7: but without the overcall the 3NT contract is easier to reach|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead D and duck is the best|pg||
nt|werge: Right april7 - North will respond 2 @D and there we are - in 3 NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: He has to, perforce develop D play it now|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will not want to cash @SA because it really kills her if diamonds DON'T break|pg||
nt|athene: and she might go a lot down|pg||
nt|athene: but i think she needs 3-2 diamonds basically so might as well go for it|pg||
nt|werge: She has|pg||
nt|raghavan: goes 2 down at least = 3S+3trumps+1D|pg||
nt|wwalter: should be 3 down|pg||
nt|werge: I do´nt know much about bridge - but this is no WINNER|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D-4@H-4@s and on we go|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes if he manages a H ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: agree Thomas|pg||
pc|d8|nt|raghavan: solves headache for S|pg||
nt|pelu: 3x1H - and N will make - can set up the 9. trick in @C|pg||
nt|xenya: reasonable contract -- remains to make it|pg||
nt|paulg: @h2 for club switch|pg||
nt|mccormac: Partners suit will always be ok at least they won't shout at you :-)|pg||
nt|mccormac: are they 28 board matches?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think so|pg||
nt|jbgood: as Arifin Halim points out: 3 NT by E is a winner!|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Had to keep the @s8|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump lead wants to prevent east ruffing his spade losers in dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C will not be a walk in the park!|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best to cash spade and duck a @D |pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzku: still he cant make 400 :)|pg||
nt|haans: why balance??? to get THEM to high|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done to E/W to push the opps|pg||
nt|raghavan: low D|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|raghavan: Looks like going in for slam in C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not 4@S. I thought East would bid that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor save agianst 2@H, this|pg||
nt|paulg: the lack of spade bid opposite encouraged Stern|pg||
nt|serhat: after W passed abit agresive. but we dont know what they play 2nt from balancing|pg||
nt|paulg: i'd have opened his hand, rather than lie in wait|pg||
nt|mdgraham: me too|pg||
nt|serhat: I wd open too.. it would sort the problem out|pg||
nt|paulg: well, I realise it may create other problems :)|pg||
nt|skjaeran: (or Q)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Partner bids Spade why W not leading|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|viren169: everything works as West has QJ of @Ds|pg||
nt|viren169: better had West led a heart|pg||
nt|april7: I once lost a grand because I didn't want to go  6 down instead of 1, but that wa slong time ago:):):)|pg||
nt|viren169: If they are good enough to bid... they are good enough to lead!|pg||
nt|werge: They INSIST on not leading partners suit, as I see it - and especially when it´s the @S-suit|pg||
nt|wwalter: @hK :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: With these two teams. I see a good suit quality over call . So Partner should trust P and lead|pg||
nt|werge: I think, fellows, that we must admit, that EAST was on lead here - and also, that it was very clever from her, NOT to lead her own suit...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: still, she has shown her hand well.|pg||
nt|raghavan: A good pass|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open room East played 3Nt very well - she had a @C-lead to the Q: First tryed for @SQx : taking @SAK - then @HAK hopiong for fall of !Q or 10: succed: @H10 and she set up a ...|pg||
nt|pelu: 1H-trick and 1D K onside = 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: Vriend are almost there|pg||
pc|s6|nt|raghavan: E has 3 diamond loser but can ruff 2 only - + a S loser|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not totally clear how to go about this|pg||
nt|april7: not necessarily|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have done very well to reopen but was deterred by the unfavourable vulnarability perhaps |pg||
nt|athene: i think heart lead was the best chance - just play partner for a doubleton|pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: develop H now|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer must be unhappy -- from his perspective, the contract is bound to fail|pg||
nt|rado: declarer will try to score 2 trumps|pg||
nt|jbgood: he might just manage that|pg||
nt|rado: kibs suggesting that if something to be bid it's 3@D - at least you have good trumps there:)|pg||
nt|mccormac: This is not going to help as @d now set up|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: 5 IMPs for 2@H making (1NT -1) to Calandra|pg||
nt|xenya: he might even play a @H at some point in an attempt to endplay E|pg||
nt|xenya: he has no idea @Hs are 6-2 of course|pg||
nt|pelu: I feel with N!|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Opps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: declarer very lucky can now get out losing a only a club spade and heart thats if he sets up the clubs now|pg||
nt|serhat: now it is ugly|pg||
nt|paulg: @hKQ may prevent too much damage|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 spades seems to make NS - so a chance for a small pickup for Hauge now|pg||
nt|james_h: 1nt was well timed here|pg||
nt|raghavan: allowing to make|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 @s was a winner too|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg: you now know that East has @cAQ for a vulnerable weak two in second seat|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Yeah. So would running all the trums.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: no im wrong nortth get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: oh|pg||
nt|ampelman: @d10 plays for @d9 short|pg||
nt|raghavan: If W does not cover may be he will get DQ|pg||
nt|mccormac: can save a trick by playing up to @s king|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wwalter: Vivi will win 4 sure now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the curse of scotland |pg||
nt|ralfwil: N should have ducked and S can find the @s shift. Now the contract is on ice|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: and the stiff @SA didn't look too good either|pg||
nt|xenya: good news!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has denied Spade control so west thought 6 may not make|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the websites leads to a number of errors - e.g. participants leads to an error message|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|xenya: the @DJ|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: spades pitch first to try to encourage some spade discards|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: well only if south gives it to him|pg||
nt|pelu: if he take out 4X@D he have no entry for @C10|pg||
nt|jbgood: not any more though - rest belongs to the defense|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: not everybody would bid 1 NT after S's spade response|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mccormac: ah 4 @d on table is ok sorry|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|raghavan: curtains|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: why spade discard|pg||
nt|mccormac: South could still have over taken @c |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: hard to follow it appears that south played declarer for 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the bulletins are not available either|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|jbgood: and Burn's rule    1 infringed: as declarer you should possess more trumps than the opps|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg: declarer will have a choice whether to finesse the diamond for 9 or 11 tricks, or just take 10|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|wwalter: ty all 4 watching, nice job Momchil, ty Doc, wish U all a nice day|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: she did not :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: pity started wqiuth excellent defence|pg||
nt|pelu: last board|pg||
nt|xenya: note W's duck at trick 1 -- that kept declarer in the dark until the end|pg||
nt|j li: Last board for this match|pg||
nt|raghavan: Julius any news from Open room|pg||
nt|ampelman: current rank for Erichsen is 27 and 29 for Gladiator|pg||
nt|haans: long way to 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S on the lie of the cards... but not easy to bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, NS certainly won't expect to gain on the board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Thomas, but more difficult|pg||
nt|mccormac: It's always difficult with only 13 cards in your hand I find|pg||
nt|raghavan: a part score contract|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: who passes that west hand these days?|pg||
nt|april7: a @H fit versus a @D fit|pg||
nt|james_h: only the very clever and those a dander to society|pg||
nt|werge: West must be declarer in NT here|pg||
nt|raghavan: What is wrong in CK and CJ|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Need to cash all minor suit winners to avoid being endplayed, with best play.|pg||
nt|xenya: that might be a swing for De Botton|pg||
nt|raghavan: West got DK entry but did not play S|pg||
nt|raghavan: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: had W won with  the K and returned the suit, N would have certainly made it |pg||
nt|mccormac: We must always remeber that when your on your own at the table some strange things can happen :-)|pg||
nt|werge: Nice 3 NT here - but more likely is 4 @H one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  so pdf format is fine but not the web format|pg||
nt|james_h: West belongs to the former I hasten to add|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzku: Thanks all |pg||
nt|pelu: 3@h?|pg||
nt|james_h:  danger|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is going down next door after S cashed her 3 minor tricks and contiinued with the club jack|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, just cash A, A and K, then sit back |pg||
nt|werge: Here it seems - that du to the bad @S-break, declarer must guess the @H-suit to make 140 - and a @d-led can make 140 an impossible mission|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again where are u Walter? - Spade coming in|pg||
nt|jbgood: 140 seems a nice result OZR|pg||
mb|2D|nt|thegarve:  So Swedes mashed their neighbours and rivals this time|pg||
nt|wwalter: I am her :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: north will be thinking of a slam with this massive two suiter|pg||
nt|j li: Weber-Weber in the open room didn´t get to the thin 6NT in B16 either|pg||
nt|haans: 8 + 4432 ok for sayman|pg||
nt|viren169: pass or 2@C?|pg||
nt|rado: 3NT for NS now|pg||
nt|serhat: I sd have been only 300 really|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @H should be the opening 4th in hand!|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 boards to go, 10-imp difference|pg||
nt|jbgood: another x?|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Down 3 in 2@h? Or 4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: i thank co commentator Mr walter, My closest friend Momchil, Important Kibits, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last board for this session|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2@H is fine with Qxx@s in your hand|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR - and also @H10 to 8 and @HQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion N knows that S has an honour (or two), otherwise W had tried to enter dummy and play @c|pg||
nt|mccormac: should be an easy 11 tricks in 4@s |pg||
nt|mccormac: hope Van not considering bidding could get very expensive |pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is also a convention. For me it´s a good @d suit and side stoppers|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like the hearts wont be found...|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D now...|pg||
nt|athene: 2 1/2 @D now from east|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a pity about the two club losers|pg||
nt|rado: but hard to bid wtih both opps action|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, is perfect hand for it|pg||
nt|raghavan: bid 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: and AM will ... |pg||
nt|athene: possibly she will round up :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: WHY THIS x unneccessary|pg||
nt|wwalter: double is a good preempt against the slem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: dbl was showing points and 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: that's exciting|pg||
nt|haans: 8 with 4 card M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent lie of the cards - 3N makes EW|pg||
nt|serhat: Fawcett played trump before establising the side suit again|pg||
nt|april7: and then 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: should pass!|pg||
nt|jbgood: no problem with 3 NT on the E hand either|pg||
nt|werge: South cannot get it easier - opening 1 @H eliminates that lead - so...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 I guess|pg||
nt|werge: So now we should have the @D-lead at least|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: an anonymous contributor says 6@C is going down next door|pg||
nt|werge: It really tells the story|pg||
nt|jbgood: @d finesse working, so contract not in danger|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wwalter: only 1190 not 1440 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south with a double fit bidding a very conservative 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: as expected no club lead|pg||
nt|j li: East might have gambled a pass|pg||
nt|j li: 2@C is at least two off|pg||
nt|ampelman: Does anybody know what happens if there are 2 or more teams placed 27th ?|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit pushy... |pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't have a good hand for 3NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 spades makes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: here we have a standard 4@S - but in the Open room Peter Fredin in West found the killing lead : @C7!|pg||
nt|raghavan: If HJ is played now, and N ducks, may be good for defense|pg||
nt|j li: Yes, good lead|pg||
nt|j li: Defense can take three aces and three ruffs now|pg||
nt|haans: such is bridge|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: last board and an exact tie -- few imps exchanged, too|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done to North for taking the bull by the horns!|pg||
nt|viren169: but he will fancy his chances!|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @S is a good card|pg||
nt|raghavan: East has overbid!!|pg||
nt|athene: having only a 4-4 diamond fit is bad|pg||
nt|athene: it ties up a lot of cards for only four winners|pg||
nt|viren169: not for the first time! (or the last!)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: 2@C checkback. 2N=two hearts and a maximum|pg||
nt|athene: you want 5-3 or 6-2 fits in NT, not 4-4 fits|pg||
nt|athene: plus of course he only has a minimum opening bid :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: yes it went down. tough to make 12 tricks actually|pg||
nt|pelu: close correct card but wrong suit :)|pg||
nt|pelu: when u see AKQ by pd u like to bid 3@D! :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  34-4 now and can only increase|pg||
nt|xenya: the point is, did E also show a major 2-suiter or just @Hs? |pg||
nt|rado: E might have prefer 2@H instead 3@C with minimum 5-4 hand|pg||
nt|viren169: I can see this coming in...|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@D is forcing in their system?|pg||
nt|april7: only the 3-3 break in @C makes the contract succeed and ofcourse also the @S situation|pg||
nt|werge: No danger for sure, but you feel better, if @C Queen takes the first trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: given the proper timing she will end up with 4-0-5-1 = 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|raghavan: H5 |pg||
nt|viren169: South would surely have passed 3@S had North bid it. |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jbgood: even that lead didnt give away the contract|pg||
nt|viren169: and T of hearts sitting well for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: ideally with that club combination you would like to lead twice towards the @CQJ|pg||
nt|athene: to cater for @CAx with south|pg||
nt|athene: but he doesn't really have that luxury|pg||
nt|april7: @S ace and the @S Q is best for defense|pg||
nt|viren169: nothing for defence to attack...|pg||
nt|athene: @SQ switch now is possible|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: Ferraro: your partner dont like that bid :) - she knot how to defeat 2Nt!|pg||
nt|werge: That lead points direction East, when you shall guess the @H-situation|pg||
nt|werge: @d-shift - and all depends on the @h-guess|pg||
nt|timb: A @D lead was needed|pg||
nt|athene: play partner for the @S10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Here 3 NT by EW makes but counterparts in OR surrendered 500  |pg||
pc|d6|nt|sunsamvar: this is even tougher|pg||
nt|xenya: seems EW have lost control over the bidding|pg||
nt|viren169: good shot!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|timb: and a club shift then a spade to the ace for another club - only at double dummy :)|pg||
nt|skjaeran: I'm told they play 6@d next door|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@C was strong, but i'm not sure about 1N|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: also a major 2-suiter|pg||
nt|timb: and a club shift then a spade to the ace for another club - a double dummy defence :(|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: touch hand to defend|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: tough|pg||
nt|jbgood: I see why S didnt want to play ag 2@h doubled - but this time a pass would have yielded some nice imps (nice for Norway)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|raghavan: This again - I wont play SK|pg||
nt|mccormac: 29 i.m.p.s = a 20-10 victory point score |pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 12 now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|star6ija: looks like transfer for @cs|pg||
nt|jbgood: Bye James|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wwalter: will be only 990|pg||
nt|star6ija: or accepted the hand as semi-balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt E and W will have a few words to say to each other after the hand is over|pg||
nt|star6ija: normally it is 2 down and 13 IMPs to Herbst|pg||
nt|pelu: @SA and a small @H!|pg||
nt|j li: Engels trumps are good enough to overruff dummy twice|pg||
nt|haans: but AQxx is a little extra|pg||
nt|viren169: South in the other room did bid 4 over 3@S|pg||
nt|werge: The problem for declarer is, that after the bidding, she probably will misguess the @H-suit, and as South has the @C Ace, he will get shortened|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: mind you in 6 there have may hav been a warning double or the view that the slam could only be defeated with the help of the club suit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The session times today are 10:00  12:30  15:00  17:30  CET|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|athene: west hopes to sneak that one past @CAx with north|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: seeing SAJ109 etc|pg||
nt|viren169: but has very little justification for it (unless they play 3@S forcing!)|pg||
nt|mccormac: if this is ducked 12 will be made the long @d used to pitch the other @c|pg||
nt|viren169: duck again...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wwalter: bye|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: @Hj|pg||

nt|werge: Bad play, will cost the 4th @S-trick. Start with the @D Q - and South will cover|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|paulg: unfortunately this match could be almost settled in the first half|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 12 IMPs changed hands on bd 10 ....|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H here...|pg||
nt|april7: another 4@H by EW and may be a slam try|pg||
nt|werge: Difficult to avoid 650 E/W here|pg||
nt|raghavan: EW should not overbid here|pg||
nt|raghavan: OR made 1OT only|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 boards to go - de Botton needs 2 big swings or 3 moderate ones|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Three to go, de Botton need some huge swings.|pg||
nt|wwalter: beeing void in the opening suit, no reson to go furder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So no result entered on board 11|pg||
nt|werge: Her 140 more likely|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: 4@Sx made next door - good lien from Sandquist|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: but hard to bid without trumps Q maybe|pg||
nt|jbgood: everythin is favourable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on board 7|pg||
nt|mccormac: another bare opening should reach 4@s |pg||
nt|viren169: 1N-2@D-...- 4@H|pg||
nt|raghavan: Probably decision by TD is awaited for scoring|pg||
nt|werge: To the previous board only this: When you open 1 @C, do´nt be surprised, if partner responds - and decide in time (before opening) what you bid after the most common answers|pg||
mb|1S|nt|raghavan: Walters Is 4 IMP shown is carry over from SF?|pg||
nt|xenya: it doesn't seem likely they can get one here|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: dble or 3@H?|pg||
nt|werge: Eats eventual 1 NT (15-17) is rather bad|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wwalter: probably from the direct game betwen them|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H choosen in both rooms|pg||
nt|werge: Must be the @H-guess|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: obviously, 7-card major-suits are best to finish to 3NT always ..forget 4H or 4S games  :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is going to ba part score |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Or they stood out of game, naturally|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best is 1N-4@D-4@H (Texas)|pg||
nt|werge: I would never break the transfer with that hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: if west bid 2@D not 4@D he ought to have slam interest now|pg||
nt|raghavan: This shows max and a good fit|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C is max with 4@H and cue|pg||
nt|viren169: may get overboard here...|pg||
nt|werge: The 3 Jacks are all doubtful persons|pg||
nt|athene: east can't really not bid a slam now with AAA @HQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mccormac: fit jump shows @s support and a good suit as well|pg||
nt|april7: now they are on the way to 6|pg||
nt|werge: Close to a fifty-fifty game|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Tx walters|pg||
nt|serhat: and they will probably bid 6h as well. not going very well for Callaghan so far|pg||
nt|viren169: steady!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like it was a foul board, so no result entered. I don't know the details|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: this is a flat board|pg||
nt|raghavan: Here he will make 5 finessing CK and playing towards SQ|pg||
nt|mccormac: might play to ruff a @c the lead and finesse @s |pg||
nt|jbgood: de Botton i NT contracts at both tables - 2 NT in the OR and 1 NT here. How many can they get combined?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: West did well to pass rather than compete to 3@S|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a good defensive hand |pg||
nt|jbgood: why not 3@d I wonder|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the 800 to follow|pg||
nt|skjaeran: -2?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mccormac: as we can see the @s 10 it looks easy for us, but would imagine they are thinking of 4-1 breaks or where is the 10 |pg||
nt|mccormac: Always worth your while to take your time at start of hand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a small @s towards @sQJx|pg||
nt|mccormac: my teacher always said a minute at the start saves you 5 at the end |pg||
nt|werge: Spectators told me, that 4 @H went down, where 3 NT made here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|werge: Even 5 @H need lost of luck - good board for Vriend (my friend)|pg||
nt|raghavan: chance to show both minor suit controls|pg||
nt|werge: Even 3 @H can be defeated by the @D-ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: and can go down in 3 on a di lead |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this should be -1, after the easy @D shift|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rado: 3@H should sound as better hand and shape 5341, naybe|pg||
nt|jbgood: thank you all, congrats to Lavazza, have to leave you now:)|pg||
nt|skjaeran: One at each table?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Walter - ur pet Spades again|pg||
nt|werge: in OR West was declarer, but South found the best lead anyway!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbgood: bye|pg||
nt|viren169: too late... last 2 boards are gonna be exciting...|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 4@C avoided the diamond lead disaster against 6|pg||
nt|april7: to late to stop!!!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg: i'm surprised South never showed spade support .. but very much a style question|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a somewhat eccentric lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: cannot stop 6|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|werge: I repeat: East has a POOR 1 NT (15-17)|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Spade switch.|pg||
nt|skjaeran: To remove entry to the clubs.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but how does she know?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Det er ganske vist|pg||
nt|jbgood: if you play 4@h as 18-19 and balanced - would you continue then on the E cards, Walter? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: sry private|pg||
pc|c6|nt|raghavan: Since S has not lead D, it means one of the top D is with N so all other points must be with S(Vul bidding)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: good point|pg||
nt|serhat: Spec told me they bid 6h|pg||
nt|viren169: 4333 shapes are not good for tricks!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mccormac: another @s beats this |pg||
nt|skjaeran: Well, what else is there?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|wwalter: could make 6 if N dose play low on the @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was not the best play!|pg||
nt|athene: east's hand doesn't have playing strength but she does have a great hand facing a shapely hand (2-suiter for instance)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 0h????|pg||
nt|jbgood: Sill also agrees (Sill = Sælensminde)|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|raghavan: goes down 1 or 2?|pg||
nt|wwalter: I tald before, was void in the opener, no reson to bid furder, in a 4-4 fit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: might stop now because of no kings|pg||
nt|skjaeran: -3 in CR. Last nail in the coffin.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|viren169: AM needs to produce some magic now! |pg||

pc|s3|nt|raghavan: Thanks Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and one player had 11, another 14 cards. But how they can find out about that in the middle of a hand is a mystery to me. You are supposed to count your cards|pg||

nt|wwalter: again TD 4 the 2@h bid? :)|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|viren169: need to bring this in for a small loss overall...|pg||
nt|athene: might drop the club now|pg||
nt|werge: They needed 3 NT RD to win, making 10 tricks - but who should double?|pg||
nt|sybarra: in our room, the declarer was S and received a @S lead, then guess @C's  and made 3 nt |pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: not so much because west needs it for 1@S (he surely bids 1@S there without it)|pg||
nt|athene: but because east might have a 1@H opener with it|pg||
nt|athene: depends on the stray diamond honours|pg||
nt|viren169: should get the @C right now...|pg||
nt|viren169: AM needs something for his overcall after all!|pg||
nt|athene: naaa, why does he need anything?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C  (if guessed right)  3 @S and 2 @D |pg||
nt|viren169: because he is dealt them sometimes!|pg||
nt|werge: If an overcall needed something, West would not have overcalled|pg||
nt|athene: i am absolutely convinced West wld have bid 1@S there without the @CQ - in fact he wld be even more eager to do so|pg||
nt|werge: Agree|pg||
nt|athene: since he wld be even more certain opps had a game on|pg||
nt|jbgood: N rates to have 4 spades and 5 diamonds - else he would have skipped the diamond bid - so i think W shaould have put up the ace and return @c jack. Difficult though|pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: maybe not!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rado: since too many kibs argue about @s Q, we may hope that a reigning Bermuda Bowl champion may find it:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: play low H?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|viren169: my money is on getting the @Cs right!|pg||
nt|jstokes: no everyone would skip the diamond with a game-going hand, though|pg||
nt|jbgood: no more luck needed by NS in this match, Harald, but they might pray for some in the final! |pg||
pc|c9|nt|werge: 1 @S is some sort of auto-pilote|pg||
nt|werge: 120 seems ok|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: I wasn't taught that, Dr. I was taught to bid Stayman with invitational+ values|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|paulg: Easier if you open 1@s, but that's not to everyone's taste|pg||
