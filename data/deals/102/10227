mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Could this be a mix up?!?!|pg||
nt|nickf: But the reason they are playing each other is that in the selection process for the round of 32 no-one else wanted to play either, so they were stuck with each other|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: Why would North want to pull the 1NT dbled?|pg||

nt|allanr44: The horrifying thought of south gaining the lead must be too hard to consider|pg||
nt|viren169: will play the K@D and hope something good happens in the club suit...|pg||
nt|nickf: not enough tricks even if the Q doesnt drop doubleton|pg||
nt|nickf: that would require 4 tricks in clusb|pg||
nt|allanr44: @SK42 not being a guaranteed a certain stopper|pg||
nt|nickf: and that requires QT9 to fall on the 1st round|pg||
nt|viren169: true but N will be endplayed to lead away from A of spades if they started off with Qxx of clubs... |pg||
