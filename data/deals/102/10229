mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|plateos: Welcome, this has been a bit of a monologue this far, and not a happy one :(|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharynr: I was just watching this hand in the other match....E-W had saved in 4@H!|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|plateos: 3@d X|pg||
nt|plateos: :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: South's @S too tempting to allow 2@H to buy the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Martin de Knijff|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi:)|pg||
nt|pale hose: Hi all|pg||
nt|plateos: I think S is systematically supposed to show the strong version but his hand does not look like a very stong @c any more.|pg||
nt|sharynr: how weak is 1@D response supposed to be?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|pale hose: 1D is 0-7|pg||
nt|vugraphzqm: 0-7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharynr: well then  he can't be blamed for flying into game then, I guess|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharynr: and the defense will have to be careful, i believe|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|plateos: Yes they were systematically in a bad place. Unfortunately from the Finnish point of view beating this needs concentration (decl cannot get out of dummy)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharynr: perhaps 2 rounds of @S to see it 10 drops...before playing a @C|pg||
nt|plateos: @h now gives declarer (atleast DD) chance by unblocking the 1H and then @d|pg||
nt|sharynr: Of course, easy to see that 2@C cashed followed by a @S exit will lock declarer in dummy|pg||
nt|sharynr: but much harder for West|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|nt|raghavan: Walter > will it be a partial in Spade?|pg||
nt|wwalter: probably|pg||

nt|ampelman: udca|pg||
nt|rado: kibs asking for previous board : 2@H was @C and forcing 1 round I suppose, and 4@H completed the picture |pg||
mb|3D|nt|thegarve:  the 1@h overcall suggests that he is East|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good afternoon to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||

nt|star6ija: this could be ade|pg||
nt|star6ija: made|pg||
nt|star6ija: without playing trumps at all|pg||
nt|xenya: in OR, W did overcall|pg||
nt|rado: standart pup Stayman, 3@D= have Major, 3@H showing @S|pg||
nt|paulg: De Botton should perhaps double 3@h to show some values, as she has already denied a penalty double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H is bold|pg||
nt|serhat: David is abit agresive here|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@h does take away the stopper asking bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: the 1Nt is limited to 16|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: the 'transfer route' one way to go about those north shapes ...|pg||
nt|paulg: which would have been Janet's call I think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: 8 or 9 tricks with the spades 3-3 |pg||
nt|serhat: 100 is okay after all for NS|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: possible but might not be easy -- it's a complex hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes defenders should play trump immediately after taking @C trick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: many play it with 5-5|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: probably 9, if E reads W's @D return as a singleton|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwi_joker: ..smolen another way to deal with them|pg||

pc|h2|pg||

nt|haans: simple finesse in spade and its a make|pg||

nt|sharynr: no game appears to make here, but there will be a bidding battle I predict|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sharynr: but it usually takes a while before opps figure out they have so many trumps, by then you can possibly scramble|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pale hose: this is really the problem with the two way swedish club. When opponents overcall in the 3 level you are squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: sorry, meant in private|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|thegarve:  lol - about their men?l|pg||
nt|ampelman: 5@dX from South that is|pg||
nt|ampelman: in 12 Open room|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: maybe get there (3NT) via 2 S, 2H, 2 D, 3 C tricks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: 3@H?|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Martin, Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: ok 12 toptricks in 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: mosian fit in 4@S?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|thegarve:  hi Paul, you didn't make it either|pg||
nt|jbgood: a disaster in the OR where the Brogelands bit to the 5 level without being pushed - and went down|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: interesting, NS can make 10 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a heart stop, partner, do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, true of course, Peter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: defence must have slipped on bd 2 in Open room to allow 3Nt thru ..seemingly 4 hearts and that offside club king to lose|pg||
nt|jbgood: bid even|pg||
nt|serhat: nice 4h here if they can bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: He made it to the pc at home I guess|pg||
nt|raghavan: and what was the result Bd 12 - or still playing?|pg||
nt|ampelman: still playing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubtful now|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: referring to the last board|pg||
nt|j li: 4M looks easy on E/W, until both majors break 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: seems likr flat board|pg||
nt|paulg: i'm going to Washington instead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: no now I see it ...defence cant untangle their 4 heart tricks (bd 2)|pg||
nt|haans: its a long way to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ampelman: the current rank of Erichsen is 27 and Gladiators rank is 29|pg||
nt|jbgood: wonder why E didnt double 2 spades|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ampelman: the first 27 qualify for the K.O. round|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by E|pg||
nt|rado: N was brave to bid vulnerable 2@S in "sandwich"|pg||
nt|serhat: this will also make with careful play|pg||
nt|paulg: a club lead would probably beat this, but no problem on a heart lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: board 1 entered - thanks operator|pg||
nt|pelu: lazy bid by East|pg||
nt|pelu: from kibs: 13 tricks in 1H!|pg||
nt|xenya: very|pg||
pc|h5|nt|star6ija: unless @s return after winning the @c lead|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a decent slam in 6@d - ruff @s out and try @H finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D is negativ, but 4@S = let go to next board :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@S bid in OR|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: Tislevoll is a very international team: Norway-Phillipines + Australia-New Zealand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: So this will be abig tense fight|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|ampelman: 5@dX on 12 went 3 off|pg||
nt|j li: If the defense tries for a spade ruff after @HA, that will pick the trump position for declarer|pg||
nt|jbgood: in retrospective a double of 2 spades may of course be for penalty|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yep|pg||
nt|rado: with favourable @H and @C E will make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg: and no reason for Stern to lead a club (and every reason not to)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|bebechira: the Brogelands bid all the way to 7NT on 17|pg||
nt|jbgood: ooops - now should make|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: now @s back|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg: a lucky escape for E/W|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwi_joker: arnolds can prevent there being 2 entries to the south hand (lucky 9@D entry), by not covering @DQ, as here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: good defense this far|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: Presumably 3NT=balanced 13-15, but it is a bit of a blunderbuss of a bid |pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: so only 9 tricks on a @S return|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|serhat: 4s is always ok even after C lead|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|star6ija: and new tie|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|pale hose: not unlikely they will end up in 4N here|pg||

nt|raghavan: WC Hedy|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: good slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 6@C and 6@D are very good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet North bids 3@H over 1@H next door|pg||
nt|paulg: play in 6@d looks interesting, perhaps try for @sQ or @cJ dropping before playing the @hA onside|pg||
nt|ampelman: 2N opening is 21-22 here|pg||
nt|raghavan: I hope NS stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: only part-scores available here|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - the grand was on a finesse |pg||
nt|serhat: but W had a better bid I believe .. instead of 4s|pg||
mb|1N|an|WEAK|nt|raghavan: I hope being Vul, NS does not try sacrifice in 6S|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sorry - lost connection|pg||
mb|2C|an|MAJORS|nt|vugraphzku: it is only 6 down :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 5 down sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@s are possible for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: surely EW must have machinery to handle very strong hands, apart from bidding game directly|pg||
nt|rado: now both 4Major for EW with cheap sacrifies in @D for NS|pg||
nt|rado: ooops sorry 3@C and 1@D at 4M|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS have the highest contract: 4 @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks hard to avoid 3NT here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|raghavan: WC Malik may be but depends on a dinesse od DQ and droping CQ -|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: so it doesnt look like good sacrifise except against the grand :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C enterprising|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: imps flying about|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@c puppet stayman|pg||
nt|j li: So far the boards haven´t been too exciting, and this is no exception|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS ending up in 2H is about best|pg||
nt|rado: but normaly when vulnerable EW will bid quickly to 4@H and opponents may go to level 5|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 4@h one down (di lead and club return) is a good save:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: on finesse of DQ+drop CQ|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@d = 1 4Major|pg||
nt|paulg: 3NT is okay if East leads her better major|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but impossible to stop that low i think|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: the 4@H was lucky : no losers on 6-1 missing the Q|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@s = I have 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: yes I hope they dont against 6C|pg||
nt|wwalter: no Q found @@ the other Ttable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|raghavan: Does south bids show long S and 4 in H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 1@H is @S or mm|pg||
nt|xenya: however they managed something like that on 12|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: W thinking??|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: yes he is|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx |pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes an extra bow|pg||
nt|rado: we see all 52 cards, players only 13 or 26|pg||
nt|paulg: Now Janet has to put her hand down as dummy :)|pg||
nt|paulg: to general amusement I expect|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 91 teams entered the Mixed Teams. We are now down to 16. Losers are eliminated, winners advance to the quarter-finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|serhat: not a very good save when 3nt is down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: with 11 against a1C precision w should think of hame esp in C is it 5 or 6-|pg||
nt|j li: I expect a diamond lead|pg||
nt|j li: and eleven tricks|pg||
nt|haans: suprise i though @H were lost |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ampelman: 10 tricks ?|pg||
nt|j li: Ten tricks, if East switches to a heart in time|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@C only down 1 = 3IMP for Norway|pg||
nt|thegarve:  could cash a@c first|pg||

nt|rado: yours are too optimistic Jon:) do you know who is who EW?|pg||
nt|serhat: which one is good Paul:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows NS will have normal 3NT-type values, so he can work out East can't have much - may have bid 4@H as a save|pg||
pc|d8|nt|raghavan: If S passed - would have been good score for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always feel that you have to be active earlier with the North hand |pg||
nt|star6ija: still no way to make it|pg||
nt|raghavan: +1D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|raghavan: Walter and MOm what were we talking about sacrifice????|pg||
nt|wwalter: I did not consider any sacrifice :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thought of 6, Mom thought of 7 in Clubs|pg||
nt|wwalter: with the open cards I would claim 7 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: there is a short break|pg||
nt|wwalter: in minors, ofcouse :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Walter > will Spade force creat problem for declarer?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Here also probably making 2H|pg||
nt|xenya: S has an ideal hand for garbage stayman |pg||
nt|j li: no, always ten tricks, you are right|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2H +1D may be losers|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: the @C-layout very friendly for decl. - all way = 5 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jbgood: I have been told that the men are N and W - but think I have seen men also sitting E (difficult for me to see them clearly from here)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wwalter: he needs to find the Qs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: although perhaps nothing is ideal - but if opps go to 3@D, you are kippered |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, North might well have called 1NT there. Then it was up to south to judge to remove that to 2@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: this was a bidding contest where all agreed that 2 down was better than 1 down:)'|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|raghavan: trouble for declarer|pg||
nt|raghavan: may go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: now he is thinking|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: does show extra in my book|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which may turn out to be quite a profitable one|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently I lose my bet - well, nothing new there|pg||
nt|xenya: no chance really on a @H return now, but it will be 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: and a a 2-imp gain|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wwalter: if he plays 4 -2 the @c :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: now he should be home :)|pg||

pc|hK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sunil|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|star6ija: only 1 down - 2 IMPs for Indemini|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|rado: vulnerable vs not often produces such overbiddings, everybody whants to add a little to the bids:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: worked out nicely here|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|raghavan: curtains|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|raghavan: throw D?|pg||
nt|paulg: one reason to bid 4@h is that you know partner is almost certainly leading the wrong major|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Some play that a redouble by North shows a heart honour.  |pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Sunil|pg||
nt|xenya: though 1N is even better|pg||
nt|ampelman: Erichsen made 3N in open room with the help of @s4-4 when south played 3@c+1 in this room|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H opening|pg||
nt|rado: and all started from a modes lead directing 3@D bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: so the 3 @d bid actually backfired..|pg||
nt|rado: will W risk opnenig now?|pg||
nt|paulg: a good partner will say, "well done partner, i was leading a spade"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, if South was to declare 3NT, it would be a good hand for the NT trick 1 signals outlined in Sabine Auken's book|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 3@c from North?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  its a league format I guess - must check exactly how many get through|pg||
nt|j li: On a good day E/W will bid and make 6@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: sry misunderstanding of the deal's No|pg||
nt|raghavan: Walter > 1 H shows Spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR: NS in 3@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course it was just a coincidence that 4@h would fail - so in  principle 5@d was a good save. And i guess the old cliche will pop up again when people speak of the board: the ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5-level belongs to the opps....|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: must be support redouble|pg||
nt|haans: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: a lot of people play 4@C when there is nothing of value outside the trump suit. May as well have pard's tenaces led into!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Say West decides to lead @HA. East plays her lowest card, which shows either two or five  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|raghavan: NP Mom|pg||
nt|ampelman: 2@h, wow I really didn't expect that|pg||
nt|rado: nowadays it's extended to 6 level belong ....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: 4@S doomed on a club lead if they get there|pg||
nt|xenya: strong 1@C here?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: but East might bid 4NT now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and then EW go down instead of NS|pg||
nt|wolker28: i think here 1C strong club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so A,3,5,4 and EW run five heart tricks as easy as pie|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: 5 of minor is a good save|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i must confess i will bid 4 nt too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzku: they play inverted Majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's only a good save if 4@S makes|pg||

nt|plateos: Of course with @h ruffs there is (at least) 1 down in 2@s|pg||
nt|pale hose: looks like a very uneventful board this|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sharynr: the trick will be to stay out of slam missing AK of trumps!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sharynr: should west take action? was DBL not a bit dangerous?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pale hose: I guess could have taken a few detours if he had any ambitions|pg||
nt|pale hose: East|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|plateos: X with shortness in undid M is always a risk but he has the extra strength a plan to rebid NT (simply too much for direct 1NT)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharynr: how about if he had AKxxxx of @S, would he not just bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|sharynr: not that slam would be good....but|pg||
nt|pale hose: I wouldnt, but sure it could easily happen|pg||

nt|paulg: yes|pg||
nt|j li: infact, after the 2@H bid 6NT is a very fine contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: but not played|pg||
mb|1H|nt|raghavan: Yes I also feel 1 down|pg||
nt|ampelman: so the 2@h bid should have pushed EW to 6N|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 91 teams entered the Mixed Teams. We are now down to 32. Losers are eliminated, winners advance to the Round of 16 later today|pg||
mb|2H|an|SP + MINOR|nt|raghavan: down 2 - 1C+2D+1H =4|pg||
nt|paulg: hard to think of a friendly layout of the cards for North-South|pg||
nt|serhat: 4S is on.. I think NS will bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H-double?|pg||
nt|paulg: this auction could end anywhere|pg||
mb|2S|an|FIT|nt|mdgraham: declarer lost 2@D, 1@C and 1@H |pg||
nt|jbgood: some good results EW have come in - may be a match after all!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it might end in a double|pg||
nt|paulg: 2@s i think, good raise|pg||
nt|paulg: now 4@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: West will transfer to spades|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT is a good contract for EW, but the diamond layout is not friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  ii would have been cool to make 4@h|pg||
nt|j li: still, difficult to bid with only 29 hcp and two essentially balanced hands|pg||
nt|ampelman: this should end in 4@h I guess|pg||
nt|j li: yes, and only a low spade lead will trouble declarer|pg||
nt|ampelman: both black kings are placed favourably|pg||
mb|4S|nt|thegarve:  cashing both @h slightly precipitous|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as the cards lie, no difference between 3@C and 4@Ss|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@h = forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: May be tough to stop short of trouble!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and as expected, the OR is way behind|pg||
nt|rado: W has a reaosnable pass after 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  another thin slam|pg||
nt|paulg: it's actually repechage .. from the French "to go out fishing again"|pg||
nt|thegarve:  on the layout 6NT is best|pg||
nt|xenya: all very normal|pg||
nt|pelu: 26 also 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes, 3N is destined to fail...|pg||
nt|viren169: East may (should) pass this.|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead  dia finesse and then what?|pg||
nt|duccino: RUNNING SCORE AT: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=32|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sunsamvar: best for N/S to take their penlty|pg||
nt|lestergold: west with two bullets but nothing else of any value would have been best advised to pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: this rarely produces a game|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@D might not be very easy|pg||
nt|paulg: very disciplined bidding by everyone, especially E-W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: E did well not to double. |pg||
nt|paulg: playing 4-card majors helped to curb any excess zeal|pg||
nt|serhat: yes I wd dbl|pg||
nt|paulg: well, North did not have to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|serhat: at least for sp lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|raghavan: Closed room 4SX made by S here 3NT by ES !!! -|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3NT by EW|pg||
nt|wwalter: will be a 12 4 Vivi|pg||
nt|wwalter: or could be a 16 :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: e/w got away undbled|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: Russia does not want a negative in both rooms now|pg||
nt|pelu: good lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: need 6 @D-tricks + 2@H + 1@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Julius to bid 6NT on 29 points is difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: just refresh running scores now and then...|pg||
nt|serhat: now easy make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: oh dear on the way skywards to which unmakeable spot?|pg||
nt|paulg: if you trust West, which I would not recommend, then he should hold 1444 hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: dia finesse and then what singel K in clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: not the best lead... but N will find the heart switch when in with the @D|pg||
nt|viren169: Budkin should signal a dislike for @cs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: must confess having some difficulty in trying to understand the auction|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead -- an unbid suit on this kind of auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least they are playing in the best of their multitude of 4/3 fits|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the double helps South as it would be far more awkward if forced to bid as North|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Redouble is strange - normally first round control say Axx|pg||
nt|haans: i say this is a make fast dia finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|raghavan: Will S play H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|thegarve:  Pass seems normal - nothing to say|pg||
nt|paulg: are we slamming yet or just looking for the best game? Perhaps just trying to show @sHx|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: but now he cant ruff the 4. @H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|star6ija: flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: oh sorry -- @Ds were bid by E -- missed that|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am going for coffee|pg||
nt|thegarve:  pass and allow South to XX if wanting a semi-stop or bid 4m |pg||
nt|paulg: 6@h looks the best slam, at least you have some options in the play|pg||
nt|thegarve:  seems the Norwegains play  reverse - pass = 1/2 or full stop and xx = two/theree small. Unusual but highly playable if all play this way|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|nt|j li: all roads lead to 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|ampelman: due to the very friendly distribution all roads lead to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: the moment of truth!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: this contract looks like one off with a clubs 2 spades and 2hearts tolose|pg||
nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
nt|jbgood: she has 8 tricks, so the finesse in hearts was too dangerous|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i mean Swedes|pg||
nt|paulg: Will Helness lead @c10?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: all over!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|thegarve:  its when half your team play one way and half the other that agreements become doubtful|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|raghavan: May be making Sunil|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 1 off from here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: heather might have dumped the king there|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not with this def surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may well run the @D9 here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|raghavan: yes agreed|pg||
nt|serhat: hmm|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: an uptrick ..|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy for Mayantz|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: i meant that even if E hadn't bid @Ds, E should lead a red suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wwalter: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: W rather|pg||
nt|haans: no help from partner|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pelu: will S take the extra chance: @C to A and @C-ruff?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes she'll love the sight of KT@C|pg||
nt|paulg: the problem with that line is that you could not pick up @dQxxx|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: tough hand for defence|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|nt|kiwi_joker: North fails (understandably?) Bidding suggested a bunch of diamonds coming for decl.... and North saw spade lead misfire .. I think finding a low heart was not impossible|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: it appears he could have made it double dummy by winning 1st @D with the Ace (Queen drops), then ruffing 4th @H with the K and finessing trumps |pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o8|st||md|2SJ7652HK983D4CT63,ST94H4DQ972CK9752,SAQHAJT7652DA863C,SK83HQDKJT5CAQJ84|sv|o|nt|sharynr: the tie remains unbroken|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|sharynr: 3@H looks like the max for E-W but can they stop|pg||
nt|sharynr: South has a tough bid here|pg||
nt|pale hose: I like 2N|pg||
nt|plateos: Koistine Nyberg semm to have taken a phantom sacrifice, but it is not easy to beat 4@h|pg||
mb|3H|mb|5C|nt|sharynr: even guessing @D, still have to trump 2 of them|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|plateos: yes, but a @d lead, for example, is detrimental for defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: interesting final contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|plateos: They are lower, but in the wrong suit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pale hose: Östberg did not feel comfortable bidding anything else than a minor|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|plateos: Best defence is probably @h, @h and alwasy @h buit it is not that easy to see single dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharynr: he saw it ;)|pg||
nt|plateos: well done|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||

nt|raghavan: a part score contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: May be 1NT by N|pg||
nt|xenya: seems there's no other way to make it |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: as this is a knock-out, time beginning to run out for Budkin|pg||
nt|viren169: partscore hand now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT made on board 5 - spade lead|pg||
nt|serhat: unnecessary sp finese..|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  with no overcall 3-2 breaks become far more common than 4-1|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 14 boards|pg||
nt|viren169: Will East open in 3rd seat?|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 3 NT made 10 on 18 in the OR|pg||
nt|paulg: 19-point slam here |pg||
mb|1H|nt|raghavan: After 6 Boards the scores are level 13 each|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh 1NT by W!!!!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  with a 6313 you would see a WJO|pg||
nt|ampelman: 12-14|pg||
nt|j li: 3NT is down on a black suit lead|pg||
nt|ampelman: 5 Major possible|pg||
nt|haans: of course :)|pg||
nt|paulg: but pretty impossible to bid unless you have help|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: slam is quite poor here -- NS won't bid it here|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@c Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|ampelman: by North|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I guess 28 bds in match? Havent checked sorry|pg||
nt|viren169: yes you are right...|pg||
mb|3H|an|WEAK|nt|raghavan: You might have played against him in European championships|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's VERY double dummy :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but on the lead almost impossible to go on @DA|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: difficult for n/s to stay out of spade game hee|pg||
nt|haans: play by North|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wwalter: never been there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't think so :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes corrected|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 2 teams here both won their grupe|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3N denies any 4+ Major|pg||
nt|viren169: may get N/S too high... |pg||
nt|viren169: 2N now should end the auction...|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: unfrtunately as cards lie it looks like one off|pg||
nt|pelu: now N shy correct to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya:  even in 4@H, there might be some problems |pg||
nt|j li: even on a heart lead the defense has to time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: maybe 2H now, then North 2NT? Yes, too hugh|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: high|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: a slip of the tongue might help|pg||
nt|ampelman: @d are blocked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, the singleton diamond is rather useful|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: but it will of ocurse be a push|pg||
nt|haans: but a small winner|pg||
nt|viren169: South will push over 2N... |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: sure will ..hoping for 5 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N by South seems enough with that hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 4@h made on 19 - looks as if it is all over now|pg||
nt|rado: agresive 2@S fit ( 3334 and dubious K@H)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: the only good news as in the club suit|pg||
nt|pelu: a weak hand with 5 card major sh be played in major!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|raghavan: going towards slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not often that you can make 7 tricks in nt with 19 pts and no 5 card suit|pg||
nt|pelu: also if pd only has 2 card in the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: perfect cards ... Roland of course would be considering the grand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: excellent point, Peter|pg||
pc|s4|nt|star6ija: 5 IMPs herbst|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract -- 4@H is cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: reverse the red queens and 4s is cold|pg||
nt|ampelman: well, but unblocking will be no problem|pg||
nt|viren169: 4333 dont produce many tricks!|pg||
nt|haans: none ever pass 2nt today '3nt was so close'|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|viren169: defence off to a great start...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this will be painful ..club, then heart thru....then..|pg||
nt|serhat: at least 4C harmless|pg||
mc|12|nt|raghavan: E could have shown club A - for EW good|pg||
pg||
qx|c9|st||md|3SAJ762HKQ5DT98C87,SKQT8HA63DQ432C92,S4H4DAK765CKJT654,S953HJT9872DJCAQ3|sv|e|nt|raghavan: Walter U were right - he made|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand and somewhat of a misfit too|pg||
nt|lestergold: the sort of hand that tends to poduce a swing|pg||
nt|xenya:  S played it very well |pg||
nt|viren169: Budlin of the mark!|pg||
nt|viren169: another p/s hand here|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D-2@D-x-p-"@S|pg||
nt|rado: how much @h from S now?|pg||
nt|paulg: harmless unless it helps them find a club save|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C by North would get 4@D by South - now jumping to 6@H not unreasonable |pg||
nt|serhat: exactly|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|WEAK|nt|star6ija: this looks like missed game by EW in the OR|pg||
nt|pelu: Norway missed 3Nt in board 15 (playing 3@C)|pg||
nt|xenya: just what W wants to hear|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like to show 6-4 as majors - if pd bid 2@S on a 3 card suit we play on 4-3 and not 6-2|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C for the majors|pg||
nt|raghavan: Julius - any further news from Open|pg||
nt|haans: not 2@D 21H|pg||
nt|serhat: huge hand|pg||
nt|serhat: after 3H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: hard reopening problem for E|pg||
nt|rado: too much honours and no bid available|pg||
nt|rado: partner may have for example Kxxxxx x xxx Kxx for an easy game|pg||
nt|jbgood: E has no good bid - cannot double with 2 spades, no good 2 NT either . pass a good alternative|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: was tuff< but he made :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 more deals let us see|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/ a minor part score n/s potential to get too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South not tempted opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ampelman: 1N = 6-11, 5-7 with 3@s this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: on the other hand, it might help to uncover a magic 5-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|rado: every bid might be right or wrong|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Callaghan will lose 10 imps for last board|pg||
mb|5D|nt|raghavan: passed hand X- S may bid 2S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: shd get to the @C game now|pg||
nt|j li: Even 2@S is in danger on a trump lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: at least|pg||
nt|pelu: now NS has problems |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht arises in his might|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: 4@h is very hard for defeating|pg||
nt|lestergold: now south couldnt come in warned of misfit by opening bid|pg||
nt|viren169: Will East reopen if it comes to them?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|viren169: the vul is wrong...|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: deal 8  down 2 in OR because of bidding system - N opened 1 D and S passed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 2@H is fourht suit forcing - the pitiful crutch|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: if Rd = ½ stopper S can bid 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: But N has extra strength|pg||
nt|jbgood: she landed on double - my last bid - even 2 NT better|pg||
nt|rado: well that's the worst|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Tor doesnt like this much...|pg||
nt|serhat: or 11?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: as a well-known author described it|pg||
nt|paulg: again the cards lie favourably for declarer|pg||
nt|ampelman: I can't see more than 8 tricks|pg||
nt|j li: This will go down unless the defense touches diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D-4@H-4@s and on we go|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes if he manages a H ruff|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|raghavan: solves headache for S|pg||
nt|pelu: 3x1H - and N will make - can set up the 9. trick in @C|pg||
nt|xenya: reasonable contract -- remains to make it|pg||
nt|paulg: @h2 for club switch|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: trump lead wants to prevent east ruffing his spade losers in dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C will not be a walk in the park!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzku: still he cant make 400 :)|pg||
nt|haans: why balance??? to get THEM to high|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done to E/W to push the opps|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|raghavan: Looks like going in for slam in C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not 4@S. I thought East would bid that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor save agianst 2@H, this|pg||
nt|paulg: the lack of spade bid opposite encouraged Stern|pg||
nt|serhat: after W passed abit agresive. but we dont know what they play 2nt from balancing|pg||
nt|paulg: i'd have opened his hand, rather than lie in wait|pg||
nt|mdgraham: me too|pg||
nt|serhat: I wd open too.. it would sort the problem out|pg||
nt|paulg: well, I realise it may create other problems :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: still, she has shown her hand well.|pg||
nt|raghavan: A good pass|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open room East played 3Nt very well - she had a @C-lead to the Q: First tryed for @SQx : taking @SAK - then @HAK hopiong for fall of !Q or 10: succed: @H10 and she set up a ...|pg||
nt|pelu: 1H-trick and 1D K onside = 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: Vriend are almost there|pg||
pc|d5|nt|raghavan: E has 3 diamond loser but can ruff 2 only - + a S loser|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not totally clear how to go about this|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: E would have done very well to reopen but was deterred by the unfavourable vulnarability perhaps |pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: develop H now|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer must be unhappy -- from his perspective, the contract is bound to fail|pg||
nt|rado: declarer will try to score 2 trumps|pg||
nt|jbgood: he might just manage that|pg||
nt|rado: kibs suggesting that if something to be bid it's 3@D - at least you have good trumps there:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: 5 IMPs for 2@H making (1NT -1) to Calandra|pg||
nt|xenya: he might even play a @H at some point in an attempt to endplay E|pg||
nt|xenya: he has no idea @Hs are 6-2 of course|pg||
nt|pelu: I feel with N!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer very lucky can now get out losing a only a club spade and heart thats if he sets up the clubs now|pg||
nt|serhat: now it is ugly|pg||
nt|paulg: @hKQ may prevent too much damage|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg: you now know that East has @cAQ for a vulnerable weak two in second seat|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: no im wrong nortth get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: oh|pg||
nt|ampelman: @d10 plays for @d9 short|pg||
nt|raghavan: If W does not cover may be he will get DQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wwalter: Vivi will win 4 sure now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the curse of scotland |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: and the stiff @SA didn't look too good either|pg||
nt|xenya: good news!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|raghavan: E has denied Spade control so west thought 6 may not make|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the websites leads to a number of errors - e.g. participants leads to an error message|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: the @DJ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: well only if south gives it to him|pg||
nt|pelu: if he take out 4X@D he have no entry for @C10|pg||
nt|jbgood: not any more though - rest belongs to the defense|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|raghavan: curtains|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: why spade discard|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: hard to follow it appears that south played declarer for 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the bulletins are not available either|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|jbgood: and Burn's rule    1 infringed: as declarer you should possess more trumps than the opps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|paulg: declarer will have a choice whether to finesse the diamond for 9 or 11 tricks, or just take 10|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: now he is down|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|dK|nt|pelu: it looked strange thatr Ferraro played @H8 in trick 1 - but that fixed declayer|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
mc|7|nt|paulg: poor timing from Stern, but you never know what'll happen at the other table|pg||

nt|wwalter: ty all 4 watching, nice job Momchil, ty Doc, wish U all a nice day|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: she did not :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: pity started wqiuth excellent defence|pg||
nt|pelu: last board|pg||
nt|xenya: note W's duck at trick 1 -- that kept declarer in the dark until the end|pg||
nt|j li: Last board for this match|pg||
nt|raghavan: Julius any news from Open room|pg||
nt|ampelman: current rank for Erichsen is 27 and 29 for Gladiator|pg||
nt|haans: long way to 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S on the lie of the cards... but not easy to bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, NS certainly won't expect to gain on the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: had W won with  the K and returned the suit, N would have certainly made it |pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  so pdf format is fine but not the web format|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzku: Thanks all |pg||
nt|pelu: 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  So Swedes mashed their neighbours and rivals this time|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: north will be thinking of a slam with this massive two suiter|pg||
nt|j li: Weber-Weber in the open room didn´t get to the thin 6NT in B16 either|pg||
nt|haans: 8 + 4432 ok for sayman|pg||
nt|viren169: pass or 2@C?|pg||
nt|rado: 3NT for NS now|pg||
nt|serhat: I sd have been only 300 really|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: i thank co commentator Mr walter, My closest friend Momchil, Important Kibits, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last board for this session|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2@H is fine with Qxx@s in your hand|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR - and also @H10 to 8 and @HQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a pity about the two club losers|pg||
nt|rado: but hard to bid wtih both opps action|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: WHY THIS x unneccessary|pg||
nt|wwalter: double is a good preempt against the slem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: dbl was showing points and 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: that's exciting|pg||
nt|haans: 8 with 4 card M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent lie of the cards - 3N makes EW|pg||
nt|serhat: Fawcett played trump before establising the side suit again|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: an anonymous contributor says 6@C is going down next door|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wwalter: only 1190 not 1440 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south with a double fit bidding a very conservative 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: as expected no club lead|pg||
nt|j li: East might have gambled a pass|pg||
nt|j li: 2@C is at least two off|pg||
nt|ampelman: Does anybody know what happens if there are 2 or more teams placed 27th ?|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit pushy... |pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: here we have a standard 4@S - but in the Open room Peter Fredin in West found the killing lead : @C7!|pg||
nt|raghavan: If HJ is played now, and N ducks, may be good for defense|pg||
nt|j li: Yes, good lead|pg||
nt|j li: Defense can take three aces and three ruffs now|pg||
nt|haans: such is bridge|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: last board and an exact tie -- few imps exchanged, too|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done to North for taking the bull by the horns!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: 2@C checkback. 2N=two hearts and a maximum|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: yes it went down. tough to make 12 tricks actually|pg||
nt|pelu: close correct card but wrong suit :)|pg||
nt|pelu: when u see AKQ by pd u like to bid 3@D! :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  34-4 now and can only increase|pg||
nt|xenya: the point is, did E also show a major 2-suiter or just @Hs? |pg||
nt|rado: E might have prefer 2@H instead 3@C with minimum 5-4 hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|raghavan: H5 |pg||
nt|viren169: South would surely have passed 3@S had North bid it. |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: even that lead didnt give away the contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: Ferraro: your partner dont like that bid :) - she knot how to defeat 2Nt!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sunsamvar: this is even tougher|pg||
nt|xenya: seems EW have lost control over the bidding|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@C was strong, but i'm not sure about 1N|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d4|pc|c7|nt|pelu: also a major 2-suiter|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|raghavan: This again - I wont play SK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: looks like transfer for @cs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wwalter: will be only 990|pg||
nt|star6ija: or accepted the hand as semi-balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt E and W will have a few words to say to each other after the hand is over|pg||
nt|star6ija: normally it is 2 down and 13 IMPs to Herbst|pg||
nt|pelu: @SA and a small @H!|pg||
nt|j li: Engels trumps are good enough to overruff dummy twice|pg||
nt|haans: but AQxx is a little extra|pg||
nt|viren169: South in the other room did bid 4 over 3@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: mind you in 6 there have may hav been a warning double or the view that the slam could only be defeated with the help of the club suit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The session times today are 10:00  12:30  15:00  17:30  CET|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|raghavan: seeing SAJ109 etc|pg||
nt|viren169: but has very little justification for it (unless they play 3@S forcing!)|pg||
