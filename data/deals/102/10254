pc|sA|nt|xenya: we start 10 minutes earlier than scheduled it seems|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|ady: surely east should not have bid n0-trump with no club stopper    give preference to diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcwla: I doubt E/W would have gotten overboard had they had the auction to themselves, but the competition allowed them to stay nice and low.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: if south doubles north can make a jump in spades to show some values|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Please do it now|pg||
nt|Walddk8: The open room operator did|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: mind you, I'm not sure that if you miss slam, that the spot to play is 3NT|pg||

nt|baardolav: and made... a great start for the Norwegian team|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|baardolav: Norway is 11.5 Vp ahead of Finland before this last round|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4S|mb|5S|mb|6S|nt|lestergold: par score battle here|pg||
nt|eggy: But the hearts line problem is that, if they don't come in, you have little extra chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i see ur point eggers|pg||
mb|7S|nt|lestergold: hm a conservative view that will certainly gain a plus score|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|baardolav: Belive Tundal will double this|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|mc|13|nt|lestergold: allowing opps to p-lay in their 3/2 fit!|pg||

nt|wwalter: but the same imps :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@h= to justify N's choice :)|pg||
nt|trotto: Ace of  trumps*|pg||

nt|don paulus: 5 now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wont encourage north to save|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pressure bid of 4@C opposite passed pd, well within Rule of 2-3-4 guidelines.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too many major suit losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c mandatory at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 3c at green|pg||
pc|c5|nt|charles_l: np grazie|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  can make  as A@C with North    but 5@C   the better contract|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: o course can bid 3n gambling if they play it to show this sort of preempt|pg||
