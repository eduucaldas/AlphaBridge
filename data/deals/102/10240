mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@C based on TRICKS here|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|mariner1: Kokish is S using 2@H that may be artificial to show extra count when next bid,,, it|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: west on lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: kickback would have helped here|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: off the rails now|pg||
nt|barnets: so he has two out of three chance to find it|pg||
nt|migry:  it usually is when u get to slam without 2 aces|pg||
nt|mariner1: Meckwell used big @c and so stopped in 4@H|pg||
nt|kareno: Wrong hand bid blackwood!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess Roy wanted to show a solid suit with 4@H, but Willenken also expected at least one more keycard|pg||
nt|barnets: I think zia might get the vibes they are off two aces|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm reminded that it was the late, great Sam Scaffidi of Mingo Junction, Ohio, who coauthored the Striped Tail Ape double with John Lowenthal.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H is the systemic rebid playing Kokish, but they may have a different agreement|pg||
nt|barnets: they already made a slam against him off 2 aces two matches ago|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes kibbers screaming for kickback here|pg||

nt|roswolf: they will regret it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s9|pg||

pc|h5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c6|nt|mariner1: Kickback is using 4@S as KeyCard|pg||
