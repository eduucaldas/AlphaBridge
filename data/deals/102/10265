mb|p|nt|davidstern: Transfe response - 1@H showed spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: 1NT showing 15-17??|pg||
nt|haans: more common soon than natural bidding|pg||
nt|kurtove: 9 tricks in spade will be normal, I think|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: Just about any lead OK here, but the contract should come home on power.|pg||
nt|don paulus: warming up board|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 easy tricks 3s dim  2c and a heart or maybe even heart suit set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: we start 10 minutes earlier than scheduled it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: the point is that the defence havent got a route to 7 tricks in any case|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|charles_l: OR in 5@cx by W|pg||
nt|wwalter: 5 or 4? :)|pg||

mb|d|nt|charles_l: he does not trust her 2nd seat red preempts|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead awkward here|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 board matches are cut throat - can't afford many bad boards|pg||

nt|don paulus: friendly lead :)|pg||
nt|ritong: par is reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: will decl find @DQ??????|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: @s now to be sure about makeing|pg||
nt|panja: the correct play now is a @S|pg||
nt|panja: to guarantee 3@H..|pg||
nt|panja: S must be hoping @H finesse is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not this lead!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some looks like tartan or muiderberg |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe you said that already) |pg||
nt|xenya: a 2-suiter, yes|pg||
nt|xenya:  does he have an ace, S is thinking|pg||
nt|kurtove: hard to find the 5 club now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kurtove: think so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: good move by north, the 6@h bid suggests 4or5 @hs and out|pg||
nt|kurtove: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: she is greedy :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as noted red vs white sacrifice but declarer hasnt found the @DQ yet but the double may steer him right|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well read by North|pg||
nt|haans: is 5@C good bridge??|pg||
nt|davidstern: Aand no double|pg||
nt|davidstern: Dont know about good bridge but -100 against possible +200 or more likely -790|pg||
nt|kurtove: is 1 club 3+ clubs|pg||
nt|kurtove: he knows that pd is short in spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is it clear that the third double is penalties|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: and rightly decides to stop in 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly safer than 3 nt  |pg||
nt|lestergold: on a spade lead it probably goes off|pg||
nt|kurtove: but its wery red|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: can get tangled up on the hand in 3 nt (imo) |pg||
nt|xenya: not really, Shirley -- 6 @Cs, 2@Ds and @HA -- at least|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: and might sneak a @S also |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: 2 spades 4 clubs and dim ace |pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, 6 hearts would make with the diamond break|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davidstern: I am guessing it is penalties but what can North sseriously believe they can do to 4@S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C is also quite safe|pg||
nt|ritong: the small danger is to see opponents bid seven @ss, but who does that in the dark|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: declarer would have to make inspired guess to put up Ks to make|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|davidstern: Claiming time|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||

nt|kurtove: 6 nt|pg||
nt|haans: i like 3@C 3rd hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|kurtove: and kqj10 in club|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4 of a major here after some interference by N/S probably.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 off for 500 n/s save some profit not the royal mint tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: neve wont be kept out|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: good board for England|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H  a great save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wwalter: she had 2@c+ 1@s as losers|pg||
nt|trotto: an be ,couse error of operator ,Joanna played ,in second trick , ce of  trumps ( and next @sQ) that's correct safety play|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the same imps :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@h= to justify N's choice :)|pg||
nt|trotto: Ace of  trumps*|pg||

nt|xenya: another 4@H for EW|pg||
nt|don paulus: 5 now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wont encourage north to save|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pressure bid of 4@C opposite passed pd, well within Rule of 2-3-4 guidelines.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too many major suit losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c mandatory at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 3c at green|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: np grazie|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: 3NT  can make  as A@C with North    but 5@C   the better contract|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: o course can bid 3n gambling if they play it to show this sort of preempt|pg||

nt|xenya: is there a sure line for 10 tricks here? |pg||
nt|henryb: sure? I don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean without seeing NS's cards of course|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho maybe not third in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: depend on style|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like claim will follow quickly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dcbutler: 9 tricks for declarer on any lead with this layout|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|charles_l: helpful|pg||

pc|hA|nt|panja: S did not seem to have any doubt|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR Reess opened the S hand 3@D, then 4@C by N -- E/W have been pushed to 5@S, a bridge too far.|pg||
nt|ady: west really has the hand for a suit contract  evedn if 2 tricks higher  good controls   but only 1 spade stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: since she clearly has a light opening|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|s3|nt|henryb: surely best to strip minors before playing a heart in case someone (particularly South) has a stiff @hA|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Maybe South's 2@C shows both majors, but West doesn't care|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|pelu: or dont know? - if opp alert 2@C u dont exp both majors .)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: We had a problem at the begin, they switched Open and Closed Room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
nt|ritong: danger zone entered|pg||
nt|ady: yes    too high now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcwla: But all in all, the auction could have been considerably worse.  This spot is reasonable if perhaps not ideal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he didnt know he would find partner with 100 honours in dims|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: this should be a useful swing to Neve|pg||
nt|kurtove: do they play 2 club as gf?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: S doesn't know that, of course -- from her perspectibe, contract mau be in real danger |pg||
nt|henryb: this is not worth a 15-17 1N (I do not know their range) and Jx is not a holding you particularly want to have as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5422 pattern  (yuck) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: the spot is ok its just the layout which is savage of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|ritong: hello G|pg||
nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: looks like I missed some action already|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, first boards swinged|pg||
nt|daman: this will swing too    doomed|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not neutral either, rite|pg||
nt|daman: aggressive bidding by West opposite a passed hand   will pay the price|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|xenya: sigh of relief from S|pg||
nt|xenya: now she will be quick to grab 11 i think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: In the OR W passed the 2@C rebid and Hinden went -2 for -200.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Leslie knows that preventing spade ruffs more important than worrying about trump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: in most natral systems the ability to show heart suit in  a weak hand would not exist|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: We dont know, but asume that West didnt know :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised to see they play 2@c as weak both majors as they are not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kurtove: 2 cl not GF|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: can claim that now|pg||
nt|lestergold: good defence|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: now the trump trick is still there!! and all the spades too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi yer  Bill|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of rebidding 1NT with the E hand.  Certainly reasonable to rebid 2@C (as both did) with nine cards in two suits, but 1NT would have worked like a charm here to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: allow E/W to drop dead in 2@H.|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 off also ?|pg||
nt|ady: 7@HX  on board 16 should have been a save against a vul 6@S making    but the contract in open room was 5@HX|pg||
nt|daman: East assumed a Drury stance with 3433  9 count    not clever|pg||
nt|ritong: well it saved some anyways|pg||
nt|ritong: which is the target of sacrifices:)|pg||
nt|daman: some of those targets are pretty small|pg||
nt|ady: turned out an 11 imp loss rather than a possible 12 imp gain|pg||
nt|daman: Barry Crane used to say....."Only Jesus saves..."|pg||
nt|kurtove: so it is a bit hurry to bid 4 h now, i think|pg||
nt|davidstern: One thing that has impressed me in these championships is the very large number of young people at this tournament|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|athene: West could bid 2@H natural non-forcing over 2@C as a passed hand, surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this could be flat with the defence taking 6 tricks unless endplayed which i think is do able now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb: not quite yet|pg||
pc|d3|nt|davidstern: Whenever I am in the corridors there are plenty of young players|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: Some rebid 1NT as a matter of course, some would do it if the stiff @S were an honor.  Matter of style.|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if east bids 6@S, Sabine had better lead the right ace!|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: the push to 5@H on the last cost 10 big ones|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brgpro: looks like 12 tricks in @s for E. why? well, you tend to lead from your short AK....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so Badger's on the board with 3.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 down how come i missed something obviously|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but not when west has shown hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: the vulnerability should deter EW from sacrificing|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Bergen now?|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d would a tad pushy|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!d|nt|athene: as he now surely will|pg||
nt|ritong: be*|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: ok - maybe he won't get the chance|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 4@s|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @H |pg||
nt|don paulus: ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The club layout might see this one home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here game to be bid but both 3n and 4h look precarious on thelayout|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So Bessis on the board|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|daman: I am getting some tea|pg||
nt|ritong: showing @ds and @ss|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s would be an egregious overbid|pg||
nt|ritong: bergen style not popular in france|pg||

nt|ritong: joli , G|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table North playing 3@D on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer shouldn't be given a chance to get a spade away from either hand on a long minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt must be lebesohl|pg||
nt|haans: leben|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3@H for me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow saly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hans you havent seen commentators manual Page 4 Paragraph 7 - we save bandwidth and do not correct minor typos|pg||
nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: May lose 1-2-2-1|pg||
nt|davidstern: For -2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if south didnt find a spade lead there is no way he wouldnt find the switch when in with Kc|pg||
nt|kurtove: if he entres the table|pg||
nt|davidstern: That lead looks helpful but if he puts up @CJ and finesses heart will prove a good lead|pg||

mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: that the screen partners on one side should be one lady and one gentleman|pg||

nt|davidstern: Indeed not|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find who should play 4@H|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||

pc|h5|nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but top @c ducked and then east is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: as it  turn o ut 2 hearts  or even 2@D  works better for n/s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: defence will hav e to do the right thing though|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: or 3rd|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: dont think can make now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: duck |pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|panja: dummy reversal is an attractive line, ruff 3 @D in Dummy|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes and lose a @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: in hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead on the go, might have done but who would do that?|pg||
nt|henryb: If she ducks, declarer can just ram @d down her throat|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in trumps are too good|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|don paulus: that would be 10 for badger|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|panja: @DA, @SQA..|pg||
nt|wwalter: the dummy has 1 @h losre, if the @h is not found|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think W shd take more blame|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H showed a strong slam try and demanded control-bid then 3@S didn't promise any extras|pg||
nt|brgpro: his 2@h rebid might not have shown 6|pg||
nt|athene: in which case maybe west should do more|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right.  Pressure at all times.|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons to come|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wwalter: is not so easy @@ the table, this is made by the great masters :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: well, count of not, the only play available is to drop @HJ or Q stiff in 7@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: OR 4@H by SOuth|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brgpro: and 3@s was sort of "on the way" cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: but if 3@H was only a mild slam try, then 3@S was showing west had a decent hand|pg||
nt|haans: 40 minutes late but still many specs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|charles_l: i only can when i am commentating, not at table :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|henryb: 7@c is a good contract and cold on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt likely to come home here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wwalter: most of us :)|pg||
nt|ritong: this will go fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  looks the best shot|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: 3@C super-accept|pg||
nt|panja: the bad break in @H will defeat this|pg||
nt|athene: there won't be much to go on regardigg @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: regarding|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: they will do well to bid 6 i think|pg||
nt|xenya: ah!|pg||
nt|henryb: a big chance for Hansen|pg||
nt|haans: @C and can go down|pg||
nt|haans: even with spades down possible|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dcbutler: good idea by south - can she make it?|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   showed I believe showed 5 hearts and 4 spades and forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: mrs hinden has a tough switch to make|pg||
nt|ritong: @d jack could slip |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
nt|davidstern: This could get ugly|pg||
nt|haans: does east  havbe @HK?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kurtove: thats a nice turn|pg||
nt|davidstern: Duck and a club ruff and another heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry club ruff and spade for -1|pg||
nt|haans: safer to play @HA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even if he wins this he can play a high spade honour they get a club ruff and then perhaps black suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|kurtove: its a problem to take the ace if east have the rest of the hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: So Heart Ace and seconbd trump then @SK win diamond ruff spade and ruff diamond and trump will nail West|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
nt|davidstern: oops|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: soade switch is awkward after cashing clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 13 precious IMPS back|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: defense needs to play spades|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
nt|ritong: well played by east, a @d and it was over, since west would certainly play a @d back|pg||
nt|ritong: now on the surface, west has to duck the @d K|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal defense at this level|pg||
nt|dcbutler: that doesn't help, does it?|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that will not help|pg||
nt|ady: should make now   with diamond position favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: she might play a @d from hand right now|pg||
nt|kurtove: he was thinking that east never would have turned hearts without the king|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
nt|kurtove: And I agree|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|athene: cash two clubs and then @HK and @H10 - even if you lose to east's @HQx, she may be endplayed anyway with @SA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: as far as inviting goes - conventional wisdom is that you don't want to play in the invitation very often, so you want partner to accept more often, i think?|pg||
nt|daman: nice|pg||

nt|sybarra: W has 2 importan cover cards |pg||
nt|sybarra: *important |pg||
nt|henryb: but no play for 6 unless S leads a diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: but likely k of @H or k of @C lead |pg||
nt|jcwla: 1 overtrick IMP to Neve there.|pg||
nt|ritong: bien joué joanna|pg||
nt|haans: who win contract pays out|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ci sei|pg||
nt|davidstern: OR playing 2@S here on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: coffee board coming up|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt would need a careful @C play..small to J first time|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, boring 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D opening, 1@H from sementa, 2@D - 2@H, 3@D - 3@H, 3@S - 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb: some danger of getting too high now, I would think|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brgpro: we just wait and say NEXT later|pg||
nt|pelu: EW bidding|pg||
nt|charles_l: same in 5@c though|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is wild :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: E has some fun|pg||
nt|wwalter: did E open?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting "but not forcing to game" |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|panja: good to try something different|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: N must XX?|pg||
nt|panja: W is not very tolerant though, he wants to have his say in the matter|pg||
nt|athene: pretty boring 3nt here with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be unlikely to sell out to 2@S sitting East|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D now perhaps all end|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D looks negative one except you are forced to play the @DA|pg||
nt|haans: singel K again :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb: even so, I think two aces is too mich opposite 2@c not to be trying for if not driving to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: again, W's pass looks timid|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||
nt|ady: likely tgo end 3NT   or 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT shows 22/23 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: payback time :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry my eyes did deceive me they were one board ahead of this table|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: that would be law going too far|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR declarer played a spade towards the queen to create the entry to take the losing diamond finesse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||
nt|wwalter: after this board will come a friendly chat on EW :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Hauge now leads the other semifinal 60-50 with (i think) 5 boards to compare|pg||
nt|ritong: 3Nt = i do not like @ss|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|daman: A @C will|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am going to back Michel to make this one|pg||
nt|kurtove: he may try to get entry on qsp, but will go -1 then|pg||
nt|haans: looks natural|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
nt|ady: lay down A@H    and 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||
nt|charles_l: lots down here|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is cold, but uptricks are heavy at that point  so she considers the best way to gather a max of tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: she might try leading @H9|pg||
nt|athene: or leading small to @H10|pg||
nt|athene: that still gives time to lead to @HK later|pg||
nt|wwalter: I hope the chairs will not fly :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment if you play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|don paulus: 1 @c strong - then ok|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb: Allix amazingly passive. I wonder what Neve would have done with the @dQ in addition|pg||
nt|athene: they probably play that you complete the transfer with any weak NT|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: hmm|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not this way but???|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: I win|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||
nt|athene: it gives up the legitimate play in the suit of @HQx / @HJx with east|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: this might give west time to get his long spade set up|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence take @CA, @S, three hearts|pg||
nt|haans: u sure do|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: the defence can actually stop declarer ducking a club into east's hand with certainty|pg||
nt|athene: west goes in with @CJ if declarer leads low from hand and east plays @C10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: but of course everything works for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: she may have a nasty moment but she can't go down :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she's thinking about discard|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|davidstern: With a spade through he would again have to cash the @DA|pg||

pc|hA|nt|athene: or perhaps 4+ hearts, forcing, á la Meckwell|pg||

nt|pelu: do u like the X from S? - 2@H or 2@S (Michael) in my book|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 5@C - strong @C-suit and no @Hs ?????|pg||
mb|5D|nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@s without @h lead|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that @D8 in trick 1 ask for @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: but will have to guess the position of @cA|pg||
mb|d|mb|5S|mb|d|nt|athene: 2@C not alerted so presumably improvisation|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@C natural or...?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D an underbid and 3nt not really very good|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but not alerted|pg||
nt|athene: actually i think a simple 3@D wld have been OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, nice Morton's Fork possibility here|pg||
nt|brgpro: seems there was an misunderstanding of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: by playing @c4 he set up "mortons fork" - if West take @CA the 2 discards - if not: the @C-trick go away|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather unfortunate...W has sort of "Nat" @hK lead...|pg||
nt|charles_l: S might suggest it over 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: but N bids 4@h|pg||
nt|wwalter: a manly bid :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: real men bid game :) (and try to make it)|pg||
nt|panja: not an easy lead, but @C is safe|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 22 the other room reached to high in 6 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *too |pg||
nt|jcwla: Should work like a charm here if natural.|pg||
nt|athene: but west perhaps just wants to stop the club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: he made LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: has there been a misunderstanding here? Sabine knows that 3NT isn't solid diamonds...|pg||
nt|haans: only brits play 5@C as slam invite|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that the X = @h + minor - so S has shown his hand!|pg||
nt|kurtove: diamond lead, ruff and small heart|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|charles_l: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|henryb: "The Fat Lady is Singing"|pg||
nt|ritong: north went for the practical bid|pg||
nt|ritong: a second cue wouldn t have scandalized me|pg||
nt|ady: north right gave up once south shows some heart values|pg||
nt|daman: has to duck 1 @H and maybe more|pg||
nt|daman: pitching @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding has maded it easy'er for N to play @Cj|pg||
nt|haans: and this was board 10 welcome back in 40 minutes! |pg||
pc|d2|nt|wwalter: 4 wich pair? :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: maybe will fines the @h :)|pg||

nt|brgpro: Bocchi thought pd denied @d control|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|wwalter: made|pg||
nt|wwalter: or not LOL|pg||
nt|charles_l: he may be preserving his options to misguess @h|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|brgpro: @c i meant|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2 x A from S - have a bet? :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: no|pg||

nt|charles_l: well if you bids em you has to makes em :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10|pg||
nt|panja: you must reciprocate after a gift..|pg||
