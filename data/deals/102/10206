nt|Walddk4: Good morning to David Carlisle|pg||

nt|rayhaa: hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|garnetts: This  could get a little competitive--with EW maybe competing to 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be feisty|pg||

nt|tsadek: hii ALL , Nigel ,Roland|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: i thought chile actually won|pg||
nt|beto: no ties this year as the carry over has 0.5 |pg||

nt|roswolf: i know hes 3rd in hand but i really dont like that call|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk4: 1@S showing diamonds. N-S play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|5H|nt|levix: lead C?|pg||

mb|6C|nt|rodal f: or @S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Rafa: last year was festival championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|Rafa: EW won last year the official pairs too|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: But agree at u. Attack from the cards u have|pg||
nt|levix: yes,sometimes,if weak hand, lead doubleton is not bad|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mostly anyway I agree at ure first. @C|pg||
nt|levix: still need guess DK,|pg||
nt|garnetts: It won't once South tried 2@H--|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Looks like a 3NTEW for me but problems can be on the line|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Strange lead. Waited @C from 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|granguru: GOOD STOP|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|rayhaa: it depends on agreement i guess|pg||
nt|rayhaa: u can bid 2@h as non forcing and X as neg or invitational or vice versa|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes to some extent--but in my case it would be qa choice--could start with either--except that a subsequent heart bid would not be forcing if I doubled first|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i suppose it might have kept e/w out of a spade partscore|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: this looks -1 or even 2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: pinpoint bidding, with the @SK not in opening bidder's hand|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|beto: nice stop although 4@S looks good in this bidding seeing only NS cards|pg||
nt|duschek: There are those who would have bid a direct 4@S holding South's cards, but perhaps the strong hearts persuaded him to be cautious|pg||

nt|garnetts: yes misplayed it having got it so right for most of the play :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w might get too high here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tsadek: when opp bid Trf bid like 1@C- @D=@H or 1@C-1@H=@S  DBL should be suit bid with some card|pg||
nt|nickf: good start by Buiajh vs one of the favourites.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|duschek: I wonder which type of hand was actually indicated by that 2@S jump overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C by south?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard cards bough for NS and EW|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nigel_k:  Maybe they just play double as takeout of the suits shown|pg||
nt|donatoru: hi all|pg||
nt|donatoru: i try to explain the Mihai's sys , they a my teammates actual vice-champs in Open Romanian Teams , coz i played very wrong the great finale :)|pg||

nt|othered1: Another flat AKA opposite an opening bid.  In last set those hands got to 1N|pg||
nt|granguru: 1951. Santiago, Chile. Players were Alfonso Agûero Antonio Carrasco Carlos Doren Jorge Guzman Antonio Herrera Jorge oVALLE Jorge Suarez and Julio Subercaseaux (founder of the main ...|pg||
nt|granguru: bridge Club in chile:Club Snatiago)|pg||
nt|nickf: I think North will bid game anyway.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And a and at the bidding|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: Admitted, here north has implied some length in pointed suits|pg||
nt|duschek: But then, perhaps not that attractive holding six to the ace-deuce and two doubleton queens on the side|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forgot to say Mi.   Ns play presision and EW polich club|pg||
nt|nickf: may be expecting 5 spades in the south hand.|pg||
nt|donatoru: en easy 3NT , coz Radu is a " white hand" and the clubs a 6-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|levix: lead the second suit of dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Silvia. Did S find the single @DK at E?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Who will stop at level 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: That passed as..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rayhaa: an relaxing 3NT|pg||
nt|donatoru: it will be a very close match , the both pairs a very strong|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|granguru: The tie was in Montevideo and Punta del Este in 1964|pg||
nt|othered1: west has to win second @C and shift to @H.  Not all that clear on auction|pg||
nt|donatoru: Radu Mihai is  1 in the Romanian top, and the ladyis  5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: wrong sided this contract, defense should be easy|pg||
nt|levix: ok,thx|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a lucky stop|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: no|pg||
nt|donatoru: some probs with the comunication , only 8 tricks in direct count , let's see|pg||
nt|donatoru: a good plan : @s-->K , and A@d , but was a fault in the defence , Geta played small @c |pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru: If my memory does not fail me they were Roberto Asriel Jorge Guzman esteban Casian Roberto Kaufman and Eric Simons|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphb1: see play|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes foolproof on this layout|pg||
pc|d2|nt|beto: need to duck clubs twice, but then defence has to manage to swith to a @H when west wins the 2nd club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When was the last time Brazil was not in a final?|pg||
nt|beto: i dont know roland|pg||
nt|granguru: The another winner was Argentina|pg||
nt|duschek: Will West overtake and shift to a heart? Not obvious - South could have quite a different high card distribution|pg||

nt|duschek: Did South have a tiny chance by leading the @D10, hoping to pin the singleton 9?|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Kit!|pg||
nt|othered1: some pretty good play so far, including the defense here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade finesse for down 1|pg||
nt|duschek: Duck a diamond for a make, say several kibitzers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not much chance that will work|pg||
nt|duschek: Except West still has a heart, sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: requires hearts 5-2 and probably a prior error|pg||
nt|beto: well on a @D duck defence can cash its @H|pg||
nt|duschek: At least I am not just quiet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it is indeed a legitimate chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't work here but it might have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if west had two hearts only he could play diamond king first round|pg||

nt|rodal f: Can be a hard fight NS vs EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug can help:)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|garnetts: West can get quite close to making 3NT I think but 4@S looks like losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult to predict the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rayhaa: another 4@s borderline|pg||
nt|donatoru: aginst double is KQJxx vs 1098x:)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: West is going to like his hand a lot|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT is a lucky make here with a spade guess|pg||
nt|nickf: Support double from South, showing 3 spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may also consider 4S game now after the diamond bid by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi arifin|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: At pess there came an auto 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: two cues and a signoff|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have as I see it. 5@C on a finding at @D and EW 9 in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But a good spot for 4@S+1 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'm not so sure about the signoff part|pg||
nt|Rafa: Other room play has stopped, Lucena called the director|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard choice for North but 2H is pessimistic|pg||
nt|rayhaa: might have tried 3@h hoping for 3NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: well a not much extra 4H|pg||
nt|duschek: 4 so-called losers in East - will he stop?|pg||
nt|kit: East has easy pass -- he already forced to game|pg||
nt|beto: he should|pg||
nt|beto: @D are not that good and he already splintered to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he certainly could have more for splinter|pg||

nt|levix: too aggressive|pg||
nt|rodal f: I feltthe whole time fore a re opening NS for fight. Did not need that.|pg||
nt|nickf: it was, I wonder what his options were?|pg||
nt|nickf: XX to show a maximum pass?|pg||
nt|nickf: 2NT perhaps to show 4S and just 2H ?|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|nickf: neither had a great hand|pg||
nt|donatoru: 1NT will be bid in few seconds:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nigel_k:  No and without 3-3 hearts they would be better off in a partscore|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@D at w?|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: 2 balanced 12 count|pg||
nt|donatoru: pass all with small @d lead 4-th best|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: EW have to be careful if defending a spade game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: they will stop below game|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@H shows 4+@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting |pg||
nt|nickf: But West will know what to do.|pg||
nt|donatoru: :) my dear parts :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|beto: dont think they will stop...|pg||
nt|nickf: and Lavazza did bid and make the 4-3 spade game on 5|pg||
nt|nickf: either West or North could be thinking here, I think the operator puts in 2 bids at a time.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru: or exactly 4 I believe|pg||
nt|kit: and the 1@S call probably shows exactly 3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Heavy 2@S|pg||
nt|rayhaa: looks like problems with connection between tables, so score in film is wrong|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lite 3@H |pg||
nt|ahalim: and a lot of tricks w/o a @H lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nickf: was that 5C by North or East ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|beto: well, they did|pg||
nt|duschek: Or could show a small balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it also is usually dead minimum|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|donatoru: hard work for the both : declarer and defence , i bet 5 ttricks for e-w , + 200 Romania|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|kit: Takes a lot of courage to stop at 2NT vulnerable -- a fine line to walk|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east could have a no trick 12 count|pg||
nt|duschek: Seems to make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|kit: and this time it looks like they were wrong|pg||
nt|granguru: agree but e has minimum minimum and 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is up to opener with anything extra|pg||
nt|kit: those 10's have a way of adding up on hand's such as these|pg||
nt|beto: i cw seen to many agressive openings by paca and ben|pg||
nt|duschek: There are three very valuable tens which they forgot to include in their HCP count|pg||
nt|beto: so here is where they pay the price for opening 10 and 11 counts|pg||
nt|levix: 3s good stop,but still down|pg||
nt|nickf: well 5m would have been a phantom save against 4S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Was it right by W to press on?|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see an opening in E and 2@S fin|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: we had openning from N without comment on table|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: even so doubt this is much over 30%|pg||
nt|beto: really?|pg||
nt|beto: wow|pg||
nt|kit: my general philosophy is:  If I don't accept a game invitation, it is because I think we may be too high already|pg||
nt|beto: argetnina reached 6@H and the @SA was lead on board 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: But I can not se Batov bidding @S after pards minor bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: I really dislike West's actions--if he consults partner they can defend 3@H which where they belong |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: And Panev are a gooooood player|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT by those atone 15 at W? I would have upgraded them or made it the line under. 1@D and later bid|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: well try it on a club lead|pg||
nt|granguru: this is board 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: atone was stone|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: In white the line always are easyer at HP|pg||
nt|donatoru: the best return is small @d , but impossibile in real life , Geta thinks that Radi is A@d sgltn |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 5|pg||
nt|beto: sry board 5|pg||
nt|levix: no middle cards,or 3nt makeable for e-w,|pg||
nt|rodal f: Def to hard for N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Rafa: other room board 5 6@h E @SA lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Rafa: This is the last segment of the Open Teams Finals, 59th. Southamerican Championship|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|rayhaa: thk x better than 3@h, than maybe S wld play something else than @h lead|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is better--then so is redouble initially--then you can bid 2@S and go to sleep |pg||
nt|garnetts: east will now lose five more tricks|pg||
nt|donatoru: now lady is near the home :|pg||
nt|donatoru: )|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Rafa: We are broadcasting from the Sheraton Hotel in Santiago de Chile|pg||
nt|beto: In the ladies match brazil is trailing by 4 against argentina with 16 to go i was told|pg||
nt|granguru: The never ending discusion..to lead or not to lead an A against a slam|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Not easy to see, but often it's right to drive at the road u have fond.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||

pc|hT|nt|rodal f: So 3@S was??????????? and fin|pg||

pc|c3|nt|Rafa: Live with the two tables in screen at the O'higgins ball room with live commentary by Eduardo Scanavino, Maestro Argentino|pg||
nt|granguru: On the last round @SA gave the slam up...this time it beats it|pg||
nt|Rafa: This show can be viewed at the hotel rooms via TV too|pg||
nt|duschek: So with 11 boards to go it's Chile by 34 - Argentina need to bid and make this one|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe xx shows a shortage in spades --but if it does they need more method |pg||

nt|roswolf: in fact all the tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: another partscore|pg||
nt|ahalim: i told you so :)|pg||
nt|donatoru: a nice game with 18 points , let's see the wild pair Mihai in auction :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|nickf: looks like a normal 3NT down 1 on a club lead|pg||
nt|rayhaa: I thk Kopstads 3@s just was indiciplined  :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|granguru: Brazil women entered this round (2 remaining) with 2 IMps ahead of Argentina|pg||
nt|levix: other table opened 1h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here we might are at dynamit|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: Very aggressive 1@C, or rather, excessive|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Ended slowly|pg||
nt|rodal f: By loosers. Only by loosers EW have 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: End for EW at 2@S|pg||
nt|nickf: not anymore though.|pg||
mb|d|nt|nickf: Lavazza is in 3NT next door NS, so here's a chance for a pickup for Buaijh|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: light 3rd seat opening -- may propel E-W to 4S, which I don't think they can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north is trying to make something happen with that 1@C semi-psych opening|pg||
nt|Rafa: 500 people from the audience saying hi from here |pg||
nt|beto: i think he did|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|donatoru: 2@s too conservative bid , 1NT is semiforcing here , 3@s is weak, 2@h is constructive raise , whihc is best bid ?|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3@c from Geta after 2@s i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: in @H best|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nickf: I agree with 3D, looks like the cards are poorly placed.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well if he thought 2@S was right then 3@S is clearly wrong in view of the third seat opening|pg||
nt|donatoru: ouuf|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We beat that number Rafa, 800 in this room :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But hi back to all of you in Santiago|pg||
nt|kit: This is even less likely to make|pg||
nt|Rafa: :) but you can't make "the wave" as we are doing here|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C are 9 or 10 but 5 are down|pg||
nt|rayhaa: what is Norths RD, just showing a honor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We can try|pg||
nt|levix: luck to click out HQJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be all from 8 til 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive 9+|pg||
nt|levix: better to erect D suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: A lot of cards NS, but there end are low|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might 3NT was better|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably |pg||
nt|garnetts: This looks like one off after the lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: unless a pass from east suggested defending 1@S I absolutely loath 2@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure it should show six|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I guess 11C did stir something up|pg||
nt|beto: har dto get to 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|othered1: !@C|pg||
nt|duschek: Also quite aggressive by East - 13 HCP with no intermediates, and any finesses but in hearts through the weak hand|pg||
nt|beto: agee ed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Rafa: many kibs sent me this:         |pg||
pc|s3|nt|granguru: Chile has the highest gap in the whole match now 34 IMPs|pg||
nt|Rafa: nice wave!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: /////\\\\\\\\/////////////\\\\\\\\//////////\\\\\\\\\\\   thanks to HedyG|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why? Need a @S ruff|pg||
nt|rayhaa: yes def, strange pass to see what happens|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: top spade lead ok here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: oops |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|beto: the gap will narrow sson as argentina is in 3N board 6, same lead as this room|pg||
nt|duschek: They missed a game at board 6 - they are certainly not going to miss two in a row, may be their philosophy|pg||
nt|kit: looks like declarer is getting the spades right, but I don't think that will get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: No. 4@H will run home|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahalim: yes but the @S 8 will then be a stopper|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|beto: dont even to 8 kit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: But best def are to do. Play trumh|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|beto: defence is in the right track|pg||
nt|kit: defense doing very well -- now may get 2 club tricks set up before ace of spades dislodged|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|nickf: as a spectator points out, the key to the hand is to endplay East by leading a H to the 9 in the endgame|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|donatoru: a catastrophic score for Romania, a take-out passed in the Open,2 conservative bids in the closed and 21-2|pg||

nt|kit: squeeze position can't really exist, and I think declarer realizes that|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes |pg||
nt|rodal f: But Batov are a bit afraid by his way of ruffing|pg||

nt|rodal f: Def a bit bad there|pg||
nt|garnetts: It was true that NS could make 4@S with a 3-3 spade break and a 3-2 club break but they will never be able to bid|pg||

nt|Walddk7: 96 teams entered the Mixed Teams. They are divided into 16 groups of 6|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kit: Some might overall the 4-card suit here|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|levix: will N lead doubleton?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass is forcing |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nickf: Well next door bocchi had a chance in the endgame to make 3NT but he didnt make the winning play|pg||
nt|garnetts: It also suggests that North should bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: The overcall works well, as 1NT is cold and 2@S has chances|pg||
nt|othered1: good lead|pg||
nt|beto: yes, very nice leaf|pg||
nt|beto: lead|pg||
nt|granguru: he he|pg||
nt|granguru: avoids a @c ruff|pg||

nt|rodal f: We already see the result but 12 might was hard|pg||
nt|rayhaa: lucky @d J10, so 5@h makes|pg||
nt|donatoru: nothing to play a flat board|pg||

pc|d8|nt|donatoru: only a thin slam or a pushed game can save our souls :) |pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru: wise comment Kit|pg||
nt|levix: no overtrick with this lead|pg||
nt|nickf: easier when we see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: declarer might still make by setting up hearts, discarding a club on third heart rather than ruffing it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Well Lerfald. I missed at my quick analyce|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Clasic one|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: If that was a strong club and north showed 5-7 then pass is surely forcing--if it wasn't a strong club then South must act|pg||
pc|sA|nt|olerfald: small C now |pg||
nt|rodal f: How many tricks at 1NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: It would have been the best Y|pg||

nt|kit: I think he will lead a heart and pitch a club|pg||
nt|beto: he will only get 3 more tricks now|pg||

mb|p|nt|duschek: No alternative to the spade lead, so this hand is over quickly|pg||
nt|kit: Pretty hard to stay out of 3NT, even if N-S had methods where North could show his shape|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|kit: East will play 9 at trick 1, and b shocked when it holds|pg||
mb|5C|an| |nt|nickf: there's too much duplication in hearts for starters.|pg||
mb|p|nt|donatoru: Mama mia , a good chance for Romania is a slam played by Erichsens|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3 keys |pg||
mb|6N|nt|roswolf: on normal play this is either -1 or2 but the defence have to be careful|pg||
nt|ahalim: N will have a fir when he finds out that the K was single :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nickf: the Irish have stopped in 5C next door|pg||
nt|nickf: the status of 3D is probably unclear ot Duboin|pg||
nt|nickf: if it was a stopper ask, he didnt have it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|donatoru: but the defence must be carrefull|pg||
nt|donatoru: let's see @s lead|pg||
nt|donatoru: Geta must mark very well the shape |pg||
nt|donatoru: Radu thinking alsos about J@c lead |pg||
nt|donatoru: but is too dangerouse|pg||
nt|donatoru: bet again :) @s lead|pg||
nt|donatoru: lunch time , pls Radu lead :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nickf: and why did East open 1C ahead of 1D, anyway ?|pg||
nt|donatoru: lose again |pg||
nt|donatoru: R@h is the strong lead Q@h is from RDxx , |pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: every reason to be in 4@H after that start lol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|aupillon: only not a heart|pg||
nt|donatoru: wow Geta signs pleasure with small , danger level 0 !!!!!!!|pg||
nt|aupillon: aïe|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to hold 3x@C - to kill the Squeeze against N|pg||
nt|donatoru: now J@c is easy , common boy , |pg||
nt|pelu: 26 IMPs on here|pg||
nt|aupillon: anything. Anything but a heart|pg||
pc|s4|nt|aupillon: ok|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nickf: huh - she raised herself to 6. Hope she makes it now.|pg||
nt|nickf: however had stayed in game, and made, that was worth 12 imps anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they made the lead from the wrong side|pg||
pc|s8|nt|granguru: 4@H might have had a chance|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: the lead was 4@h|pg||
nt|nickf: lead from the wrong side?|pg||
nt|donatoru: in women never trust :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahalim: sry fit i meant|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: behave :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|duschek: Argentina were 1 down in 4@S where Robles/Pacareu bid agressively to 3NT, so that was 3 imps to Argentina, still trailing by 22½|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|aupillon: :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: diamond discards speed things up|pg||
pc|d6|nt|duschek: Here the Argentinians must hope for a push|pg||
nt|othered1: might you get out of NT, playing weak NT:  1@D - 1@H - 2@H?|pg||
nt|donatoru: 4 discards from Radu :)|pg||

nt|donatoru: S should play 4@h at the first trick , that's all folks|pg||
nt|pelu: better to take @S6 and disc @C6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: 32 imps is 25-5|pg||

nt|nickf: If I was declarer I'd accept the lead and let Duboin play the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|nickf: I think the speed the hand was played that may have been what happened|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: because mrs lavazza open the screen |pg||
nt|rayhaa: 7 imps and even match|pg||
nt|blueclub2: ciao|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be exciting|pg||
nt|ahalim: ciaoPietro|pg||
nt|jbgood: and get the kids away from the computer...|pg||
nt|donatoru: 25-5 this is the situation|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3NT |pg||
nt|aupillon: In OR they made 3NT in EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nickf: doh!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|duschek: Depends a lot of the methods|pg||
nt|duschek: on|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has an obvious 4@D bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: rather 11C - 1@H - 2@H|pg||
nt|ahalim: right but how high will they gp ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry go|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the 5 level is safe|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kit: it isn't like 3NT is the worst contract ever been in last hand -- sometimes spades are 4-4, sometimes they don't find the spade lead when 3-card holding is on lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west will relay with 1s|pg||
nt|ahalim: just :)|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3NT for e-w and a good score for Norvay , congrats Norvay, vae victis |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: amusing look to the auction|pg||
nt|ahalim: did Liz really bid 5@D ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk7: as choose a major I presume, showing equal length|pg||
nt|roswolf: logical explanation|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@D showed both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will have to decide whether to sac at some level|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|ady: good morning Silvia|pg||
nt|ady: this should make with an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|rayhaa: 1NT  :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: relay this|pg||
nt|duschek: The normal contract, but stone dead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or not guess this time he did not care|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: practicality won out|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 3-3  would be 12 tricks|pg||
nt|rayhaa: is that correct opening?|pg||
nt|roswolf: more or less the par spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not in my view :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Unless it shows a good hand with 5-5 majors which I doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director was called|pg||
nt|rayhaa: strange defence too|pg||
nt|garnetts: Does anyone know?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Nicked a trick with the 8@C --which is odd too--|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: so if this is flat the Irish will record a 17-13 win over one of the favourites|pg||
nt|aupillon: sure. I'm asking myself the comments after discarding on board 9, at the apetizer, if one exists|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this is going off|pg||
nt|ahalim: good judgment by Louk Verhees |pg||
pc|s4|nt|nickf: and probably have topay for their coffee for the rest of the week|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|nickf: oh to be in San Remo and have coffee from one of the Lavazza girls|pg||
nt|nickf: it's a dream of mine|pg||
nt|rayhaa: looks like dir called than saw void|pg||
nt|garnetts: Have I been transported to an Alice in Wonderland game?  |pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6 finesse  :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: well it reminds me of an odd auction wherby it went 1NT    7NT   and not on lead the poor guy had AKQ10xx of clubs--the 7NT bidder added 5 points for a void which then added up to ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 37|pg||
nt|garnetts: All was well when his opartner who had xxx xxx xxx Jxxx found the odd lead of a low club|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: last board folks see you soon off to the usa|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|donatoru: :)oki andrei errare humanum est , good luck Romania for the next match|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: must be carefull not to shorten trumps too much in trying to get     back to hand to establish clubs|pg||
nt|ady: after ruffing 1 club   winning line is to draw trumps   and give up 2 club tricks    this works with either clubs 3-3  or  if not trumps 2-2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: Not a single expert led that :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|aupillon: Same here. For Norway too. |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 bad board at both table - and the match was over - hard life :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|duschek: I suspect this hand will be a push|pg||
nt|kit: I don't care for the lead from A10xx, but this time it came out ok -- not necessary to defeat the contract, of course|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is more surreal |pg||
pg||
