nt|bjacobs: Looks like East read the double as penalties|pg||
nt|jcwla: No comprendo.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: But with 3 small hearts, is that possible?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No, makes no sense|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So you comprendo now, but still nonsensico ....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: East would be staring at dummy in absolute dismay|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If South has a takeout double and West has hearts, North would be bidding clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Her seven points have dwindled to one trick|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  Which will be fine unless West produces QC|pg||

nt|jcwla: Strange job of stranding both high @H's in dummy.  Oh well, someone E/W had to do something different on one of her turns, you can't bring back a result like this on a partscore ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: hand when you're trying to make up ground.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Some players would always play A from AQ there|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Here is a web site with some rankings ... http://www.pabf.org/ecscore/ec_ranking.asp|pg||
nt|vugraphzrf: call the director|pg||
nt|vugraphzrf: about the explaination of the dbl after 1NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry if the website doesn't work for you ... it did briefly work for me|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks as normal as can be - wonder what was the explanation?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well if somone explained it as penalties rather than takeout?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  More importantly, how does the meaning of South's double change the meaning of West's double?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that either North nor South is likely to do that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps an all-Australian appeals committee might rule in E/W's favour - I think everyone else would pocket the deposit|pg||
