nt|ady: north likely to open with 6-5 distribution      whoever plays  should not go above 2 level    |pg||
nt|finch: The 'intermediate' two (often in combination with a multi) is very fashionable at the moment|pg||
nt|gosia: hello|pg||

nt|finch: west has a tricky call, a choice between 4@D, 4@H and pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Margie|pg||
nt|mcarroll: evening all|pg||

nt|Walddk4: There is a typo in South's name operator|pg||

nt|pef: this is the final segment of the round of 8 match for USA I|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: hello :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: 35 imps with 45 boards to go|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, typo in South's name   Weichsel|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: this table was late starting, the play was lost for the first board, we are now live, result was 1nt +1|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|finch: North's double often described as "action" saying I want to act but I'm doubling in case you want to defend|pg||
nt|ady: this could be expensive|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d minimum... and 2@h relay (with help from specs)|pg||
nt|gosia: I comm - Robinson/Rogoff - wonder if they had late penalties ?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  don't have it at fingertips... will get it in one minute but it's under USBF|pg||
nt|gosia: lots of bidding here - better come to a screeching halt soon :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Weichsel head in hands, in the tank, he is well known for being a "deliberate" player|pg||
nt|andyv:  unchartered waters here.  Maybe 4@D is cue with @h support?|pg||
nt|gosia: I first fell asleep kibbitzing Peter in 1970 :)|pg||
nt|pef: the fleisher team has a large, but not insuperable lead with 15 boards to go|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: there is still a pending director ruling from the previous set, so the current margin "might" not be fixed, but likely the showing 54 imps|pg||
nt|pef: 5c is a little pushy here, but should succeed|pg||
nt|pef: 3nt would only make on a spade lead if the queen of diamonds was covered so there were was an entry to dummy for the club finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pef: I'm told the open room is playing only 3c, so a good chance for ozdil to gain 5 imps (or 6 if they make 6c here|pg||
nt|pef: however, even making 5c is going to take quite a bit of work|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|finch: about 500 I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Barnet|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|finch: ...until it was pulled to 5@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|finch: that's not something you want to do very often.  You know that converting 4@Hx to 5@Hx never looks very good|pg||
nt|ady: think 5@D  likely down 4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A benefit of being at the slow table is that we get to see the Open results|pg||
nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
nt|gosia: wheels came off here a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: ekeblad says he shows a 5-3-3-2 that didn't want to play nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  like in races, when the baton gets dropped, usually bad things happen.|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter new to this - comes from Precision|pg||
nt|andyv:  system notes on line not much help here...3@d may have been the culprit.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: weichsel : "we had a mixup p, sorry" |pg||
nt|gosia: Russ plays some Blue tem Club variant|pg||
nt|gosia: Team|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Barnet|pg||

nt|don paulus: ruff some clubs promotes 8 H in south|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: Wc Kath|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: three rounds of spades would also have promoted the @H8.  The diamond lead was a pretty good shot however|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Chris Larsen|pg||
nt|clarsen: thx roland|pg||
nt|pef: hi, chris|pg||

nt|hedyg: hi Barnet!|pg||
nt|barnets: im next door just checking|pg||

nt|gosia: lol- can picture this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like an easy 4@s on EW. no sacrifie in vulnerable|pg||
nt|pef: so this is another chance for a gain.  we can see that 4s makes e/w and it wasn't bid in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 4@S is more obviously a void. 3@S sounds as if it's looking fr 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: one more    likely shows minors   |pg||
nt|3for3: good action hands to start|pg||
nt|finch: not exactly what south wanted to hear loooking at soft spade values|pg||
nt|3for3: but his minors look great|pg||
nt|finch: 4NT here might be natural. Or it might be saying I don't know what to bid. I bet they've never discused this acution!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and EW putting pressure on|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: that expression is new to me  i must remember it to impress my friends :)|pg||
nt|barnets: the last hand in 3n in open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but with @cQJx in front 12 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 3n after 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: needs a lot to be made in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 3 NT contract goes away|pg||
nt|barnets: here 61S makes on any lead|pg||
nt|pef: e/w in full, let's bid games and try to make them mode here--so far so good|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: took Gu about a fraction of a millisecond to blast 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s= minimum?|pg||
nt|don paulus: hard to get into slam after ops open|pg||
nt|gosia: oops|pg||
nt|gosia: think Russ worth 4 @d ?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|barnets: a lucky one|pg||
nt|pef: everything very favorable here to will easily make 12 tricks on that lead, I guess (6 spades, 5 diamonds, and this ruff|pg||
nt|pef: so should be 12 imps to ozdil and down to only 35 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: I believe this is the first segment that Lair and Ozdil have sat out in the knockout phase|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to say if worth a 4@d bid....maybe 3@h followed by 4@d if pd can't bid 3N...S hand already limited|pg||
nt|gosia: I think Russ worth a boost even though Peter showed 5 or less|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tylere: this is probably -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead?|pg||
nt|tylere: A@D maybe?|pg||
nt|tylere: @H would be my second choiuce|pg||
nt|pef: although while we can see the lies, declarer can't so probably will ruff another heart here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: often trump is best when you and pd hold the majority of hcps|pg||
nt|hlortz: so this should be a couple of IMPs to EW|pg||
nt|tylere: I notice that 3N has been changed to = in both rooms now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, more like it|pg||
nt|barnets: just less than 25 percent slam|pg||
nt|pef: that leads to 10 tricks if spades split and 13 with the nice diamond position|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: as with a iamond lead declarer has to cash 3 hearts before the @S ace|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: best he can do now is take in hand and play @s hoping for split honours|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: that would be for -1|pg||

nt|pef: 3c is going to win some imps for the ozdil team.  probably down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: East trusting his partner to have some values for a vul against not overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards all wrong for E/W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an 18 HCP vul game|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter will take a long time to play this unless they lead trumps for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says trump lead holds it to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: with most right here its only a question of how many overtricks he will make|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 1@C could be a doubleton but it;s important to compete on these hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems to be able to make quite a few @cs in NS|pg||
nt|tylere: yes..but if it's bid it probably has to be by south, and south is happy in 2@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: shot in the arm for Ozdil|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: and EW might find the better @d contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this goes down 1 another IMP to ew|pg||
nt|tylere: the top+bottom two suiter problem again...in a couple of partnerships I've played various ways of showing that combo, just to avoid this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: N should be short in @s, thus unbalanced with @cs|pg||
nt|barnets: i predict 2|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: Here Ozdil goes down |pg||
nt|barnets: or 1|pg||
nt|barnets: if he ducks a club|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: so why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with trump lead, declarer should be able to make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will he run for home or @H Blockage here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: No block|pg||
nt|cindy:  wonder if W considered 4@s   he has suit oriented cards (not notrump)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can hope|pg||
nt|barnets: hi peter|pg||

nt|andyv:  some order restored for n/s|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could have ducked @d but S would have little choice except to put up K|pg||
nt|gosia: didn't take much- 2-2 @h etc - Luck is also a big factor in this game|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Jan|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6@H and 4@S again for east|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this board will be more interesting that previous|pg||
nt|ndemirev: probably Gu did not believe he was given the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Who can resist 1@d overcall|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tylere: X some sort of single suiter, I would assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  also A@c lead told declarer where all the missing cards were|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no fear from West|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: n/s   have 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|gosia: he really didn't have much choice|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR in 3N on this hand, down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: great looking hand at red but at the score you cant pass throughout|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here would work a 4@D used natural showing raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: only the club ruff stops 6@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is thinking bec 4@H could be dangerous, losing the possibility to search slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch: another big hand - NS can make 11 tricks in hearts and EW 10 in diamonds|pg||
nt|vbman: now a michaels may lead to a right lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@H is unlucky to go down, if West leads the@CQ|pg||
nt|pef: pretty normal 3nt here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: e/w   trying to barrage  opps out of contract|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   tht east had bid 4@D|pg||
nt|finch: North has a nice hand for the majors, but should probably stick to 4@H only as South may have stretched a little to get to the right spot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S i mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on hands i like astro with a 5-card anchor major|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vbman: melih may pull some back|pg||
nt|ady: hope south wont overvalue the void diamond|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 2S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to bid that on the first round|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N and W will be glad to keep alow profile on this one|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can make a couple of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can now retire from the bididng and let NS sort things out at the five-level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 6@H is down also with Qx in West - to make would guess to play K at first round|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6 level you mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and probably will go down anyway, come to that|pg||
mb|d|nt|tylere: I'm being told that X = single minor or majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to the world's youngest vugraph commentator: Adam Kaplan|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|tylere: Welcome Adam|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Adam :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to go down if declarer attacked @hs|pg||
nt|cindy:  Weichsel overcalled with a 1@s opening with 2@h holding J10xxx so im amazed no 1@s bid here|pg||
nt|cindy:  last night|pg||
nt|barnets: so you would be right here|pg||
nt|clarsen: should make 9 tricks with di spades and clubs friendly|pg||
nt|pef: i believe 1d showed hearts, 1h showed usually exactly 3|pg||
nt|ndemirev: yes|pg||
nt|pef: ok, showed 1-3|pg||
mb|r|nt|hlortz: welcome|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe he bids differently with a good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Tyler, Hedy and Henry :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Meckwell here it looks like|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|hlortz: so ew are chipping away at the lead looks like 4 imps for making 2@D|pg||
nt|tylere: looks like they'll do rather better here than in the other room, where they ended up in 2@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Danny :)|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like 4 or 5 for diamond for bidding the better part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Danny!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This was an interesting problem for Rogoff in the OR|pg||
nt|finch: now a matter of how much South think he's already shown - and clearly he thinks he's minimum|pg||
nt|ady: e/w save in 6@D   -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@H also possible|pg||
nt|cindy:  got them to 4@h and at the other table his side never got in the bidding|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@h making|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S was too much in the cold light of day|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Weichsel wrote down "Hearts + Clubs I think" will that disuade a club lead?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the bid for South is very difficult - need to guess - i would bid the same without see the cards|pg||
nt|ndemirev: so they changed their methods a bit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: pretty sure he wrote down 1-3 @h, not 100% sure|pg||
nt|pef: I've been looking at the notes and haven't gotten one completey right yet :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: or the cold light of evening|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is that is down the same - to play K in @C isn't easy, having J109|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: weichsel claimed after lead, saying he'll play for q of clubs in east :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if South gets the clubs right, he is a better man than I am, Gunga Din|pg||
nt|clarsen: might weinstein have 4 spades in this auction?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|3for3: DF makes 3@D, but I think that requires a spade to the ten when in with the only dummy entry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but K work with this figure and with Qx in all hands, or Axx Ax Axxx in East - so can be played|pg||
nt|ndemirev: i doubt it |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ndemirev: unless 1h shows 3|pg||
nt|clarsen: he would bypass hearts with 3h and 4 spades?|pg||
nt|ndemirev: but with 43?? you have to bid 1h anyhow |pg||
nt|pef: so all he needs (with hearts not splitting) is the club finesse, spades splitting, and diamonds 3-2|pg||
nt|ndemirev: *and bal hand |pg||
nt|pef: we seem to have more specs at this table than all others combined|pg||
nt|ndemirev: nedd to play on @C |pg||
nt|pef: must be the commentators :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|clarsen: seems he can play on di with spades 4-4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: or later :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He had to decide whether to pass 2@d which was 1M or to bid 2@h allowing for if his partner had @s|pg||
nt|hlortz: make 2 make 3 same 4 imps...|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 4@h, 2@c and 3@d are there for the taking|pg||
nt|pelu: a 2@S = 5+ and a minor would work well here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: Shi fingered for the king, put it back, then played the @h A :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I am usually called Rag|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok rag|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well Rag I might play Ace when i have a singleton and want my partner to give me a ruff|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: when dummy came down, ekeblad oppologized for not bidding 7 :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|3for3: diamond picking up some loose change...which could change the match :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: N(S play precision ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think so|pg||

mb|4H|nt|gosia: depends on how you feel at theses colors|pg||

mb|p|nt|tylere: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N maybe 4NT - |pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: NS play a canope system with a strong 1@c opener, |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 4@S look good - if u only see NS-card - but @S 4-1 will make great probelms on a @H-lead from East|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H = spades !?|pg||
nt|clarsen: cant see rubin bidding less than 4 spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mtvesuvius: 1@h shows 2 or 3@H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 places toplay?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  little slower auction here than OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H 1@S or pass - 1@H giving the K for the lead may be the best :)|pg||

nt|ndemirev: 3@S strikes me as underbid |pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: North somewhat disappointed that South didn't reopen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: kibitzs told me that N/S play strong club and canapé|pg||
nt|pef: if he had, granovetter would know partner was short|pg||
mb|4N|nt|finch: After that lead, South knows that partner has a spade void|pg||
nt|raghavan: Kath - do EW play forcing NT|pg||
nt|barnets: well 5@D is down 1 but 4@S maybe more|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think west's pass was wet|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H = @S Matt ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: This is a pretty easy 3N or 4@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: 2@d is more @hs?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: a lot of wxplaining going on|pg||
nt|3for3: this kind of bidding, even though it is not complicated, will forever keep bridge from becoming a spectator sport (bbo afficionados notwithstanding)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: on both sides of table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont know their system but it looks like it |pg||
nt|pef: but he took the push anyway|pg||
nt|pef: me too, nik, I would think 3h was about right, you can always pass 3s then if you want|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: also slows the play down a lot with the questions and answers|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Al|pg||
nt|gosia: I like Lairs (north) Take out dbl - get in and out fast|pg||
nt|ndemirev: probably NS are trying to keep the lead by staying on the plus side |pg||
nt|clarsen: i think n/s would be better off trying to duplicate likely action at other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: south has bid his 3 card suit and twice bid his xx|pg||
nt|ady: may not be easy to beat 2@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes alerted now|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes now alerted|pg||
nt|raghavan: as forcing|pg||
nt|ndemirev: that may account for the bidding sequence here |pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: This is rightsided in this case\|pg||
nt|hedyg: so all that is known of the S hand is that he has no 3+ @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: more explanations before opening lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  rare 4th best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: west needs to shift to a diamond to hold the extra overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@s or 10|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|andyv:  6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why rare Cindy?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hlortz: ew are having a great board-a-match game but few imps being won|pg||
nt|3for3: the black suits look fairly hopeless|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Close match here, every IMP counts|pg||
nt|hedyg: now N has the 9@s for finessing @s and is not blocked|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, everything works nicely for Declarer here|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead by W in OR|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Greco may find a @d switch here|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n is further explaining|pg||

mb|1N|nt|hedyg: another balanced 1@c|pg||

nt|roswolf: a straightforward 3nt|pg||
nt|clarsen: there is no di guess involved if h ace wins trick one so only need to get spades right|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 1@D=@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am learning :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or better still Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  aces and spaces made the hand almost unbiddable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h is makeable|pg||
nt|pef: right|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tylere: ;)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s is the limit here I think|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D   flannery?|pg||
nt|pelu: that max for EW|pg||
nt|clarsen: wonder why this is a negative dbl not 2 spade bid|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= no 4 cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry 1@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h?|pg||
nt|gosia: typo Matt ? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: negatory, weichsel did indeed bid 2@h|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ndemirev: 2S might not be F |pg||
pc|d5|nt|mtvesuvius: It only takes 51 boards to learn a system, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|3for3: might make 3 on some variations|pg||
nt|hedyg: faster if they repeat the bids on each bd :)|pg||
nt|3for3: i bet DF will|pg||
nt|andyv:  game try?|pg||
nt|cindy:  @cA lead i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: ekeblad explained 3spd as "if rememberd, 4-4-4-1 max"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no - wwhen I look at the @d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: well this should be safe|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or they might stop in 1. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: a lot of explaining going on|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@S must be limited....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Although I think Hampson will want to reopen|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He may try 1NT now|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh hes passed duh|pg||
nt|3for3: dangerous spot for hampson here|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt want to lose a double part score swing|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: more questions|pg||
nt|hlortz: he wansts to bid but is vulnerable|pg||
nt|3for3: but the opps are in his longest suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, 1NT is tempting|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass is more tempting|pg||
nt|gosia: got lucky double let Russ pass|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Russ took out a pass card but put it back, now thinking|pg||
nt|pef: he'll probably get this right, also|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphu4: there seems to be different explanations from each player|pg||
nt|hedyg: uhoh!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the slam lost 11 - NS had a free run to 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cindy:  oops|pg||
nt|pef: especially now!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: -1 sh be easy|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad asked Weichsel if he's going to be a while, Peter confirmed so eke is on his smoke break|pg||
nt|pelu: if decl duck - then -2 on a @C-ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: as he looks at dummy he thinks 4@S is reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: asking about the q@h lead, and 7@h now, |pg||
nt|pelu: in board 49 NS found the way to 2@S - but Gu didn't find the winning line - so only +1 imp|pg||
nt|clarsen: i was informed they play negative free bids that explains the dbl|pg||
nt|pef: so a possible gain just turned into a likely loss|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  should have put the pass card out|pg||
nt|gosia: whoa |pg||
nt|bridge_one: push board|pg||
nt|clarsen: no chance to go wrong in spades now|pg||
nt|ndemirev: the J is a better lead here  |pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: well 1@D can promise 4441|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  this will be expensive|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mtvesuvius: Well, they landed in a good spot |pg||
nt|pef: well low makes sure he plays the ace|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: about the 1@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to tell who expected what from this auction|pg||
nt|gosia: maybe 2 @h mechanical error - once on the tray can't take it back|pg||
nt|andyv:  and only thing i was wondering was whether to bid 2@S or 2@D over 1N with the S hand|pg||
nt|gosia: for those who watched Women's trials I learned the hard way|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: i don't believe so, he deliberately bid 2@h from my perspective, but is possible :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: i am told the 1@h response shows 3+ Nat and Non Forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: on the previous board|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 64 ozdil/lair stayed in 4@H and made +2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the pass by East is justified|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: North south arguing about the pace of play. Ekeblad : "I am going to go to the restroom" Weichsel "Can I go with u?"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hmm|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there is some work to do here |pg||
nt|clarsen: i oubt he can handle 5-0 spades so has to play for spades to be the way they are|pg||
nt|ndemirev: but declarer should be getting it right |pg||
nt|ndemirev: declarer can ruff now and try the @S Q |pg||
nt|clarsen: that seems best i think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: their system card is :  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=418&pid=131|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i never thought to use 1@H with 3 cards over 1@D playing strog club and 5 majors - could be interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: weichsel previously asked to use the washroom, ekeblad told him no|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chinese will certainly take their time|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy:  half right   4-1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: true :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gosia: did not see pard opened 1 @d so passed lefty had not bid yet and could not take my pass back|pg||
nt|andyv:  with taps in @h suit, I probably would have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad "can open 2@s 5+s and 4@d" or if too strong, open 1@c, players discussing at present*|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  except with certain partners who never have more than one trump for me|pg||
nt|clarsen: unlikely to go wrong from here|pg||
nt|pef: and west only has one heart left to tap declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: They may treat it as a 1RF potentially, although change that by a Passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can ruff 1@c and disc 1 and endplay E in @s|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|gosia: we played 1 @d making 3 when 4 @s goes down on a club ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: super-safe line|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|barnets: defence have 2 more for down 1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gosia: was called Rueful Rabbit by Commentators when we gained 4 IMP's|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of tricks... too bad there's a spade suit to contend with|pg||
nt|gosia: lho was same side of screen as me - once bid in try - is over |pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|gosia: once bid in tray|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ndemirev: should have played low now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: in 50: West open 1@S (canape) - and 'stole' the @s-fit from NS|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pef: so 5 imps back the other way|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|clarsen: im sure he would play sp 9 if he played low|pg||
nt|ndemirev: right criss , no reason not to |pg||
nt|clarsen: only remains to worry about clubs being 4-1|pg||
nt|ndemirev: pitch @D ?|pg||
nt|clarsen: looks normal to pitch a di i think|pg||
nt|clarsen: maybe it would have been better to pitch a club not a di earlier|pg||
nt|ndemirev: could hurt |pg||
nt|ndemirev: had to ruff i think |pg||
nt|ndemirev: can he overthing and go down? |pg||
nt|ndemirev: overthink'|pg||
nt|clarsen: it wouldnt be the first time this has happened but i dont think he will go wrong|pg||
nt|pef: he does have things to think about, but the good news for him is that it is hard to see anyway, given the lie of the cards, that he can go down.  he'd have to pitch a club, play a ...|pg||
nt|pef: club to dummy and take a diamond finesse to do that|pg||
nt|ndemirev: tick-tick-tick|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: at this pace the time police will pay us a visit :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|bridge_one: yes, super safe :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: goodish slam for e/w is defeated by the spade break|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: does pass show values?|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: It may be, but he probably just played on spades|pg||
nt|3for3: lose 2 spades, plus AKA|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok..|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt many people would bid that one - some hands are just too tough|pg||
nt|gosia: Specs sad for me - maybe got bad ruling :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how he got rid of his @d loser...if E returned @D|pg||
nt|pelu: and EW didnt find the 8 card @H-fit - the batle stopped in 3@C :)|pg||
nt|ndemirev: i would have let him sit there |pg||
mb|3N!|nt|ady: exact cards   with 10 card fit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H could be too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is difficult to predict|pg||
nt|pef: this was potentially a good result for fleisher.  n/s are cold for 3nt and played in 1h in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Df made 3 though, so the computer won an imp :)|pg||
nt|vbman: fine only double dummy|pg||
nt|ady: need to play 5 of a minor  here|pg||
nt|andyv:  just cashed @cs I guess|pg||
nt|cindy:  so what is the verdict on his correct bid ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 1@S 4 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Milgrim is going to be tortured here|pg||
nt|3for3: yummy hand for milgrim here|pg||
nt|3for3: his @H's are better|pg||
nt|finch: another bidding challenge, this time for NS - to get to exactly 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|barnets: 43 imps with 38 boards to go just 1 per board|pg||
nt|bridge_one: canapè style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S rather shuts out the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsz: w is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzsz: :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|finch: 3@D both majors FG an exceptionally useful piece of system when you have this hand.|pg||
nt|ady: south will avoid no-trumps one partner has shown both minors|pg||
nt|gosia: must play Aces Scientific 3@c forcing raise|pg||
nt|gosia: I like it as it frees up a natural forcing 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2 way jacoby|pg||
nt|gosia: that's seems silly - never heard of it ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5! exclusion?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Shi in the tank :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2n=4 trump and 16+hcp|pg||
nt|gosia: 2nt natural and forcing over 1 of a suit is so comfortable :)|pg||
nt|pef: i would bid 1nt with the north hand at this point, but both passed, what do you guys think?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I bet he will be forced to make at least 2 bids, if not more|pg||
nt|finch: South could have temporised with 3@S which would also get the job done, but this is probably simpler|pg||
nt|ady: east is going to be on lead   so 5 will bed the limit    there will not be a wrong lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@C=4 trumps and 12-15 hcp|pg||
nt|clarsen: it looks like a 1nt bid to me|pg||
nt|pef: oops, another chance|pg||
nt|ndemirev: pass is ok |pg||
mb|4H|nt|3for3: but he surely doesn't want to be raised|pg||
nt|cindy:  W has a difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: I believe they agreed that 2@s should be opened systematically for them.|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: IN 4th chair specifically***|pg||
mb|d|nt|hlortz: 2@c to not encourage pard|pg||
nt|hedyg: should have bid his major|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now he has to pass and accept whatever happens|pg||
nt|andyv:  some flip it around|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 1h is safer in a way because 1n can go down 2-3 while 1H makes ... the pesimistic view |pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: 2@s is clever - afraid of 2@h protection if he passes |pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: looks to be -2, no?|pg||
nt|3for3: nothing too terrible|pg||
nt|hedyg: wishing he had bid @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: or that E had bid!!|pg||
nt|3for3: not clear, 2@H made have raised all the way to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: this has the merit of being undoubled|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2 down it looks like, so 3 IMPs to Diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however 2@S will be no picnic|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: tortured pass by weichsel : "I hope this isn't something..."|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very competitive system - the use to open with 4 cards in Major give good advantage about the regular distribution|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes at these colours he doesnt mind playing in a moysian fit|pg||
nt|pef: well this is going to be a sick feeling for gu|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  seems like E/W are making this more complicated than it needs to be|pg||
nt|gosia: lack of @d q will encourage East|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: a @d shift and chances to defeat|pg||
nt|clarsen: gu will be sorry he reopened|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tylere: somewhat surprised east didn't X, actually. 2NT with the points split 20-0 rarely plays well|pg||
nt|3for3: they need a win 5 for the wheel|pg||
nt|gosia: kickback with a void ?|pg||
nt|ndemirev: yes |pg||
pc|c3|nt|cindy:  dont think they can make this|pg||
nt|roswolf: again i feel e/w have been a bit damp with a 10 card there should be some way into the auction|pg||
nt|pef: you always think in a high level match that it's safer to reopen because opps would have bid a game the first time if they had one|pg||
nt|pef: but even here it happens|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hlortz: no big swings but all to ew|pg||
nt|bridge_one: remember that they play canapé, so to bid 2@H take the risk to find 5@H in South ...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: he must have been happy with the contract|pg||
nt|ady: this hand should not take long|pg||
nt|gosia: right W denied @d control|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H over 1NT is possible, but one advanyage of canape is that such an overcall can walk into your main suit  |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but some risks have to be taken|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: declarer will start spades with low towards the J in case north has 4 to the Q|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy:  probably will play S for the long clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4!@C, 1@D, 3@H  and 1@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: W can get 3H, 1D, 1S and 3Club |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting auction to get to right spot and maybe our first push board of the set|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: but again, with 2/2 in the minors, perhaps it is more likely that South has a long minor rather than hearts |pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: luckily @D break|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: having QJ83 in @S East tought to can bid at seccond round his @h :) but north choise to bid 2@S ....|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but East not at all interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Cash 2@d and underlead the @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably. I like an early action before balancing|pg||
nt|pef: n/s had an uncontest auction to 4h, west led a low diamond and north went up with the ace--oops|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphu4: Weichsel lets out a deep sigh, almost as if to announce another tank|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is right also bec take the chance to play @S from North, proteging from lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he won't go on - he's gone off in one slam already|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cindy:  friendly hand though|pg||
nt|raghavan: thinkg of slam Kath?|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think a singleton spade lead is likely|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: as West?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not after I bid like that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad : "you're giving me a heart attack with that" Weichsel "what/??? you mean you don't have extras???"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|finch: It looks as if double followed by 2@H was either intended as forcing, and/or West thinks East has a 1534 type hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: up to partner now|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not - but then 4@S can make|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tylere: A@C out a @C works too, at this point|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n says they play sound 2s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he sure has a sound 2!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: argument has just breaken out about the system|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: broken out*|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: disagreements about 3@d etc. before the lead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|finch: for the double.  This is all very murky, I'm not embarrassed to say I've never discussed exactly this auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|othered1: pass by north?   Double must be near-absolutely for takeout.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobh1: double is for takeout but n is 4by3|pg||
nt|bobh1: pass has to be considered|pg||
nt|bobh1: if his minors were reversed pass would be clear|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but he may play for penalties here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if he does bid 4@s it will be david's turn to find the missing Q|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: that will easier here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|roswolf: this may be tricky in view of the 4-1 trump break|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|othered1: there is still a @H p[osition to deal with.  Must west have a high @H?  Even despite no @H opening lead?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

nt|bobh1: he may realize now that he needs to play w for the @h T|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bobh1: so might as well do it now|pg||
nt|bobh1: the bad trump break is a set-back|pg||
nt|othered1: on this lie of the cards.  Of course that would be wrong if east had AK10, just barely a possibility|pg||
nt|bobh1: but hopefully not a fatal one|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: ok, players have returned, ready to resume|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does Weichal open 11 counts?|pg||
nt|raghavan: do u think NS may play in 2NT? Kath?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: players discussing meaning of 3@d, ekeblad it insists GF w/o promising extras, wants game opp limit type hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be competitive|pg||
nt|pef: this looks very flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and now a potential slam.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe |pg||
nt|barnets: nice to point tht out to the opponents|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: alot of post mortem at this table, by both sides|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gosia: I know that bid :) @h+@d's|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Useful bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S for E/W and 5@H for N/S here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, this is what we like to see - both sides have a major suit fit |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so lots of lovely biddings|pg||
nt|ndemirev: yes |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andyv:  5@h + 4+@D 10-15 hcp|pg||
nt|andyv:  E dbl aggressive with only 3@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Support Redbl?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: a long note written by peter, can't read it but it says something about hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  but for which suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Encouraging for opps|pg||
nt|ndemirev: if gu bids 2S now they might be able to steal |pg||
nt|clarsen: heavy 2nt bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tylere: not one I'd really want to be in|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c is artificial GF I think|pg||
nt|finch: NS may well get to 4@S which is a rather delicate spot, although only has 3 obvious losers|pg||
nt|vbman: ozdil must be predicting the state of the match not so bright fr |pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have a tight 4@S   in view of trumps 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: when your behind in a match sometimes good to let the opponents know they could have done better|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@SX MAY BE THE FINAL CONTRACT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume 5@S by E/W - no way to risk 6@H by South with only one Ace|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk4: It is|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gettysburg?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I am told Natural GF or Balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would be very aggressive to bid this slam, but it's makeable|pg||
nt|andyv:  weak makes more sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: I'd be shocked if rubin didn't raise|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: always a dilemma now whether to show the 5 card major |pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right Rag |pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx rare |pg||
nt|ndemirev: looks like a raise |pg||
nt|clarsen: rubin has an easy raise with that hand|pg||
nt|pef: the play on this should go quickly (relatively speaking :) )|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: THIS IS WHERE JUDGMENT COMES TO THE FORE|pg||
mb|4S|nt|finch: 2NT often played as a relay, particularly if you like raising with 3-card support frequently|pg||
nt|finch: 4@S likely to show a maximum weak NT with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  wrong sided the contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shh, Geoffrey - the children are asleep|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will east play the king?|pg||
nt|finch: that's a storming lead.  I was expecting a diamond which makes life fairly easy for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: keyboarditis|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can now make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my, that @D8 is useful |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or is it....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think East can quite do it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk4: You need a few things to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c=?|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so 1@S is 5 or 4 with another 5 card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Shi pulled out the 4@h put it back and elected for the diamond, good choice :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe -1 in any event|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: best to ruff 2@c in dummy, but will still only come to 12|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bridge_one: having 2 losers in @H i think impossible to make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if North duck A in @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: discard club|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Barry Goren tells me that 4@c is Natural with Support for @c|pg||
nt|finch: yes, and another club on the jack of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: E should lead a trump anyway if the other way|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Ekeblad has left the table for a smoke break, dummy is vacant|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one loss in every suit =9 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Why the alert then?|pg||
nt|3for3: because it might have been a control bid|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: s says balk|pg||
nt|andyv:  only a smoke break?  No valium around?|pg||
nt|gosia: long way to go - if gets caught in staircase - Solly will go ballistic :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|gosia: they're on the 2nd floor - can't go out for security reasons :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: If you are going to alert all natural bids too, you have to alert all the time|pg||
nt|barnets: yes had south not led a diamond dec would have had a chance to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: pitching the D on the club and guessing spades|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|3for3: that is what one would assume|pg||
nt|clarsen: this might allow them to save some time|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|vbman: and pray for dia to behave|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: looks like no make|pg||
nt|vbman: cl ruffs?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tylere: maybe an alert because it might be assumed a cue otherwise?|pg||
nt|pef: ah, if only he had psyched the 2h bid on a doubleton :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|3for3: right tyler|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|raghavan: may play C|pg||

pc|dA|nt|mtvesuvius: That's possible, since it's not what the assumed meaning would be|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is getting very dangerous - East is running out of trumps|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: now when N overruffs the last @C there is a trump promotion in @H as well|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: and another push|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This one will be interesting though|pg||
nt|3for3: interesting to go quietly with the east hand here at the other table|pg||
nt|andyv:  boards 18 & 19 really stand out now|pg||
nt|raghavan: 100 + 200 in OR = 7IMP|pg||
nt|cindy:  well 1N was semi forcing|pg||
nt|raghavan: 7  IMP|pg||
nt|barnets: not a pretty west hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but East!|pg||
nt|ndemirev: :)|pg||
nt|ndemirev: and no raise :) |pg||
mb|1S|nt|3for3: partner is marked with points, and you have 74...1nt is not where I'd like to be|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Greco and Hampson play Meckwell over 1NT, so this may be a loss for them|pg||
nt|cindy:  he could have passed 1N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 20-20 in points.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best thing to say when you have just gone three down|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: the unbalanced type of 1@c now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Although when Milgrim opens 1@c it gives them a chance to find the right spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is solid so a bidding test for e/w|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opportunity here though |pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  2@d again|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: the semiforcing was alerted as can only pas 5332 min, for their style|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will join in|pg||
nt|ndemirev: i was thinking about the same thing ... |pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c could be set 1 I think on perect defense|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: perfect*|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hampson praying for a rebid by S|pg||
nt|pef: got to do something to keep the specs interested at this point :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mtvesuvius: Nice decision by Milgrim|pg||
nt|gosia: dejavu once again|pg||
nt|andyv:  balance with E hand?|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|cindy:  still  ....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no imagination - what's wrong with 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I have to admit, I'd be tempted to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: the good ole' tortured pass accompanied with a deep sigh :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  not this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: over 5@C  what does west do - punt 6@H?|pg||
nt|clarsen: the cops might be there if he bid 2h with 2 and gu failed to raise with 5|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mtvesuvius: This will probably be -1 also... which means that Rogoff gets 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|finch: 4@H asking South to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: n/s     3@S   |pg||
nt|mcarroll: @Ss a bit anaemic to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and price was steep|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess Shi is showing 4@S?|pg||
nt|pef: looks like another dullish 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: what a Spade suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: THE BARRAGE DOES ITS JOB|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@C is quite a good save|pg||
nt|pef: unlike the last quarter where there were at least 7 hands with 11 cards in two suits|pg||
nt|pef: the last sixth, I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  + value of K@h dropped considerably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is even better|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: fairly normal to bid game opposite a strong NT and find out if it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H lead now|pg||
nt|ndemirev: this 3n needs some play |pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: You owe me a beer, Geoffrey - you've just woken my kids|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: should be 1 too high   though east must switch to a heart|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|finch: no hurry to switch to a heart yet, can still do so later|pg||
nt|vbman: not this1|pg||
nt|ady: yes  with only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|pef: meanwhile, for those keeping track, the robinson match is done (they have two boards to go but hard to pick up 80 imps in two boards even for Nik) with robinson moving on to the ...|pg||
nt|pef: semis|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mtvesuvius: Best to keep on playing trumps here|pg||
nt|hlortz: they - rogoff may finally score imps this set!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Since the less they have the ability to ruff your winners the better|pg||
nt|cindy:  good dbl|pg||
nt|cindy:  they are doomed now|pg||
nt|cindy:  but which @h to lead ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a good double till they rex for blood...|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|cindy:  hmm|pg||
nt|raghavan: what happened no H lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would be afraid my partner would kill me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: ekeblad asked about 4 questions about the bidding, then plopped out the 2 of @c|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did he not see partner's double?|pg||
nt|cindy:  can he see his partner's face ?  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: 99% sure he saw the double, no, screens prevent that :)|pg||
nt|barnets: east will have to make 2 discards on the hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if I bid 1nt in this sequence I show 18-20 - do you agree?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a coke perhaps diet of course|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: undo!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: many problems   here    3rd diamond to look after as well|pg||
nt|vbman: d1?|pg||
nt|ady: cant see much better than hope spade king onside  and breaking   draw trumps|pg||
nt|clarsen: good think weinstein let this go|pg||
nt|ndemirev: not many good leads available |pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: granovetter in the tank... again :)|pg||
nt|pef: looks like the semis will be welland, fleisher, and robinson, with nickell finally joining the party.  but remember, lots of teams still left in the repechage for USA II|pg||
nt|ndemirev: a black card if i can interepret teh auction right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|cindy:  i used to have a partner that i could hear sighing on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|clarsen: club as good as anything i believe|pg||
nt|ndemirev: looks best |pg||
nt|pef: heart to the ace and heart to the queen?|pg||
nt|pef: or he could play spades|pg||
nt|pef: or he could play diamonds|pg||
nt|clarsen: heart to the queen is obvious from here maybe not so clear for gu|pg||
nt|pef: hard to figure out the best line after this many boards and days at this state of the match|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hlortz: needs to give pard a@c ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  at other table, E was fearless, bid @ss twice even though S was able to show both suits naturally|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
mc|9|nt|barnets: I think so easy when we see partners hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I was about to say that the strong club would save E from the 2NT opening when N bid1@H, so it actually triggered the 2NT evaluation of the hand, much to W's disgust|pg||
nt|ndemirev: may lose 3@H 1S !@C|pg||
pg||
