mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: An Irish slam is a slam where you are off two aces and a couple of trump tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and now a 3rd explanation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Karel has a Belgian father but is born-and-bread Irish.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: at this vulnerability?|pg||

nt|lestergold: 5d does not look makeable|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: in 5@D the trump split would be awkward|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he'd better calm down. Being upset does not help his cause. After all, the grand slam was on a finesse. We have all been in much worse|pg||
nt|lestergold: and what do you do wityh the 4th clubs and 4th heart neither suit breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Brogeland couple also bid 7NT, so he is in good company|pg||
