mb|3H|nt|boedhy: Hi Nigel and Raghavan|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: One of the best mix pairs of europe Maas-Vriend|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|boedhy: will be interesting to see if they manage to add another big victory to their palmares|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4H or 3NT N/S just needs the heart finesse which is working|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ruud is it NS or EW the best pais|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Close decision for North|pg||
nt|boedhy: Bakkeren Arnolds sure the second mixed pair in the NEtherlands so should be possible|pg||
nt|raghavan: Though makes  from here, I would pass on the rule of 2 and 3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Normally you'd just pass a 3 level preempt but second seat vul vs not it will be a good hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would pass too but I would be nervous|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|boedhy: rule of then.. Maas is the trainer of the open team of teh Netherlands and they say always raise with 3 card if partner opens 3X|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed but since is already 2 short  and N can furnish those 2, cannot count upto 4|pg||
nt|boedhy: rule of TEN|pg||

nt|boedhy: tricky result in the open room high bidding all around|pg||
