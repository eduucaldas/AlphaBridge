nt|mariner1: is Bergen popular in China? I have always thought it takes up too many bids,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: based on the false (to me) premise that the bids it uses are not effective used|pg||
nt|mariner1: otherwise|pg||

nt|mariner1: N can't really continue can they, 4@S to me shows not enough controls to move|pg||
nt|brgpro: but since N has so much potentials for slam, maybe it is not a good idea to pass the ball to pd|pg||

nt|brgpro: why @s lead...|pg||
nt|othered1: OK the reason was I didn't see east was playing this|pg||
