nt|mtvesuvius: EW play 2/1 and a Strong NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: A difficult bidding hand for E-W.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H may be OK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 4@H on 5-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough board first up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|an|Natural or BAL 11-13 or 17+|nt|henryb: also hard after S opens 1@d|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h seems to be the best spot, we'll see|pg||
nt|henryb: or even 1@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C rather, they open all balanced minimum hands 1@C|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|mtvesuvius: That's one method of bidding this :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Zia can afford to pass for one round. No, he has bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Zia asking about DBL, Welland shrugs|pg||
nt|jbgood: the practical shot |pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: hmm... this looks familiar :)|pg||
nt|henryb: which involves playing one of the opponents for honor doubleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I thought that was Hamman's job :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As Wubbo de Boer in spec points out, you can actually defeat 4@H too, but it takes a very sharp defence|pg||
nt|brolucius: A huge lead for North. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Either red suit will beat this|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia asks about lead: "attitude"|pg||

mb|p|nt|capercliff: the 10 was unlucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|gavin: west has to stop low|pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: here is a slam im sure they will get to|pg||
nt|gavin: lets see if ew have some sort of lebensohl agreement here|pg||
nt|gavin: some people play 2nt here says i have a bad hand, some play it scrambling|pg||
nt|caitlin: not uncommon over this double to have such an agreement|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C on NS, 3NT down|pg||
nt|gowdy: @S and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot compete against this|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 6NT by north the top spot, but 6@D also excellent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, drinks for all on me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: assuming they have some kind of two way new minor available|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probs in this contract with the hands so well fitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to the last 16 boards of an exciting match|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: what is 2@H, maybe a relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they opt for the Moysian @S fit it will be a problem|pg||
nt|caitlin: a support double?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: value showing|pg||
nt|lestergold: prob make 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Double or 4S bid will come|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: shows the need for the 2NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if it is, doubling is likely to help opponents|pg||
nt|gavin: was wrong about the line up|pg||
nt|gavin: they did runt he same 4 again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even with lebensohl likely to try 4|pg||
nt|gavin: agree, west hand is so huge, hard to judge|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh What agood bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C good bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: great bidding|pg||
nt|raghavan: Martin did N hear you saying 5C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well yesterday he made good bids i did not say|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna can lead singleton spade but never gets partner in|pg||
nt|raghavan: North reasoningmay be S did not bid 3S over 3H so may be S 3 cards so clubs in S hand is assured|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: north can see at trick one that the only chance to beat this hand is his partner having the Jack of hearts since clubs are frozen if the Q and K are reversed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: wolperts main worry is xx in diamonds opposite|pg||

nt|Walddk12: and hello to our wonderful operator, Karen, aka macaw on BBO @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good analysis|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin: he will overtake the spade to play another spade|pg||
nt|gavin: hoping declarer leads a high heart from dummy|pg||
nt|gavin: giving him 1 extra chance to beat the hand |pg||
nt|gavin: if his partner has 9x of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho may be a prob for south with last club so mayube only 2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|capercliff: pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT i guess is pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will bid 6@d I would guess, holding 4 small @c's|pg||
nt|gavin: leading a 4th round and having his partner ruff high in hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Martin|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|cA|nt|vugraphznx: lost the play :(|pg||
nt|gowdy: tell them to slow it down :)|pg||

pc|c8|nt|gavin: i guess the word faster|pg||

nt|gavin: dont go together that well|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you here?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||

nt|glen: do you have methods that get to your 4-4 fit?|pg||
nt|gambit: out of the frying pan...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i will settle for a 4-3, even a chunky 4-2|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: Susie has all the secrets|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|capercliff: could 5N really be a grand slam bid after 1N?|pg||
nt|shals: Good evening this game is being played in beautiful Penticton B>C> I am joining Caitlin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy but "slow" 3nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: all 3 of these players, I believe are from Toronto, certainly Hanna Nader, Jim Green, Darren Wolpert|pg||
nt|caitlin: or Czyz may be Montreal, not sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: match tightened up a little in the last segment|pg||
nt|glen: hi bart, glad to hear you are joining the kast of katz|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: don't ask me|pg||
mb|3D|nt|caitlin: welcome Shirley Laidaw|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, ralph & I will be warming up shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but i think if wolpert had heart ace, would have cued at some point, similarly with void|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to envisage 5NT as GSF|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS may play in 1NTor 2C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C has come|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades, double presumably hearts|pg||
nt|caitlin: at Open Table Carruthers, who has won many championships, is from Toronto, his partner Joey Silver from Montreal and L'Ecuyer and Fergani from Quebec|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: with the heart entries in easts hand , north can probably scramble together 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gavin: welcome shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you have come to a Canadian zoo:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/ cannot come in at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 2s may already be overboard|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2@S looks like an underbid  perfect on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: should East return to 4@S now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: important here for the defence to give nothing away|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: good plan if they let you do it|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sharynr: i type too slow|pg||
nt|shals: really..I am going to play ther next week ..wonderful tournament|pg||
nt|gavin: me too|pg||
nt|gavin: im about to start my trip around the world in about 4 hours when i leave for stockholm airport|pg||
nt|shals: hope we can meet|pg||
nt|glen: good evening all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: hi Glen|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: these X  allow the XX,  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: if defence open up hearts for example Green may end up with a trick|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: i guess they dont play super KCB|pg||
nt|sybarra: only helps opps imo |pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: and we end with a flat board - probably|pg||
nt|capercliff: there are many other ways he could have persued a grand slam on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this broadcast will continue all day, see bbo schedule for time|pg||
nt|capercliff: bye all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might have tried 5@S with hannas hand, he can be sure 6@C is down|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is your itenary, gavin?|pg||
nt|gavin: 8 1/2 hour flight to nyc, go into the city for a few hours (5 hour layover) to hang out with friends, then back to the airport for a 6 hour flight to calgary, another hour to banff ...|pg||
nt|gavin: before i quit for the night |pg||
nt|caitlin: Gavin is also a Wolpert .........Darren playing South:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: nice lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: 6 aces for @H and @s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: welcome to segment 3 of the Canadian finals from always sunny Penticton|pg||
nt|caitlin: for declarer|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Karen, to the commentators, spectators for their comments, to BBO for allowing us to see bridge from everywhere, and to the CBF for arranging this broadcast|pg||
nt|gavin: then spending sunday driving through banff which ive never done before|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|shals: ok|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: fortunately wont have any effect here, but i see no point in this double|pg||
nt|bbramley: another case for 6RKC|pg||
nt|bbramley: good to have some rules for what's trump in ambiguous keycard auctions|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt @H set with raise of @H?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or could be @S with cue bid?|pg||
nt|bbramley: not the way i play - for me 3@S makes both suits key - immed fits in two suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the rule i use is partners suit is the key suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharynr: I wonder if  Daniel would have guess @D in 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: and finally get there sunday night , relax have breakfast monday and show up for the ko|pg||
nt|shals: Banff and the trip to the Okanagan is spectacular!|pg||
nt|caitlin: to Penticton??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: warning you will have your picture taken 20 times and be asked to take pictures at least that many times|pg||
nt|caitlin: where you going for KO?|pg||
nt|gavin: penticton|pg||
nt|gavin: regional starts monday night|pg||
nt|caitlin: awesome|pg||
nt|gavin: sucks that i will miss my mom and bro by a day|pg||
nt|lestergold: Green will try to force/encourage the defence to open up something to his advantage|pg||
nt|bbramley: but joey may not know for sure|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: needed to cash a second spade before the diamond|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bbramley: if joey thought @Hs were the only key suit, then he could be missing a grand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharynr: I guess Jim made it easier|pg||
nt|sharynr: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: and as he will say.  NEXT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: a club exit is safe|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shals: ok Gavin, I will bring my camera, then?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gavin: so when he knocks out the heart, he will be able to squeeze hughes in hearts and spades for his 11th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is a dim but it removes an exit card from north|pg||
nt|bbramley: some play first agreed suit, or the major, or whatever - for me it's clear that with a two-suited fit that all of the high honors in both suits are key|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin: he is being a little carefull here not wanting to discard a diamond until its late enough in the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if hughes ducks|pg||
nt|gavin: u got it :)|pg||
nt|gavin: so if he ducks he can still negotiate it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club of course may not have been safe from Grainer's point of view|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|gavin: cashes a couple clubs and its the same squeeze in a different way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: run the spades now |pg||
nt|rlebi: hence super kcb|pg||
pc|d3|nt|starkist: 3@s might just be a cuebid|pg||
nt|bbramley: and i mean KEY in the literal sense, as in IMPORTANT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if both suits bid first by same hand, is most convenient to use the higher ranking as the key suit|pg||
nt|rlebi: so then it wouldnt matter|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gavin: jurek can claim|pg||
nt|gavin: but fast ....|pg||
nt|gavin: this actually works as a double squeeze now|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|gavin: he has a complete claim because if turner has the 4th spade|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gavin: then he will be squeezed in spades and diamond|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: tightening up the position|pg||
nt|lestergold: hoping for an endplay here|pg||
nt|gowdy: now tighten them up with trumps|pg||

nt|brolucius: Tips for how to avoid becoming 72 down are more vulnerable.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  well certainly not use the green card like I saw last night - need to be active|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|thegarve:  mind you a green card is  what gets you into the USA|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s has good chances by guessing @s right|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Willenken has to have *something* for his overcall :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: W: "do you have an agreement about what the DBL shows?" H: "It's just a takeout DBL, he could have lots of hands; I assume he wants me to do something intelligent"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

nt|henryb: What we are discussing is a so-called "Finesse obligatoire"|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 4H beatable?|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Martin they haven't played this board??|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am confused|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score detroit|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh from set one|pg||
nt|glen: S suspects what the minor is|pg||
nt|susieq: I'm a little surprised Grainger didn't open that 3@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcarroll: Hi Martin, George|pg||
nt|caitlin: Last year Carruthers came in second for Worlds|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT may be better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: is this worth a superaccept?|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suit is blocked and north endplayed|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes end play from the club of course as long as Green reads the position|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2-1 my boys are making a come back:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a 2@H opening in first set, caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: now I understand, thanks:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: duh|pg||
nt|starkist: 2@d 2.5@h bid?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like a diamond shift trick 2 does it in|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: apparently 1NT shows more than a bare 6 count|pg||
nt|bbramley: sure, an early @D ought to beat it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: for results so far http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/09files/BWeek09_results.html|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W's interference may have prevented NS from reaching their 5-5 @D fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: click on date time and event|pg||
nt|mittmouse: lets see if turner makes the good technical play of a low club back not that it helps|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi martin x2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi George|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi george|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best they can do is cash club, heart, and play a heart|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Making3|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Lost the play, will claim out the hand when they are done. sorry |pg||
nt|fabsayc: some partnerships use 2@S over 2@H as a relay, would have been handy here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will come close to duplicating the undertricks here|pg||
nt|caitlin: I actually like Bergen super accepts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: perhaps only 2, declarer drawing 2 trumps and playing diamonds for safety|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would think most play 8-10|pg||
nt|caitlin: what do I really care.....the Maple Leafs going nowhere ever so let's have THREE teams here..Hamilton, downtown and Downsview park..let them ALL in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek needed to put in the queen, forcing declarer to win|pg||
nt|caitlin: and unblock?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|shals: would all of you lead the j?|pg||
nt|caitlin: depending if you playing Jack denies|pg||
nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: if Eddie Kantar were here he would have a FIT re: lead of Jack:)|pg||
nt|shals: iguess that is where I'm coming from|pg||
nt|caitlin: regardless of HCP you super accept with 9 card fit.. and more to it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: enlighten us Ellen|pg||
nt|raghavan: llen - since S did not make a bid they must be opening with 12 Points ( We were seeing lighter openings in other USA matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes surprising|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8 loser hand I would open|pg||
nt|glen: it helps if W has two ways to bid 3H over 2@S, one to show a great hand|pg||
nt|glen: here E has two bullets (aces) and a fit, so 4@H regardless|pg||
nt|glen: now at this time declarer thinks N's minor is @Cs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|caitlin: guess they don't play that|pg||
nt|raghavan: any lead helps|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Darren is not shy|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a great lead for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only suit that really matters is spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: e/w have 5 hearts to cash if they get the chance given a heart lead unlikely unless Green finds a double|pg||
nt|starkist: =|pg||
pc|c3|nt|caitlin: I like Rusinow leads by far best|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes easier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is up to carruthers to figure this out|pg||
nt|bbramley: not an easy defense|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: especially in this case|pg||
nt|gowdy: well S has show a 3 suite|pg||
nt|fabsayc: korbel wisely pulls|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|caitlin: gets rid of one heart loser|pg||
pc|s7|nt|shals: the 8 might make pd play the q|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes now he doesnt have to worry about the @Ha|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: the 4-1 spades may slow things down|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club and HK are favourably placed|pg||
nt|raghavan: another H may go on Clubs|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sharynr: 9 easy tricks here. should not take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n porbably going off as not likley to take dim finesse in 3n|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@S however, seems too much|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d has reasonable play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|shals: it still can do damage|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 10|pg||
nt|caitlin: look it how close this match is|pg||
nt|rlebi: he's likely gonna make it now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: took his 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: even Rolan would have doubts about playing 6d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: arggh|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my money is with the defenc|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could make on cross ruff except that fourth heart will be overruffed|pg||
nt|lestergold: this slam has more holes in it than one of them mousetrap cheeses|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D 22 @S king  @C q ruffs out onside  too good for Roland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but it looks makeable|pg||
nt|glen: and the D took care of that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|caitlin: yes Jurek (North) might have made another move|pg||
nt|lestergold: can it be made double dummy?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: 12 tricks looks difficult|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently no does not have quite the entries to south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: both made a cue bid too many - the KH metited an un cue bid if that were possible|pg||
nt|gowdy: ani nteresting push vs 3nt with big upside   sort of shows why slams should have better play thanthis as 5 @D could win big|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: i truely dont understand a club play|pg||
nt|caitlin: E-W played in safe 3D on board 17 for 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|glen: if S had given a @C ruff, it was just ruffing one of declarer's losers|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good line of play for the rest|pg||
nt|starkist: now for sure|pg||
pc|cA|nt|starkist: I like that play|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|caitlin: for 6|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|starkist: that too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: Ithought playing D A first and back with SQ good|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|caitlin: this is not pretty for E-W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this was safer, although diamond ruff unlikely|pg||
pc|h7|nt|caitlin: but if East ducks what now?|pg||
nt|caitlin: low spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy spade exit|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: lost the thread|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|caitlin: np|pg||
nt|caitlin: do we know outcome?|pg||
nt|lestergold: how old are these guys this has the feel of a junior slam|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: yes forgot they have not taken club ace yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may still be juniors|pg||
pc|d7|nt|caitlin: hmm|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gowdy: no  not any more|pg||
nt|lestergold: apparently both early twenties|pg||

mb|4S|nt|thegarve:  Is this the 'Fill in your country' 3Nt - I have a stop do you have a solid suit 3NT overcall|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s*|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: When Ifix the score in the movie it loses the bidding and play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: Willenken seems to have decided that one needs 13 cards to bid at this state of the match|pg||
pc|cK|nt|thegarve:  prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's gotten them to the top spot though|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Everything works|pg||
nt|thegarve:  there is one word that the English hate and it was mentioned on tv again this week - no-one uses gotten|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Amazing, and you could even toss @HK, @DQ and @DJ and replace them with small cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Roy: "that's a good start ... not dead yet"|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its got|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: I think we hate 'gotten' because we are secretly embarrassed at saying 'got'. (Indeed, my teachers always said that we should not use 'got'.)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|thegarve:  ill-gotten gains - but gotten does not exist|pg||

nt|fabsayc: we missed the key defensive play|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dent in the lead perhaps altho could be in 3n in the open going off too|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: david grainger wins the Lord Yarborough cup|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: a little smaller than the Stanley Cup|pg||
nt|sharynr: is this 1NT an upgrade or part of the range?|pg||
nt|susieq: systemically that shows a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
mb|d|nt|susieq: at least according to what I have here|pg||
nt|caitlin: so this is the finals of the CNTC|pg||
nt|glen: 4@C is a splinter, and as you can see from the E hand, partnerships have to agree on how little it can have for working high card points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east hand may actually be above their minimum, but poorly placed|pg||
nt|glen: 4@D here, as played by many experts, is "last train" - last bid below 4@H - it says I like my hand, but may or may not have a @D card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so much depends on cue bid style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last train has its own set of problems|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: seems like a bid showing majors for me|pg||
nt|susieq: oh my mistake- it's a weak notrump, so it just shows values|pg||
nt|sharynr: or just a good old fashioned penalty double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they play Woolsey?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|sharynr: pretty good weakie :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if grainger establishes the spades west must ruff the fourth, leaving losing heart in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S  and I think bid now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid quickly and down quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the least of which is easts 4@S can be ace or king|pg||
nt|glen: for one of the famous Gitelman articles: http://www.imp-bridge.nl/articles/2over1b.htm|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|glen: this is before in moved from toronto, and now names conventions on the songs of vegas acts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna is out of bids in my opinion|pg||
nt|glen: *this was before he|pg||
nt|glen: yup, he was worth 1 try, not 2|pg||
nt|glen: unless their splinters promise a moose (grizzly in BC)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ew needed to get in the bidding here|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N would fare fine|pg||
nt|mcarroll: who will bid NT?|pg||
nt|raghavan: W I presume|pg||
nt|caitlin: I might have bid 2H with Nader's hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if E bids 3@S W may venture 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will bid again S and W 3NT |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt by west down on spade lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: ah it will take a while |pg||
nt|mittmouse: 4s is cols from the n side|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: easy 3@S, and 2@D can be made|pg||
nt|sharynr: risky pass, David should expect a void|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bidding may be riskier|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: this should go down|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is a skinny 2N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: several chances to lead spades|pg||
nt|mittmouse: cold|pg||
pc|sK|nt|caitlin: so then Canada and Mexico vie for spot in Brazil|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: possibly 3@S now|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna is President of Canadian Bridge Federation which sponsors the CNTC's|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like 2@D was cold also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: biddable is not so clear|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|raghavan: RE has bid twice- 5 cards why develop|pg||
pc|sA|nt|caitlin: Bermuda used to be part of that but has spot in Central American zone|pg||
nt|caitlin: for Canadian Bridge Federation CNTC see: http://www.cbf.ca/CNTC/|pg||
nt|caitlin: is this a 2NT catch up bid?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just an overbid in my view|pg||
nt|bbramley: must still guess the @SJ, although east is likely to help on lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bbramley: that lead won't cost|pg||
nt|gambit: every lead gives away something, endplayed trick ! ]\|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: H lead prob|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|caitlin: Darren's 9 asks for spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: C 9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: declarer on the winning line|pg||
nt|lestergold: an auction likely to  be duplicated tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club club and club wuill give declarer a losing option to go down 2|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|sharynr: excellent result for N-S|pg||
nt|caitlin: Darren Wolpert (not to be confused with his brother Galvin) and Czyzowicz are aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|raghavan: S can take 2 Spade only|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gowdy: not sure about that  north has an interesting hand  depends on meathods |pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4s bid is normal becuase either it makes or if it doesnt it prevents e/w  however here i think e/w liimit was 3 dims|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed, 3NT makes EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the carnage if NS declare, nobody wants to know|pg||
nt|caitlin: I believe reverse smith echo here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moose here also|pg||
pc|cA|nt|caitlin: sorry Gavin |pg||
nt|caitlin: it is Darren|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now turner is confused, looks like partner was trying to find entry for a heart through declarer|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c9|nt|raghavan: 2 S + C A + H A|pg||
nt|caitlin: so Wolpert's @C7 says I do not like hearts|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but quite a play problem|pg||
nt|raghavan: Which is the 9th trick? |pg||

nt|caitlin: by passed hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey just asking|pg||
nt|caitlin: why not drury then?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|shals: yes it is|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why i said it was tame as the cards lie not in an absoluiter sense|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Karen our operator?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but does he have a losing alternative, perhaps not|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Karen:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I almost fell asleep in the sun:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so he has to establish clubs and that means spades will be established and he cannot lose the lead again|pg||
nt|lestergold: so its a one shot contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharynr: good stop by E-W|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Gowdy:)|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  four rounds to play in COPC; we'll announce leaders when posted|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 1 or numerous overtricks on this defense|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome|pg||
pc|hT|nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: what if korbel ducks two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then the hearts squeeze hanna|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharynr: looks like N-S make 21H so even down 1 is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry, they are playing too fast and lost thread |pg||
nt|sharynr: but that was a reasonable shift|pg||
nt|mittmouse: technically hanna should now try a club if that is wrong he has to take a s finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: good point G|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so saved by the diamond 9 then|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or possibly cash @Ss to check if they are 3-3 or the J falls, then 2 top @Cs|pg||
nt|raghavan: finessing towards w is likely - since W may not know that H K is alone|pg||
nt|caitlin: he will finesse West for @DQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna will try K then lead low to the Q better odds than playing anything else|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|caitlin: I think any bid showing spade support would have turned Turner on:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: crosby doing pushups with the cup|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green gave count|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna knows that the ace will be held up otherwise|pg||
nt|caitlin: so David Grainger and Daniel Korbel|pg||
nt|lestergold: better unblock hearts now he will of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did he really pitch a heart?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he did hes dead|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|shals: woops this is going to be tough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a crystal ball tuner, Mike|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gavin: 2 down with a winning finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks misere from here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching a spade gives up any chance of a make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: for me 3@C would be clubs only|pg||
nt|caitlin: I see 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: good save against 2@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: upside down|pg||
nt|glen: yes, but he was doing it in hope to entice a @S play|pg||
mc|11|nt|caitlin: no X no trouble?|pg||
nt|shals: maybe|pg||
nt|caitlin: let's remember these guys may be TIRED|pg||
nt|gavin: oh ya, this is a gruelling event to say the least|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Now discussing 6@h - I think something about good opening lead and might have to guess a little bit|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H was easy and would surely be bid, so the bent 2NT may not have affected things too much. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: It's gotten some interesting discussion though :)|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Welland is disappointed to hold only a five-card major for his NT bid this time.|pg||
nt|henryb: the fact that they are off two aces would not affect the possibility surely? :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  well you have a world series which is only played in USA  so you must be right|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He wants some swings, it's Chris' fault for not getting rid of some cards|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Let's stop this Europe-USA banter|pg||

nt|brolucius: I took a look at yesterday's bulletin (edited by Suzi Subeck), to see the story about the three players who were fined for smoking. It was a good issue, with plenty of jokes and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: plenty of deals. That's how we like it.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: They are doubled there also|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i agree they have very good jokes|pg||
nt|henryb: I assume Garner has found 4@s|pg||

nt|sharynr: and Hanna must have taken that line|pg||
nt|gavin: hughest hand is way too strong for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
nt|gavin: very difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no down 1 on this defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the interesting defense would have been to start with a high club|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mittmouse: i think he must have done it right good technique by hanna|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needed 6 hearts for his overcall, so finesse long odds at the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator says it was a heart discarded|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: Would anyone open east hand and if so, what|pg||
nt|gavin: too strong for 2C then 2nt too|pg||
nt|shals: and hockey city|pg||
nt|gavin: so many slams where partner doesnt show interest|pg||
nt|gavin: 1D is a reasonable choice |pg||
nt|raghavan: Part score deal|pg||
nt|caitlin: a constructive 2@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: in which case unless im missing something it was a bad error|pg||
mb|p|nt|susieq: I would open 3@D but I'm a little crazy|pg||
nt|caitlin: whereas if he were weaker he would first bid 1NT then 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise  2 spades 2 clubs 5 hearts and contract made|pg||
nt|starkist: all I know is I'm leading the @h j on this hand|pg||
nt|bbramley: @H8 is the key card|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: both k's are working|pg||
nt|susieq: that's fit showing|pg||
nt|caitlin: Turner will pass I assume|pg||
nt|gambit: Will C balance? I thk y|pg||
nt|gavin: this auction would almost always be 4-6 or 5-6|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to picture partner with a hand good enough for this action that doesnt have 6 diamonds |pg||
nt|gavin: turner has a monster|pg||
nt|gavin: (given the state of the auction)|pg||
nt|gavin: with  aspade stopper and 3 diamonds and the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|gavin: i think he owes hughes 2 or 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: 1nt = @C|pg||
nt|gowdy: suit or a lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: interesting choice to bid 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may regret not playing 4@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4333 often plays at least a trick better in 4 of a major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 4@S an easier contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: neither is very good|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, 3D, and the QH, extras given his pass, but monster, No.....a couiple modest redeeming features, |pg||
nt|mcarroll: On Board 1 I see they did prefer the Moysian @S fit rather than @Cs and it cost 11 imps|pg||
nt|caitlin: they play constructive so 2@S 8-10 HCP|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is not forward going, but Jurek still tempted|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3@S is preemptive not constructive|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes some play 1@S 2@S 3@S stop|pg||
nt|caitlin: I personally don't like it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as there is no entry to Dummy, on a @D lead to take advantage of a discard on the @HA 4 @S goes down|pg||
nt|raghavan: S is trying to prevent EW going to 3H and later if he ventured - may be doubled - Of course he does not know N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that does not automatically beat hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And there are slow @C losers|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: nice hand for fit showing|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|capercliff: even with both K's working hard to see 10 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|caitlin: given their lead there is no reason to push to 4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gavin: he cant have a better hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: We cannot find fault with N for his bidding|pg||
nt|caitlin: well if they play 1S 2S 3S stop we can|pg||
nt|starkist: darn need to play xfer lead doubles|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharynr: 4@S might have been reached (and made)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think green should have tried 3@D in that case|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this is a steal im surprised green didnt bid 3d then hanna would bid 4s |pg||
nt|sharynr: but as is the case when both sides make a major suit game, the bidding might not have stopped at the 4 level|pg||
nt|gavin: funny to balance your opponents from 1D into 3NT|pg||
nt|caitlin: how true|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has maximum for his 2S bid|pg||
nt|glen: the 2/1 way to make a 3 card limit raise - 1NT (forcing/semi-forcing), then 3 of the major|pg||
pc|s4|nt|capercliff: good things H's are 3-3 or this would be really ugly|pg||
nt|capercliff: cancel that|pg||
nt|capercliff: even I could make 4 tricks with this @h suit:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in no trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: what out what you ask for|pg||
nt|gavin: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: czyz will have an easy time finding hte club shift|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems down if defense passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have stayed low nough to make  a plus|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gavin: the king of spades asks his partner to unblock an honor or give him upside down count|pg||
nt|caitlin: he showed it with constructive raise|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gambit: this will go down quickly |pg||
nt|gambit: as a plus |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict slowly|pg||
nt|gambit: you know David? Methodical |pg||
nt|gavin: when south gets in with the first diamond|pg||
nt|gavin: he will undoubtedly lead a spade|pg||
nt|gavin: since his partner lead the king, thats their power lead he knows that he has a GREAT spade suit|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to know if he has 5 or 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad spade break and poor communications with dummy would make higher level contracts very precarious|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|gambit: 3-2 diamonds would work losing 1 diamond, 3 spades|pg||
nt|rlebi: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: some problems now for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the simplest solution, finesse the club|pg||
nt|caitlin: he has to|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: brave play, minimizing the loss|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: why rush with ace of dim?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was a mistake but afraid hanna would draw partners lone trump|pg||
pc|c3|nt|caitlin: then how back to hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: finessing @Ds against North??|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharynr: i am sure NS would have pushed to th5 5-level|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky spade position|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mittmouse: look at what that fit showing jump did for graingers hand he would have bid to the 5 level if necessary|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had Hanna tried 8s it would have been very revealing!!|pg||
nt|mittmouse: carruthers must have missed a spot|pg||
nt|starkist: teasing @d10 play|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: this is why i hesistated with my comment, was not at all clear|pg||
nt|gavin: that was an odd play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond lead would have made this tougher, but i think still makes|pg||
nt|glen: yes, the @D lead head towards a forcing defense|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|glen: the idea being to play @Ds at all chances|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: contract still in jeapordy tho|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gavin: and darren playing the queen of diamonds was bad also|pg||
nt|gavin: only lying to his partner|pg||
nt|caitlin: this has not been a lucky 3rd or beginning of 4th set for Carruthers team|pg||
nt|gowdy: a new variation  pitch a winner on a loser   but maintain control|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c8|pc|d4|nt|starkist: didn't he have to duck as the only hope?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: lucky for him partner didnt have a black ace|pg||
nt|bbramley: he had 2 hopes: @HAJ8 with west, or a @D entry with west|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another mistake by declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|caitlin: I am sure many have TV's on for NHL|pg||
nt|caitlin: Wolpert should wonder why Green took @CA and returned spade|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|caitlin: a chance to finesse|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a gruelling event|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think they are all getting very tired|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it was down if that was play|pg||
nt|caitlin: as is our great operator Karen|pg||
pc|c5|nt|caitlin: an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: finesse gains nothing, as can always elope the small trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|mc|8|nt|gavin: id put money that this is no worse than a push for them|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to believe that grainger and korbel , easily the most aggressive pair in the event are not in a game on this hand|pg||

nt|thegarve:  a footballer was asked by some lads - what can you do what I cannot do?|pg||
nt|henryb: the opening @d lead will not terrify Willenken|pg||
nt|brolucius: They were also docked 9 qualification points for next year's trials. Quite a severe penalty.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mtvesuvius: Right, that's a real big penalty|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: As Chris was considering his pitch on the 4th diamond, Roy said, pointing at club, "make sure you don't pitch any of that 234 suit"|pg||
nt|thegarve:  how do the pints work?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  points|pg||
nt|henryb: You get points for performance in the Spingold, Reisinger, Vanderbilt and Trials|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very inconsiderate to have the USA trials and Euro Championships at the same time|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|thegarve:  makes life hard for Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: It takes many months to accumulate 9 points.....  and 2 minutes to lose them.|pg||
nt|henryb: About 100 for winning the VS, 80 for winning the R|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do the politicians ever sit down together and get it sorted out I wonder|pg||
nt|henryb: points reduce for lesser performance|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I doubt it, but it's certainly unfortunate|pg||
nt|thegarve:  more to the point - who ran to mummy and cried foul play?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they did, there would be three big events on together.|pg||
nt|henryb: not actually politicians who do this, Roland; it is a committee of the participants|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We have had some discussions about that and will try to coordinate better in the future - but it is difficult for everyone to avoid conflicts with other important events|pg||
nt|brolucius: Tournament directors have breath-testing kits nowadays. |pg||
nt|thegarve:  euros and american trials seem independent so not unreasonable|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, it is a Euro Open event, so all can play.|pg||
nt|henryb: takes about two quarterfinal KO appearances or one SF to get a bye out of the RR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The hotel has a $250 charge for cleaning a room if someone has smoked in it; their staff noticed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To be fair, the US trials were scheduled long time before the Euro Open. Would it have been a disaster to let the Europeans start 3 or 4 days later in order to get more ...|pg||

nt|bbramley: but still no reason to duck 2nd @H in either case|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: what to bid...|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 4 OR smart to be in 3@D making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 22|pg||
nt|shals: intersting all over the scoe bd|pg||
nt|caitlin: Karen how did you land up operating in Penticton if you are American?|pg||
nt|glen: for a close final quarter, this table is moving quickly, which is nice for everybody watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not for me :)|pg||
nt|starkist: throwing away down tricks|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2N|nt|capercliff: 2@h is never enough these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: British Columbia|pg||
nt|glen: true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess "dont watch" wont work|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: monster super accept for cz|pg||
nt|gavin: tough to avoid slam on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: joey cant have side ace?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: its on a finesse but they have so many wasted points|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: but they always bid 3nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: how does everyone feel about 3N?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Silver made 5@d on the second hand, for 8 imps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|caitlin: tell us later:)|pg||
nt|rlebi: no take A no get A|pg||
nt|rlebi: @s|pg||
nt|starkist: risky to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Silver laughed when he saw dummy: "and hope you make it partner" |pg||
nt|fabsayc: guess that answers my question :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: so i like to have a semblance of a side entry for 3 preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is "normal"|pg||
nt|gavin: ok obviously not as tough as i thought|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|gavin: i guess 2nt was 20-22|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 1 OR Silver bid 1@S over 1@H overcall......did Carruthers assume he had 5?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on the bidding declarer probably should finess through N for @SJ to cater for a 4-1 break - which does not cost in this instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h does jam the auction nicely, you know if you double partner is bound to bid 4m|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is better than 22|pg||
nt|gavin: so darren could see it wasnt going to be great even opposite a super accept|pg||
nt|gavin: i agree|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't you bid 2c then 2n?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah, opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: 6@D is a reasonable spot with the bonus of making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H will make|pg||
nt|glen: this setups a possible @H discard, and a lot depends on how declarer places the cards|pg||
nt|bbramley: good cash|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: 2@H makes|pg||
nt|caitlin: loses 1@H 2@S 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c makes as played by west|pg||
nt|caitlin: very tough to get to|pg||
nt|gowdy: Karen  if there is a break in the action tell Green that I shot 78 today   Thanks :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: hey Gowdy awesome:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharynr: but both bd 20 and 22 will swing the match the other way, i predict|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6D makes 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but assuming a direct raise of diamonds was forcing, this is not a strong sequence |pg||
nt|caitlin: run clubs get rid of 2 hearts ruff a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: all up to North to shoot for it or not|pg||
nt|caitlin: don't love my J9 of @D but hey...life isn't perfect|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades 2-2 so this "should" not present problems|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|shals: wow spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my par 3 score|pg||
nt|caitlin: and I know nada about golf except a) scores b) I love Tiger:)|pg||
nt|glen: for us seeing all 4 hands, use @D K to discard @H, ace and another @H ruff, draw trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: simplest approach is ruffing heart hook|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if it loses defense can not hurt you|pg||
nt|glen: @H lead would have set it if rest of D okay|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would agree with 3NT|pg||
nt|capercliff: he also knows now it was based on 6 card suit so rates to have a singelton somewhere|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H was a FSF even tho a forcing auction|pg||
nt|caitlin: letting pd know game is there |pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: maybe, but that is not the only way to play 2@H|pg||
nt|gavin: im not a fan of trump lead w/ xxx in clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gavin: thk u need to be more aggressive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart king seems very normal lead|pg||
nt|gavin: when you dont have controls in reversers opening suit|pg||
nt|shals: 6 do you think could be made?|pg||
nt|shals: I guess|pg||
nt|caitlin: sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: that may NOT be a push|pg||
nt|shals: probably not|pg||
nt|shals: 2c might have helped|pg||
nt|shals: toobad|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: not in Canada|pg||
nt|caitlin: good point made: what doesn't Wolpert bid 3@D instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|gavin: i think 2H they use as their slowdown bid|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really??|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: the only lead to hold this to 4|pg||
nt|glen: establishing 1@H, 2@C, 1@D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gavin: it says ive got garbage and i will likely pass ur next bid|pg||
nt|gavin: thats why cyz had to bid more than 3C |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|caitlin: it is 100% forcing|pg||
nt|gavin: cause he was afraid of his partner passing|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Gavin|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: aha he must have pitched a heart on the diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not sure how the play went for the last two tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry :(|pg||
pc|s9|nt|caitlin: now diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|caitlin: I thought it was doubled???|pg||
nt|lestergold: club ruff to be found buty i doubt it|pg||
nt|caitlin: and the obvious lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Jim wants to know what you did on the back 9?|pg||
nt|lestergold: have to go for dinner so bye all for now |pg||
nt|caitlin: bye and thanks:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Zia asks about 1@h - Roy: "usually 2-3 hearts, not 4, once in a while 1"|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: No reason to think that 1NT will play better than 1@H, so perhaps he wanted to shut out the spades.|pg||

nt|gavin: np|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is Gavin Wolpert|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing but weak caitlin, then 3@C would be limited reverse and not forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you think Mr Kokish will visit the open room|pg||
nt|shals: should we expcet him/|pg||
nt|caitlin: if so 110 isn't right score|pg||
nt|gowdy: thanks  nice job|pg||
nt|lestergold: my pleasure Caitlin|pg||
nt|bbramley: tough to give up on a beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: potentially 0 cover cards|pg||
nt|sharynr: A unusual weak 2 by Hanna|pg||
nt|susieq: that's a pretty heavy 2@S bid nv|pg||
nt|gavin: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is why Jurek did not try for slam over 4@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have been facing xxxx in diamonds for example|pg||
nt|shals: expect ie|pg||
nt|caitlin: just ask Eric to go to Peter Chung King and he will come to ANY table:)|pg||
nt|shals: ahh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not doubled|pg||
nt|caitlin: great response by Jim:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is East Jim Green|pg||
nt|glen: np, 1st priority is to get right result in|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2nd priority is to get Korbel to update his bridge blog|pg||
nt|glen: with actual play of hand|pg||
nt|rlebi: quite a few tricks available|pg||
nt|susieq: he's got some hands from the Cavendish in Vegas to put in as well before he gets to this :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|glen: Korbel alerts pass of 2NT to mean "i'm not blogging this hand"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: opening 3@H would have blown out N/S|pg||
nt|starkist: I don't like to have 7 for wk 2|pg||
mb|1N|nt|caitlin: btw Mohmad Ali is at the NHL game wearing a Red Wing Jersey:) *IMPORTANT information:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have advertising space available on my chest also :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anybody know what 4@C is|pg||
nt|glen: well, we can't use the G word can we|pg||
nt|mittmouse: bart do u think its right in a long match where people are tired not to claim and let them work to try to beat it|pg||
nt|bbramley: agree about 7|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: silver asking for the same dummy this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: i guess Jim has seen his partner's weak 2's before|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry won't go for what Ali's goes for:)|pg||
nt|gavin: go pittsburgh!|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|gavin: im in sweden for about 7 more hours, no hockey on normal TV here :( |pg||
nt|caitlin: we will keep you up to date Gavin|pg||
nt|caitlin: I have Tom in the lobby letting me know all:)|pg||
nt|gavin: looks like down a couple in 3 diamonds, ew can make 3C|pg||
nt|shals: what does that indicate?|pg||
nt|caitlin: raise in diamonds|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: limit|pg||
nt|caitlin: our vugraph operator, Karen, says it wasn't doubled|pg||
nt|gowdy: againd 4 @S and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4+|pg||
nt|caitlin: Korbel thinking of raising|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gavin: i think its a mixed raise , we will see based on norths response|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry I thought S doubled again and it was left in|pg||
nt|bbramley: george, not in general|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: worked out well for him|pg||
mb|2S|nt|raghavan: Ellen and Martin - what will N play now after SQ - will he play club small??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably win and shift to a club, although that does not look hopeful|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he overtakes that is his only hope|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps a heart better|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Martin?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that is what he is thinking about, I would opt forsmall@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: attacking communication|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be the Green convention|pg||
nt|glen: yes, Green convention, asking for aces|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H likely showed 0 or 3 aces (E suspects 3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is fine if you don't do it also on garbage hands|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect!|pg||
nt|shals: yep|pg||
nt|caitlin: asking re minor which can't be clubs|pg||
nt|glen: 5@C confirms all aces, and now W has good playing value if E has the right hand opposite|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: I wonder whom you are rooting for Gavin?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: pittsburgh !!! oh my brother|pg||
nt|shals: good stop I think|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see......not so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: and which is more important?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good choice |pg||
nt|capercliff: normal with a stiff honor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: anyone know what 2Nt asked for|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|starkist: what a steal this was|pg||
nt|bbramley: and he's going to make 2@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|capercliff: @s lead will hold it to 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: may have been singleton?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Pittsburgh on a power play|pg||
nt|shals: no stoppers in clubs for nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: that would be too lucky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really ugly lead problem for hanna|pg||
nt|gowdy: may lose 2 @S here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gowdy: not now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh my|pg||
nt|glen: and only a ruff can beat this 7NT|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rlebi: unusual but effective auction|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: i don't think this auction calls for trump lead either|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wouldnt think so|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I caught all the play on that one :)|pg||
nt|glen: lol :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all 139 spectators are sworn to not tell roland|pg||
nt|rlebi: 16 imp diff now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin: wheres the contract that consents if detroit wins my bro wins ? ill sign |pg||
nt|fabsayc: Jxx and Jx are ugly for trump lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: 8 boards - 2 imps a board until a playoff|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: but is hard to see why a spade is best|pg||
nt|caitlin: nada tricks for NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this right??|pg||
nt|mcarroll: K worked better|pg||
nt|raghavan: fell in the trap- 2Club tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well now a heart seems clear|pg||
nt|caitlin: it's right he played North for KQ tight|pg||
nt|gowdy: tuff lead     this looks normal|pg||
nt|caitlin: what else to lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass right to dummy|pg||
nt|caitlin: underlead a heart to stiff @HK??|pg||
nt|caitlin: can't be or he would have clubs:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: a few|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart or club ace were clearly alternatives, also with their losing cases|pg||
nt|caitlin: low heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna thinking of winning clearing trump|pg||
nt|caitlin: ???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he cant do that, would have no chance then|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|caitlin: :) so blood is thicker than hockey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck again looks best|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharynr: well my predictions stink....bd 20 open room in 4@D DBL|pg||
nt|gavin: its amazing how often ducking to keep control in trumps is right when they break bad and you have length w/ the ace|pg||
nt|gavin: both as defender or declarer|pg||
nt|gavin: unless you clearly need to clear trumps ASAP , its better not to win your ace until the last chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or 3@D|pg||
nt|starkist: then a shoot off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely not two overtricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just making|pg||
nt|rlebi: sudden death|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: typo|pg||
nt|bbramley: all the same impwise, for making 110, 140 or 170|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: fixed it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: yes very imaginative by jurek|pg||
nt|raghavan: He wants D|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: declarer has to play diamonds|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this defense may cost a trick|pg||
nt|shals: would one think of 1n first?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: claim time|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is not going to make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gavin: unless he guessed the singleton king of hearts in the first place he couldnt make after turner ducked two rounds of spades|pg||
nt|gavin: which could not happen|pg||
nt|caitlin: true enough|pg||
nt|caitlin: so N will get his diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now a diamond, but which one|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|caitlin: not with 5Ds|pg||
nt|caitlin: that would certainly help E-W find clubs I think|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharynr: well this cant help but fail|pg||
nt|caitlin: anything now gives it to declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharynr: was there really a claim to make 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: y|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what|pg||
nt|sharynr: where did the @H oser go?|pg||
nt|sharynr: loser|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: korbel: "sorry i lost a trick"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is barely possible if defense did not take their clubs|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|caitlin: how did he make it?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|caitlin: well folks.....I think I will call it a night...we have lots of sessions tomorrow|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Open Room replicated the 1NT-3NT auction on board 6|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting, both not wanting to miss an early Vul game|pg||
nt|sharynr: but they did|pg||
nt|gavin: his low heart play would work any time hearts were 3-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north forced to give east a spade trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4H + 2C+1D\|pg||
nt|gowdy: ruff a @C draw trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes john|pg||
nt|susieq: the cards are definitely going East-West this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: 2@H both majors?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E thinks his hand is too good for an old fashioned 3@d bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes shows both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: he needed to keep his ace of hearts in his hand for an entry to draw trumps after he leads up towards his jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so always makes if declarer plays right|pg||
nt|raghavan: a part score deal I hope EW do not jump to game in a Major|pg||
nt|chorush: there was no flannery. what would he be upset about?|pg||
nt|starkist: chugging contest|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in that case 2@S by east can be natural or artificial, you need to discuss a defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is S worth an immediate 4@S?|pg||
nt|gavin: very tough hand will be interesting to see the line in the other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 10-1 somebody bids game|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: Obviously he thinks so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe too strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S AND 4@H are both feasible|pg||
nt|gavin: unlikely he will leave them there|pg||
nt|gavin: 7-4 white vs red|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green does not have to accept transfer|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will reject transfer and bid 3S|pg||
nt|rlebi: wrong sided for @Ss already|pg||
nt|rlebi: better stay low for a plus|pg||
nt|starkist: canoe race|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: 5@D in big trouble|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 5@c is better, best defence can get 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: must be a @h lead for 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: anything else is 500|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to lead a @H fromS, @S the obvious lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club ruff and heart heart switch works also|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont believe you can gain a trick by claiming if it is impossible to  make it....and in that defense they could not make a mistake?|pg||
nt|caitlin: best to lead trump|pg||
nt|starkist: snowball fight|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: will any director out there agree?|pg||
nt|rlebi: sry, dreaming here|pg||
nt|glen: could declarer draw all the trumps and pick up @Ds?|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. just lose to the @D ace if guesses suit right|pg||
nt|rlebi: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S presumably no singleton and extras, and for that hand he is close to minimum|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: not clear, but more likely daniel ducked heart|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hoping declarer would play the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: or S and switch|pg||
nt|gowdy: coffee time |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast they may bid slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs three diamonds so percentage is finesse of queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: yes that works as well Martin|pg||
nt|capercliff: no doub!!!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: I guess that is what happened martin, since daniel apologized|pg||
mb|5C|nt|capercliff: must be joking|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: guess he didnt think he was taking even 1 @s trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was the problem with 4@S, did not invite partner to participate|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he did open|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb...barbecue going:)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: or at least try for it|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 S  strong H raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: if Hanna is going to bid it should be 4@S|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S = he skipped a @H cuebid, since minimum for 3@S|pg||
nt|rlebi: he didnt bid 4@s,did he?|pg||
nt|glen: the question is whether he plays serious 3NT or not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have based on hand overall minimum|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. EW|pg||

nt|caitlin: a splinter with 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|gowdy: no 3S artifical|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh|pg||
nt|gowdy: smolen|pg||
nt|caitlin: smolen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a splinter, can be balanced or singleton spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or perhaps unspecified splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT asks for a second suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just in case partner has both majors|pg||
nt|rlebi: not too many imps gonna swing on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: trump switch?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe heart to king now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many ways to play that bid|pg||
nt|rlebi: running low on boards|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: NV vs vul, shows 8 major cards and a lot of hope :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: from N's perspective his partner is weak for 4@s|pg||
nt|raghavan: If at all I have to bid - I will bid 4S - He has 2 Spades but no guarentee that E will have 2 Hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: serious 3nt would help a lot on this specific auction|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: well not sure what turner signal meant|pg||
nt|bbramley: will the bridge cops let them finish?|pg||
nt|starkist: flash suggested tree climb good for that area|pg||
nt|rlebi: there is a precedent for that|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hughes knows the entries wrong for trump leads|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah i think a trump lead on the go was best from his hand|pg||
nt|gavin: when partner bids vul against not , its very likely he was bidding to make|pg||
nt|gambit: Diamond to the queen/ King...then trump from my good friend, David Turner |pg||
nt|caitlin: Welcome gambit (Cam French)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is the Canadian Society of Commentators CSofC:)|pg||
nt|gambit: TY Caitlin great to see my compatriots competing|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed|pg||
nt|rlebi: l'ecuyer could slow down the pace - while in the lead - run em out of time|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|gowdy: yes 3 of the other major after 2c and a major response is artifical showing the strongest support raise |pg||
nt|fabsayc: here comes an imp|pg||
nt|bbramley: close matches automatically slow down at the end - and why not? when you KNOW it's close you grind out every imp|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact his only chance on this hand is to actually draw trumps then eventually guess clubs|pg||
nt|caitlin: end of first period 0-0 btw|pg||
nt|gavin: thx|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|gavin: he was hoping to see singleton jack of hearts so he could go over to dummy to lead clubs up twice (once with heart and once with diamond)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not really garbage stayman, intent is to pass any rebid|pg||

nt|gavin: isnt that what garbage stayman is ? sry if i missspoke|pg||
nt|caitlin: well Gavin I call it that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: KCB will identify a possible loser, so no 7|pg||
nt|gavin: this is a baby slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3nt here is a brick   4 H is in some trouble|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is away from the city so does not disturb anybody|pg||
nt|susieq: 2am is too... here they never close|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|gavin: and easy to avoid 7 as martin said|pg||
nt|gavin: but its definitely good practise to play 6NT|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 imps better and safer|pg||
nt|gavin: 2 imps|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|raghavan: good bid by N|pg||
nt|rlebi: big potential  swing hand here|pg||
nt|rlebi: very easy to get to nonmaking Slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 5@H too expensive a sacrifice|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3nt only makes because diamonds blocked and club jack onside, single dummy 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D blocked  le tthem set them up  3nt is on the J or no club lead|pg||
nt|starkist: we play this position 10-12, cowards|pg||
mb|3S|nt|caitlin: but I know many WC Cohen Gitelman Bergen etc who call it takeout of 2C|pg||

nt|raghavan: oh???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: drury auction,, should be a making contract|pg||
nt|gavin: spec points out east hand so strong for 4M that maybe its too strong to open 1NT, tough decision|pg||
nt|rlebi: very easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: if the @c honors were split it wouldnt|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not realistic I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: in the effort to getting to 6NT it would have been better for him to bid 3S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gavin: to hear from partner that they have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|gavin: he did what he did to find out about the king of spades i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i dont like any of these bids|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction calls for a trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: garbage stayman to me is when you rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek described an entirely different hand|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|gavin: cool i just figured ur bidding stayman with garbage either way|pg||

nt|fabsayc: like gavin said, i dont agree with 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: the problem that happened here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless 4@H can be a singleton, but that does not make sense|pg||
nt|gavin: was his partner didnt bid 2NT over 2D|pg||
nt|gavin: so he really has no idea how good his hearts are|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: pittsburg|pg||
nt|gavin: i have complete sympathy in the auction he created for himself why he chose to end in 6D over 6NT|pg||
nt|gavin: i just think he should have constructed the auction better to help himself get to 6NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 35 in majors with 9 count perhaps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gavin: i guess some ppl dont play 2H is weak over 2D so if youre discussing garbage stayman , thats what you are talking about|pg||

nt|thegarve:  swing chance if he finds the safer @c as he should - may even lead a@h|pg||

nt|gavin: seems like u can see that if u start hearts their club losers can go away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somehow silver made 6nt on 23|pg||
nt|gavin: very rare that u will need to take heart ruff and u dont get clubs back as a trade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which looks impossible unless a club opening lead|pg||
nt|gavin: a club lead is impossible|pg||
nt|gavin: but playing 6nt over 6s seems bizarre|pg||

nt|gavin: no matter how bad my hand is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 3@C game forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: repeated diamond leads would beat this hand i think|pg||
nt|glen: swing to Carruthers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that hanna has any reason to find that defense|pg||

mb|1C|mb|2C|nt|Vugraphu1: Bob never talks at the table|pg||
mb|3S|an|Splinter|nt|brolucius: Now "@S can be used to show a good club raise. No, he has preferred a splinter bid of 3@S.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is a splinter I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Once in a while when Zia gets too chatty, Bob tells him to be quiet|pg||
nt|brolucius: ...2@S for the sound raise....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: We saw that a few times yesterday|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Zia wrote "short" on the notepad for Roy|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Many use 2M to show a stopper for NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|thegarve:  4@D is a thoughtfull call - 4@h next|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Interesting @d duck|pg||
nt|thegarve:  ahh missed a trick just -1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe they would have taken a minus score somewhere.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Roy leaning on his elbow on the table, thinking, now leans back to study his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: which looks almost like what you see on the screen, except he has the diamond 9 and club 5 - I missed  spots when he played those suits :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now he has to ruff out the @H suit for -1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to see what other option is available.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: THinking about whether Hamman's heart Q was honest, I imagine|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the Ws pressure bidding is finally having an effect|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Roy just turned to look at the clock, obviously making sure he had time to give this more thought|pg||
nt|migry:  can hardly be honest |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: @HQ obviously can't be stiff, but might be wondering about QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|migry:  can be from QJ10, QJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Or maybe what he can do if it's QJ 4th?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @HQ has caused declarer to worry a bit, but it hardly seems that it can have any beneficial effect in the long run.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: In that case he would have to take a ruffing @h finesse against Hamman|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now Roy asks Zia what other bids Hamman had available over 2@c: 2@d would be non-forcing, 2@h would have been good with clubs, 2@s would have been good with diamonds, 3@d would ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: have been invitational|pg||

nt|bbramley: 30 imps, 5 boards to go|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gavin: looks like the defense can hold this to 4 with a spade lead|pg||
nt|gavin: 4H looks like a pretty good spot, as does 5D but it looks like nothing can make|pg||
nt|raghavan: a dangerous hand for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: may land in 6H with bad results|pg||
nt|mcarroll: very true|pg||
nt|gowdy: now this " slam"  won't be as much fun|pg||
nt|mcarroll: their best suit fit is full of holes|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3S|nt|gavin: though the diamonds look like a standout from south, leavin north up to cashing the ace of spades when he gets in with the ace of hearts or it goes away|pg||
nt|rlebi: how many???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two way stayman|pg||
nt|bbramley: can E/W get to 3NT?|pg||
nt|bbramley: not any more!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: north must have underlead spade when in with heart ace|pg||
nt|glen: 1NT is 12-14, 2@D game forcing stayman|pg||
mb|d|nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact ew in the open room freely bid themselves to 5, lucky to survive|pg||
nt|caitlin: @DQ led and then declarer claimed it seems???|pg||
nt|gavin: though unlucky to catch AD opposite void|pg||
nt|gavin: specs suggesting 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt will make|pg||
nt|caitlin: So Czyz is from Ottawa|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not the Roland F wor?>|pg||
nt|raghavan: No they may stop in 4H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6NT is better but down also|pg||
nt|caitlin: capitol of Canada|pg||
nt|gowdy: Is this flannery  or weak with Majors |pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H shows 5-4 or vul 5-5|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is some strong 2@H bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|rlebi: the answer was 3|pg||
nt|gambit: other table 5c -1 |pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: or operator missed auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: good spot|pg||
nt|gavin: seems hard to unravvel your tricks but i guess they end up just coming to you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 44 possible not vul|pg||
nt|caitlin: not necessarily so weak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It will be very hard for S to stop in game opposite an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: going out on a limb and predicting this will make in under 5 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you believe that story?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: they claimed very fast|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gowdy the teacher may approve  that having another Major- I should not pre empt. Also here N has 11 points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the best one we have seen|pg||
nt|caitlin: no 2@H shows both majors|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh are they playing Flannery?|pg||
nt|caitlin: either 5-4 or vul 5-5 or non vul could even be 4-4|pg||
nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not Flannery, is called Ekren in Europe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the winning amount|pg||
nt|rlebi: oops|pg||
nt|rlebi: just right|pg||
pc|sK|nt|capercliff: N/S playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|glen: so he drops 2@Ss, 2@Hs, and ummm?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|gowdy: if 2 D shows a bad weak two  then 2 H shows a very good one|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharynr: i think you are right!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a bit harder from south seat|pg||
nt|gavin: yeh seems fine to win in either hand and knock out the king of diamonds, eventually u just cash your tricks and exit with a heart and the defense will be forced to give you your ...|pg||
nt|gavin: club and spade trick in dummy|pg||
nt|bbramley: on their way to 300|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: 2@C can be singleton, 2@D rebid promises 4|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes, 2c can be 2 or more|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4531 i think would rebid 2@C also|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: at least i think that's Wolpert just said :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: why? North wins HA can play SA|pg||
nt|caitlin: ooooooops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: here we go|pg||
nt|raghavan: Putting head under a sword?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: misplaced major jack, else a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: this should be double key card     6 key card  4 aces and 2 major suit kings|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wonder if this is asking re: 5 controls for hearts and spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6 I mean:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be double key card, not clear which suit is agreed|pg||
nt|caitlin: hearts|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gavin: after the 1D opening bid, south definitely should not lead a diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or underlead it for the set|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to pick from his doubletons|pg||
nt|gowdy: 11 to 13 |pg||
nt|caitlin: ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed vul against not with defense no reason to bid 4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|caitlin: he did not cash SA|pg||
nt|gavin: wrong one , now cyz has to cash ace of spades to hold to 5 |pg||
nt|gavin: fly ace|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact north should fly ace of hearts and play a club|pg||
nt|caitlin: on this lead clubs going nowhere nor hearts for defense..more likely to cash out|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Gavin?|pg||
nt|caitlin: this could be singleton?|pg||
nt|gavin: cause of the lead ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe in 4 that isnt such a winning defence since the club ruff would be 3rd trick, he needs a spade honor from partner to beat|pg||
nt|gavin: so might as well hope its kx and thats why partner was afraid to lead it|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is 5@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they get to 6@H E will be very careful not to double in case they run to a making 6NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: what does 5S mean |pg||
nt|glen: bonus for operator: play will be quick|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this type of auction clubs often the weakest suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if responder has club fit would tend to rebid 2@S not 2nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: Wolpert taking his time with this one|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will overtake and finesse I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some minor communication issues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On a @C lead will succeed if the !Q is played, which is I think the correct technical play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a surprise this, a @c from the east hand cant hurt him|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needs to pitch a diamond if 3rd heart lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: i hear the fat lady warming up ..|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|capercliff: assuming he overtakes and finesses the @d again|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|raghavan: Martin you are right as always|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is good to read the Hobbit trilogy|pg||
nt|raghavan: I maeant NO DOUBLE|pg||
nt|caitlin: for sure no double|pg||
nt|caitlin: you never know if 6N will make which it does not here|pg||
nt|glen: in the other room, on board 8, they are also using the Green convention|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: director has been called|pg||
nt|glen: what for i wonder?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: a spade back would be embarassing if jack wrong|pg||
nt|mcarroll: small @H from N at trick 2 would have worked|pg||
nt|capercliff: yah and when @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4-2 sry|pg||
nt|capercliff: if the K@c was wrong he could go off now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Would have 4@H,3@D 1@C and 1@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtaking with the J at trick one was 100%|pg||
nt|gowdy: 9 @C  and the @H now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gavin: very thoughtfull play|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|glen: maybe its zero tolerance, as they have zero chance of beating the doubled contract|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no overtrick|pg||
nt|susieq: was there a ruling?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: made 3 exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: there was a one trick transfer by director, i don't know why, sorry|pg||
nt|rlebi: not likely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow|pg||
pc|d9|nt|caitlin: there are SIX hungry university guys in my backyard doing the barbecue|pg||
nt|gavin: hughes sees that the one layout that will defeat him is 2 club ruffs|pg||
nt|gavin: so he ditches a club on the ace of diamonds and leads a heart up towards his hand (north is marked with ace of hearts from auction)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make from here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gavin: well played|pg||
nt|caitlin: when declaring you always have to think about worse case scenario|pg||
nt|caitlin: what if? what if?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: lost the play on this one, too fast|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or in this case, best case, doubleton ace of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: np what is outcome?|pg||
nt|raghavan: I hope he plays H 6 on lead from N - then 3 down - |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 down|pg||
nt|caitlin: Karen we understand...I could NEVER do your job|pg||
nt|raghavan: sorry 2 down|pg||

nt|glen: poor other table, when they try to work that out|pg||
nt|glen: 1 hour from now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey tough enough here|pg||
nt|bbramley: slam on 2 finesses, or 1 finesse and a miracle @D guess|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|gavin: wolpert bid 1NT here because he didnt think he was good enough for 2H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3@H also ok|pg||
nt|gavin: aggressive 4S bid|pg||
nt|gavin: rlly hate that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: and instead of risking his partner raising 1S to 2S and playing the wrong fit, he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|gavin: on that lead declarer will likely go 2 down, take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|bbramley: but only 30 HCP and no extra shape - it's a bad slam and normal to stay out of it|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mcarroll: Seemingly W cannot pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 800 possible|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt i would want to ever pass 3nt|pg||
nt|gavin: though the defense will need to cash their tricks int he right order|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room Joey opened 2@D and auction crowded opponents|pg||
nt|caitlin: can set up hearts to make 4S|pg||
nt|glen: btw board 8 is a push in 7NT, unless misplayed now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: 3@C blocking bid but sometimes taken seriously|pg||
nt|gavin: easy to allow them to escape for 1 down by trying to cash 2 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would be a better contract if north had 2 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: the A  then the 9  the green plays the last @H|pg||
nt|glen: nope, claim eliminated misplay chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: he can pass, and will when happy to see opponents bid|pg||

nt|caitlin: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@H is weird|pg||

nt|glen: also when in 7NT, claim|pg||
pc|h2|nt|caitlin: hey there fish...you finished in Open?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ok i claim 5@C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: still losers in diamond to deal with|pg||
nt|gowdy: rebidding your 7 card suit ?  not so so thats bad|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|gavin: hard hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: and that is the name of the game|pg||
nt|caitlin: so far 18 vs 9 IMPs to L'Ecuyer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mittmouse: 4 down|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: right but 2@H is going nowhere with a promising hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gavin: south had a tough problem, conflicting rules|pg||
nt|gavin: most often when you have a 4-4 fit and a 5-3 fit you want to play the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gavin: though from the bidding there was a good chance his partner was 6-4, and with such bad spades it hink he made the wrong decision|pg||
nt|mittmouse: no 3|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hanna will make 3 only|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gavin: 135-107|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|caitlin: and use 5-3 to dump losers if possible|pg||
nt|gavin: here north didnt even introduce spades|pg||
nt|rlebi: 37 imps with 3 boards|pg||
pc|c4|nt|harmon: Hey everyone|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: ultralight 1nt stole board 12, carruthers missed game|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Hamman says something about how much they would have beaten 4@s and Zia says "I didn't mean my dbl as penalty" H: "no, high cards"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|NAT or BAL 11-13 or 17+|nt|brolucius: Spade lead was not unreasonable with only four-card suits available.|pg||

mb|2H!|an|11-13, 4 !hs|nt|thegarve:  opened 1@c on AJ to inhibit the lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|jbgood: nice contract..|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Chris, laughing "cutting down on the ruffs in the dummy?" Hamman "I'd like to see someone have something other than 4333"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: good spot|pg||
nt|thegarve:  plays well in 2@h despite the best lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: What could North have bid instead, with these transfer responses?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: btw Jan, 11 or 12 tricks on that last one?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  1@S no Major|pg||
nt|migry:  1NT would have been natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 IMPs to Wellland on 71|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Roy: "what am I going to do?" Z: "against Hamman, you have no chance" Roy: "that was some play, Bob ... talk me out of playing for 3-3 hearts ... I should have gone up with the K ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: of @ds and made it" Chris "that would have been impossible ... just make this one"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT made in the other room|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: No, Chris doesn't forget things like that - it was his idea of the best bid to make with his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Also, he alerted it :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and it turned out well|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is the sort of 'small bend' that is reasonable when you are well behind. Better than 'large bends'.|pg||
nt|migry:  he just made what he thought is the best bid with his hand - he would not forget that |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 300 cost 5 IMPs, also 4@SX in the other room, but only 1 down|pg||
nt|migry:  if they belong in NT it might be better to play it from the South hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Roy played very quickly to this point, now considering|pg||

nt|starkist: 2@c is majors, shd survive|pg||

nt|rlebi: a little rich i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is why i said double was shakey, is really at bottom end in tricks|pg||

pc|hT|nt|caitlin: hey Detroit is on a power play|pg||

pc|h6|nt|caitlin: hard to go wrong here|pg||

nt|caitlin: let's have specs clap if for Pittsburgh.....|pg||
nt|caitlin: and now for Detroit|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|caitlin: sorry Hobart vs Jotcham|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gavin: west can see without any entries to dummy that he might aswell lead clubs out of his hand|pg||
nt|glen: yes, otherwise known as no hope in heck|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rlebi: will Jim find the winnining return?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|capercliff: you cant always have 4-4 fits in the majors|pg||
nt|gavin: normally you would like to lead up towards the kq a couple times|pg||
nt|caitlin: which proves fruitful|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he did|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: 2h rebid (my hand sucks) - ok then 2s not forcing- thanks partner|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gowdy: well n's 8 is suit pref for H  as opposed to netural  so it is gueesable  |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|gavin: with the 9 showing in north|pg||
nt|gavin: west carefully protected his 3rd club trick by leading low from his hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now a safety play|pg||
nt|gavin: 2nd rather|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: but will cost an imp or two|pg||
nt|starkist: pitt scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lost an imp not cashing the spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but had hanna ducked this would be very interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gavin: 9 tricks secured with 1 spade 3 hearts 3 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he already has to assume heart ace right|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mittmouse: well i think 3h is the right bid if it just shows a lot of hearts and no cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as it should, with power you go thru 2NT|pg||
nt|starkist: i agree if it shows that|pg||
nt|starkist: because thats what he has|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah... though it would still typically have a card outside i thk|pg||
nt|gavin: 5 card support and a stiff and out seems like a bit much|pg||
nt|gavin: 145-107 if he makes this|pg||
nt|starkist: fellow commentators, starstudded... should put a team together and challenge the winners|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|gavin: if the vugraph operator can wish my bro and his team gl from me id appreciate it|pg||

nt|fabsayc: we will field the enforcers with 10 foot hockey sticks|pg||
nt|glen: he might just put 6@C on the table now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5-3s often better in NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|raghavan: 4 H no chance let us see for 3NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks and chances for a ninth|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here the 5 never even mentioned|pg||
nt|caitlin: needs one minor suit trick|pg||
nt|caitlin: ????|pg||
nt|fabsayc: entries a problem|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  we're about 5 mins from COPC one round to go leaders|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: cunning play but should not work|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|capercliff: huh?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: signing off, but this could be less safe than slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can be missing two aces|pg||
nt|capercliff: 5@s was a relay to play in 5N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so blackwood was not the right tool|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure what is however|pg||
nt|gowdy: needs a or k of d in N with  no C switch|pg||
nt|susieq: 5N transfers the blame to partner|pg||
nt|glen: no, its the your-fault 5NT (i.e. you pick it)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one does not get 12 card fits that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: slam is 50/50 at best anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to gavin, caitlin, tony, george and cameos from cam and harmon |pg||
nt|fabsayc: so win and heart to 9 and diamond up|pg||
pc|h3|nt|capercliff: happens to be the right side of 50 this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better than 50-50|pg||
nt|capercliff: you dont have time to try both finesses Martin:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually the defense will yield many clues to the best line|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hazel, the mom runs a great bridge club|pg||
nt|raghavan: North must be alert to play C and another C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is essentially the same|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is better, though Jurek should realize hearts likely solid|pg||
nt|rlebi: he picked swell|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a bid with a great track record lately, but worked here|pg||
nt|glen: on board 10, with the two offside black kings, EW made 6@S at the other table|pg||
nt|glen: sorry board 9|pg||
nt|glen: they bid 6@S for 13 imps|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: they have to guard clubs also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: plus no spade lead, i would expect a lot of clues|pg||
