nt|ady: sorry  3NT making    but would go down if 5 card club suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: 3@h is a good bid|pg||

mb|4H|mb|d|nt|panja: and a raise by N is a must|pg||

nt|lestergold: can north sound find their nice safe spot in diamonds?|pg||

nt|ritong: par is reached|pg||

nt|panja: the correct play now is a @S|pg||
nt|panja: to guarantee 3@H..|pg||
nt|panja: S must be hoping @H finesse is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not this lead!|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some looks like tartan or muiderberg |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe you said that already) |pg||
nt|xenya: a 2-suiter, yes|pg||
nt|xenya:  does he have an ace, S is thinking|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: good move by north, the 6@h bid suggests 4or5 @hs and out|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wwalter: she is greedy :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: and rightly decides to stop in 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly safer than 3 nt  |pg||
nt|lestergold: on a spade lead it probably goes off|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: can get tangled up on the hand in 3 nt (imo) |pg||
nt|xenya: not really, Shirley -- 6 @Cs, 2@Ds and @HA -- at least|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and might sneak a @S also |pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: 2 spades 4 clubs and dim ace |pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, 6 hearts would make with the diamond break|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: 5@C is also quite safe|pg||
nt|ritong: the small danger is to see opponents bid seven @ss, but who does that in the dark|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer would have to make inspired guess to put up Ks to make|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
mc|9|nt|jcwla: With Ax opposite xx, no reason to duck a round of @C's.  With 9x of @H's, it's normal to lead pd's bid suit.  Declarer doesn't always have AKJx on this auction.|pg||

nt|don paulus: See 4 @s EW - but NS may take out in a minor suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: è assurdoprovare interesse per te lo so ma questo è...........tu che didi?|pg||
nt|ady: well if 6@S is bid in OR   then a save|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are doubled in 5@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jcwla: 4 of a major here after some interference by N/S probably.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 off for 500 n/s save some profit not the royal mint tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: neve wont be kept out|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: good board for England|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H  a great save|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C!|nt|wwalter: she had 2@c+ 1@s as losers|pg||
nt|trotto: an be ,couse error of operator ,Joanna played ,in second trick , ce of  trumps ( and next @sQ) that's correct safety play|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the same imps :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@h= to justify N's choice :)|pg||
nt|trotto: Ace of  trumps*|pg||
nt|panja: Even 3@D might be too high here..|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no........ she claim sanding I give you 2@c 1@s and K@H|pg||
nt|xenya: another 4@H for EW|pg||
nt|don paulus: 5 now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wont encourage north to save|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pressure bid of 4@C opposite passed pd, well within Rule of 2-3-4 guidelines.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too many major suit losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c mandatory at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 3c at green|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: np grazie|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 3NT  can make  as A@C with North    but 5@C   the better contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: o course can bid 3n gambling if they play it to show this sort of preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north probably lead a diamond|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||

nt|xenya: is there a sure line for 10 tricks here? |pg||
nt|henryb: sure? I don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean without seeing NS's cards of course|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho maybe not third in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: depend on style|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like claim will follow quickly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dcbutler: 9 tricks for declarer on any lead with this layout|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|charles_l: helpful|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|panja: S did not seem to have any doubt|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR Reess opened the S hand 3@D, then 4@C by N -- E/W have been pushed to 5@S, a bridge too far.|pg||
nt|ady: west really has the hand for a suit contract  evedn if 2 tricks higher  good controls   but only 1 spade stopper|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: well brave effort by west with 7 count|pg||
nt|dcbutler: not at this vul|pg||
nt|ritong: now west has a serious problem|pg||
nt|ritong: his part showed a good limit raise |pg||
nt|dcbutler: wonder how much 2NT showed?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   looked enough with that collection|pg||
nt|ritong: agreed|pg||
nt|dcbutler: looks like a mixed raise (at best) to me|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphztg: IT IS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I'll say, both aces on side, the qj of @H flopping |pg||
nt|xenya: VERY well, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: would this bid not show a stronger hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ady: east hoping for the best here  QJ spades look poor values on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: tre other 3 hand = the bidding, but S??|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe South's 2@C shows both majors, but West doesn't care|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|pelu: or dont know? - if opp alert 2@C u dont exp both majors .)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: We had a problem at the begin, they switched Open and Closed Room|pg||

nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
nt|ritong: danger zone entered|pg||
nt|ady: yes    too high now|pg||
mb|d|mb|5H|nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: But all in all, the auction could have been considerably worse.  This spot is reasonable if perhaps not ideal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he didnt know he would find partner with 100 honours in dims|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: this should be a useful swing to Neve|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: S doesn't know that, of course -- from her perspectibe, contract mau be in real danger |pg||
nt|henryb: this is not worth a 15-17 1N (I do not know their range) and Jx is not a holding you particularly want to have as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5422 pattern  (yuck) |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: the spot is ok its just the layout which is savage of course|pg||

nt|ritong: yes, first boards swinged|pg||
nt|daman: this will swing too    doomed|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not neutral either, rite|pg||
nt|daman: aggressive bidding by West opposite a passed hand   will pay the price|pg||

nt|xenya: sigh of relief from S|pg||
nt|xenya: now she will be quick to grab 11 i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: In the OR W passed the 2@C rebid and Hinden went -2 for -200.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Leslie knows that preventing spade ruffs more important than worrying about trump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: in most natral systems the ability to show heart suit in  a weak hand would not exist|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: We dont know, but asume that West didnt know :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised to see they play 2@c as weak both majors as they are not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||

nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi yer  Bill|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of rebidding 1NT with the E hand.  Certainly reasonable to rebid 2@C (as both did) with nine cards in two suits, but 1NT would have worked like a charm here to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: allow E/W to drop dead in 2@H.|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 off also ?|pg||
nt|ady: 7@HX  on board 16 should have been a save against a vul 6@S making    but the contract in open room was 5@HX|pg||
nt|daman: East assumed a Drury stance with 3433  9 count    not clever|pg||
nt|ritong: well it saved some anyways|pg||
nt|ritong: which is the target of sacrifices:)|pg||
nt|daman: some of those targets are pretty small|pg||
nt|ady: turned out an 11 imp loss rather than a possible 12 imp gain|pg||
nt|daman: Barry Crane used to say....."Only Jesus saves..."|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|athene: West could bid 2@H natural non-forcing over 2@C as a passed hand, surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this could be flat with the defence taking 6 tricks unless endplayed which i think is do able now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|henryb: not quite yet|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: Some rebid 1NT as a matter of course, some would do it if the stiff @S were an honor.  Matter of style.|pg||

nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I am getting some tea|pg||
nt|ritong: showing @ds and @ss|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s would be an egregious overbid|pg||

pc|sA|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer shouldn't be given a chance to get a spade away from either hand on a long minor|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: 3@H for me too|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow saly|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||

nt|charles_l: sitff @hJ and dummy reverse|pg||
nt|wwalter: any play would lose 1@h|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H P 1@S 2@D P P now west has a bit of a decision|pg||
mb|1H|nt|MolvaM: that the screen partners on one side should be one lady and one gentleman|pg||
nt|athene: i know Sabine Auken doesn't like it - she complained about it in her book :)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: well I was talking about the general EBL rules :)|pg||

nt|xenya: but not this one?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wwalter: I see playing rederse summy, ruffing 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s looks making as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: if south had raised to 4@D i am sure west wld have bid 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb: this hand is not trivial if N-s play more @h|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but top @c ducked and then east is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: as it  turn o ut 2 hearts  or even 2@D  works better for n/s|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: defence will hav e to do the right thing though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sQ|nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: or 3rd|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: dont think can make now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: duck |pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|panja: dummy reversal is an attractive line, ruff 3 @D in Dummy|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes and lose a @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: in hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead on the go, might have done but who would do that?|pg||
nt|henryb: If she ducks, declarer can just ram @d down her throat|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in trumps are too good|pg||
pc|h6|nt|don paulus: that would be 10 for badger|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|panja: @DA, @SQA..|pg||
nt|wwalter: the dummy has 1 @h losre, if the @h is not found|pg||
nt|wwalter: now should ruff some @d|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer has to worry about 4-1 trumps too|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb: a heart continuation would create enormous problems|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: i have to go now folks bye for now thx all|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|wwalter: this is the best line to play|pg||
nt|don paulus: ty mike cu|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: north played for some blocking @c position|pg||
nt|ady: but discarding a heart and a diamond made the contract unmakeable|pg||
nt|ritong: unless @d 10 drops|pg||
nt|ritong: if a defender has a @c less, he has a @d more and then @d 10 can be short|pg||
nt|ritong: he/she, btw|pg||
nt|daman: should be a push then|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: at trick 2. declarer plays a club and South wins and plays a third heart|pg||
nt|xenya: would be much better, yes -- still declarer can prevail i think|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|charles_l: i think the @h count is later known|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|ritong: but you were finally right, even with good news this defense beats it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: not taking out trump at all thus far, is certainly a little risky|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dT|nt|ady: long winded   but still down 1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|charles_l: she is still ok though|pg||
nt|panja: if a @D is played now, decl will be a bit under pressure..|pg||
nt|panja: ruff high or not? where to place @SJ?|pg||
nt|wwalter: only one losing line, high ruff, than finess|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|panja: y, but from 13 tricks we have come to a point where a losing line is available|pg||
mc|6|nt|don paulus: don't like 170 scores in imps count :(|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think W shd take more blame|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H showed a strong slam try and demanded control-bid then 3@S didn't promise any extras|pg||
nt|brgpro: his 2@h rebid might not have shown 6|pg||
nt|athene: in which case maybe west should do more|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right.  Pressure at all times.|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons to come|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: is not so easy @@ the table, this is made by the great masters :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: well, count of not, the only play available is to drop @HJ or Q stiff in 7@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brgpro: and 3@s was sort of "on the way" cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: but if 3@H was only a mild slam try, then 3@S was showing west had a decent hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i only can when i am commentating, not at table :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|henryb: 7@c is a good contract and cold on the layout|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|dcbutler: good idea by south - can she make it?|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   showed I believe showed 5 hearts and 4 spades and forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: mrs hinden has a tough switch to make|pg||
nt|ritong: @d jack could slip |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: soade switch is awkward after cashing clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: defense needs to play spades|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
nt|ritong: well played by east, a @d and it was over, since west would certainly play a @d back|pg||
nt|ritong: now on the surface, west has to duck the @d K|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal defense at this level|pg||
nt|dcbutler: that doesn't help, does it?|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that will not help|pg||
nt|ady: should make now   with diamond position favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: she might play a @d from hand right now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|athene: cash two clubs and then @HK and @H10 - even if you lose to east's @HQx, she may be endplayed anyway with @SA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: as far as inviting goes - conventional wisdom is that you don't want to play in the invitation very often, so you want partner to accept more often, i think?|pg||
nt|daman: nice|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||

nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||
nt|wwalter: after this board will come a friendly chat on EW :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Hauge now leads the other semifinal 60-50 with (i think) 5 boards to compare|pg||
nt|ritong: 3Nt = i do not like @ss|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|daman: A @C will|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
nt|ady: lay down A@H    and 12 tricks|pg||
mc|12|nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||

nt|ady: almist certainly south|pg||
mb|3N|nt|charles_l: 2@d is 3rd suit forcing|pg||

nt|daman: to tie|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|an| |mb|p|nt|brgpro: if 6@h is played by W, it is easier to find @d lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: E wont pass this...|pg||

mb|2N|an|4+ !s 18-20 points|nt|charles_l: pass=2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yessssssssssss|pg||
nt|daman:  3NT here   has chances to go down, but not many|pg||
nt|daman: zero in fact|pg||
nt|ady: South needs to avoid a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but all W's cards in the minors were "right", so perhaps his final raise was not too unreasonable -- though somewhat inconsistent with the cuatious style he had dispalyed before|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR just finished (and not on a good note for Badger), so welcome to all those who have come here from the OR.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|xenya: sorry for bad typing|pg||
nt|xenya: so it might be 13 imps for the trailing team |pg||
nt|henryb: not enough boards left|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: no @D stop = stop!|pg||
nt|charles_l: should always make - @d sets up for a loser discard|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: a nice scientific auction, asking NS to lead diamonds, please|pg||
nt|xenya: but the gap is already too wide to overcome, true |pg||
nt|daman: up Simba|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brgpro: could be an important imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume they VIP it |pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: EW could either play a third @D for W to ruff small|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: nees to play a hearft to the queen|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: if EW just blast into the slam, i think it's far from obvious to lead a diamond|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|daman: at risk now|pg||
nt|ritong: this @d 3 was not a jewel|pg||
nt|daman: another @D by South|pg||
nt|ritong: i think @d J would have been much more helpful|pg||
nt|daman: un autre carreau par Sud|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, when declarer has K9x, it looks bad|pg||
nt|ritong: but anyways, north is not on lead soon|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the other room, declarer played a heart toward the queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: The quiet before the (mild) storm of 14.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could choose to draw trumps and exit @SA and another here|pg||
nt|athene: then eventually the defence have to open diamonds or give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|ritong: a better move imho|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|athene: of course nothing matters with both diamonds right|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb: probably down one. no problem :)|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe down 2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East is indeed Frances Hinden, one of our regular commentators (Finch)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a busy poster on BBO forums|pg||

nt|henryb: last board, and the imp scale does not extend to 39, so ...|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@H also bid on 26 in OR -- a push|pg||
nt|henryb: congratulations to the Neve team|pg||
nt|henryb: a deserved win|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thx also to Vladimir and Henry for your comments.  Always interesting and important discussion. |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Thx shirley see you all soon after lunch time |pg||
nt|daman: took their eye off the ball|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But unlikely to matter|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|ritong: 14 is the right size|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now. Many thanks to Massimiliano, our outstanding operator in Sanremo. Well done!|pg||
nt|ritong: avoids the dreaded cold game lost|pg||
nt|daman: and this hand is unlikely to deposit 14 IMPs to their account either|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: E can bilive !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: * belive sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: David Edwin, Dave Butler, Henri Schweitzer and George Holland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: thx all    |pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: S wont lead @dA|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: So the only real big pickup this segment for Badger (and a deserved one) will be Board 6, where Allix/Neve rested in 3@S while Hinden played 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: how many extra bds if the match is a draw?|pg||
nt|pelu: pl stay for the last board, Massimiliano :) - u have done a great job|pg||

nt|daman: thank you everyone    |pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She was hoping for @DA with partner|pg||
nt|athene: putting her partner with the @DA|pg||
nt|ritong: after the strict fourth best lead|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case declarer would perhaps have just knocked out the @DA first of all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Thx also to EBU and all of the folks who help bring this important tourney to  BBO |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this segment (these semis are quite short, aren't they?), a big thank you to Roland, Bill, Paul, Mike and all specs.  Some great comments.  The second and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: final segment is scheduled for the top of the hour, so stay tuned.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows 3+ and is forcing. It denies 4 and a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i didnt envisage stayman there|pg||
nt|panja: y, Major suits..so more equal|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: only one think please Massimiliano or Max not Massimo :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  thx for thoughts and comments,  we appreciate them @H@H  hope you enjoyed |pg||
nt|henryb: and to the BBO staff who make this available to them and you all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a little scary|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Roland in particular who herds us cats (sometimes called commentators)   He works very hard to make this run smoothly  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: simple 3NT |pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: Whats for lunch Massi |pg||
nt|henryb: probably down 1. declarer will take the @c finesse, and a @h shift will sink the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: May be a sandwich or a salad.........very light however I could sleep on 3° tournment :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to you Roland for your yeoman efforts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous and bravi to the winners|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Play will resume tomorrow with the final (48 boards) at 10:30 CET, 4:30 am New York, 9:30 am London, 6:30 pm Sydney. Welcome back then|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye all see you tomorrow for final macht|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|pelu: ??? - why not keep communication?|pg||
nt|pelu: before u take the trick - be sure what u wont to play next trick - if u dont know - then dont take the trick!|pg||
nt|brgpro: she was afraid Q10x by dec. and pd Jxx|pg||
nt|brgpro: now she knows QJ10|pg||
nt|pelu: I know that S cant see QJ!0 by decl - Bocchi could have the J - but she has to decide before taking @HA|pg||
nt|charles_l: Max is shorter to type :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: in the meantime 2@h is not going to be fun...|pg||
nt|athene: are you sure 1@S promises 3 spades? an earlier board suggested NS play 1@S = any weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it won't go 8 down which is what's needed to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she both asked and looked at the convention card|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: bye|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has 3 1Ss, 2@Ds and 3 @Cs -- unless she is clairvoyant|pg||
nt|athene: and now east's 2@S bid suggests the same|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: if she makes this she will gain 10 IMPS   a day late and a dollar short|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: On that lead it's even close to making|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now she has three heart tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The losers will both win a bronze medal. No play-off for third place|pg||
nt|daman: is there a website Roland?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: is there a playoff for third, or do both semifinal losers get bronze?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: read above|pg||

pc|s4|nt|brgpro: well, she tried Merimac copu|pg||

nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
