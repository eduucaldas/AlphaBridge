nt|vugraphztg: sorry but i got a problem with south..............she cover the cards |pg||
nt|donatoru: doesnt matter with 6 cards also must duck  first trick like a AKx <-> xx |pg||
mb|1D|an| |mb|p|mb|1N|an| |nt|duschek: E/W may easily get overboard here unless West resists the temptation to respond 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: aha, weak with 5-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|beto: 2@H must me weak 5@S4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H was the alternative, showing spades|pg||
nt|duschek: 2@H is probably showing a weak hand with 5@S4@H - advance Flannery or whatever it's called|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Player names please|pg||
nt|begse: if east has the q of @s stiff wd ruff @h to score her trick|pg||
nt|rado: here N-S must stop low sins minors lay unfavourable|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this might be bid to 3 nt, but may take much longer to play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Morning Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm sure at any other vulnerability west wouldn't have any problems bidding 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: but here he might pause a little|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: good metho|pg||
nt|athene: and indeed 4@S is 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: method|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@D from north looks sensible|pg||
nt|donatoru: a partia @d game stollen :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sunsamvar: 1 @S showing @C ?|pg||
nt|rado: if W on lead must underlead Ak@H to ensure 5 tricks for the defence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphztg: double is to|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: take out|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nigel Kearney|pg||

nt|rado: standart lead A will give a chance for declarer|pg||
nt|donatoru: but no big deal in this board|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|granguru: Lambardi Ventin have been playing for a time together but I have no clues about their performance|pg||
nt|rayhaa: hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @H are blocked|pg||
pc|d2|nt|levix: if E play 3nt,S lead spade,may some problems|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: south said 3 or more @s.........................|pg||
nt|moen: good shift|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yke: with clubs 2-2 even 6@C would have a chance, but now 5@C is not easy|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Serhat Ozenir|pg||
nt|begse: hi roland,constantin and everybody|pg||
nt|rado: the books say @C must be double finessed:)|pg||

nt|beto: i ve played agaisnt them last year in the brazilian champioship finals|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to David Carlisle|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|rayhaa: hi|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@D by South will need perfect defence to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Club lead and spade through|pg||
nt|donatoru: partial time , but let's see , the boards a very excinting|pg||
mb|1D|nt|garnetts: This  could get a little competitive--with EW maybe competing to 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be feisty|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|stc: good play and also good defense...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but maybe the south in the open room was a librarian :)|pg||
nt|rado: N has a promising hand in case of fit|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3@h Rune ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Seem like NS have a sac|pg||
nt|tsadek: hii ALL , Nigel ,Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Roald Ramer|pg||
nt|yke: one down confirmed|pg||
nt|begse: the value of the aces 3nt making|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i thought chile actually won|pg||
nt|beto: no ties this year as the carry over has 0.5 |pg||
nt|Rafa: Chile hasn't won an official South American Championship since something near 1950|pg||
nt|roswolf: i know hes 3rd in hand but i really dont like that call|pg||
nt|yke: hi Roald :)|pg||
nt|aldek: hoi Yke|pg||
nt|donatoru: conservative :)|pg||
nt|moen: yes lol|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: 1@S showing diamonds. N-S play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|yke: 2@H 6+ spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 9-11 long club suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|levix: lead C?|pg||
nt|rayhaa: i thk they will try 4@h at this vul|pg||
nt|serhat: 4h is makeable|pg||
nt|rado: many use Stayman with 54 in Majors|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not familiar with the NS system - it looks like Blue Club based though, from these two hands|pg||
nt|donatoru: a t/o i bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: or @S?|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps 2@S shows 6 controls|pg||
nt|donatoru: thinking between 4@c,3@s , pas |pg||
mb|5C|nt|Rafa: last year was festival championship|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes i prefer to use stayman and smolen with such hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|Rafa: EW won last year the official pairs too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But agree at u. Attack from the cards u have|pg||
nt|levix: yes,sometimes,if weak hand, lead doubleton is not bad|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mostly anyway I agree at ure first. @C|pg||
nt|levix: still need guess DK,|pg||
nt|garnetts: It won't once South tried 2@H--|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead??|pg||
nt|davidstern: -1 I suspect|pg||
nt|rado: 3@S agreeing @S while 4 minor would support @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Looks like a 3NTEW for me but problems can be on the line|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is double better or 2@H?  |pg||
nt|yke: a phantom save, but 4@S is hard to resist|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: north wants to use a short suit try|pg||
nt|moen: wow|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Strange lead. Waited @C from 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|granguru: GOOD STOP|pg||
nt|athene: although that's not standard Blue Club|pg||
nt|athene: (after the strong 1@C opener showing 17+ hcp, responder shows number of aces/kings, A=2, K=1)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|rayhaa: it depends on agreement i guess|pg||
nt|rayhaa: u can bid 2@h as non forcing and X as neg or invitational or vice versa|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes to some extent--but in my case it would be qa choice--could start with either--except that a subsequent heart bid would not be forcing if I doubled first|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i suppose it might have kept e/w out of a spade partscore|pg||
nt|serhat: yes only lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: So they have bid to the last making spot|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: to check for wasted values in @C...|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, 2@H/2@S were semi-positives; basically a weak-2 in the suit|pg||
nt|athene: i am told that NS play 2@D and 2@H as transfers, to rightside the contract|pg||
nt|athene: in which case 2@S will indeed be the 6 or 6+ controls response|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1 or even 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Momchil Aleksandrov|pg||
nt|donatoru: wow , the lion heart Geta|pg||
pc|s7|nt|serhat: Ac and sp switch is not good enough|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but i dont know how they can do it now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|othered1: pinpoint bidding, with the @SK not in opening bidder's hand|pg||
nt|aldek: Last hand was unjust for Bep Vriend, here she overbid|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not to beat four but to beat 5|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|athene: nice comfortable 6nt to play|pg||
nt|athene: 12 on top; spade finesse for the overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT is not too bad, but it needs clubs 4-3 so will fail|pg||
nt|stc: same 9 tricks|pg||
nt|begse: 3nt is very diff. to bid this is the normal auction|pg||
nt|rado: mild slam try and now declarer must play cautiously to avoid 2 trum lusers|pg||
nt|athene: hi welcome|pg||
nt|moen: should plsy the A now and @h K for safe down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: you claim this at trick 1 pretty much|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sunsamvar: south correctly evaluated that the feature of the north hand is the @C shortage and wisely passed 4@S|pg||
nt|rado: A @S and low to 10 seems safety but again lack of communications|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes with asking where is the @S king|pg||
nt|moen: play|pg||

pc|hK|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Michael Zhu|pg||
pc|c5|nt|beto: nice stop although 4@S looks good in this bidding seeing only NS cards|pg||
nt|duschek: There are those who would have bid a direct 4@S holding South's cards, but perhaps the strong hearts persuaded him to be cautious|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: now plenty of entries|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tsadek: 2@S overbid , DBL to show @S and opening hand is better|pg||

nt|garnetts: yes misplayed it having got it so right for most of the play :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w might get too high here|pg||
nt|yke: but there was a good chance that both contracts were making|pg||
nt|aldek: altoghether rather unlucky|pg||
nt|davidstern: Brian Callaghan, Gillian Fawcett (Salt) Christine Duckworth and david Beauchamp|pg||
nt|davidstern: The last board 4@D was flat at both tables|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 6@S here|pg||
nt|davidstern: A test for e/w|pg||
nt|davidstern: East has opened a game force in the OR|pg||
nt|rado: again much bidding from NS expected|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: misfit here.. so N/S will do well to stay low|pg||
nt|donatoru: a flat game , leet's drink a coffee|pg||
nt|moen: yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tsadek: when opp bid Trf bid like 1@C- @D=@H or 1@C-1@H=@S  DBL should be suit bid with some card|pg||
nt|nickf: good start by Buiajh vs one of the favourites.|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: bad splits seem to stop games on both sides|pg||

mb|2D|nt|duschek: I wonder which type of hand was actually indicated by that 2@S jump overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C by south?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jim Patrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard cards bough for NS and EW|pg||
nt|serhat: yes.. I think it is going to be a flat board.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hi there|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nigel_k:  Maybe they just play double as takeout of the suits shown|pg||
nt|donatoru: hi all|pg||
nt|donatoru: i try to explain the Mihai's sys , they a my teammates actual vice-champs in Open Romanian Teams , coz i played very wrong the great finale :)|pg||
nt|aldek: a slam for EW|pg||
nt|yke: but you need to rightside the contract, so 6NT is better then 6@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N/S must be playing canape style|pg||
nt|rado: we seen Canape, opening shorter suit wheh 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|beto: i would guess intemediate 11-15|pg||
nt|othered1: Another flat AKA opposite an opening bid.  In last set those hands got to 1N|pg||
nt|granguru: 1951. Santiago, Chile. Players were Alfonso Agûero Antonio Carrasco Carlos Doren Jorge Guzman Antonio Herrera Jorge oVALLE Jorge Suarez and Julio Subercaseaux (founder of the main ...|pg||
nt|granguru: bridge Club in chile:Club Snatiago)|pg||
nt|nickf: I think North will bid game anyway.|pg||
nt|davidstern: The other table have stopped in 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d has some play|pg||
nt|2hplus4: How will N get his hand over?|pg||
nt|begse: 5@d gives 2 aces @c ruff  |pg||
nt|stc: after S's X Nord will keep bidding|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s, 4!NT  ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And a and at the bidding|pg||
nt|2hplus4: It's a problem even for the great Bocchi|pg||
nt|star6ija: so far NT is well positioned, let;s see the level|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure why east didn't just raise diamonds over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Admitted, here north has implied some length in pointed suits|pg||
nt|duschek: But then, perhaps not that attractive holding six to the ace-deuce and two doubleton queens on the side|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forgot to say Mi.   Ns play presision and EW polich club|pg||
nt|nickf: may be expecting 5 spades in the south hand.|pg||
nt|donatoru: en easy 3NT , coz Radu is a " white hand" and the clubs a 6-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be surprised if E/W can assess the beuty of their non-club fit|pg||
nt|stc: Of course, 1@c X shows majors, he may have no fit at all|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looks the obvious bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|levix: lead the second suit of dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Silvia. Did S find the single @DK at E?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Board 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe contract|pg||
nt|davidstern: East could now try 5@C exclusion blackwood but this is a stretch|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What system are EW playing? The fit may be @C|pg||
nt|stc: I assume 1@c is 13 cards and some points, 1@d shows @h|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Who will stop at level 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: That passed as..|pg||
nt|yke: only a diamond lead doent give declarer the 12th trick|pg||
nt|aldek: the best one in diamonds played by east|pg||
nt|rado: 3@c had a chance for down 1 only|pg||
nt|rado: and 3@H could be made|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: south hand is worth a 2@C over a 1@S opening, but maybe not after a 1@H |pg||
nt|star6ija: this one also works|pg||
nt|star6ija: William, do you know the system EW use?|pg||
nt|athene: when the @CQ falls, declarer only needs one red-suit finesse|pg||
nt|athene: and they both work|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the EW system sorry|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rayhaa: an relaxing 3NT|pg||
nt|donatoru: it will be a very close match , the both pairs a very strong|pg||
nt|stc: The 2NT message didn't pass :(|pg||
nt|athene: NS counted their 36 hcp and bid 7 in the other room - unlucky|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rado: nice stop and now E on lead maybe @D|pg||
nt|athene: a big, essentially random swing based on the @SK position|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to kibitzers, so we have natural system with weak (12-14) NT|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the best way to play is win @SK, cash @CAK just in case the @CQ falls|pg||
nt|athene: when it does, you try @DAK in case @DQ falls|pg||
nt|athene: when it doesn't you finesse hearts|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|granguru: The tie was in Montevideo and Punta del Este in 1964|pg||
nt|othered1: west has to win second @C and shift to @H.  Not all that clear on auction|pg||
nt|donatoru: Radu Mihai is  1 in the Romanian top, and the ladyis  5|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as has been suggested 7@H anybody|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: wrong sided this contract, defense should be easy|pg||
nt|levix: ok,thx|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is that really the lead by South?|pg||
nt|davidstern: South and East are always females in the this event|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this lead might help declarer keep |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: Looks like a lucky stop|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: no|pg||
nt|donatoru: some probs with the comunication , only 8 tricks in direct count , let's see|pg||
nt|donatoru: a good plan : @s-->K , and A@d , but was a fault in the defence , Geta played small @c |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru: If my memory does not fail me they were Roberto Asriel Jorge Guzman esteban Casian Roberto Kaufman and Eric Simons|pg||
nt|2hplus4: If they get the @H going it's disastrous|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see play|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes foolproof on this layout|pg||
pc|cK|nt|beto: need to duck clubs twice, but then defence has to manage to swith to a @H when west wins the 2nd club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When was the last time Brazil was not in a final?|pg||
nt|beto: i dont know roland|pg||
nt|granguru: The another winner was Argentina|pg||
nt|duschek: Will West overtake and shift to a heart? Not obvious - South could have quite a different high card distribution|pg||
nt|beto: first time ever since i play bridge (1998)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|duschek: clap clap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what other plan was viable|pg||
nt|beto: well done ben|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: For shure it's down but will it be 2?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|donatoru: now 3@c+4@d+at least1@s+ A@h it's enough|pg||
pc|h9|nt|beto: now a @H and he is down|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|levix: yes,2nt also nice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|levix: make now|pg||
nt|levix: play h to break bridge|pg||
nt|levix: thinking overtrick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Strange returne|pg||
nt|roswolf: east wasting brainpower|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: claim less one|pg||
nt|athene: well, this works just fine :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|aldek: East has a perfect 12-14 hand, difficult to envisage for West|pg||
nt|rado: 9@D wa correct in case lead form K10x... but not at actual layout|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|begse: keeping @s ace as an entry would be much better for the defence|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yke: 3NT was a bit wet, but E has very good control and a max|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: 3NT are normaly 1 down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or if the lead was from @D10|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: the problem now is that declarer can't try for the @CQ drop|pg||
nt|athene: because he is in the wrong hand to take the diamond finesse, if the @CQ doesn't fall|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|beto: hello|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|duschek: Hi|pg||
nt|duschek: Did South have a tiny chance by leading the @D10, hoping to pin the singleton 9?|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Kit!|pg||
nt|othered1: some pretty good play so far, including the defense here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade finesse for down 1|pg||
nt|duschek: Duck a diamond for a make, say several kibitzers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not much chance that will work|pg||
nt|duschek: Except West still has a heart, sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: requires hearts 5-2 and probably a prior error|pg||
nt|beto: well on a @D duck defence can cash its @H|pg||
nt|duschek: At least I am not just quiet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it is indeed a legitimate chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't work here but it might have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if west had two hearts only he could play diamond king first round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then declarer could duck|pg||
nt|stc: Nobody understood Bocchi|pg||
nt|athene: so he is forced to take the diamond finesse now|pg||

nt|donatoru: 1@s i supose :) |pg||
nt|athene: well, now we will find out if 3@C was showing minors|pg||
nt|athene: because south will bid 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: but my guess is it wasn't, and 2NT would have worked out a lot better|pg||
nt|donatoru: but can be 4 card , |pg||
nt|donatoru: i wonder about Mihai pas at 1@d|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: E-w might get higher if East splinters now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a hard fight NS vs EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug can help:)|pg||
nt|rado: 4 cards opening may quiet EW from bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: West can get quite close to making 3NT I think but 4@S looks like losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult to predict the final contract|pg||
nt|stc: The 2NT misunderstanding may end in a + swing if NS go - in 5Min !!|pg||
nt|moen: yes 1major respond shows 5+ cards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rayhaa: another 4@s borderline|pg||
nt|donatoru: aginst double is KQJxx vs 1098x:)|pg||
nt|star6ija: normally 4 in Majors will go down from both hands, so 5 @d whic is one down is sacrifice against nothing|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the defence can take a diamond then @CAQ - club ruff against either major|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D should be one down - it would make if the defence didn't cash their hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but of course they will do, looking at that dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: West is going to like his hand a lot|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT is a lucky make here with a spade guess|pg||
nt|nickf: Support double from South, showing 3 spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may also consider 4S game now after the diamond bid by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi arifin|pg||
nt|yke: I think S is too strong for 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: At pess there came an auto 1@S|pg||
nt|yke: better 2NT but two small diamonds is a flaw|pg||
nt|rado: now N has a difficult choice to pas for 5-2 fit, bid 2 @S for 4-3 or introduce @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: two cues and a signoff|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have as I see it. 5@C on a finding at @D and EW 9 in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy|pg||
nt|donatoru: now lady and giants , A@h or royal flush ?|pg||
nt|moen: need to guess the lead now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: But a good spot for 4@S+1 here|pg||
nt|athene: 4NT interesting|pg||
nt|donatoru: @s or @h ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: I'm not so sure about the signoff part|pg||
nt|Rafa: Other room play has stopped, Lucena called the director|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard choice for North but 2H is pessimistic|pg||
nt|rayhaa: might have tried 3@h hoping for 3NT|pg||
nt|aldek: some would bid 2@D|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why does he bother with Stayman with all of those points?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: And a flat hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: well a not much extra 4H|pg||
nt|duschek: 4 so-called losers in East - will he stop?|pg||
nt|kit: East has easy pass -- he already forced to game|pg||
nt|beto: he should|pg||
nt|beto: @D are not that good and he already splintered to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he certainly could have more for splinter|pg||
nt|beto: like the @DK ; )|pg||
nt|levix: too aggressive|pg||
nt|rodal f: I feltthe whole time fore a re opening NS for fight. Did not need that.|pg||
nt|nickf: it was, I wonder what his options were?|pg||
nt|nickf: XX to show a maximum pass?|pg||
nt|nickf: 2NT perhaps to show 4S and just 2H ?|pg||
nt|donatoru: dont understand 5@d, an anticipated preemptive bid ? but Lion Heart Radu doubled !!|pg||
nt|rado: there are easy 9 tricks at @H|pg||
nt|athene: is it just trying to muddy the waters - or catering for partner's 4@D being lead-directing with a club fit?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|levix: friendly lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Indeed. Better possibility for make it now|pg||
nt|levix: yes,makeable now even failed finesse of SQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the normal reading are K from a dobbleton|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many tricks Lerfald?|pg||
nt|athene: if partner has @DAK tight and five clubs, you don't want to bid 5@D and go past your correct spot of 5@C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rayhaa: but this will prob be a push|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think N was not sure whether 4@d was natural or values with club support|pg||
pc|c2|nt|granguru: can make 6 now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done, not really 50-50 slam|pg||
nt|granguru: or go down|pg||

nt|granguru: no 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: If S shows @s (even 5) N may make a mild slam try|pg||

nt|donatoru: bad luck here , but the Mihai's pass wae the reason |pg||
pc|c4|nt|beto: he can ruff the 3rd @D with the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: I'm not sure he can handle 12 tricks even without the spade being cashed|pg||
nt|beto: if he finesses on 1st trick|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: It is very hard to get to 3NT here--and to make it the sequence of play must be very precise|pg||
nt|serhat: an other dia finese ?|pg||
nt|serhat: may be not anymore|pg||
nt|davidstern: No diamond nine so may not but with East holding five hearts may try diamond ten|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nobody here except Barry and I an neither of us. I could try the operator|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: miss cornell belevied the ten was played|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|donatoru: a good chance for +5 Imp's missing by Erichsens |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|donatoru: a little "creme renverse"  7 Imp's |pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru: looks like it is not possible to make 12|pg||
nt|levix: second trump play S10 better|pg||
nt|rodal f: As I see i there are7. Correct|pg||
nt|athene: when you go to 5major, you are more happy to go 2 down than 1 down|pg||
nt|star6ija: so he gave his partner chance to name the final contract|pg||
nt|donatoru: was|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|donatoru: 1@d was explain like = ?|pg||
nt|moen: yes 1@h overcall not vul, couldnt be so bad i think|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|beto: well chile stoped in 1N on board 4 so a few imps coming back|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru: 3 rounds of @C now and @D10. |pg||
nt|beto: a lot actually|pg||
nt|duschek: 1NT should make so could easily be 9 imps|pg||
nt|beto: as declarer went for 300 gere|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do NS play preciccion or polich club?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|athene: if they are in 4 in the other room, it means you are just losing 3 imps, not 12 :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphb1: Precision for both pairs|pg||
nt|moen: 1@d relay , denies a 5 card major|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|donatoru: or better , suposing : 4@d pas pas double (Radu- i know  him) /pas 4@h ( Geta ) pass all|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|beto: 120 for 9 imps i believe|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Reacted at the 1@D opening|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h7|pg||

nt|rodal f: A funny side for interested persons:  http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm   Bookmake it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A side witch can be interesting for some bridgeplayers. Bookmark it so u have it later.  http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: I am shure Roland have more of those.|pg||
nt|nickf: neither had a great hand|pg||
nt|donatoru: 1NT will be bid in few seconds:)|pg||
nt|star6ija: mixed events are unpredictable, because of the unpredictable women's nature :)|pg||
nt|donatoru: like usually , a bad lead moves 4-5 tricks in NT contract :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  No and without 3-3 hearts they would be better off in a partscore|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
nt|stc: On 14 NS playd 3@c X in OR, an easy +1|pg||
nt|athene: the ladies are always south and east in this event?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: YES |pg||
nt|star6ija: on big events like this directions should be specified|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rodal f: 1@D at w?|pg||
nt|yke: 3@C on 6 card is standard nowadays|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H or 1 @H Rado ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: 2 balanced 12 count|pg||
nt|donatoru: pass all with small @d lead 4-th best|pg||
mb|1D|an| |nt|nickf: EW have to be careful if defending a spade game|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they will stop below game|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@H shows 4+@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting |pg||
nt|nickf: But West will know what to do.|pg||
nt|donatoru: :) my dear parts :)|pg||
nt|athene: i looked at a few other tables and it wld appear so|pg||
mb|1H|nt|beto: dont think they will stop...|pg||
nt|nickf: and Lavazza did bid and make the 4-3 spade game on 5|pg||
nt|nickf: either West or North could be thinking here, I think the operator puts in 2 bids at a time.|pg||
nt|athene: north's bidding plan was to canapé into spades|pg||
nt|athene: but west beat him to it :)|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT from East now?|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: east might be worried that north has a canapé into diamonds - but even if so, south has to find the lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: I vote 2N unless it is some raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: or exactly 4 I believe|pg||
nt|kit: and the 1@S call probably shows exactly 3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Heavy 2@S|pg||
nt|rayhaa: looks like problems with connection between tables, so score in film is wrong|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: north will take insurance in 4@S|pg||
nt|moen: same as last :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: Lite 3@H |pg||
nt|ahalim: and a lot of tricks w/o a @H lead|pg||
nt|serhat: easy 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: was that 5C by North or East ?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Godefroy de Tessières|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: well, they did|pg||
nt|duschek: Or could show a small balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it also is usually dead minimum|pg||
nt|yke: E implied a 4 card spade because she bid double first|pg||
nt|yke: only 8 tricks |pg||
nt|davidstern: Bonjour|pg||
nt|donatoru: t/o , last train ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke: wow... they made 4@H in OR|pg||
pc|c5|nt|donatoru: hard work for the both : declarer and defence , i bet 5 ttricks for e-w , + 200 Romania|pg||
nt|rado: opening 4@H will force "automatic" 4@S at this vulnerability, so slowly way starting 1@H seems better|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: east has no defence :)|pg||
nt|duccino: RUNNING SCORE AT: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=32|pg||
nt|star6ija: we went slightly out of bounds|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can run the @SH but north will duck, of course|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can run the @SJ sorry|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|kit: Takes a lot of courage to stop at 2NT vulnerable -- a fine line to walk|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east could have a no trick 12 count|pg||
nt|duschek: Seems to make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|kit: and this time it looks like they were wrong|pg||
nt|granguru: agree but e has minimum minimum and 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is up to opener with anything extra|pg||
nt|kit: those 10's have a way of adding up on hand's such as these|pg||
nt|beto: i cw seen to many agressive openings by paca and ben|pg||
nt|duschek: There are three very valuable tens which they forgot to include in their HCP count|pg||
nt|beto: so here is where they pay the price for opening 10 and 11 counts|pg||
nt|levix: 3s good stop,but still down|pg||
nt|nickf: well 5m would have been a phantom save against 4S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|poussin: hello|pg||
nt|rado: that's true|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true Rado... reqires very little from p to make slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|athene: but then he might be setting himself up for an endplay?|pg||
nt|athene: i think south's @HQxx should save him|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 th trick still can't be seen|pg||
nt|athene: best is for the defence just to clear the diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: some problems might appear until E cashes his @s tricks|pg||
nt|athene: then south sits there with @HQxx and good diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer can never get anything going in the endgame|pg||
nt|star6ija: what about the clubs... S should keep them also|pg||
nt|athene: yes true - it might get quite complicated|pg||
nt|athene: let's say declarer loses a club to north|pg||
nt|athene: and runs @SJ, ducked|pg||
nt|athene: i still don't think she can do it|pg||
nt|athene: cashing @SAK would sort of squeeze south in three suits but it would break up a lot of the endings against north|pg||
nt|star6ija: are we frozen?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes they get to the toilette |pg||
nt|athene: of course if north ducked this, the contract could be made|pg||
nt|star6ija: what can one lead cause ... :)|pg||
nt|athene: for example just run @SJ which north must duck|pg||
nt|athene: then duck a heart |pg||
nt|athene: and then play @HAK, @CA and another, endplaying north and setting up @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: north can cash @DA and one long heart but then leads into the @SAK10|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer makes @DJ, FOUR spades, @HAK, @CAJ|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am sure that North is able to recognize the lead, so he won't duck it|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it right by W to press on?|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see an opening in E and 2@S fin|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: we had openning from N without comment on table|pg||
nt|serhat: slm|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sunsamvar: now east has to guess which minor ace p holds|pg||
nt|athene: i remember a very famous hand which Dano De Falco played in 3nt a bit like this|pg||
nt|athene: it was the last hand of a bermuda bowl - about 1983 or so|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: even so doubt this is much over 30%|pg||
nt|beto: really?|pg||
nt|beto: wow|pg||
nt|kit: my general philosophy is:  If I don't accept a game invitation, it is because I think we may be too high already|pg||
nt|beto: argetnina reached 6@H and the @SA was lead on board 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: But I can not se Batov bidding @S after pards minor bid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: I really dislike West's actions--if he consults partner they can defend 3@H which where they belong |pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: And Panev are a gooooood player|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT by those atone 15 at W? I would have upgraded them or made it the line under. 1@D and later bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 91 teams entered the Mixed Teams. We are now down to 32. Losers are eliminated, winners advance to the Round of 16 later today|pg||
nt|athene: he had to run the @SJ and north did duck - then there might have been an endplay but de falco went down|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: well try it on a club lead|pg||
nt|granguru: this is board 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: atone was stone|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: In white the line always are easyer at HP|pg||
nt|donatoru: the best return is small @d , but impossibile in real life , Geta thinks that Radi is A@d sgltn |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Unadventurous 6NT needs little more than the @S finesse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Board 5|pg||
nt|beto: sry board 5|pg||
nt|levix: no middle cards,or 3nt makeable for e-w,|pg||
nt|rodal f: Def to hard for N|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Rafa: other room board 5 6@h E @SA lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think the declarer will win the contract|pg||
nt|athene: it got very interesting there if declarer played a heart|pg||
nt|athene: GIB says it's always down but there are lots of ways for the defence to go wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Rafa: This is the last segment of the Open Teams Finals, 59th. Southamerican Championship|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|moen: D2 same res as in OR|pg||
pc|d6|nt|star6ija: @c now an curtains|pg||
nt|star6ija: and|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stc: 6@c by W has some play and makes on a @h@s lead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|rayhaa: thk x better than 3@h, than maybe S wld play something else than @h lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Another diamond will make declarer a little nervous|pg||
nt|poussin: he can safely finesse the @s|pg||
nt|davidstern: Serf have doubled their lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: The spade finesse will now be ok as there are four spade tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|garnetts: it is better--then so is redouble initially--then you can bid 2@S and go to sleep |pg||
nt|garnetts: east will now lose five more tricks|pg||
nt|donatoru: now lady is near the home :|pg||
nt|donatoru: )|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Rafa: We are broadcasting from the Sheraton Hotel in Santiago de Chile|pg||
nt|beto: In the ladies match brazil is trailing by 4 against argentina with 16 to go i was told|pg||
nt|granguru: The never ending discusion..to lead or not to lead an A against a slam|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Not easy to see, but often it's right to drive at the road u have fond.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Still. 3NT are to be 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: this defeats declarer in a cute way|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: So 3@S was??????????? and fin|pg||
nt|nickf: next|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rayhaa: many use RD as 9+ without support|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer now forced to play another club I think - not knowing of doubleton spade king|pg||
nt|davidstern: Identical position in closed room|pg||
nt|poussin: I wonder why declarer didnt keep 4 @s in dummy and try to let the 10 of @s run|pg||
nt|serhat: he is worried if K is off side|pg||
nt|poussin: maybe he thought south would have routinely ducked this |pg||
nt|serhat: yes this wasnt the best line|pg||
nt|star6ija: he can't go down now|pg||
nt|star6ija: second @s and S is hopeless|pg||
nt|athene: south had to just clear the diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: S has to release the hearts|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Rafa: Live with the two tables in screen at the O'higgins ball room with live commentary by Eduardo Scanavino, Maestro Argentino|pg||
nt|granguru: On the last round @SA gave the slam up...this time it beats it|pg||
nt|Rafa: This show can be viewed at the hotel rooms via TV too|pg||
nt|duschek: So with 11 boards to go it's Chile by 34 - Argentina need to bid and make this one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: Maybe xx shows a shortage in spades --but if it does they need more method |pg||
nt|athene: @D8 very strange|pg||
nt|athene: really that card not the @D6?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: now declarer can just cash the @SK and south has to throw a heart|pg||
nt|donatoru: first idea , they havent time to find a defence ag. 1@c--1@d !! ( art) , again pas with good @d suit and a resonable @h suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|donatoru: i lose my money , never bet in Sunday |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think he will now cash three hearts and finesse the spade again|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer can play @HK, @CJ and another, endplaying south to lead into the @DQ7!|pg||

nt|donatoru: a nice game with 18 points , let's see the wild pair Mihai in auction :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Oh joy we have halved the lead|pg||
nt|2hplus4: N was squeezed in @D and @S|pg||
nt|rado: now some cards for EW|pg||
nt|athene: i think when the @S9 appeared under the @SJ, declarer could perhaps have worked out the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|athene: but it certainly wasn't easy|pg||
nt|eamongall: but even if he/she play good still lose 10 imps :):)|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke: oh wait, maybe 3 down is correct|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nickf: looks like a normal 3NT down 1 on a club lead|pg||
nt|rayhaa: I thk Kopstads 3@s just was indiciplined  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: weak|pg||
nt|rado: 3NT on @D finesse|pg||
nt|donatoru: first set-up for Romania ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|granguru: Brazil women entered this round (2 remaining) with 2 IMps ahead of Argentina|pg||
nt|levix: other table opened 1h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here we might are at dynamit|pg||
nt|athene: all the intricacies of 3NT in this room are somewhat swamped by the result in the other room|pg||
mb|d|nt|duschek: Very aggressive 1@C, or rather, excessive|pg||
nt|athene: certainly EW have an easier job defending 4@DX than playing 3NT|pg||
nt|eamongall: specs tell that the Madame Phelan was driving the ship on the 3Nt hands |pg||
nt|moen: seems so|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Ended slowly|pg||
nt|rodal f: By loosers. Only by loosers EW have 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: End for EW at 2@S|pg||
nt|nickf: not anymore though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: Lavazza is in 3NT next door NS, so here's a chance for a pickup for Buaijh|pg||
nt|yke: 6@H is not that bad|pg||
nt|aldek: you will make it if you bid it|pg||
nt|yke: after a spade lead, you can try to drop the @CK first which will work|pg||
nt|yke: 3@d now?|pg||
nt|yke: maybe the play it as NF|pg||
nt|aldek: but it's not a good contract, as we say it|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|donatoru: i dont agree to open W's hand|pg||
nt|moen: hi Jon|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: light 3rd seat opening -- may propel E-W to 4S, which I don't think they can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north is trying to make something happen with that 1@C semi-psych opening|pg||
nt|Rafa: 500 people from the audience saying hi from here |pg||
nt|beto: i think he did|pg||
nt|athene: ladies are S and E at all the other tables i looked at|pg||
nt|Walddk4: it's mandatory|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I played in this event twice|pg||
mb|d|nt|donatoru: 2@s too conservative bid , 1NT is semiforcing here , 3@s is weak, 2@h is constructive raise , whihc is best bid ?|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3@c from Geta after 2@s i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: in @H best|pg||
nt|rado: quiet 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: i remember Sabine Auken complaining about this rule in her book :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Fred og Eugen|pg||
mb|4H|nt|nickf: I agree with 3D, looks like the cards are poorly placed.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well if he thought 2@S was right then 3@S is clearly wrong in view of the third seat opening|pg||
nt|donatoru: ouuf|pg||
nt|poussin: what system do NS play?|pg||
nt|rado: most probably making 3 sinche @H shift from N after Q@D is not so easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a silly rule|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let people sit where they want|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps she will try to swap with Bocchi when the director isn't looking|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: We beat that number Rafa, 800 in this room :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But hi back to all of you in Santiago|pg||
nt|kit: This is even less likely to make|pg||
nt|Rafa: :) but you can't make "the wave" as we are doing here|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C are 9 or 10 but 5 are down|pg||
nt|rayhaa: what is Norths RD, just showing a honor?|pg||
nt|aldek: she should know if 3@D is forcing|pg||
nt|davidstern: N/S play standard style with weak 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We can try|pg||

nt|rodal f: Can be all from 8 til 10|pg||

nt|garnetts: Probably |pg||
nt|garnetts: This looks like one off after the lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: unless a pass from east suggested defending 1@S I absolutely loath 2@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure it should show six|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The rule is actually sexist|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I guess 11C did stir something up|pg||
nt|beto: har dto get to 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|othered1: !@C|pg||
nt|duschek: Also quite aggressive by East - 13 HCP with no intermediates, and any finesses but in hearts through the weak hand|pg||
nt|beto: agee ed|pg||
nt|poussin: I thought north would bid 3@c|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: isn't 1 nt an underbid with the west hand ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because there is no rule in the Open or Women|pg||
nt|athene: looks like two spades and two clubs to lose here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Rafa: many kibs sent me this:         |pg||
nt|yke: i really hate the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|poussin: well done|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Only a low @S lead would have troubled declarer here|pg||
nt|2hplus4: And no reason whatsoever to try that|pg||
nt|donatoru: Great Kelsey have a chapter : " Too many Queens and Jacks" , but in actual world run :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru: Chile has the highest gap in the whole match now 34 IMPs|pg||
nt|Rafa: nice wave!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: /////\\\\\\\\/////////////\\\\\\\\//////////\\\\\\\\\\\   thanks to HedyG|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why? Need a @S ruff|pg||
nt|rayhaa: yes def, strange pass to see what happens|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: top spade lead ok here|pg||
nt|josj: might therefore even be against EU Law|pg||
nt|athene: north might lead a small club at some point and save the overtrick|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: oops |pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seriously, I think it is, Jos|pg||
nt|athene: that was a risky finesse|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Clubs could be doubleton if 4-4-3-2 otherwise generally min of three|pg||
pc|dK|nt|beto: the gap will narrow sson as argentina is in 3N board 6, same lead as this room|pg||
nt|duschek: They missed a game at board 6 - they are certainly not going to miss two in a row, may be their philosophy|pg||
nt|kit: looks like declarer is getting the spades right, but I don't think that will get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: No. 4@H will run home|pg||
nt|donatoru: Hi Jon , welcome|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahalim: yes but the @S 8 will then be a stopper|pg||
nt|rado: after K@C shown N should find @H Switch|pg||
pc|d7|nt|beto: dont even to 8 kit|pg||
nt|athene: it might lead to the loss of @HK, three clubs and two trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: But best def are to do. Play trumh|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|donatoru: 2 off ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: against 3 nt he might have|pg||
nt|josj: It certainly is against Dutch Law but who cares about that? :)|pg||
nt|athene: much better just to bash our @SA and another|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club now is best|pg||
nt|davidstern: or ruff spade and then club|pg||
nt|poussin: maybe @s ruffed and @c|pg||
nt|poussin: trying to score 6@d 1@c and 2@h|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table same contract|pg||
nt|athene: now you are cold for 8 tricks on a 3-2 break|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: one ruff sidappeared . now very cheap indeed|pg||
nt|jbgood: disappeared:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb (- go looking for my glasses)|pg||
nt|donatoru: It seems ag Scandinaves we must be more and more agressive like them :) |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|beto: defence is in the right track|pg||
nt|kit: defense doing very well -- now may get 2 club tricks set up before ace of spades dislodged|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nickf: as a spectator points out, the key to the hand is to endplay East by leading a H to the 9 in the endgame|pg||
nt|rado: Declarer had @S stop + @D honours + K@C so no room for AQ@H:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: here too and we don't have that rule|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|aldek: take 9 tricks and run|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|davidstern: Also you thought North might 3@C but that would have meant south would be declarer - you havent played many mixed events I am guessing|pg||
pc|s5|nt|donatoru: a catastrophic score for Romania, a take-out passed in the Open,2 conservative bids in the closed and 21-2|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer deciding if North really would underlead the KQ of hearts twice|pg||
nt|poussin: lol|pg||
nt|serhat: this is better|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 and fin I belive|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: In some places, UK for instance, they also dictate where North should be. I am talking about tables without screens|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a big sign on the wall   N|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: another silly rule|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|granguru: @S7|pg||
nt|duschek: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning Frank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7:50 am Sunday is it?|pg||
nt|kit: squeeze position can't really exist, and I think declarer realizes that|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes |pg||
nt|rodal f: But Batov are a bit afraid by his way of ruffing|pg||
nt|serhat: why did E duck Qc?|pg||
nt|poussin: my partners always play better than I do|pg||
nt|davidstern: As I said you obviously dont play in mixed events|pg||
nt|moen: 2 down and first score for the Romanian team|pg||
mc|8|nt|garnetts: concede four tricks and move oon|pg||
nt|donatoru: hard work anyway , :)|pg||
