mb|p|nt|cicus: I think 3@H was not forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: now some judgment is required|pg||
nt|mariner1: this can be set......... not easily|pg||
nt|roswolf: east should pull to 5@H i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3down 5@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree 5@H looks better than defending and you are RED|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C can make too|pg||

nt|bridge_one: East know to have too much @H in the line|pg||

nt|marlowepi: strong hands. there is some merit to that but there is much to be said against it too--when you can describe your shape in one bid, do it--especially when you don't have spades|pg||
