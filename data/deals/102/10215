mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|sharynr: South's @S too tempting to allow 2@H to buy the hand|pg||

nt|pale hose: Hi all|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|plateos: Yes they were systematically in a bad place. Unfortunately from the Finnish point of view beating this needs concentration (decl cannot get out of dummy)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharynr: perhaps 2 rounds of @S to see it 10 drops...before playing a @C|pg||
nt|plateos: @h now gives declarer (atleast DD) chance by unblocking the 1H and then @d|pg||
nt|sharynr: Of course, easy to see that 2@C cashed followed by a @S exit will lock declarer in dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 8 or 9 tricks with the spades 3-3 |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: possible but might not be easy -- it's a complex hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes defenders should play trump immediately after taking @C trick|pg||

nt|paulg: 6@h looks the best slam, at least you have some options in the play|pg||

pc|c4|nt|pale hose: you tell me how often do you anticipate making 3N holding the West hand|pg||
nt|plateos: Juuri-Oja is not afraid of bidding VUL games! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqm: 3@d is ART 5c@s|pg||
nt|pale hose: and how often will 4S be a superior contract even agains at doubleton|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|plateos: But I would normally like to play 2NT (as 1 is not any more possible) with that collection.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|pale hose: y agree|pg||
pc|h6|nt|plateos: Normally this should be ducked to prevent entry from Dumy but now I am unsure (partner has the @d and you wabt declarer to finess)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|plateos: Juho has the sound point that this must be ducked in case Kiema has AK dubbelton in @s|pg||

nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand and somewhat of a misfit too|pg||
nt|lestergold: the sort of hand that tends to poduce a swing|pg||
nt|xenya:  S played it very well |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: this looks like missed game by EW in the OR|pg||
nt|pelu: Norway missed 3Nt in board 15 (playing 3@C)|pg||
nt|xenya: just what W wants to hear|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like to show 6-4 as majors - if pd bid 2@S on a 3 card suit we play on 4-3 and not 6-2|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C for the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|wwalter: was tuff< but he made :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 more deals let us see|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/ a minor part score n/s potential to get too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|xenya: on the other hand, it might help to uncover a magic 5-4 @S fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: passed hand X- S may bid 2S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: shd get to the @C game now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: at least|pg||
nt|pelu: now NS has problems |pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: 4@h is very hard for defeating|pg||
nt|lestergold: now south couldnt come in warned of misfit by opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: deal 8  down 2 in OR because of bidding system - N opened 1 D and S passed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 2@H is fourht suit forcing - the pitiful crutch|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: if Rd = ½ stopper S can bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: as a well-known author described it|pg||
nt|paulg: again the cards lie favourably for declarer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D-4@H-4@s and on we go|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|raghavan: solves headache for S|pg||
nt|pelu: 3x1H - and N will make - can set up the 9. trick in @C|pg||
nt|xenya: reasonable contract -- remains to make it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: trump lead wants to prevent east ruffing his spade losers in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzku: still he cant make 400 :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: Looks like going in for slam in C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not 4@S. I thought East would bid that|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: still, she has shown her hand well.|pg||
nt|raghavan: A good pass|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open room East played 3Nt very well - she had a @C-lead to the Q: First tryed for @SQx : taking @SAK - then @HAK hopiong for fall of !Q or 10: succed: @H10 and she set up a ...|pg||
nt|pelu: 1H-trick and 1D K onside = 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|raghavan: E has 3 diamond loser but can ruff 2 only - + a S loser|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not totally clear how to go about this|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: E would have done very well to reopen but was deterred by the unfavourable vulnarability perhaps |pg||
pc|s8|nt|raghavan: develop H now|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer must be unhappy -- from his perspective, the contract is bound to fail|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: 5 IMPs for 2@H making (1NT -1) to Calandra|pg||
nt|xenya: he might even play a @H at some point in an attempt to endplay E|pg||
nt|xenya: he has no idea @Hs are 6-2 of course|pg||
nt|pelu: I feel with N!|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer very lucky can now get out losing a only a club spade and heart thats if he sets up the clubs now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: no im wrong nortth get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: oh|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wwalter: Vivi will win 4 sure now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the curse of scotland |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: and the stiff @SA didn't look too good either|pg||
nt|xenya: good news!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: E has denied Spade control so west thought 6 may not make|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the websites leads to a number of errors - e.g. participants leads to an error message|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: the @DJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: well only if south gives it to him|pg||
nt|pelu: if he take out 4X@D he have no entry for @C10|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: why spade discard|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: hard to follow it appears that south played declarer for 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the bulletins are not available either|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|c7|pg||

nt|sharynr: 2 1/2 looks right|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: not quite a limit raise :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|plateos: I'm not sure what are there methods though, without any concetnions 2@s my the least of evils|pg||

nt|lestergold: pity started wqiuth excellent defence|pg||
nt|pelu: last board|pg||
nt|xenya: note W's duck at trick 1 -- that kept declarer in the dark until the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: had W won with  the K and returned the suit, N would have certainly made it |pg||
mb|1C|nt|thegarve:  so pdf format is fine but not the web format|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: Thanks all |pg||
nt|pelu: 3@h?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|thegarve:  So Swedes mashed their neighbours and rivals this time|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: north will be thinking of a slam with this massive two suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: i thank co commentator Mr walter, My closest friend Momchil, Important Kibits, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last board for this session|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2@H is fine with Qxx@s in your hand|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR - and also @H10 to 8 and @HQ|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: a pity about the two club losers|pg||
mb|2S|nt|raghavan: WHY THIS x unneccessary|pg||
nt|wwalter: double is a good preempt against the slem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: dbl was showing points and 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: that's exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: an anonymous contributor says 6@C is going down next door|pg||
mb|3C|nt|wwalter: only 1190 not 1440 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south with a double fit bidding a very conservative 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: as expected no club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here we have a standard 4@S - but in the Open room Peter Fredin in West found the killing lead : @C7!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: last board and an exact tie -- few imps exchanged, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@C checkback. 2N=two hearts and a maximum|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: yes it went down. tough to make 12 tricks actually|pg||
nt|pelu: close correct card but wrong suit :)|pg||
nt|pelu: when u see AKQ by pd u like to bid 3@D! :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  34-4 now and can only increase|pg||
nt|xenya: the point is, did E also show a major 2-suiter or just @Hs? |pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pelu: Ferraro: your partner dont like that bid :) - she knot how to defeat 2Nt!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sunsamvar: this is even tougher|pg||
nt|xenya: seems EW have lost control over the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|xenya: 1@C was strong, but i'm not sure about 1N|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pelu: also a major 2-suiter|pg||
mb|5S|an|2 KEYS|nt|raghavan: This again - I wont play SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: looks like transfer for @cs|pg||
mb|6C|nt|wwalter: will be only 990|pg||
nt|star6ija: or accepted the hand as semi-balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt E and W will have a few words to say to each other after the hand is over|pg||
nt|star6ija: normally it is 2 down and 13 IMPs to Herbst|pg||
nt|pelu: @SA and a small @H!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you in 6 there have may hav been a warning double or the view that the slam could only be defeated with the help of the club suit|pg||
mb|6D|nt|raghavan: seeing SAJ109 etc|pg||
