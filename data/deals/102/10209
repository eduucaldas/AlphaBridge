nt|fabsayc: 1@H was the alternative, showing spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|Rafa: EW won last year the official pairs too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But agree at u. Attack from the cards u have|pg||
nt|levix: yes,sometimes,if weak hand, lead doubleton is not bad|pg||

nt|levix: still need guess DK,|pg||
nt|garnetts: It won't once South tried 2@H--|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Looks like a 3NTEW for me but problems can be on the line|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is double better or 2@H?  |pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|granguru: GOOD STOP|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|rayhaa: it depends on agreement i guess|pg||
nt|rayhaa: u can bid 2@h as non forcing and X as neg or invitational or vice versa|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes to some extent--but in my case it would be qa choice--could start with either--except that a subsequent heart bid would not be forcing if I doubled first|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i suppose it might have kept e/w out of a spade partscore|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: this looks -1 or even 2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: pinpoint bidding, with the @SK not in opening bidder's hand|pg||
nt|aldek: Last hand was unjust for Bep Vriend, here she overbid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nigel_k:  3NT is not too bad, but it needs clubs 4-3 so will fail|pg||

pc|sA|nt|beto: nice stop although 4@S looks good in this bidding seeing only NS cards|pg||
nt|duschek: There are those who would have bid a direct 4@S holding South's cards, but perhaps the strong hearts persuaded him to be cautious|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: And a and at the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Admitted, here north has implied some length in pointed suits|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Kit!|pg||
nt|othered1: some pretty good play so far, including the defense here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade finesse for down 1|pg||
nt|duschek: Duck a diamond for a make, say several kibitzers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not much chance that will work|pg||
nt|duschek: Except West still has a heart, sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: requires hearts 5-2 and probably a prior error|pg||
nt|beto: well on a @D duck defence can cash its @H|pg||
nt|duschek: At least I am not just quiet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it is indeed a legitimate chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't work here but it might have|pg||

mb|3C|nt|kit: E-w might get higher if East splinters now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a hard fight NS vs EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug can help:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: West can get quite close to making 3NT I think but 4@S looks like losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult to predict the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rayhaa: another 4@s borderline|pg||
nt|donatoru: aginst double is KQJxx vs 1098x:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: West is going to like his hand a lot|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT is a lucky make here with a spade guess|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  They may also consider 4S game now after the diamond bid by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi arifin|pg||
nt|yke: I think S is too strong for 3@C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: At pess there came an auto 1@S|pg||
nt|yke: better 2NT but two small diamonds is a flaw|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: two cues and a signoff|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have as I see it. 5@C on a finding at @D and EW 9 in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: But a good spot for 4@S+1 here|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|Rafa: Other room play has stopped, Lucena called the director|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard choice for North but 2H is pessimistic|pg||

nt|aldek: some would bid 2@D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: well a not much extra 4H|pg||
nt|duschek: 4 so-called losers in East - will he stop?|pg||
nt|kit: East has easy pass -- he already forced to game|pg||

nt|rodal f: I feltthe whole time fore a re opening NS for fight. Did not need that.|pg||

nt|nickf: XX to show a maximum pass?|pg||
nt|nickf: 2NT perhaps to show 4S and just 2H ?|pg||

nt|donatoru: :) my dear parts :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: dont think they will stop...|pg||
nt|nickf: and Lavazza did bid and make the 4-3 spade game on 5|pg||
nt|nickf: either West or North could be thinking here, I think the operator puts in 2 bids at a time.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|granguru: or exactly 4 I believe|pg||
nt|kit: and the 1@S call probably shows exactly 3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Heavy 2@S|pg||
nt|rayhaa: looks like problems with connection between tables, so score in film is wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Lite 3@H |pg||
nt|ahalim: and a lot of tricks w/o a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: was that 5C by North or East ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: well, they did|pg||
nt|duschek: Or could show a small balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it also is usually dead minimum|pg||
nt|yke: E implied a 4 card spade because she bid double first|pg||
nt|yke: only 8 tricks |pg||
pc|c2|nt|yke: wow... they made 4@H in OR|pg||
pc|c5|nt|donatoru: hard work for the both : declarer and defence , i bet 5 ttricks for e-w , + 200 Romania|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: Takes a lot of courage to stop at 2NT vulnerable -- a fine line to walk|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east could have a no trick 12 count|pg||
nt|duschek: Seems to make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|kit: and this time it looks like they were wrong|pg||
nt|granguru: agree but e has minimum minimum and 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is up to opener with anything extra|pg||
nt|kit: those 10's have a way of adding up on hand's such as these|pg||
nt|beto: i cw seen to many agressive openings by paca and ben|pg||
nt|duschek: There are three very valuable tens which they forgot to include in their HCP count|pg||
nt|beto: so here is where they pay the price for opening 10 and 11 counts|pg||

nt|beto: really?|pg||
nt|beto: wow|pg||
nt|kit: my general philosophy is:  If I don't accept a game invitation, it is because I think we may be too high already|pg||

nt|rodal f: But I can not se Batov bidding @S after pards minor bid|pg||

pc|h7|nt|rodal f: And Panev are a gooooood player|pg||

nt|rodal f: End for EW at 2@S|pg||

nt|yke: 6@H is not that bad|pg||
nt|aldek: you will make it if you bid it|pg||
nt|yke: after a spade lead, you can try to drop the @CK first which will work|pg||
nt|yke: 3@d now?|pg||
nt|yke: maybe the play it as NF|pg||
nt|aldek: but it's not a good contract, as we say it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: light 3rd seat opening -- may propel E-W to 4S, which I don't think they can make|pg||

nt|Rafa: 500 people from the audience saying hi from here |pg||
nt|beto: i think he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|donatoru: 2@s too conservative bid , 1NT is semiforcing here , 3@s is weak, 2@h is constructive raise , whihc is best bid ?|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3@c from Geta after 2@s i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: in @H best|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I agree with 3D, looks like the cards are poorly placed.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Def a bit bad there|pg||
nt|garnetts: It was true that NS could make 4@S with a 3-3 spade break and a 3-2 club break but they will never be able to bid|pg||

mb|p|pc|cK|nt|nickf: Well next door bocchi had a chance in the endgame to make 3NT but he didnt make the winning play|pg||
nt|garnetts: It also suggests that North should bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: The overcall works well, as 1NT is cold and 2@S has chances|pg||

nt|beto: yes, very nice leaf|pg||
nt|beto: lead|pg||

nt|rodal f: We already see the result but 12 might was hard|pg||
nt|rayhaa: lucky @d J10, so 5@h makes|pg||

nt|levix: no overtrick with this lead|pg||
nt|nickf: easier when we see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: declarer might still make by setting up hearts, discarding a club on third heart rather than ruffing it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Well Lerfald. I missed at my quick analyce|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Clasic one|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|garnetts: If that was a strong club and north showed 5-7 then pass is surely forcing--if it wasn't a strong club then South must act|pg||
nt|yke: operator?|pg||

nt|rodal f: How many tricks at 1NT?|pg||

nt|yke: something went wrong in the diamond suit, but its ok now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|beto: maybe more|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will lead a heart and pitch a club|pg||
nt|beto: he will only get 3 more tricks now|pg||
nt|frankaus: started and finished with 6 top tricks|pg||
nt|kit: then opponents play on clubs, he ruffs, crosses to dummy, and plays another heart pitching diamond|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c4|nt|kit: West ruffs, but must break diamonds, so down 1 I believe|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 board matches|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|beto: 3N by ns, down on a @S lead|pg||
nt|aldek: 12 tricks is plenty|pg||

mb|p|nt|donatoru: now 21-9 converted in VP|pg||
mb|2H|nt|beto: 1N - 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: Tough hand - seems 5@D is on a finesse (and diamonds 3-2)|pg||
nt|nickf: this hand is a bit more complex. East makes a lot of clubs, but how many ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: East should double for take out|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|beto: 1N 2@C 2@D 3N|pg||
nt|nickf: 12 if Mme Lavazza guesses clubs.|pg||
nt|garnetts: double is much more flexible than 3@D |pg||
nt|rayhaa: good x, can they stop in 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|duccino: Board 1 was deleted and they played a brand new one. So results of board 11 are correct but the cards are not|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nickf: but what NS are doing is anyone's guess|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nickf: I dont think duboin will drive this to slam tho|pg||
pc|s8|nt|duschek: No alternative to the spade lead, so this hand is over quickly|pg||
nt|kit: Pretty hard to stay out of 3NT, even if N-S had methods where North could show his shape|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|kit: East will play 9 at trick 1, and b shocked when it holds|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nickf: there's too much duplication in hearts for starters.|pg||
nt|aldek: in a short match overtricks add up to an IMP or even two|pg||
pc|h2|nt|donatoru: Mama mia , a good chance for Romania is a slam played by Erichsens|pg||
nt|donatoru: 3 keys |pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: on normal play this is either -1 or2 but the defence have to be careful|pg||
nt|ahalim: N will have a fir when he finds out that the K was single :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|nickf: the Irish have stopped in 5C next door|pg||
nt|nickf: the status of 3D is probably unclear ot Duboin|pg||
nt|nickf: if it was a stopper ask, he didnt have it.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|donatoru: but the defence must be carrefull|pg||
nt|donatoru: let's see @s lead|pg||
nt|donatoru: Geta must mark very well the shape |pg||
nt|donatoru: Radu thinking alsos about J@c lead |pg||

nt|donatoru: bet again :) @s lead|pg||

pc|s3|nt|nickf: and why did East open 1C ahead of 1D, anyway ?|pg||

pc|d6|nt|kit: diamond discards speed things up|pg||
pc|s5|nt|duschek: Here the Argentinians must hope for a push|pg||

nt|ahalim: right but how high will they gp ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry go|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|yke: 1@S=diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it isn't like 3NT is the worst contract ever been in last hand -- sometimes spades are 4-4, sometimes they don't find the spade lead when 3-card holding is on lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west will relay with 1s|pg||
nt|ahalim: just :)|pg||

mb|4H|nt|roswolf: amusing look to the auction|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk7: as choose a major I presume, showing equal length|pg||
nt|roswolf: logical explanation|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@D showed both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will have to decide whether to sac at some level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good morning Silvia|pg||

nt|fabsayc: or not guess this time he did not care|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: practicality won out|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 3-3  would be 12 tricks|pg||
nt|rayhaa: is that correct opening?|pg||
nt|roswolf: more or less the par spot|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: Not in my view :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Unless it shows a good hand with 5-5 majors which I doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director was called|pg||
nt|rayhaa: strange defence too|pg||
nt|garnetts: Does anyone know?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Nicked a trick with the 8@C --which is odd too--|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director on the table|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|nickf: so if this is flat the Irish will record a 17-13 win over one of the favourites|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ady: must be carefull not to shorten trumps too much in trying to get     back to hand to establish clubs|pg||
nt|ady: after ruffing 1 club   winning line is to draw trumps   and give up 2 club tricks    this works with either clubs 3-3  or  if not trumps 2-2|pg||
