nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand - big swings possible for both sides|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|3D|nt|roswolf: 4 or wvwn 6@H could be bid|pg||
nt|athene: east will just bid diamonds and forget trying to get the spades into it|pg||
nt|roswolf: even|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: unless 3@D shows spades?|pg||
nt|athene: i remember seeing one pair playing these jumps as 6minor 4major|pg||
nt|athene: but it's certainly not standard|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: no but these 2 suited bids are popular in eastern europe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i can't say i am a big fan of the forcing 1NT response with a 3-card raise|pg||

nt|athene: people do make "weak" jump overcalls with good-ish hands with a limited partner|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: but here west wasn't a passed hand - she had just passed over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: which isn't the same thing|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
