nt|fulldire: which is the meaning of 4@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@S has some chances on a non-heart lead since south must keep all her clubs to avoid subjecting pard to a squeeze|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Want the operator to ask her? :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't see any squeeze, maybe I am blind|pg||
nt|fulldire: no there is no squeeze if defence make well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As Mark Horton points out, 6@S would have chances if North had the @H10 as well, as the @H 9 would then be a menace|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe he pitched @C8 before and not the jack|pg||
