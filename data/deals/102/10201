pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|h7|pc|c9|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: in encyclopedia this is also called Rule of 15  [which has 2nd definition that covers a lead convention]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- we've found an 11 that I would NOT open :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: try Cansino Count Al,,,,,, easier to say :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i mean East -- not North|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: I knew Cansino as convention over opp 1N -- didn't know there was another meaning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 3@H [support DBL]|pg||
nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I was thinking they might find the A@C lead to beat 4....... no chance though on 83|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen not opening has really made things difficult for Pollack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: players closing eyes resting, while she thinks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is DBL takeout??|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: is 2N nat or scramble?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: what is 2@H??  |pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: Stasha's eyes opened wide with the 4 spades call|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 2NT is the red suits, and Meckstroth will decide how high now|pg||
nt|cindy:  it will be pretty high i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S for N/S, 5@H for E/W - 4@S Dbl is a good defense for N/S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most pairs use the available 2 cue bids to differentiate various strength bids for East|pg||
mb|3H|an|spades|nt|bridge_one: for E/W sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i inverted NS EW|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@H is a Weaker @s bid I suppose|pg||

mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: may be only @S - but i think can be also strong|pg||
