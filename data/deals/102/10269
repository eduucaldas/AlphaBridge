mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: 1st to 1 nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: rare, nowadays, to get to open with a flat 13 in 4th seat.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the other table  East responded 5N to 4N ask -- probably showing 1-KeyCard + void|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@D by a team that was being outplayed isn't surprising|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me would be 2 and void|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: trump Q gets lost in the shuffle, so I really don't like the choice of 5N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: would you rebid west's hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd be in the minority (it says here) and pass 1@H|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|othered1: yesterday I played with my only partner (and a long-standing one at that) who insists 5N is one plus a void|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: of course if responses to 4N KeyCard are 0314 then maybe worried 5@D gets passed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 1 ace if 5@D, i can see why you might avoid that|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's fine agreement if you're sure void will help|pg||
nt|othered1: Is east's bidding natural?  Why 2@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i expect void to be irrelevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our East splintered with 3@S over 2@D |pg||
nt|othered1: Are they playing something like Blue Team Club, where the rebid of the 5-card suit was mandatory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so, but i might do it anyway to save space with aceless hand|pg||
nt|othered1: if 5@D is responding to key card ask, maybe excludes partner's secondary suit as a useful void.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: now was afraid 5@H to play, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S looks like ask @DQ|pg||
nt|othered1: That's looking for @DQ, I presume, guaranteeing all keys|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|leao: i agree, merit to campos' bid|pg||
