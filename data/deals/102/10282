pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|raghavan: Hi Hans |pg||
nt|werge: Hi|pg||
nt|werge: Best defence should beat this - after that lead|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|justin c: NS have done well here |pg||
nt|rhelle:  of course, he has limited his hand by not doubling first and then bidding @h ... but still, I'd expect more if I was South|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  still the end result is a pretty decent contract|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|rhelle:  and with the red Queens right, he can't really go off|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|werge: A clecer spec tells us, that 6 rounds of @D will put North into an end-play squeeze|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: And Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||

nt|werge: But too late now, only hope for defence was @H Ace in South|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle:  good switch!|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and equally good from North to put in the J straight away|pg||

pc|c6|nt|werge: I mean - his partner is sitting North, what is South waiting for?|pg||

nt|werge: ¤ @H and ¤ @S - both one down|pg||
nt|werge: 4 and 4...|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably a weak 2 suited call|pg||
nt|werge: Double-dummy you can win 4 @H, unless East shifts to a @D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|enotsrevli: lightning strike|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: 9 fast tricks in 3 spades|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: so n/s playing strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades + minor|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rnc: and they were _very_ fast, indeed :)|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: 1D wrong |pg||

mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|mmmakela: hi all sry late, didn't know about schedule change|pg||

nt|roswolf: tough decision here|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: a kibber points out that the law of total tricks doesnt work too well on the last one|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Then 2@S from North = clubs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think board 12 would be 6 IMPS ... surely declarer made 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|ady: south is better placed to compet with his good 7 card suit  when 1NT is passed    clear that north must have around an opening  and his suit will stand up against a shortage|pg||

nt|ady: that was 11 to tean aces      mesbur falling behind|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally the same team lost in finals of Indian selection trials for BFAME and Bermuda Bowl by margin of 5 IMPs after sudden death play-off of 4 boards, scores finished level ...|pg||
nt|rv: after 96 boards|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: Caroll will raise to 3@s?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: u mean ppp-1 @S?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mmmakela: 4 @S sry|pg||
nt|rv: lebensohl sequence|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rv: Sundarram's 2n shows either weak sign-off in any suit or GF hand with stopper|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  a lot of people play 2@d in this sequence as a general GF bid|pg||
nt|ady: with club finesse on   6@H can make even on best lead of a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|rv: I think Sundarram tactically bid 3n instead of showing stopper and 4 card @h with a bid of 3@h on Sridhar's 3@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: very cautious action by both east ans west|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Sridhar could have made another bid, possibly 4|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  satisfied with game   I suppose from west's point of view  east might have less|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rv: Sridhar can possibly 4@c on 3n and he can always pass partner's 4n|pg||
nt|rv: but playing lebensohl, Sundy might bid this way even with good 10-11 so Sridhar's pass of 3n would be my choice as well|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: yes, nthng to do with dias|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as is, after 1X - 1Y - 1NT: 2C = transfer to 2@d, and everything is invitational after|pg||
nt|rhelle:  And 2@d = any GF hand, nothing to do with @d|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: needs a heart lead to beat lucky but unlikely 6C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is a convention that works remarkably well, and I can recommend it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good treatment, shd be included in BBO2/1(or even sayc)|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S looks better than 3NT on the EW cards|pg||
nt|justin c: if one defender had five @C and the @DA, this could turn nasty|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I have some sympathy for East ... often the 5 @s tricks work just as well in 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: with @C 4-3, this is ok|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not clear why they chose NT with either's club holding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|rhelle:  I think this was a well-controlled sequence - East gave West a clear choice|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rhelle:  and I'd not be unhappy with ending in 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  if the horros scenario of 5@c and the @d Ace (in south) were to appear, 4@s would be in trouble too ... overruffs!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|werge: North is end-play-squeezed in the black suits, 11 tricks seem sure|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|rhelle:  and in 3NT you still have the option of simply finding the @hQ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hahahaha that @h play is really insulting North :)|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||

nt|fabsayc: several ways to beat, none particularly obvious|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 1 more to d'orsi for pretending to own spade ace|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Might east have made it easier by unblocking @HK when given the chance to keep off lead?|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: that was one of them|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but that is why i dont want partner opening 9 counts with 1 bids|pg||

nt|fabsayc: it takes the penalty double completely out of the game|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|vugrapha3: the bidding is correct |pg||
nt|chick: 1@S could be either some agreement we don't know, or a psyche to prevent a spade contract|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not alerted|pg||
nt|frankaus: baby psych|pg||
nt|chick: then possibly a psyche|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: some funny symmetry here in the major suit plays|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|frankaus: after an X showing @S when u have a good fit with pd's overcall|pg||
nt|chick: psyches are not alerted, in fact it's illegal to have a psyche agreement|pg||
nt|othered1: and he did get the lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra2: agree,  and penalty double "out of fashion" or out of the game  |pg||

mb|2D|an|multi|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: to me suit quality more important if only 4|pg||
nt|rv: this is group Z|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|justin c: I think it makes the most sense when your rho has opened a minor, so your p is more likely to be on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I'd pass the N hand nv|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   have a part score in spades   8 or 9 tricks  according to defence   but n/s have 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: this looks an easy 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: north is transferring into @C|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if opps bid spades compete in clubs|pg||
nt|justin c: W is cue bidding with a big @S fit|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT   would certainly have gone down on a spade lead|pg||

nt|mmmakela: N did some overbidding here, must bid 4 @C now|pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know what 3@D from North meant (maybe showing shortage, maybe showing @H)|pg||
nt|ady: has north ever linited his hand     would 4@C  now be forward going?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess so actually so must pass to avoid further dbls?|pg||
nt|justin c: whatever 3@D meant, it was likely gf|pg||
mb|3N|nt|justin c: making it quite an overbid|pg||
nt|rv: top 3 from each group qualify for Swiss league A, others play Swiss league B|pg||
mb|p|nt|enotsrevli: most of the Jacoby problems seem to stem from the fact that most start from a hand just worth a raise to game - then the hands with a little more become difficult- |pg||
mb|p|nt|enotsrevli: should win with club ace - then ac and another diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: wow|pg||
pc|c7|nt|enotsrevli: rule of 11 makes club ace safe unless West led a short suit|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: since he is thinking he is sure to play ace|pg||
nt|ady: will lose 50   or 100|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the favorable red suit layout lots of tricks available|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: Top 27 teams from Swiss league A and top 5 from league B qualify for K/O matches after league|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You will get a club lead and a C return|pg||

nt|ady: looking at the tow hands there seems some play for 4@S   but hopeles as cards lay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as West has a singleton heart. You can't reach dummy twice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|enotsrevli: lots of values but no game makes- 3NT fine without club lead- 4 spades no chance on lie|pg||
nt|rnc: Declaring from South, EW will find their @D-ruff |pg||

nt|enotsrevli: will be no good if he is declarer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this might do better|pg||

nt|enotsrevli: good bid I think and unlucky- he sensed the danger in spades after the 2D bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|enotsrevli: needs to sneak 1 diamond through|pg||
nt|enotsrevli: c queen and low diamond quickly - or d king quickly- speed is vital - already too slow|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
