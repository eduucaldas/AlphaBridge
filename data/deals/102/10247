mb|p|nt|pelu: tre other 3 hand = the bidding, but S??|pg||

nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcwla: But all in all, the auction could have been considerably worse.  This spot is reasonable if perhaps not ideal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he didnt know he would find partner with 100 honours in dims|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|xenya: S doesn't know that, of course -- from her perspectibe, contract mau be in real danger |pg||
nt|henryb: this is not worth a 15-17 1N (I do not know their range) and Jx is not a holding you particularly want to have as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5422 pattern  (yuck) |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the spot is ok its just the layout which is savage of course|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|xenya: sigh of relief from S|pg||
nt|xenya: now she will be quick to grab 11 i think|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR W passed the 2@C rebid and Hinden went -2 for -200.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Leslie knows that preventing spade ruffs more important than worrying about trump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: in most natral systems the ability to show heart suit in  a weak hand would not exist|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|c3|nt|pelu: We dont know, but asume that West didnt know :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised to see they play 2@c as weak both majors as they are not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|hK|nt|xenya: can claim that now|pg||
nt|lestergold: good defence|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi yer  Bill|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of rebidding 1NT with the E hand.  Certainly reasonable to rebid 2@C (as both did) with nine cards in two suits, but 1NT would have worked like a charm here to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: allow E/W to drop dead in 2@H.|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|don paulus: 2 off also ?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: West could bid 2@H natural non-forcing over 2@C as a passed hand, surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this could be flat with the defence taking 6 tricks unless endplayed which i think is do able now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb: not quite yet|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|brgpro: looks like 12 tricks in @s for E. why? well, you tend to lead from your short AK....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so Badger's on the board with 3.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 down how come i missed something obviously|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: but not when west has shown hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: the vulnerability should deter EW from sacrificing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as he now surely will|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: ok - maybe he won't get the chance|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I raise,  wonder if 2 @S or 3 H! is better |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H |pg||
nt|don paulus: ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The club layout might see this one home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here game to be bid but both 3n and 4h look precarious on thelayout|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s would be an egregious overbid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer shouldn't be given a chance to get a spade away from either hand on a long minor|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: 3@H for me too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow saly|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if south didnt find a spade lead there is no way he wouldnt find the switch when in with Kc|pg||
pc|s5|nt|charles_l: no takers :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dim if thats the way declarer plays it|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|pelu: yes ruff 3x@c disc @D - ruff @D ruff @h and u will have 12 tricks in the end|pg||

nt|brgpro: one spec. asked me if the ladies have sit S or E in this event, i guess yes|pg||
nt|athene: -450 can't surely be bad for NS|pg||

nt|wwalter: @d than @h|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: -650 sry|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: 13-11 to Lavazza after 4 bords |pg||

nt|charles_l: sitff @hJ and dummy reverse|pg||
nt|wwalter: any play would lose 1@h|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H P 1@S 2@D P P now west has a bit of a decision|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: that the screen partners on one side should be one lady and one gentleman|pg||
nt|athene: i know Sabine Auken doesn't like it - she complained about it in her book :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: N has single J|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder we've got a football (soccer) score in this set so far -- 2-1 -- the hands have been fairly routine |pg||

nt|xenya: but not this one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: I see playing rederse summy, ruffing 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s looks making as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: if south had raised to 4@D i am sure west wld have bid 4@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb: this hand is not trivial if N-s play more @h|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: or 3rd|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: duck |pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: dummy reversal is an attractive line, ruff 3 @D in Dummy|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes and lose a @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: in hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead on the go, might have done but who would do that?|pg||
nt|henryb: If she ducks, declarer can just ram @d down her throat|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in trumps are too good|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|don paulus: that would be 10 for badger|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|panja: @DA, @SQA..|pg||
nt|wwalter: the dummy has 1 @h losre, if the @h is not found|pg||
nt|wwalter: now should ruff some @d|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer has to worry about 4-1 trumps too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb: a heart continuation would create enormous problems|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d9|nt|charles_l: she is still ok though|pg||
nt|panja: if a @D is played now, decl will be a bit under pressure..|pg||
nt|panja: ruff high or not? where to place @SJ?|pg||
nt|wwalter: only one losing line, high ruff, than finess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: y, but from 13 tricks we have come to a point where a losing line is available|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|don paulus: don't like 170 scores in imps count :(|pg||
nt|jcwla: Threading the needle loses again.  They pay 500 extra for vulnerable games.|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: exiting the club there was 100% for the overtrick, no?|pg||
nt|athene: if you make 11, you persuade your partner to raise you next time it's close :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Neve had prime cards and two @S's for partner.  I love it when opponents try to judge that this will be the hand where they can only take nine tricks.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, for sure, it's much more restful defending 3major or 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: if you mess up and let an overtrick through - big deal :)|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think W shd take more blame|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H showed a strong slam try and demanded control-bid then 3@S didn't promise any extras|pg||
nt|brgpro: his 2@h rebid might not have shown 6|pg||
nt|athene: in which case maybe west should do more|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right.  Pressure at all times.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wwalter: is not so easy @@ the table, this is made by the great masters :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: well, count of not, the only play available is to drop @HJ or Q stiff in 7@S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brgpro: and 3@s was sort of "on the way" cue bid|pg||

nt|henryb: a big chance for Hansen|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: cash two clubs and then @HK and @H10 - even if you lose to east's @HQx, she may be endplayed anyway with @SA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: as far as inviting goes - conventional wisdom is that you don't want to play in the invitation very often, so you want partner to accept more often, i think?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: yes, boring 3nt|pg||

mb|1H!|an|transfer to !s|nt|charles_l: N must XX?|pg||
nt|panja: W is not very tolerant though, he wants to have his say in the matter|pg||
nt|athene: pretty boring 3nt here with an overtrick or two|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|henryb: even so, I think two aces is too mich opposite 2@c not to be trying for if not driving to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: again, W's pass looks timid|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: payback time :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: that would be law going too far|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||
nt|wwalter: after this board will come a friendly chat on EW :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||
nt|charles_l: lots down here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|athene: she might try leading @H9|pg||
nt|athene: or leading small to @H10|pg||
nt|athene: that still gives time to lead to @HK later|pg||
nt|wwalter: I hope the chairs will not fly :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment if you play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
pc|dK|nt|don paulus: 1 @c strong - then ok|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|henryb: Allix amazingly passive. I wonder what Neve would have done with the @dQ in addition|pg||
nt|athene: they probably play that you complete the transfer with any weak NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||
nt|athene: it gives up the legitimate play in the suit of @HQx / @HJx with east|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: this might give west time to get his long spade set up|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence take @CA, @S, three hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: the defence can actually stop declarer ducking a club into east's hand with certainty|pg||
nt|athene: west goes in with @CJ if declarer leads low from hand and east plays @C10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: but of course everything works for declarer|pg||

nt|athene: if scared that west has the @CQ|pg||

nt|brgpro: i've seen people leading singleton against a grand...so...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|charles_l: +1 here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: declarer is under no pressure here - although if south had @SK107 left, a diamond back wld be nasty|pg||
nt|pelu: the 4. slamswing: NS in 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: 96 imps changed hands in 11 boards|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: that's what we like to see!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: so all kibs - stay for tha last 2 boards!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|brgpro: the last 2 bds will be pairs or BAM ( board a match)|pg||
nt|wwalter: probaly they play 4M , we saw canape earlyer, so 1@c denies 4M|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an| |mb|p|nt|charles_l: will E dbl 2@d?|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brgpro: if 6@h is played by W, it is easier to find @d lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: E wont pass this...|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that Bocchi-Auken are exp that they are on lead - only 1 bad board - the 3NT-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: pass=2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yessssssssssss|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but all W's cards in the minors were "right", so perhaps his final raise was not too unreasonable -- though somewhat inconsistent with the cuatious style he had dispalyed before|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR just finished (and not on a good note for Badger), so welcome to all those who have come here from the OR.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|xenya: sorry for bad typing|pg||
nt|xenya: so it might be 13 imps for the trailing team |pg||
nt|henryb: not enough boards left|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|pelu: no @D stop = stop!|pg||
nt|charles_l: should always make - @d sets up for a loser discard|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: a nice scientific auction, asking NS to lead diamonds, please|pg||
nt|xenya: but the gap is already too wide to overcome, true |pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: could be an important imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume they VIP it |pg||
pc|sT|nt|panja: EW could either play a third @D for W to ruff small|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: if EW just blast into the slam, i think it's far from obvious to lead a diamond|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jcwla: The quiet before the (mild) storm of 14.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could choose to draw trumps and exit @SA and another here|pg||
nt|athene: then eventually the defence have to open diamonds or give a ruff-sluff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||

nt|charles_l: and as i was typing he went off...|pg||
nt|wwalter: this was a strange declar|pg||
nt|charles_l: Last board now. Thanks are due to our excellent operator Massimiliano, the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph, Walter Weber ...|pg||
nt|charles_l: and Panja our commentators. Also to our spectators for their insightful comments. I am Charles Leong.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Last board see you in 10 minutes :)|pg||
nt|panja: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx charles :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: ty too all great vg operators :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: wish U all a nice day, grazie Massimo,|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last bd of this set  |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thx to our terrific (now tired) operator Maxi,  still a great job! |pg||
nt|henryb: last board, and the imp scale does not extend to 39, so ...|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@H also bid on 26 in OR -- a push|pg||
nt|henryb: congratulations to the Neve team|pg||
nt|henryb: a deserved win|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thx also to Vladimir and Henry for your comments.  Always interesting and important discussion. |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Thx shirley see you all soon after lunch time |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an| |nt|brgpro: S wont lead @dA|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: So the only real big pickup this segment for Badger (and a deserved one) will be Board 6, where Allix/Neve rested in 3@S while Hinden played 3NT.|pg||
mb|1H|an|4+ spade|nt|brgpro: how many extra bds if the match is a draw?|pg||
nt|pelu: pl stay for the last board, Massimiliano :) - u have done a great job|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i'm here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: don't know baout important|pg||
nt|athene: East in the other room was trying to kill the entry to the diamonds>|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She was hoping for @DA with partner|pg||
nt|athene: putting her partner with the @DA|pg||
nt|ritong: after the strict fourth best lead|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case declarer would perhaps have just knocked out the @DA first of all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: Thx also to EBU and all of the folks who help bring this important tourney to  BBO |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this segment (these semis are quite short, aren't they?), a big thank you to Roland, Bill, Paul, Mike and all specs.  Some great comments.  The second and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: final segment is scheduled for the top of the hour, so stay tuned.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows 3+ and is forcing. It denies 4 and a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i didnt envisage stayman there|pg||
nt|panja: y, Major suits..so more equal|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: only one think please Massimiliano or Max not Massimo :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  thx for thoughts and comments,  we appreciate them @H@H  hope you enjoyed |pg||
nt|henryb: and to the BBO staff who make this available to them and you all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a little scary|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Roland in particular who herds us cats (sometimes called commentators)   He works very hard to make this run smoothly  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: simple 3NT |pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: Whats for lunch Massi |pg||
nt|henryb: probably down 1. declarer will take the @c finesse, and a @h shift will sink the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: May be a sandwich or a salad.........very light however I could sleep on 3° tournment :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: ??? - why not keep communication?|pg||
nt|pelu: before u take the trick - be sure what u wont to play next trick - if u dont know - then dont take the trick!|pg||
nt|brgpro: she was afraid Q10x by dec. and pd Jxx|pg||
nt|brgpro: now she knows QJ10|pg||
nt|pelu: I know that S cant see QJ!0 by decl - Bocchi could have the J - but she has to decide before taking @HA|pg||
nt|charles_l: Max is shorter to type :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: in the meantime 2@h is not going to be fun...|pg||
nt|athene: are you sure 1@S promises 3 spades? an earlier board suggested NS play 1@S = any weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it won't go 8 down which is what's needed to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she both asked and looked at the convention card|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: bye|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has 3 1Ss, 2@Ds and 3 @Cs -- unless she is clairvoyant|pg||
nt|athene: and now east's 2@S bid suggests the same|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On that lead it's even close to making|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Now she has three heart tricks in the bag|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: is she?|pg||
nt|sybarra: go for your woman's intuition!|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is thinking about it |pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: two ruffs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brgpro: and 4 trumps and @cA|pg||
nt|ritong: one club|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|nt|brgpro: well, she tried Merimac copu|pg||
nt|pelu: 27 = flat - so this board will decide the winner|pg||

nt|charles_l: only consolation is its only 50 a pop|pg||

nt|charles_l: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set up to show times for your area) thanks to Roland Wald (Denmark) the BBO vugraph co-ordinator|pg||
