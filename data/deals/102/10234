mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: But a very light opening in 3rd seat combined with a sound raise gave Rubin the clues he needed to execute the very rare squeeze|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: and the opning lead helped |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck: "sorry about the whole thing"|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: The continuing saga of, "What bid would you least like to hear?"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Weichsel has the perfect hand for a passed-hand protective double. Were he not a passed hand, he might still double. But he would be nervoud about holding only 10 points. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: For many people double would be automatic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about you, Barnet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 6D deal:  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBCUSA2/html/USBCUSA2_2009_F_2_s1.htm bd9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|barnets: yes I x|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: In the other room West opened 1@C; then N-S took over and are in 4@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: doest look as if n/s can make anything|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|c3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Weichsel did well to hold up the @DA for one round.|pg||
nt|barnets: this is down 3 for 500|pg||
nt|jcwla: They lead low from three small so no rush to take @DA|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this could well be a push|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is always good business to accept 500 in exchange for a vulnerable game that might not make. You have a large potential gain and at most a small loss.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H was even doubled next door and Kamil found the excellent lead of a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|barnets: of course if south were to oick the hearts it would hel p in 4@H|pg||
nt|lc: Hi -- sorry to be here instead of still playing.|pg||
nt|barnets: pick the hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: hi larry|pg||
nt|barnets: had west opened 3@C he would have got the hearts right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: So this event was your last at top-level, Larry?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lc: No, they drafted me for D.C. Nationals.  Can't get out yet. :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nothing in the slightest bit wrong with the decisjon to open 3@C. pre-emptive bids are always a bit of a gamble, though, and here it has turned out unluckily.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|barnets: east x 4@H i see so that tells him a bout the hearts roland|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
mc|6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but it will still be 1 down in 4@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 12 IMPs to Fleisher coming soon and a new leader|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or an old leader rather|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck: "sorry, partner, lousy dummy" Rod: "well, I could have opened 2 ..." Meck: "my fault for a lousy dummy"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Since Fleisher was in the lead most of the time yesterday|pg||

nt|caitlin: Hi Raghavan and Martin|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wc all kibits|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Ellen|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the 10 was unlucky|pg||
mb|1C!|an|all balanced except 3-3-5-2|mb|1H|nt|gavin: west has to stop low|pg||
mb|1S|nt|capercliff: here is a slam im sure they will get to|pg||
nt|gavin: lets see if ew have some sort of lebensohl agreement here|pg||
nt|gavin: some people play 2nt here says i have a bad hand, some play it scrambling|pg||
nt|caitlin: not uncommon over this double to have such an agreement|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C on NS, 3NT down|pg||
nt|gowdy: @S and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot compete against this|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N!|nt|fabsayc: 6NT by north the top spot, but 6@D also excellent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, drinks for all on me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict 4h|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: assuming they have some kind of two way new minor available|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probs in this contract with the hands so well fitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to the last 16 boards of an exciting match|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what is 2@H, maybe a relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they opt for the Moysian @S fit it will be a problem|pg||
nt|caitlin: a support double?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: value showing|pg||
nt|lestergold: prob make 3|pg||
mb|4H|nt|raghavan: Double or 4S bid will come|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: shows the need for the 2NT bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: if it is, doubling is likely to help opponents|pg||
nt|gavin: was wrong about the line up|pg||
nt|gavin: they did runt he same 4 again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even with lebensohl likely to try 4|pg||
nt|gavin: agree, west hand is so huge, hard to judge|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh What agood bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C good bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: great bidding|pg||
nt|raghavan: Martin did N hear you saying 5C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well yesterday he made good bids i did not say|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna can lead singleton spade but never gets partner in|pg||
nt|raghavan: North reasoningmay be S did not bid 3S over 3H so may be S 3 cards so clubs in S hand is assured|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: north can see at trick one that the only chance to beat this hand is his partner having the Jack of hearts since clubs are frozen if the Q and K are reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wolperts main worry is xx in diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi folks!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hi Martin and Sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: and hello to our wonderful operator, Karen, aka macaw on BBO @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good analysis|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: he will overtake the spade to play another spade|pg||
nt|gavin: hoping declarer leads a high heart from dummy|pg||
nt|gavin: giving him 1 extra chance to beat the hand |pg||
nt|gavin: if his partner has 9x of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho may be a prob for south with last club so mayube only 2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|capercliff: pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT i guess is pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will bid 6@d I would guess, holding 4 small @c's|pg||
nt|gavin: leading a 4th round and having his partner ruff high in hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Martin|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sharynr: ty Roland|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: misinterpreted the 5nt|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
pc|dK|nt|caitlin: Last night we had Gavin Wolpert here commentating...was excellent...he is now a pro and the Wolpert family is well known in Toronto with their mother, Hazel, who came in second in ...|pg||
nt|caitlin: CWTC, owns a major bridge club here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|vugraphznx: lost the play :(|pg||
nt|gowdy: tell them to slow it down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not that exciting a hand  i think two spades made unless defence errs|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gavin: i guess the word faster|pg||
nt|gavin: and jurek|pg||
nt|gavin: dont go together that well|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you here?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: i play weak no trump, when they double, always run, rarely gets any worse|pg||
nt|glen: do you have methods that get to your 4-4 fit?|pg||
nt|gambit: out of the frying pan...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i will settle for a 4-3, even a chunky 4-2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gavin: unless theres a "than" between them... faster than jurek, is a common expression|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|an|weak|mb|p|mb|1N!|an|17-19|nt|bigtrain: 1NT = 17-18 BAL|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is this another day of 1NT contracts I wonder, David|pg||
nt|lc: I would play "system on" in balancing seat here, but I doubt N-S have discussed it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Weichsel would like to get into the auction, but it is hard to see how.|pg||
nt|lc: I would balance, of course.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel thinking|pg||
nt|lc: I would show majors.|pg||
nt|barnets: with what larry ?|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@C?|pg||
nt|lc: Some 2- suiter.  Either majors, or 2@C (@C and a major) if available.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: DONT'ish|pg||
nt|lc: I don't like defending 1NT where partner always leads my singleton.|pg||
nt|lc: At least the singleton is the Jack this time.|pg||
nt|lc: Seeing all 4 hands, showing the majors isn't as smart as showing @C + major.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He won't want to hand 500 straight back. No doubt he will pass eventually (I could be wrong...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 12 IMPs on 31 scored now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad: "well I guess I'd better lead 4th from my longest & strongest :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|lc: Yes -- that is the ethics of it all.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Showing the majors also does not allow the 1NT opener or his pd to bid 2@D.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad: "by the way, Peter, for the future, we would play our Strong NT defense there"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|lc: As I suspected -- they probably hadn't discussed it.  Now they have .  :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: There is another aspect to consider. Some say that you should not let a good player declare 1NT if you have any excuse whatsoever. I believe Rodwell belongs to that category of ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: good players :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h5|nt|barnets: zia in 1N from south seat|pg||
nt|lc: Ekeblad-Weichsel play only occassionally -- not more than 10-20 sessions a year.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was a good joke by Ekeblad but I guess a certain sort of opponent would object to a remark that told partner that the @D7 was fourth highest.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: He followed it with "probably his void" so it was clear that he was talking about the long huddle over 1NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not allowing the opponents to play in 1NT is a good guideline at matchpoints but can be an expensive one at IMPs. |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: I think the colours are just right for a re-opening. I agree with Larry|pg||
nt|lc: I find that opps are reluctant to X 2MAJ at IMPs -- so you usually get away with murder.|pg||
nt|lc: More likely to get X'ed at matchpoints.|pg||
nt|barnets: and 2@C is close to making n/s|pg||
nt|lc: Also, their X is usually "cards" -- hard to "get you."|pg||

mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: Susie has all the secrets|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: could 5N really be a grand slam bid after 1N?|pg||
nt|shals: Good evening this game is being played in beautiful Penticton B>C> I am joining Caitlin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy but "slow" 3nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: all 3 of these players, I believe are from Toronto, certainly Hanna Nader, Jim Green, Darren Wolpert|pg||
nt|caitlin: or Czyz may be Montreal, not sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: match tightened up a little in the last segment|pg||
nt|glen: hi bart, glad to hear you are joining the kast of katz|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: don't ask me|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: welcome Shirley Laidaw|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, ralph & I will be warming up shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but i think if wolpert had heart ace, would have cued at some point, similarly with void|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to envisage 5NT as GSF|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS may play in 1NTor 2C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C has come|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades, double presumably hearts|pg||
nt|caitlin: at Open Table Carruthers, who has won many championships, is from Toronto, his partner Joey Silver from Montreal and L'Ecuyer and Fergani from Quebec|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gavin: with the heart entries in easts hand , north can probably scramble together 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gavin: welcome shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you have come to a Canadian zoo:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/ cannot come in at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 2s may already be overboard|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2@S looks like an underbid  perfect on this hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharynr: should East return to 4@S now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: important here for the defence to give nothing away|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: good plan if they let you do it|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sharynr: i type too slow|pg||
nt|shals: really..I am going to play ther next week ..wonderful tournament|pg||
nt|gavin: me too|pg||
nt|gavin: im about to start my trip around the world in about 4 hours when i leave for stockholm airport|pg||

nt|glen: good evening all|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Glen|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: these X  allow the XX,  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: if defence open up hearts for example Green may end up with a trick|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: i guess they dont play super KCB|pg||
nt|sybarra: only helps opps imo |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and we end with a flat board - probably|pg||
nt|capercliff: there are many other ways he could have persued a grand slam on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this broadcast will continue all day, see bbo schedule for time|pg||
nt|capercliff: bye all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might have tried 5@S with hannas hand, he can be sure 6@C is down|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is your itenary, gavin?|pg||
nt|gavin: 8 1/2 hour flight to nyc, go into the city for a few hours (5 hour layover) to hang out with friends, then back to the airport for a 6 hour flight to calgary, another hour to banff ...|pg||
nt|gavin: before i quit for the night |pg||
nt|caitlin: Gavin is also a Wolpert .........Darren playing South:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: nice lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: 6 aces for @H and @s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: welcome to segment 3 of the Canadian finals from always sunny Penticton|pg||
nt|caitlin: for declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Karen, to the commentators, spectators for their comments, to BBO for allowing us to see bridge from everywhere, and to the CBF for arranging this broadcast|pg||
nt|gavin: then spending sunday driving through banff which ive never done before|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|shals: ok|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: fortunately wont have any effect here, but i see no point in this double|pg||
nt|bbramley: another case for 6RKC|pg||
nt|bbramley: good to have some rules for what's trump in ambiguous keycard auctions|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt @H set with raise of @H?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or could be @S with cue bid?|pg||
nt|bbramley: not the way i play - for me 3@S makes both suits key - immed fits in two suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the rule i use is partners suit is the key suit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharynr: I wonder if  Daniel would have guess @D in 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: and finally get there sunday night , relax have breakfast monday and show up for the ko|pg||
nt|shals: Banff and the trip to the Okanagan is spectacular!|pg||
nt|caitlin: to Penticton??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: warning you will have your picture taken 20 times and be asked to take pictures at least that many times|pg||
nt|caitlin: where you going for KO?|pg||
nt|gavin: penticton|pg||
nt|gavin: regional starts monday night|pg||
nt|caitlin: awesome|pg||
nt|gavin: sucks that i will miss my mom and bro by a day|pg||
nt|lestergold: Green will try to force/encourage the defence to open up something to his advantage|pg||
nt|bbramley: but joey may not know for sure|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: needed to cash a second spade before the diamond|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|bbramley: if joey thought @Hs were the only key suit, then he could be missing a grand|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sharynr: I guess Jim made it easier|pg||
nt|sharynr: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: and as he will say.  NEXT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: a club exit is safe|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|nt|shals: ok Gavin, I will bring my camera, then?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|gavin: so when he knocks out the heart, he will be able to squeeze hughes in hearts and spades for his 11th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is a dim but it removes an exit card from north|pg||
nt|bbramley: some play first agreed suit, or the major, or whatever - for me it's clear that with a two-suited fit that all of the high honors in both suits are key|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin: he is being a little carefull here not wanting to discard a diamond until its late enough in the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if hughes ducks|pg||
nt|gavin: u got it :)|pg||
nt|gavin: so if he ducks he can still negotiate it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club of course may not have been safe from Grainer's point of view|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gavin: cashes a couple clubs and its the same squeeze in a different way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: run the spades now |pg||
nt|rlebi: hence super kcb|pg||
pc|d9|nt|starkist: 3@s might just be a cuebid|pg||
nt|bbramley: and i mean KEY in the literal sense, as in IMPORTANT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if both suits bid first by same hand, is most convenient to use the higher ranking as the key suit|pg||
nt|rlebi: so then it wouldnt matter|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gavin: jurek can claim|pg||
nt|gavin: but fast ....|pg||
nt|gavin: this actually works as a double squeeze now|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|gavin: he has a complete claim because if turner has the 4th spade|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gavin: then he will be squeezed in spades and diamond|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: tightening up the position|pg||
nt|lestergold: hoping for an endplay here|pg||
nt|gowdy: now tighten them up with trumps|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: must guess to run the diamond|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|lc: I don't know what they are playing vs. big @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad: "we are playing Meckwell there?" Weichsel: "I thought so, but I didn't want to DBL just in case we weren't"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: likely part of their big club defense|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|barnets: 3N  best here on lie of cards|pg||
mb|2C!|an|clubs + Major|mb|4D!|an|transfer|nt|lc: Likely to Texas into 4@H, I'd think.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So this is DONT. Clubs and another|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: South has to lead a minor ace|pg||
nt|lc: This will fail, as Barnet implied.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Well, it can fail, anyway.  We'll see if it DOES fail... :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfer keeps the singleton club off lead, at least.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Actually, Meckwell, so I think it's clubs + Major - sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe @DA to see a signal|pg||
nt|barnets: he has a lot of stuff|pg||
nt|lc: @DA lead --  then will he find @CA and a club?  Not easy.  Might depend on how he interprets the signal on the @DA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Partner can't have much on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it seems like a club ruff is the best chance|pg||
nt|barnets: partner may play the 2 suit pref|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rod: "don't have to wonder where the Jacks are"|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: if they play standard suit pref|pg||
nt|lc: If we believe the 14-16, that is indeed South's best chance (singleton @C)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lc: He should have known his partner has a 0-count.|pg||
nt|barnets: so he played a high diamond and got a spade|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe he is hoping to get his @HQ -- very possible if declarer had @HAxx.|pg||
nt|lc: Then later, 2 @C tricks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Weichsel can see only 14 points missing and they must all lie with declarer for his opening bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What surprises me is that it took Weichsel a split second to shit to a spade. One would have thought that you would need time to figure out what to do next|pg||
nt|lc: For example, declarer could have:  @SQxxx  @HAxx  @DKQx  @CKxx.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shift even, sorry for the typo|pg||
nt|lc: In that example, Weichsel's play could be right -- but yes, Roland -- he would take more time, you'd think.|pg||
nt|barnets: he may have just taken the signal as discouraging|pg||
nt|barnets: if they play A from ak|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 6@D is makeable but requires good guessing for sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: does that show 5-4?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: at this vul probably could be 4-4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it came up in set 1|pg||
nt|caitlin: increasingly popular these days|pg||

mb|d|mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: Good evening from Dublin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4H beatable?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|caitlin: Martin they haven't played this board??|pg||

nt|fabsayc: score detroit|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh from set one|pg||
nt|glen: S suspects what the minor is|pg||
nt|susieq: I'm a little surprised Grainger didn't open that 3@C|pg||
mb|p!|an|denies 3!h|nt|mcarroll: Hi Martin, George|pg||
nt|caitlin: Last year Carruthers came in second for Worlds|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT may be better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: is this worth a superaccept?|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suit is blocked and north endplayed|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes end play from the club of course as long as Green reads the position|pg||
mb|2S|nt|caitlin: 2-1 my boys are making a come back:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: a 2@H opening in first set, caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: now I understand, thanks:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: duh|pg||
nt|starkist: 2@d 2.5@h bid?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like a diamond shift trick 2 does it in|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: apparently 1NT shows more than a bare 6 count|pg||
nt|bbramley: sure, an early @D ought to beat it|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: for results so far http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/09files/BWeek09_results.html|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W's interference may have prevented NS from reaching their 5-5 @D fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: click on date time and event|pg||
nt|mittmouse: lets see if turner makes the good technical play of a low club back not that it helps|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi martin x2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi George|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi george|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best they can do is cash club, heart, and play a heart|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Making3|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Lost the play, will claim out the hand when they are done. sorry |pg||
nt|fabsayc: some partnerships use 2@S over 2@H as a relay, would have been handy here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will come close to duplicating the undertricks here|pg||
nt|caitlin: I actually like Bergen super accepts|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: perhaps only 2, declarer drawing 2 trumps and playing diamonds for safety|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would think most play 8-10|pg||
nt|caitlin: what do I really care.....the Maple Leafs going nowhere ever so let's have THREE teams here..Hamilton, downtown and Downsview park..let them ALL in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek needed to put in the queen, forcing declarer to win|pg||
nt|caitlin: and unblock?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|shals: would all of you lead the j?|pg||
nt|caitlin: depending if you playing Jack denies|pg||
nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: if Eddie Kantar were here he would have a FIT re: lead of Jack:)|pg||
nt|shals: iguess that is where I'm coming from|pg||
nt|caitlin: regardless of HCP you super accept with 9 card fit.. and more to it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: enlighten us Ellen|pg||
nt|raghavan: llen - since S did not make a bid they must be opening with 12 Points ( We were seeing lighter openings in other USA matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes surprising|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8 loser hand I would open|pg||
nt|glen: it helps if W has two ways to bid 3H over 2@S, one to show a great hand|pg||
nt|glen: here E has two bullets (aces) and a fit, so 4@H regardless|pg||
nt|glen: now at this time declarer thinks N's minor is @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: guess they don't play that|pg||
nt|raghavan: any lead helps|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Darren is not shy|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a great lead for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only suit that really matters is spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w have 5 hearts to cash if they get the chance given a heart lead unlikely unless Green finds a double|pg||
nt|starkist: =|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: I like Rusinow leads by far best|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes easier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is up to carruthers to figure this out|pg||
nt|bbramley: not an easy defense|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: especially in this case|pg||
nt|gowdy: well S has show a 3 suite|pg||
nt|fabsayc: korbel wisely pulls|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|caitlin: gets rid of one heart loser|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|shals: the 8 might make pd play the q|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes now he doesnt have to worry about the @Ha|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: the 4-1 spades may slow things down|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club and HK are favourably placed|pg||
nt|raghavan: another H may go on Clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharynr: 9 easy tricks here. should not take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n porbably going off as not likley to take dim finesse in 3n|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@S however, seems too much|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d has reasonable play|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|shals: it still can do damage|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 10|pg||
nt|caitlin: look it how close this match is|pg||
nt|rlebi: he's likely gonna make it now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: took his 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: even Rolan would have doubts about playing 6d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: arggh|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my money is with the defenc|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could make on cross ruff except that fourth heart will be overruffed|pg||
nt|lestergold: this slam has more holes in it than one of them mousetrap cheeses|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D 22 @S king  @C q ruffs out onside  too good for Roland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but it looks makeable|pg||
nt|glen: and the D took care of that|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes Jurek (North) might have made another move|pg||
nt|lestergold: can it be made double dummy?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: 12 tricks looks difficult|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently no does not have quite the entries to south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: both made a cue bid too many - the KH metited an un cue bid if that were possible|pg||
nt|gowdy: ani nteresting push vs 3nt with big upside   sort of shows why slams should have better play thanthis as 5 @D could win big|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: i truely dont understand a club play|pg||
nt|caitlin: E-W played in safe 3D on board 17 for 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|glen: if S had given a @C ruff, it was just ruffing one of declarer's losers|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: good line of play for the rest|pg||
nt|starkist: now for sure|pg||
pc|hT|nt|starkist: I like that play|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|caitlin: for 6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|starkist: that too|pg||
pc|h4|nt|raghavan: Ithought playing D A first and back with SQ good|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is not pretty for E-W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this was safer, although diamond ruff unlikely|pg||
mc|10|nt|caitlin: but if East ducks what now?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: I'm surprised to hear Meckwell so chatty.  When I play them, they usually say nothing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Mollo would need more like 4@S making at both tables, rather than 1NT contracts.|pg||

nt|brolucius: It is great to hear what they are saying, of course - thanks to Jan. |pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Tony Nunn from Australia spotted that on board 32 Rodwell held a so-called Dragon, one card of each of 2 through ace. Have a look and you will see it is correct|pg||

nt|brolucius: The dealing machine for this event does seem to cough up a lot of 1NT contracts. I hope they will have replaced it with the new model by next year.|pg||
nt|lc: Everyone in this event was rooting "backwards."  We in the USA2 bracket wanted the NICKELLS of the world to keep winning -- and stay out of the "losers" bracket.  But, they lost -- ...|pg||
nt|lc: and that is Fleisher's prize.|pg||

mb|p|nt|susieq: at least according to what I have here|pg||
nt|caitlin: so this is the finals of the CNTC|pg||
nt|glen: 4@C is a splinter, and as you can see from the E hand, partnerships have to agree on how little it can have for working high card points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east hand may actually be above their minimum, but poorly placed|pg||
nt|glen: 4@D here, as played by many experts, is "last train" - last bid below 4@H - it says I like my hand, but may or may not have a @D card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so much depends on cue bid style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last train has its own set of problems|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: seems like a bid showing majors for me|pg||
nt|susieq: oh my mistake- it's a weak notrump, so it just shows values|pg||
nt|sharynr: or just a good old fashioned penalty double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they play Woolsey?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|sharynr: pretty good weakie :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if grainger establishes the spades west must ruff the fourth, leaving losing heart in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S  and I think bid now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid quickly and down quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the least of which is easts 4@S can be ace or king|pg||

nt|gowdy: ah it will take a while |pg||
nt|mittmouse: 4s is cols from the n side|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: easy 3@S, and 2@D can be made|pg||
nt|sharynr: risky pass, David should expect a void|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bidding may be riskier|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: this should go down|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|caitlin: so then Canada and Mexico vie for spot in Brazil|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: possibly 3@S now|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nader Hanna is President of Canadian Bridge Federation which sponsors the CNTC's|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like 2@D was cold also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: biddable is not so clear|pg||
pc|s7|nt|raghavan: RE has bid twice- 5 cards why develop|pg||
pc|s3|nt|caitlin: Bermuda used to be part of that but has spot in Central American zone|pg||
nt|caitlin: for Canadian Bridge Federation CNTC see: http://www.cbf.ca/CNTC/|pg||

pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: declarer on the winning line|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sharynr: excellent result for N-S|pg||
nt|caitlin: Darren Wolpert (not to be confused with his brother Galvin) and Czyzowicz are aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|raghavan: S can take 2 Spade only|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gowdy: not sure about that  north has an interesting hand  depends on meathods |pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4s bid is normal becuase either it makes or if it doesnt it prevents e/w  however here i think e/w liimit was 3 dims|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: indeed, 3NT makes EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|an|can be short|mb|p|nt|lc: Rodwell really passed a "12" count?|pg||
mb|2H!|an|no 4-card Major, !hs better than !ss|nt|lc: I know it is an ugly 12, and 2nd seat unfav -- but still, I never thought I'd see the day.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That must be a psyche|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@D has five possible meanings here for Ekeblad//Weichsel.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If N-S get to game, someone (perhaps both) will have overbid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I can't quite read Weichsel's note - something about balanced and/or hearts I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: And he has shown the 12-14 balanced (may have 2 @D's, may have 4-cd major).|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lc: So, Rodwell's decision to pass the 12-count was a winning action, it seems.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad said: "he has no major, hearts better than spades (and I guess some point count)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|lc: They rate to go +50 here, and had he opened they would likely have gone minus in a partial their way.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Passing on the West cards would have been the obvious action, particularly when vulnerable, a couple of decades back. |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 34, where Meckstroth failed by 1 in 1NT, Fleisher failed by one in 2@H, so the first push of the segment.|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looked like only 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: we have to remember that there are also novices and low intermediates in spec who may not know when such bids are asking or telling|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not too many in penticton area however|pg||
nt|glen: the bears ate them|pg||
nt|glen: an ottawa bear is in pendiction for the tourney|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he did that fast, guess would have taken much longer if in 4|pg||
nt|bbramley: how many tricks did he take, operator?  if he guessed spades he made 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcbruce:  The CSTC is over after three quarters, with Hobart winning after a big 3Q.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hi Cliff|pg||
nt|glen: penticton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: obvious you have never encountered a moose in the wild :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: welcome Cliff|pg||
nt|caitlin: so when is final game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: cheers guys|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer advance of 1@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: E-W make 3S on last hand|pg||
nt|gavin: this match ends tomorrow|pg||
nt|gavin: stanley cup is over ! |pg||
nt|caitlin: hockey Gavin:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are on at 9:30, 12, 4:30 and 7 tomorrow for the remaining 4 sets|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all time PDT|pg||
nt|caitlin: ohhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|glen: S has a good @H fit, but soft values in the other suits, and no ruffing value|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  his means we have two sets of boards, one at each table, so my duplication accuracy will be put to the test...but nobody will wait for a board|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the claim was for making 3 :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gavin: 4-3 pittsburgh, thats practically like bringing the cup to canada|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double support|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: showing hearts, adds a lot of possible new sequences |pg||
nt|capercliff: is this only after a X?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure, is good any time in my opinion|pg||
nt|gavin: about as close as were gonna get for a while|pg||
nt|caitlin: "practically"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do you figure that gavin|pg||
nt|gavin: our young superstar wins|pg||
nt|lestergold: tame 3n here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a quackery|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: these transfer responses ar gaining popularity everywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: i quite like it after a double, puts the doubler on lead but requires lots of notes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this tricky lead is going to backfire|pg||
nt|fabsayc: erase my last comment, lost the plot :)|pg||
nt|gavin: vancouver is the only canadian team with a hope|pg||
nt|shals: I agree but great story  for the underdogs|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@C??|pg||
nt|shals: I hope!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hope springs eternal, go whitecaps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|starkist: not beating now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: 3NT is the simplest bid available|pg||
pc|h2|nt|shals: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: Gavin would you bid 3C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gosh i must be old, i pass in second seat|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is risky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but quite a play problem|pg||
nt|raghavan: Which is the 9th trick? |pg||
nt|mcarroll: He has to find one of the @SJ,@DQ or @CQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will probably attempt to combine chances|pg||
nt|raghavan: C Q difficult|pg||
nt|gowdy: looks like coffee ( or wine ) time here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6@S|pg||
nt|caitlin: moi aussi|pg||
nt|shals: me too|pg||
nt|gavin: i wouldnt open :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: cash top cards in one minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: with hearts 3/3 and the qc as entry no probs in this contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that tame, saved by heart split and club ace right|pg||
nt|glen: dummy comes down and declarer thinks should I work out on how 4@S would do - no first, play this|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gavin: but no i wouldnt bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|caitlin: 3@C Fit showing jump by passed hand|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect hand to pass and make an unusual 2NT bid later|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not bergen?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey just asking|pg||
nt|caitlin: why not drury then?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|shals: yes it is|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why i said it was tame as the cards lie not in an absoluiter sense|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Karen our operator?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but does he have a losing alternative, perhaps not|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Karen:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I almost fell asleep in the sun:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so he has to establish clubs and that means spades will be established and he cannot lose the lead again|pg||
nt|lestergold: so its a one shot contract|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharynr: good stop by E-W|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Gowdy:)|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  four rounds to play in COPC; we'll announce leaders when posted|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: down 1 or numerous overtricks on this defense|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome|pg||
pc|s6|nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what if korbel ducks two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then the hearts squeeze hanna|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharynr: looks like N-S make 21H so even down 1 is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry, they are playing too fast and lost thread |pg||
nt|sharynr: but that was a reasonable shift|pg||
nt|mittmouse: technically hanna should now try a club if that is wrong he has to take a s finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: good point G|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so saved by the diamond 9 then|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: or possibly cash @Ss to check if they are 3-3 or the J falls, then 2 top @Cs|pg||
nt|raghavan: finessing towards w is likely - since W may not know that H K is alone|pg||
nt|caitlin: he will finesse West for @DQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna will try K then lead low to the Q better odds than playing anything else|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think any bid showing spade support would have turned Turner on:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: crosby doing pushups with the cup|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green gave count|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hanna knows that the ace will be held up otherwise|pg||
nt|caitlin: so David Grainger and Daniel Korbel|pg||
nt|lestergold: better unblock hearts now he will of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did he really pitch a heart?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he did hes dead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|shals: woops this is going to be tough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a crystal ball tuner, Mike|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gavin: 2 down with a winning finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks misere from here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching a spade gives up any chance of a make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me 3@C would be clubs only|pg||
nt|caitlin: I see 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: good save against 2@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: upside down|pg||
nt|glen: yes, but he was doing it in hope to entice a @S play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|caitlin: no X no trouble?|pg||
nt|shals: maybe|pg||
nt|caitlin: let's remember these guys may be TIRED|pg||
nt|gavin: oh ya, this is a gruelling event to say the least|pg||
pc|cT|nt|caitlin: for me FSJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand and in competition|pg||
nt|caitlin: they didn't get here without lots of play|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't we all..|pg||
nt|gavin: its an achievement to be in the finals but the losing team probably wont feel that way|pg||
nt|shals: true..|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmm|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is going well for declarer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: north will just keep discarding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open Room got to 4@D on 3|pg||
nt|gambit: To all you hockey fans Pitt wins 2-1 in a nailbiter |pg||
nt|glen: though the D can clearly see that a @H discard is called for|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. don't trust that @S discard at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry too fast |pg||
mc|9|nt|fabsayc: down 2|pg||

nt|sharynr: and Hanna must have taken that line|pg||
nt|gavin: hughest hand is way too strong for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
nt|gavin: very difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no down 1 on this defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the interesting defense would have been to start with a high club|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mittmouse: i think he must have done it right good technique by hanna|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needed 6 hearts for his overcall, so finesse long odds at the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator says it was a heart discarded|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: Would anyone open east hand and if so, what|pg||
nt|gavin: too strong for 2C then 2nt too|pg||
nt|shals: and hockey city|pg||
nt|gavin: so many slams where partner doesnt show interest|pg||
nt|gavin: 1D is a reasonable choice |pg||
nt|raghavan: Part score deal|pg||
nt|caitlin: a constructive 2@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: in which case unless im missing something it was a bad error|pg||
mb|p|nt|susieq: I would open 3@D but I'm a little crazy|pg||
nt|caitlin: whereas if he were weaker he would first bid 1NT then 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise  2 spades 2 clubs 5 hearts and contract made|pg||
nt|starkist: all I know is I'm leading the @h j on this hand|pg||
nt|bbramley: @H8 is the key card|pg||
mb|1N|nt|capercliff: both k's are working|pg||
nt|susieq: that's fit showing|pg||
nt|caitlin: Turner will pass I assume|pg||
nt|gambit: Will C balance? I thk y|pg||
nt|gavin: this auction would almost always be 4-6 or 5-6|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to picture partner with a hand good enough for this action that doesnt have 6 diamonds |pg||
nt|gavin: turner has a monster|pg||
nt|gavin: (given the state of the auction)|pg||
nt|gavin: with  aspade stopper and 3 diamonds and the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|gavin: i think he owes hughes 2 or 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: 1nt = @C|pg||
nt|gowdy: suit or a lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: interesting choice to bid 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may regret not playing 4@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4333 often plays at least a trick better in 4 of a major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 4@S an easier contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: neither is very good|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, 3D, and the QH, extras given his pass, but monster, No.....a couiple modest redeeming features, |pg||
nt|mcarroll: On Board 1 I see they did prefer the Moysian @S fit rather than @Cs and it cost 11 imps|pg||
nt|caitlin: they play constructive so 2@S 8-10 HCP|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is not forward going, but Jurek still tempted|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3@S is preemptive not constructive|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes some play 1@S 2@S 3@S stop|pg||
nt|caitlin: I personally don't like it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as there is no entry to Dummy, on a @D lead to take advantage of a discard on the @HA 4 @S goes down|pg||
nt|raghavan: S is trying to prevent EW going to 3H and later if he ventured - may be doubled - Of course he does not know N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that does not automatically beat hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And there are slow @C losers|pg||
mb|2C!|an|invitational checkback|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: nice hand for fit showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: even with both K's working hard to see 10 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|caitlin: given their lead there is no reason to push to 4|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gavin: he cant have a better hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: We cannot find fault with N for his bidding|pg||
nt|caitlin: well if they play 1S 2S 3S stop we can|pg||
nt|starkist: darn need to play xfer lead doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 4@S might have been reached (and made)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think green should have tried 3@D in that case|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this is a steal im surprised green didnt bid 3d then hanna would bid 4s |pg||
nt|sharynr: but as is the case when both sides make a major suit game, the bidding might not have stopped at the 4 level|pg||
nt|gavin: funny to balance your opponents from 1D into 3NT|pg||
nt|caitlin: how true|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has maximum for his 2S bid|pg||
nt|glen: the 2/1 way to make a 3 card limit raise - 1NT (forcing/semi-forcing), then 3 of the major|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: good things H's are 3-3 or this would be really ugly|pg||
nt|capercliff: cancel that|pg||
nt|capercliff: even I could make 4 tricks with this @h suit:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in no trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: what out what you ask for|pg||
nt|gavin: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: czyz will have an easy time finding hte club shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: seems down if defense passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have stayed low nough to make  a plus|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin: the king of spades asks his partner to unblock an honor or give him upside down count|pg||
nt|caitlin: he showed it with constructive raise|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gambit: this will go down quickly |pg||
nt|gambit: as a plus |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict slowly|pg||
nt|gambit: you know David? Methodical |pg||
nt|gavin: when south gets in with the first diamond|pg||
nt|gavin: he will undoubtedly lead a spade|pg||
nt|gavin: since his partner lead the king, thats their power lead he knows that he has a GREAT spade suit|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to know if he has 5 or 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad spade break and poor communications with dummy would make higher level contracts very precarious|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|gambit: 3-2 diamonds would work losing 1 diamond, 3 spades|pg||
nt|rlebi: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: some problems now for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the simplest solution, finesse the club|pg||
nt|caitlin: he has to|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: brave play, minimizing the loss|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: why rush with ace of dim?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was a mistake but afraid hanna would draw partners lone trump|pg||
pc|c2|nt|caitlin: then how back to hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: finessing @Ds against North??|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharynr: i am sure NS would have pushed to th5 5-level|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky spade position|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mittmouse: look at what that fit showing jump did for graingers hand he would have bid to the 5 level if necessary|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had Hanna tried 8s it would have been very revealing!!|pg||
nt|mittmouse: carruthers must have missed a spot|pg||
nt|starkist: teasing @d10 play|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: this is why i hesistated with my comment, was not at all clear|pg||
nt|gavin: that was an odd play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond lead would have made this tougher, but i think still makes|pg||
nt|glen: yes, the @D lead head towards a forcing defense|pg||
pc|s4|nt|glen: the idea being to play @Ds at all chances|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: contract still in jeapordy tho|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gavin: and darren playing the queen of diamonds was bad also|pg||
nt|gavin: only lying to his partner|pg||
nt|caitlin: this has not been a lucky 3rd or beginning of 4th set for Carruthers team|pg||
nt|gowdy: a new variation  pitch a winner on a loser   but maintain control|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|starkist: didn't he have to duck as the only hope?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: lucky for him partner didnt have a black ace|pg||
nt|bbramley: he had 2 hopes: @HAJ8 with west, or a @D entry with west|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another mistake by declarer|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|caitlin: I am sure many have TV's on for NHL|pg||
nt|caitlin: Wolpert should wonder why Green took @CA and returned spade|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: a chance to finesse|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a gruelling event|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think they are all getting very tired|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it was down if that was play|pg||
nt|caitlin: as is our great operator Karen|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: finesse gains nothing, as can always elope the small trumps|pg||

nt|jcwla: 35, where Ekeblad failed by 1 in 2NT, Zia played 2@C making 3, so 4 to Nickell.|pg||
nt|lc: 3@D at these colors?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lc: Not good enough, I suppose.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Can they find 3NT?|pg||
nt|lc: 3NT on 4-4 @H or no @H lead -- but not easy to reach.|pg||
mb|2N!|an|!ds|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1NT = 14+ to 17.|pg||

nt|brolucius: South can see a chance now opposite @DK-x-x-x-x-x.|pg||
mb|3D!|an|likes !ds|nt|jcwla: With a max and monster @D fit, could just bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|lc: Likes?   How about  Head-over-heals in love?|pg||
nt|lc: heelsd|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell made a thumbs up signal and W agreed :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North does have seven diamonds, rather than six, so he needs only two outside tricks. Yes, well bid!|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell asks. W: "2NT transfer to @ds; he could have shown shortness in a Major if he chose"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lc: I don't live for lead problems like West's -- but am relieved when I find out nothing mattered.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jcwla: "Don't like, don't complete" the xfr - some pairs play the opposite.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: It makes sense for 3@D to be the 'like' rebid and 3@C the not-like one. That's because on some weak minor two-suiters, the responder can pass 3@C. |pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lc: Exactly.  Transfer to @D with  @DJxxxx and @CJxxxx.  Then pass the reject to 3@C.|pg||

pc|d6|pc|s6|mc|9|nt|jcwla: Zia made one more in 2@S than Ekeblad did in 2@H on 36, so 1 to Nickell to within 2.|pg||
nt|lc: There is usually a table feel to know that declarer is playing only for overtricks.  Sometimes he even announces it (at IMPs).|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South had held @CA-K instead of @CA-Q-J, that would surely have been enough to persuade him to rebid 3NT instead of 3@D.|pg||
nt|lc: No @C finesse :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck: "maybe I should have bid - I had a 4 by 1 9 count" W: "he had the K of clubs?" Rod: "no, I had the K of clubs ... didn't want to try for 10?" Laughter. Now short break|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if the hands are nothing special, it is still interesting to watch because so much is at stake.|pg||
nt|lc: Due to Freeman illness, the Nickell team is playing this match 4-handed.|pg||
nt|lc: There is some debate about what happens if Nickell wins.  Can Freeman-Nickell add back on for Brazil?  Should they be allowed to?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is that 60 boards a day or 45?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 60, I am told, which is quite lot to play four-handed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There must be rules somewhere, Larry|pg||
nt|lc: And, if Dick Freeman is able to watch, we certainly wish him the best.|pg||
nt|lc: There are committees to handle such matters.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Could make a slightly different argument if say the Fleisher team won, as they've all played a ton of bridge here.  Nickell didn't come in until relatively late.|pg||
nt|brolucius: And they should surely show some compassion in this particular case.|pg||
nt|lc: Yesterday, I read that "Yes, they can ass back on." -- But I was surprised to know it would already be determined.|pg||

nt|raghavan: Give credit to E playing small Spades. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think he unblocked hearts before club ruff|pg||
nt|raghavan: and not SJ|pg||
nt|bbramley: but still no reason to duck 2nd @H in either case|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: what to bid...|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 4 OR smart to be in 3@D making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 22|pg||
nt|shals: intersting all over the scoe bd|pg||
nt|caitlin: Karen how did you land up operating in Penticton if you are American?|pg||
nt|glen: for a close final quarter, this table is moving quickly, which is nice for everybody watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not for me :)|pg||
nt|starkist: throwing away down tricks|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|capercliff: 2@h is never enough these days|pg||
mb|2N|an|transfer to !d|nt|caitlin: British Columbia|pg||
nt|glen: true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess "dont watch" wont work|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: monster super accept for cz|pg||
nt|gavin: tough to avoid slam on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: joey cant have side ace?|pg||
mb|3D!|an|likes !d|nt|gavin: its on a finesse but they have so many wasted points|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but they always bid 3nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: how does everyone feel about 3N?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Silver made 5@d on the second hand, for 8 imps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|caitlin: tell us later:)|pg||
nt|rlebi: no take A no get A|pg||
nt|rlebi: @s|pg||
nt|starkist: risky to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Silver laughed when he saw dummy: "and hope you make it partner" |pg||
nt|fabsayc: guess that answers my question :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so i like to have a semblance of a side entry for 3 preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is "normal"|pg||
nt|gavin: ok obviously not as tough as i thought|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|gavin: i guess 2nt was 20-22|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 1 OR Silver bid 1@S over 1@H overcall......did Carruthers assume he had 5?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: on the bidding declarer probably should finess through N for @SJ to cater for a 4-1 break - which does not cost in this instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h does jam the auction nicely, you know if you double partner is bound to bid 4m|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is better than 22|pg||
nt|gavin: so darren could see it wasnt going to be great even opposite a super accept|pg||
nt|gavin: i agree|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't you bid 2c then 2n?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah, opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@D is a reasonable spot with the bonus of making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H will make|pg||
nt|glen: this setups a possible @H discard, and a lot depends on how declarer places the cards|pg||
nt|bbramley: good cash|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcarroll: 2@H makes|pg||
nt|caitlin: loses 1@H 2@S 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c makes as played by west|pg||
nt|caitlin: very tough to get to|pg||
nt|gowdy: Karen  if there is a break in the action tell Green that I shot 78 today   Thanks :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: hey Gowdy awesome:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: but both bd 20 and 22 will swing the match the other way, i predict|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6D makes 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but assuming a direct raise of diamonds was forcing, this is not a strong sequence |pg||
nt|caitlin: run clubs get rid of 2 hearts ruff a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: all up to North to shoot for it or not|pg||
nt|caitlin: don't love my J9 of @D but hey...life isn't perfect|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: spades 2-2 so this "should" not present problems|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|shals: wow spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my par 3 score|pg||
nt|caitlin: and I know nada about golf except a) scores b) I love Tiger:)|pg||
nt|glen: for us seeing all 4 hands, use @D K to discard @H, ace and another @H ruff, draw trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: simplest approach is ruffing heart hook|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if it loses defense can not hurt you|pg||
nt|glen: @H lead would have set it if rest of D okay|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: I would agree with 3NT|pg||
nt|capercliff: he also knows now it was based on 6 card suit so rates to have a singelton somewhere|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H was a FSF even tho a forcing auction|pg||
nt|caitlin: letting pd know game is there |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe, but that is not the only way to play 2@H|pg||
nt|gavin: im not a fan of trump lead w/ xxx in clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gavin: thk u need to be more aggressive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart king seems very normal lead|pg||
nt|gavin: when you dont have controls in reversers opening suit|pg||
nt|shals: 6 do you think could be made?|pg||
nt|shals: I guess|pg||
nt|caitlin: sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: that may NOT be a push|pg||
nt|shals: probably not|pg||
nt|shals: 2c might have helped|pg||
nt|shals: toobad|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: not in Canada|pg||
nt|caitlin: good point made: what doesn't Wolpert bid 3@D instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|gavin: i think 2H they use as their slowdown bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: really??|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: the only lead to hold this to 4|pg||
nt|glen: establishing 1@H, 2@C, 1@D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gavin: it says ive got garbage and i will likely pass ur next bid|pg||
nt|gavin: thats why cyz had to bid more than 3C |pg||
pc|dA|nt|caitlin: it is 100% forcing|pg||
nt|gavin: cause he was afraid of his partner passing|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Gavin|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha he must have pitched a heart on the diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not sure how the play went for the last two tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry :(|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: now diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|caitlin: I thought it was doubled???|pg||
nt|lestergold: club ruff to be found buty i doubt it|pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: Ellen and Martin - what will N play now after SQ - will he play club small??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably win and shift to a club, although that does not look hopeful|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he overtakes that is his only hope|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps a heart better|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Martin?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that is what he is thinking about, I would opt forsmall@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: attacking communication|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be the Green convention|pg||
nt|glen: yes, Green convention, asking for aces|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H likely showed 0 or 3 aces (E suspects 3)|pg||
mb|2N|an|minimum, <4!h|nt|fabsayc: is fine if you don't do it also on garbage hands|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect!|pg||
nt|shals: yep|pg||
nt|caitlin: asking re minor which can't be clubs|pg||
nt|glen: 5@C confirms all aces, and now W has good playing value if E has the right hand opposite|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: I wonder whom you are rooting for Gavin?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: pittsburgh !!! oh my brother|pg||
nt|shals: good stop I think|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see......not so easy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|caitlin: and which is more important?|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good choice |pg||
nt|capercliff: normal with a stiff honor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: anyone know what 2Nt asked for|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|starkist: what a steal this was|pg||
nt|bbramley: and he's going to make 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: @s lead will hold it to 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: may have been singleton?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Pittsburgh on a power play|pg||
nt|shals: no stoppers in clubs for nt|pg||
nt|caitlin: that would be too lucky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really ugly lead problem for hanna|pg||
nt|gowdy: may lose 2 @S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: not now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh my|pg||
nt|glen: and only a ruff can beat this 7NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rlebi: unusual but effective auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: i don't think this auction calls for trump lead either|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wouldnt think so|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I caught all the play on that one :)|pg||
nt|glen: lol :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all 139 spectators are sworn to not tell roland|pg||
nt|rlebi: 16 imp diff now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gavin: wheres the contract that consents if detroit wins my bro wins ? ill sign |pg||
nt|fabsayc: Jxx and Jx are ugly for trump lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: 8 boards - 2 imps a board until a playoff|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but is hard to see why a spade is best|pg||
nt|caitlin: nada tricks for NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this right??|pg||
nt|mcarroll: K worked better|pg||
nt|raghavan: fell in the trap- 2Club tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well now a heart seems clear|pg||
nt|caitlin: it's right he played North for KQ tight|pg||
nt|gowdy: tuff lead     this looks normal|pg||
nt|caitlin: what else to lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass right to dummy|pg||
nt|caitlin: underlead a heart to stiff @HK??|pg||
nt|caitlin: can't be or he would have clubs:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: a few|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart or club ace were clearly alternatives, also with their losing cases|pg||
nt|caitlin: low heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna thinking of winning clearing trump|pg||
nt|caitlin: ???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he cant do that, would have no chance then|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|caitlin: :) so blood is thicker than hockey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck again looks best|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharynr: well my predictions stink....bd 20 open room in 4@D DBL|pg||
nt|gavin: its amazing how often ducking to keep control in trumps is right when they break bad and you have length w/ the ace|pg||
nt|gavin: both as defender or declarer|pg||
nt|gavin: unless you clearly need to clear trumps ASAP , its better not to win your ace until the last chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or 3@D|pg||
nt|starkist: then a shoot off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely not two overtricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just making|pg||
nt|rlebi: sudden death|pg||

pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: claim time|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is not going to make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gavin: unless he guessed the singleton king of hearts in the first place he couldnt make after turner ducked two rounds of spades|pg||
nt|gavin: which could not happen|pg||
nt|caitlin: true enough|pg||
nt|caitlin: so N will get his diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now a diamond, but which one|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|caitlin: not with 5Ds|pg||
nt|caitlin: that would certainly help E-W find clubs I think|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharynr: well this cant help but fail|pg||
nt|caitlin: anything now gives it to declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharynr: was there really a claim to make 4?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I like the safety aspect very much|pg||
nt|barnets: i disagree with larry of course|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|d|nt|lc: All I'm saying is that a weak declarer can "coast" through and win an IMP match -- but not BAM or pairs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The great attraction of IMPs is the variation in tension and importance of the deals. Matchpoint play is more like a long, hard exam.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|lc: Surely, IMPs is the most popular.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, I've forgotten what 2@s is and both Meck & Rod know so didn't ask :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: A bit surprising that Weichsel opened 2@S, 1@S could be 10-15 with 5 @S's and 3/3/2 side distribution.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This should push E-W to 4@H, and N-S can cash for down 1|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Open Room replicated the 1NT-3NT auction on board 6|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting, both not wanting to miss an early Vul game|pg||
nt|sharynr: but they did|pg||
nt|gavin: his low heart play would work any time hearts were 3-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north forced to give east a spade trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4H + 2C+1D\|pg||
nt|gowdy: ruff a @C draw trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes john|pg||
nt|susieq: the cards are definitely going East-West this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|all balanced except 3-3-5-2|nt|fabsayc: 2@H both majors?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E thinks his hand is too good for an old fashioned 3@d bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes shows both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: he needed to keep his ace of hearts in his hand for an entry to draw trumps after he leads up towards his jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so always makes if declarer plays right|pg||
nt|raghavan: a part score deal I hope EW do not jump to game in a Major|pg||
nt|chorush: there was no flannery. what would he be upset about?|pg||
nt|starkist: chugging contest|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: in that case 2@S by east can be natural or artificial, you need to discuss a defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is S worth an immediate 4@S?|pg||
nt|gavin: very tough hand will be interesting to see the line in the other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 10-1 somebody bids game|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: Obviously he thinks so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe too strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S AND 4@H are both feasible|pg||
nt|gavin: unlikely he will leave them there|pg||
nt|gavin: 7-4 white vs red|pg||
nt|caitlin: Green does not have to accept transfer|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will reject transfer and bid 3S|pg||
nt|rlebi: wrong sided for @Ss already|pg||
nt|rlebi: better stay low for a plus|pg||
nt|starkist: canoe race|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|an|promises 4|nt|fabsayc: 5@D in big trouble|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 5@c is better, best defence can get 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: must be a @h lead for 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: anything else is 500|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to lead a @H fromS, @S the obvious lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club ruff and heart heart switch works also|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont believe you can gain a trick by claiming if it is impossible to  make it....and in that defense they could not make a mistake?|pg||
nt|caitlin: best to lead trump|pg||
nt|starkist: snowball fight|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharynr: will any director out there agree?|pg||
nt|rlebi: sry, dreaming here|pg||
nt|glen: could declarer draw all the trumps and pick up @Ds?|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. just lose to the @D ace if guesses suit right|pg||
nt|rlebi: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S presumably no singleton and extras, and for that hand he is close to minimum|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: not clear, but more likely daniel ducked heart|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hoping declarer would play the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: or S and switch|pg||
nt|gowdy: coffee time |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast they may bid slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs three diamonds so percentage is finesse of queen|pg||
mb|4S|nt|capercliff: yes that works as well Martin|pg||
nt|capercliff: no doub!!!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: I guess that is what happened martin, since daniel apologized|pg||
mb|5C|nt|capercliff: must be joking|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: guess he didnt think he was taking even 1 @s trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was the problem with 4@S, did not invite partner to participate|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he did open|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb...barbecue going:)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: or at least try for it|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 S  strong H raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|caitlin: if Hanna is going to bid it should be 4@S|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S = he skipped a @H cuebid, since minimum for 3@S|pg||
nt|rlebi: he didnt bid 4@s,did he?|pg||
nt|glen: the question is whether he plays serious 3NT or not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have based on hand overall minimum|pg||
nt|glen: i.e. EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 3@S was expected|pg||
nt|caitlin: a splinter with 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|gowdy: no 3S artifical|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh|pg||
nt|gowdy: smolen|pg||
nt|caitlin: smolen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a splinter, can be balanced or singleton spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or perhaps unspecified splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT asks for a second suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just in case partner has both majors|pg||
nt|rlebi: not too many imps gonna swing on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: trump switch?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe heart to king now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many ways to play that bid|pg||
nt|rlebi: running low on boards|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: NV vs vul, shows 8 major cards and a lot of hope :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: from N's perspective his partner is weak for 4@s|pg||
nt|raghavan: If at all I have to bid - I will bid 4S - He has 2 Spades but no guarentee that E will have 2 Hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: serious 3nt would help a lot on this specific auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: well not sure what turner signal meant|pg||
nt|bbramley: will the bridge cops let them finish?|pg||
nt|starkist: flash suggested tree climb good for that area|pg||
nt|rlebi: there is a precedent for that|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: hughes knows the entries wrong for trump leads|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah i think a trump lead on the go was best from his hand|pg||
nt|gavin: when partner bids vul against not , its very likely he was bidding to make|pg||
nt|gambit: Diamond to the queen/ King...then trump from my good friend, David Turner |pg||
nt|caitlin: Welcome gambit (Cam French)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is the Canadian Society of Commentators CSofC:)|pg||
nt|gambit: TY Caitlin great to see my compatriots competing|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed|pg||
nt|rlebi: l'ecuyer could slow down the pace - while in the lead - run em out of time|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|gowdy: yes 3 of the other major after 2c and a major response is artifical showing the strongest support raise |pg||
nt|fabsayc: here comes an imp|pg||
nt|bbramley: close matches automatically slow down at the end - and why not? when you KNOW it's close you grind out every imp|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gavin: in fact his only chance on this hand is to actually draw trumps then eventually guess clubs|pg||
nt|caitlin: end of first period 0-0 btw|pg||
nt|gavin: thx|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gavin: he was hoping to see singleton jack of hearts so he could go over to dummy to lead clubs up twice (once with heart and once with diamond)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|gambit: what does he pitch? all cards have a value....|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: so 1100 turned into 400|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|gavin: this play would have him make the contract if kjx of diamonds were onside|pg||
nt|gambit: club|pg||
nt|gambit: and spade exit|pg||
nt|gavin: the play doenst matter much at this point he will just lose 2 clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gavin: one goes on diamond ace and one ruffed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bbramley: i think they should allow some extra time in the last stanza of a match|pg||
pc|s7|nt|caitlin: spade now |pg||
nt|gavin: now if hughest plays a diamond declarer wont lose another club|pg||
nt|starkist: lets petition for it|pg||
nt|rlebi: the directors get hungry, thats what matters, doesn't it?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: 38 a push on similar if not identical play.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting to see if meck opens 1@C, 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|lc: I say 1@S|pg||
nt|lc: I guess, that is.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: ROdwell asks Meck about his shape, then asks Weichsel, who says he was 6-3-2-2, so he opened 2@s because he had his hand mis-sorted|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: that's myvote|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah ha!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lc: Opp PH (especially the way these boys open white), game is unlikely. So not 1 big @C.|pg||
nt|lc: East's hand is nowhere near worth it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No.|pg||
nt|lc: As to a sexy 1NT, that should be reserved for playing with weak partners.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now ekeblad & Meck trying to figure out the shape. Eke: "Peter must have had his hand mis-sorted" I nod, everyone laughs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or sexy partners.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I am amazed by the chatter.  Meckwell are usually dead serious at the table.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Peter just told me not to tell you he had mis-sorted his hand :). But I already had |pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphu1: No|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is an auction that calls for a trump lead (responder leaves partner in his second suit). |pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|lc: Kit -- you are going to Brazil on USA1. I'll let you wini this one.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Often, responder will give preference to the first suit when 2-3. That's why Rodwell referred to it as a 'guess' when he left 2@H. |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|barnets: this will be 500 to nickell|pg||
nt|lc: The preference back to the 2-card suit is more important in "STANDARD" -- when declarer might have hidden extras -- you give him another chance to bid.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another factor that enters into those decisions is a weak, non-fitting hand.|pg||

nt|caitlin: well Gavin I call it that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: KCB will identify a possible loser, so no 7|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gavin: and easy to avoid 7 as martin said|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|raghavan: good bid by N|pg||

nt|rlebi: very easy to get to nonmaking Slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 5@H too expensive a sacrifice|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3nt only makes because diamonds blocked and club jack onside, single dummy 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|gowdy: @D blocked  le tthem set them up  3nt is on the J or no club lead|pg||
nt|starkist: we play this position 10-12, cowards|pg||
pc|h7|nt|caitlin: but I know many WC Cohen Gitelman Bergen etc who call it takeout of 2C|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Oh oh|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharynr: drury auction,, should be a making contract|pg||

pc|h5|nt|capercliff: if the @c honors were split it wouldnt|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not realistic I think|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|gavin: in the effort to getting to 6NT it would have been better for him to bid 3S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gavin: to hear from partner that they have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|gavin: he did what he did to find out about the king of spades i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i dont like any of these bids|pg||

pc|d3|nt|gavin: cool i just figured ur bidding stayman with garbage either way|pg||

nt|gavin: the problem that happened here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless 4@H can be a singleton, but that does not make sense|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well he could have gone down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: skipping board 10 for the omment|pg||
nt|gavin: impossible play of a diamond, even if declarer has 2 D it would cost him a trick|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: moment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was a guess on a random jack|pg||

pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: this looks down 3|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to overtake to play a club, easy play|pg||
nt|gavin: to overtake|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to decide wheather to play hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|gavin: seems like u can see that if u start hearts their club losers can go away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somehow silver made 6nt on 23|pg||
nt|gavin: very rare that u will need to take heart ruff and u dont get clubs back as a trade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which looks impossible unless a club opening lead|pg||
nt|gavin: a club lead is impossible|pg||
nt|gavin: but playing 6nt over 6s seems bizarre|pg||
nt|gavin: and a club lead vs 6s is impossible as well|pg||
nt|gavin: ok so the lecuyer team actually leads by 26|pg||
nt|fabsayc: impossible no. just strange|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Low @H lead beats it|pg||
nt|gavin: 7 card suit for me is game opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|gavin: no matter how bad my hand is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 3@C game forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: repeated diamond leads would beat this hand i think|pg||
nt|glen: swing to Carruthers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that hanna has any reason to find that defense|pg||
nt|glen: so 12+13|pg||
nt|glen: on boards 6+7|pg||

nt|fabsayc: bid deliberately to push board?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gavin: impossible because i know how they play|pg||

nt|rlebi: therefore they are a well matched pair|pg||
nt|mittmouse: right|pg||

nt|caitlin: So Czyz is from Ottawa|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not the Roland F wor?>|pg||
nt|raghavan: No they may stop in 4H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6NT is better but down also|pg||

nt|caitlin: 2@H shows 5-4 or vul 5-5|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is some strong 2@H bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|rlebi: the answer was 3|pg||
nt|gambit: other table 5c -1 |pg||
mb|2H|nt|caitlin: or operator missed auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: good spot|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 44 possible not vul|pg||
nt|caitlin: not necessarily so weak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It will be very hard for S to stop in game opposite an opening bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: going out on a limb and predicting this will make in under 5 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you believe that story?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: they claimed very fast|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gowdy the teacher may approve  that having another Major- I should not pre empt. Also here N has 11 points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the best one we have seen|pg||
nt|caitlin: no 2@H shows both majors|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh are they playing Flannery?|pg||
nt|caitlin: either 5-4 or vul 5-5 or non vul could even be 4-4|pg||
nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not Flannery, is called Ekren in Europe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the winning amount|pg||
nt|rlebi: oops|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gowdy: if 2 D shows a bad weak two  then 2 H shows a very good one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: i think you are right!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a bit harder from south seat|pg||
nt|gavin: yeh seems fine to win in either hand and knock out the king of diamonds, eventually u just cash your tricks and exit with a heart and the defense will be forced to give you your ...|pg||
nt|gavin: club and spade trick in dummy|pg||
nt|bbramley: on their way to 300|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: 2@C can be singleton, 2@D rebid promises 4|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes, 2c can be 2 or more|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4531 i think would rebid 2@C also|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: at least i think that's Wolpert just said :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: why? North wins HA can play SA|pg||
nt|caitlin: ooooooops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: here we go|pg||
nt|raghavan: Putting head under a sword?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: misplaced major jack, else a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: this should be double key card     6 key card  4 aces and 2 major suit kings|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wonder if this is asking re: 5 controls for hearts and spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6 I mean:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be double key card, not clear which suit is agreed|pg||
nt|caitlin: hearts|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin: after the 1D opening bid, south definitely should not lead a diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or underlead it for the set|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to pick from his doubletons|pg||
nt|gowdy: 11 to 13 |pg||
nt|caitlin: ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed vul against not with defense no reason to bid 4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|caitlin: he did not cash SA|pg||
nt|gavin: wrong one , now cyz has to cash ace of spades to hold to 5 |pg||
nt|gavin: fly ace|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact north should fly ace of hearts and play a club|pg||
nt|caitlin: on this lead clubs going nowhere nor hearts for defense..more likely to cash out|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Gavin?|pg||
nt|caitlin: this could be singleton?|pg||
nt|gavin: cause of the lead ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe in 4 that isnt such a winning defence since the club ruff would be 3rd trick, he needs a spade honor from partner to beat|pg||
nt|gavin: so might as well hope its kx and thats why partner was afraid to lead it|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is 5@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they get to 6@H E will be very careful not to double in case they run to a making 6NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: what does 5S mean |pg||
nt|glen: bonus for operator: play will be quick|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this type of auction clubs often the weakest suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if responder has club fit would tend to rebid 2@S not 2nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: Wolpert taking his time with this one|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will overtake and finesse I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some minor communication issues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On a @C lead will succeed if the !Q is played, which is I think the correct technical play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a surprise this, a @c from the east hand cant hurt him|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes sense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hanna needs to pitch a diamond if 3rd heart lead|pg||
nt|rlebi: i hear the fat lady warming up ..|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|capercliff: assuming he overtakes and finesses the @d again|pg||

pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: a spade back would be embarassing if jack wrong|pg||

nt|capercliff: 4-2 sry|pg||
nt|capercliff: if the K@c was wrong he could go off now|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|gavin: so the actual score is 135-97|pg||
nt|fabsayc: push|pg||
nt|glen: could have been a misplayed card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: I still wish I knew what 5@S response to 4N was|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphznx: they were discussing that here a bit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more than he had?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hanna seems to hold hearts a lot:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I also want to know what 5S is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Carruthers got another 5 imps on board 7|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S  E-W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H, does not fit any other overcall|pg||
mb|1H|nt|caitlin: everyone agree with 2S?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by North?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is ok|pg||
nt|gavin: with 4 boards to go in the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe hanna should cash diamond before returning the club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure which way denies the club doubleton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: penalty card in hearts maybe|pg||
nt|glen: poor other table, when they try to work that out|pg||
nt|glen: 1 hour from now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey tough enough here|pg||
nt|bbramley: slam on 2 finesses, or 1 finesse and a miracle @D guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|gavin: wolpert bid 1NT here because he didnt think he was good enough for 2H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3@H also ok|pg||
nt|gavin: aggressive 4S bid|pg||
nt|gavin: rlly hate that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: and instead of risking his partner raising 1S to 2S and playing the wrong fit, he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|gavin: on that lead declarer will likely go 2 down, take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|bbramley: but only 30 HCP and no extra shape - it's a bad slam and normal to stay out of it|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: Seemingly W cannot pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 800 possible|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt i would want to ever pass 3nt|pg||
nt|gavin: though the defense will need to cash their tricks int he right order|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room Joey opened 2@D and auction crowded opponents|pg||
nt|caitlin: can set up hearts to make 4S|pg||
nt|glen: btw board 8 is a push in 7NT, unless misplayed now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: 3@C blocking bid but sometimes taken seriously|pg||
nt|gavin: easy to allow them to escape for 1 down by trying to cash 2 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would be a better contract if north had 2 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: the A  then the 9  the green plays the last @H|pg||
nt|glen: nope, claim eliminated misplay chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: he can pass, and will when happy to see opponents bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe more|pg||
nt|starkist: omg|pg||
nt|caitlin: right|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: 2@H is weird|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess 1@S can be a four card suit for them|pg||
nt|gowdy: normal   canadian  hmmm |pg||
nt|starkist: it's the exchange rate|pg||
nt|bbramley: north must be worth another try, assuming that 2@C was GF|pg||
nt|gracelin: both 6H / 6NT forced to make on DQ lead :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, private|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||

nt|susieq: when in doubt, claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this does have a play of sorts, but will fail|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Very lucky with the @C position|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: needs miracles including clubs 2-2 onside i believe|pg||
nt|capercliff: so long as N goes low with a @c|pg||
nt|capercliff: if N doesnt play small it will come in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmmmm|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice auction|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if he gets to 6 withqof d lead and he ducks and w returns the 9 of clubs he may still go down playing for a squeeze|pg||
pc|d6|nt|glen: also when in 7NT, claim|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: hey there fish...you finished in Open?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mittmouse: 4 down|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: right but 2@H is going nowhere with a promising hand|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gavin: south had a tough problem, conflicting rules|pg||
nt|gavin: most often when you have a 4-4 fit and a 5-3 fit you want to play the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gavin: though from the bidding there was a good chance his partner was 6-4, and with such bad spades it hink he made the wrong decision|pg||
nt|mittmouse: no 3|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hanna will make 3 only|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gavin: 135-107|pg||

nt|brolucius: I think Meckstroth did well to bid 5@S. Not everyone would have found it. It may seem obvious when we can see the full lay-out, but some players would have taken their chances ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: against 5@H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel: "I should have passed the first time ... you would have let it go ... it was tempting to bid, but prob'ly wrong"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|barnets: 9 top tricks in 3n here but 4@Smore difficult|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|an|6+ !ss|nt|bigtrain: 2@S = 6+|pg||

nt|brolucius: If South manages to win the second heart, he will have to lead away from his remaining heart honor, or open the clubs.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Plsy is schedules to resume in 45 minutes, but you never know; we may get an early restart|pg||
nt|kit: this is unexpected line of play|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders must score a heart as well as two clubs - not set up the 4th club for a heart discard, of course.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel has left the A of clubs face up on the table and is contemplating. Before this hand, they checked that were ahead of the other room :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: Meckstroth apparently hoping for a defensive error|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: and it may have worked -- difficult for South to find heart shift now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hamman tried to give Kamil a @S guess by winning the first @D with the A and switching to a low @S on 42, but Kamil inserted the @SJ and scored up 4@C to win 11 for Fleisher, back ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: up by 5.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The chance of the elimination play (that Kit mentioned) was not a big one and Meckstroth must judge that playing on clubs himself will be a better shot.|pg||
nt|kit: but not at all impossible|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel moving hand over different suits. Had heart out, put it back|pg||
nt|brolucius: It must be a heart now, or the defenders' heart trick will vanish into the mist.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: we will field the enforcers with 10 foot hockey sticks|pg||
nt|glen: he might just put 6@C on the table now|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5-3s often better in NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: 4 H no chance let us see for 3NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks and chances for a ninth|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here the 5 never even mentioned|pg||
nt|caitlin: needs one minor suit trick|pg||
nt|caitlin: ????|pg||
nt|fabsayc: entries a problem|pg||
nt|mcbruce:  we're about 5 mins from COPC one round to go leaders|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: cunning play but should not work|pg||
pc|sK|nt|capercliff: huh?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: signing off, but this could be less safe than slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can be missing two aces|pg||
nt|capercliff: 5@s was a relay to play in 5N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so blackwood was not the right tool|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure what is however|pg||
nt|gowdy: needs a or k of d in N with  no C switch|pg||
nt|susieq: 5N transfers the blame to partner|pg||
nt|glen: no, its the your-fault 5NT (i.e. you pick it)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one does not get 12 card fits that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: slam is 50/50 at best anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to gavin, caitlin, tony, george and cameos from cam and harmon |pg||
nt|fabsayc: so win and heart to 9 and diamond up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|capercliff: happens to be the right side of 50 this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better than 50-50|pg||
nt|capercliff: you dont have time to try both finesses Martin:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually the defense will yield many clues to the best line|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hazel, the mom runs a great bridge club|pg||
nt|raghavan: North must be alert to play C and another C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is essentially the same|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is better, though Jurek should realize hearts likely solid|pg||
nt|rlebi: he picked swell|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a bid with a great track record lately, but worked here|pg||
nt|glen: on board 10, with the two offside black kings, EW made 6@S at the other table|pg||
nt|glen: sorry board 9|pg||
nt|glen: they bid 6@S for 13 imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: they have to guard clubs also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: plus no spade lead, i would expect a lot of clues|pg||
nt|glen: and now in 6@S board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tomorrow first session at 9:30 PDT, 12:30 in toronto, 2pm in newfoundland|pg||
nt|starkist: cameos and harmeos|pg||

nt|gavin: yikes bruce i know that task|pg||
nt|rlebi: swing comes back as predicted|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: nice 6@C by Turner and Hughes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: in answer to why they cancelled the board|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: thoughts on opener rebidding 2@C rather than 3@D|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: 8 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast|pg||
nt|raghavan: still Ck and C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and now is surely marked|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Has 9 but def can getb 5 first|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why H is not developped - means solid|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|raghavan: so hope in C|pg||
nt|gowdy: works here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam on 9 was fair, on 10 horrible|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: cash the spade|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: if this session did not start on time, would be very noisy once the COPC ended|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: GOOOOOD|pg||
mc|10|nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to guess right at the end to get the 6 tricks he started with|pg||
