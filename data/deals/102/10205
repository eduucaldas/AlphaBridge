nt|ronpa: I wonder if 2@D shows @H's so North showed @D's with his X|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  Meckstroth can show both his suits if he wants to (assuming 2@D shows hearts)|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can play 2@D :)|pg||
nt|cherdano:  true!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sartaj1: I think 2@D is natural because they play 2@H as a good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: no easy entry to dummy hurts|pg||
nt|mariner1: however NS will have to give him an in eventually|pg||
nt|ronpa: I guess Rodwell's pass showed no 3 @H's so meck was hoping for some @D fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: kibbers reminding me this is a violation of Burn's Law (Rules)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|charles_l: 4@h almost always transfers oppo to 4@s|pg||

mb|3H|nt|cherdano:  others might open 1M with his hand, but that risks losing the other major|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sartaj1: I would guess that 70 players out of the world top 100 would open that hand in 3rd seat; choosing 1@C, 1@H or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  1@H might be the plurality choice?|pg||
nt|barnets: hearts and spade are for a lead|pg||
nt|ronpa: Chris had Q@H lead for 3NT but now its not an option anymore|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough 3N to play here|pg||
nt|cherdano:  redouble showed diamonds|pg||
nt|sartaj1: A couple of days ago, we saw Meckstroth open KJ9x and out (in 3rd seat favourable)|pg||
nt|ronpa: Rodwell knows Meck is @S short so he considers a 4@H bid|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has only 7 top tricks here|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 short|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: if he could see norths hand he could get another diamond trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ronpa: seems like only high @C lead will give 3NT a chance but its all over, 4@H will need a @D lead to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is likely off 1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: might be better than playing 3N though|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: yes  agreed|pg||
nt|cherdano:  how does the high club lead help? not enough entries to set up club suit as far as i can see|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Assuming the redouble showed diamonds, Rodwell will try to squeeze South between the hypothetical @S Jack and the diamond queen|pg||
nt|ronpa: Even if J@S was in south hand, north would just have to duck the first @S and squeeze would be terminated|pg||
nt|mariner1: note 4 @H has more play if @H were 3  3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: unluck contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 3-3 clubs or 3-3 hearts or @D finesse|pg||
nt|ronpa: As kib mentioned, a @S duck would terminate squeeze but also would terminate the @S loser :)|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as jdonn points out, East and North will read the lead as a singleton|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Rodwell is probably considering a diamond to the king right here to avoid the trump promotions and ensure making the contract when hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|barnets: if he leads a spade now and north ducks he can make|pg||

nt|gracelin: I tk north would double 4S if it were bid.  He preempted with a strong hand so must double to show it.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gracelin: in original precision, 2C is NF Stayman and 2D is game forcing Stayman, which leaves both 2H/2S natural and sign-off|pg||

nt|raghavan: aggressive EW |pg||
nt|xenya: 2N for minors i asuume -- but W takes it differently|pg||
