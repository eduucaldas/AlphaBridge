nt|davidstern: 1NT showing 15-17??|pg||
nt|haans: more common soon than natural bidding|pg||
nt|kurtove: 9 tricks in spade will be normal, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: @HK and @CQ right - so 'only' down 1|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H did show minimum opening but better than weak 2 promise only 5|pg||
nt|haans: he did not intend 4@H to make|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@H in OR|pg||
nt|milton_se: not sure I see N's hand as made for preemption|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Just about any lead OK here, but the contract should come home on power.|pg||

mb|3S|nt|xenya: we start 10 minutes earlier than scheduled it seems|pg||

nt|milton_se: 4H can be set w AC lead|pg||
nt|pelu: and in OR S - after a @H kead to K - took a finess to the @HJ = -1 in 3@H|pg||
nt|haans: har ingen aning|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes looks 3Nt |pg||
mb|3N|nt|wwalter: @s now to be sure about makeing|pg||
nt|panja: the correct play now is a @S|pg||
nt|panja: to guarantee 3@H..|pg||

nt|lestergold: but not this lead!|pg||
nt|milton_se: AH and JS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some looks like tartan or muiderberg |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe you said that already) |pg||
nt|xenya: a 2-suiter, yes|pg||
nt|xenya:  does he have an ace, S is thinking|pg||
nt|kurtove: hard to find the 5 club now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kurtove: think so|pg||
nt|haans: think they play 3nt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: no great interest in the play. Just needs to knock out the A@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: 10 tricks  normally to be made = 4S+3H+2D+1C=10|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: good move by north, the 6@h bid suggests 4or5 @hs and out|pg||
nt|kurtove: wow|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wwalter: she is greedy :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as noted red vs white sacrifice but declarer hasnt found the @DQ yet but the double may steer him right|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well read by North|pg||
nt|haans: is 5@C good bridge??|pg||
nt|davidstern: Aand no double|pg||
nt|davidstern: Dont know about good bridge but -100 against possible +200 or more likely -790|pg||
nt|kurtove: is 1 club 3+ clubs|pg||
nt|kurtove: he knows that pd is short in spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is it clear that the third double is penalties|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S relay 3@H 3-4-3-3|pg||
nt|milton_se: wise w two 4333|pg||
nt|haans: yep :)|pg||
nt|haans: but they could fist ask then  bid nt|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly decides to stop in 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly safer than 3 nt  |pg||
nt|lestergold: on a spade lead it probably goes off|pg||
nt|kurtove: but its wery red|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|milton_se: getting in trouble if double finesse in Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|haans: hi hedy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: can get tangled up on the hand in 3 nt (imo) |pg||
nt|xenya: not really, Shirley -- 6 @Cs, 2@Ds and @HA -- at least|pg||
nt|pelu: S know that there are 'mirrow'distribution - so 3Nt sh be as good as 4@H - nice bidding|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|sybarra: and might sneak a @S also |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: 2 spades 4 clubs and dim ace |pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, 6 hearts would make with the diamond break|pg||

nt|hedyg: the CC is from last year so might have made some changes|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: not obvious to read the 8@c, W could have ducked|pg||
nt|haans: AJ right in clubs so soon happy decl|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does not know that Hans|pg||
nt|milton_se: but he can't go wrong|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am guessing it is penalties but what can North sseriously believe they can do to 4@S|pg||
nt|oliverc: Did Declarer really play the Q@D on a small one at trick 1, I wonder|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: maybe Lofgren led from xxx|pg||
pc|d6|nt|milton_se: anyhow he needs a D trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: Good play be the expert devalopping Clubs while in E|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: 5@C is also quite safe|pg||
nt|ritong: the small danger is to see opponents bid seven @ss, but who does that in the dark|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|raghavan: Declarer won first D with Q though could have by 10|pg||
mc|10|nt|raghavan: whatever North's idea for covering, it is made easy for W|pg||

nt|trotto: an be ,couse error of operator ,Joanna played ,in second trick , ce of  trumps ( and next @sQ) that's correct safety play|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the same imps :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@h= to justify N's choice :)|pg||
nt|trotto: Ace of  trumps*|pg||
nt|panja: Even 3@D might be too high here..|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no........ she claim sanding I give you 2@c 1@s and K@H|pg||
nt|xenya: another 4@H for EW|pg||
nt|don paulus: 5 now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wont encourage north to save|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pressure bid of 4@C opposite passed pd, well within Rule of 2-3-4 guidelines.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too many major suit losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c mandatory at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 3c at green|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh all pass|pg||
nt|raghavan: after 3H|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: np grazie|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: 3NT  can make  as A@C with North    but 5@C   the better contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he will not punish his pd for the overcall|pg||
nt|milton_se: NS playing 12-14 NT?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: do u know that the X was? - some play that X = 4 card @S and 1@S = 5 card - but X as 5 card @S I have never seen before|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: o course can bid 3n gambling if they play it to show this sort of preempt|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will try to find a CC for them|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4NT nat now?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: north probably lead a diamond|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: they made one on 1|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|haans: First three in each group will qualify for Swiss A after 5 rounds Rest will play in Swiss B |pg||

nt|henryb: sure? I don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean without seeing NS's cards of course|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil NS going as you feared to 6C - The X oD will not discourage|pg||
pc|h8|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho maybe not third in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: depend on style|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like claim will follow quickly|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to play transfers after overcall so X= @s transfer|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dcbutler: 9 tricks for declarer on any lead with this layout|pg||
nt|haans: that has been mpore and more popular|pg||
nt|raghavan: X of D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The slam is roughly 50% and bid at many tables|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|charles_l: helpful|pg||
nt|ritong: although he knows south has a @s top|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is not a good hand for those who subscribe to "always lead an ace against a slam"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: S did not seem to have any doubt|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|Walddk5: @SA would be the only card to let it through|pg||
nt|milton_se: about 48 (stiff S lead)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR Reess opened the S hand 3@D, then 4@C by N -- E/W have been pushed to 5@S, a bridge too far.|pg||
nt|ady: west really has the hand for a suit contract  evedn if 2 tricks higher  good controls   but only 1 spade stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: since she clearly has a light opening|pg||
pc|h9|nt|raghavan: run Hearts |pg||
nt|raghavan: needs some Diamond discards from Opp|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|nt|henryb: surely best to strip minors before playing a heart in case someone (particularly South) has a stiff @hA|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||

mb|p|nt|charles_l: 2@c must be drury|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm they may well miss their heart fit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well brave effort by west with 7 count|pg||
nt|dcbutler: not at this vul|pg||
nt|ritong: now west has a serious problem|pg||
nt|ritong: his part showed a good limit raise |pg||
nt|dcbutler: wonder how much 2NT showed?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   looked enough with that collection|pg||
nt|ritong: agreed|pg||
nt|dcbutler: looks like a mixed raise (at best) to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oliver can you explain the bidding - I could not understand what is 2Club by S?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphztg: IT IS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I'll say, both aces on side, the qj of @H flopping |pg||
nt|xenya: VERY well, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: would this bid not show a stronger hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ady: east hoping for the best here  QJ spades look poor values on the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: was 4@H fast arrival (negative bid) ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: tre other 3 hand = the bidding, but S??|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe South's 2@C shows both majors, but West doesn't care|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|pelu: or dont know? - if opp alert 2@C u dont exp both majors .)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: We had a problem at the begin, they switched Open and Closed Room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
nt|ritong: danger zone entered|pg||
nt|ady: yes    too high now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: and he will make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I was away a minute|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it a weak opening in a Major?  and 2H by N is pass or correct?|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sounds like it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|haans: 13 hcp for opps|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by S - also 5D makes but this 4H is a trial on way to 5D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: But all in all, the auction could have been considerably worse.  This spot is reasonable if perhaps not ideal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he didnt know he would find partner with 100 honours in dims|pg||
nt|haans: may be 10-12 nt|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: this should be a useful swing to Neve|pg||
nt|kurtove: do they play 2 club as gf?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: S doesn't know that, of course -- from her perspectibe, contract mau be in real danger |pg||
nt|henryb: this is not worth a 15-17 1N (I do not know their range) and Jx is not a holding you particularly want to have as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5422 pattern  (yuck) |pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: the spot is ok its just the layout which is savage of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||

nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: looks like I missed some action already|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, first boards swinged|pg||
nt|daman: this will swing too    doomed|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not neutral either, rite|pg||
nt|daman: aggressive bidding by West opposite a passed hand   will pay the price|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|xenya: sigh of relief from S|pg||
nt|xenya: now she will be quick to grab 11 i think|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: In the OR W passed the 2@C rebid and Hinden went -2 for -200.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Leslie knows that preventing spade ruffs more important than worrying about trump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: in most natral systems the ability to show heart suit in  a weak hand would not exist|pg||
nt|ampelman: my version is from july 2008|pg||
nt|hedyg: the players all had give in their CCs before play started, shame we have no access to them|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|pelu: We dont know, but asume that West didnt know :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised to see they play 2@c as weak both majors as they are not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|oliverc: Apparently, NS play Dwururka - the Little major like system developed by Pazur|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kurtove: 2 cl not GF|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: can claim that now|pg||
nt|lestergold: good defence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: now the trump trick is still there!! and all the spades too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi yer  Bill|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of rebidding 1NT with the E hand.  Certainly reasonable to rebid 2@C (as both did) with nine cards in two suits, but 1NT would have worked like a charm here to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: allow E/W to drop dead in 2@H.|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill.|pg||
nt|milton_se: killing lead though|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|don paulus: 2 off also ?|pg||
nt|ady: 7@HX  on board 16 should have been a save against a vul 6@S making    but the contract in open room was 5@HX|pg||
nt|daman: East assumed a Drury stance with 3433  9 count    not clever|pg||
nt|ritong: well it saved some anyways|pg||
nt|ritong: which is the target of sacrifices:)|pg||
nt|daman: some of those targets are pretty small|pg||
nt|ady: turned out an 11 imp loss rather than a possible 12 imp gain|pg||
nt|daman: Barry Crane used to say....."Only Jesus saves..."|pg||
nt|kurtove: so it is a bit hurry to bid 4 h now, i think|pg||
nt|davidstern: One thing that has impressed me in these championships is the very large number of young people at this tournament|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: D 10 ruff is begging|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: West could bid 2@H natural non-forcing over 2@C as a passed hand, surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this could be flat with the defence taking 6 tricks unless endplayed which i think is do able now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: not quite yet|pg||
pc|h7|nt|davidstern: Whenever I am in the corridors there are plenty of young players|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: Some rebid 1NT as a matter of course, some would do it if the stiff @S were an honor.  Matter of style.|pg||

nt|jcwla: The club layout might see this one home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here game to be bid but both 3n and 4h look precarious on thelayout|pg||
nt|pelu: 11-14 5-5 in m|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
nt|oliverc: Apparently 2@C was 4+5+ in the Majors|pg||

nt|milton_se: very fat 2C -- may be hard to communicate|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||

pc|h6|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||

nt|haans: 2nt must be lebesohl|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if south didnt find a spade lead there is no way he wouldnt find the switch when in with Kc|pg||
nt|kurtove: if he entres the table|pg||
nt|davidstern: That lead looks helpful but if he puts up @CJ and finesses heart will prove a good lead|pg||

nt|raghavan: Bertil, Diamond bid is due from E |pg||
mb|2S|nt|charles_l: N has single J|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder we've got a football (soccer) score in this set so far -- 2-1 -- the hands have been fairly routine |pg||

nt|kurtove: Not a good result for bessis in open|pg||

nt|milton_se: not happy w spades bid by LHO...|pg||

nt|athene: if south had raised to 4@D i am sure west wld have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed not|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find who should play 4@H|pg||
nt|kurtove: must be worth trying 4 h with that hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: this hand is not trivial if N-s play more @h|pg||
nt|kurtove: in North|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: huge dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: but south was + score|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
nt|aupillon: and slowly, but surely, thry drew their plans agains us ( War of The Worlds)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but top @c ducked and then east is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: as it  turn o ut 2 hearts  or even 2@D  works better for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: luxemburg has done well this far|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
nt|raghavan: Should play D and continue to shorten S in trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dQ|nt|ady: defence will hav e to do the right thing though|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: or 3rd|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: dont think can make now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: duck |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: dummy reversal is an attractive line, ruff 3 @D in Dummy|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes and lose a @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: in hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead on the go, might have done but who would do that?|pg||
nt|henryb: If she ducks, declarer can just ram @d down her throat|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in trumps are too good|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|don paulus: that would be 10 for badger|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|panja: @DA, @SQA..|pg||
nt|wwalter: the dummy has 1 @h losre, if the @h is not found|pg||
nt|wwalter: now should ruff some @d|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer has to worry about 4-1 trumps too|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: a heart continuation would create enormous problems|pg||

nt|oliverc: EW won the Under 28 Pairs at Beijing in the Mind Sport Games|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: north played for some blocking @c position|pg||
nt|ady: but discarding a heart and a diamond made the contract unmakeable|pg||
nt|ritong: unless @d 10 drops|pg||
nt|ritong: if a defender has a @c less, he has a @d more and then @d 10 can be short|pg||
nt|ritong: he/she, btw|pg||
nt|daman: should be a push then|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb: at trick 2. declarer plays a club and South wins and plays a third heart|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  looks the best shot|pg||

mb|3D|nt|raghavan: D J is natural lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||

nt|raghavan: oh sorry N on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C super-accept|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: they will do well to bid 6 i think|pg||

nt|henryb: a big chance for Hansen|pg||

nt|ritong: mrs hinden has a tough switch to make|pg||
nt|ritong: @d jack could slip |pg||
nt|murat: they are still ok|pg||
nt|april7: S will start a crocss ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
nt|davidstern: This could get ugly|pg||
nt|haans: does east  havbe @HK?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kurtove: thats a nice turn|pg||
nt|davidstern: Duck and a club ruff and another heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry club ruff and spade for -1|pg||
nt|haans: safer to play @HA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even if he wins this he can play a high spade honour they get a club ruff and then perhaps black suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|kurtove: its a problem to take the ace if east have the rest of the hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: So Heart Ace and seconbd trump then @SK win diamond ruff spade and ruff diamond and trump will nail West|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@D is a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can get C ruff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
nt|davidstern: oops|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: soade switch is awkward after cashing clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 13 precious IMPS back|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: defense needs to play spades|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
nt|raghavan: a D to KQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: SAK|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
nt|ritong: well played by east, a @d and it was over, since west would certainly play a @d back|pg||
nt|ritong: now on the surface, west has to duck the @d K|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal defense at this level|pg||
nt|dcbutler: that doesn't help, does it?|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that will not help|pg||
nt|ady: should make now   with diamond position favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: she might play a @d from hand right now|pg||
nt|kurtove: he was thinking that east never would have turned hearts without the king|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
nt|kurtove: And I agree|pg||
pc|h2|nt|milton_se: +2|pg||
nt|raghavan: H9|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|athene: cash two clubs and then @HK and @H10 - even if you lose to east's @HQx, she may be endplayed anyway with @SA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: as far as inviting goes - conventional wisdom is that you don't want to play in the invitation very often, so you want partner to accept more often, i think?|pg||
nt|daman: nice|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|jcwla: That's how I feel.  I prefer the invitation to be one last chance to decline game with the absolute pits; otherwise, we go.|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for the theorists -- when 2@C guarantees 6+@C it is more efficient to use only one response to 2@D to say 4@H or 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: yes, boring 3nt|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting "but not forcing to game" |pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: on Board 16 Versace found the lead of @SA and gave a ruff = 6@D -1 - but 12 IMPs for Salokin-team|pg||
nt|raghavan: May reach slam in H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: yes Lauria bid only 1@H, not 3|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: good to try something different|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by NS is best,but hard to reach|pg||
nt|raghavan: In ACBL tourneys, Convention cards are published in advance - Here I tried the website - could not go beyond the names of countries |pg||
nt|raghavan: will S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|murat: or Dbl maybe|pg||
nt|april7: if S bids 2NT then N will give him ofcourse the 3d|pg||
nt|murat: dbl would be no sense actually|pg||
nt|april7: the question also is whether N can have a 4card @S suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|charles_l: N must XX?|pg||
nt|panja: W is not very tolerant though, he wants to have his say in the matter|pg||
nt|athene: pretty boring 3nt here with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be unlikely to sell out to 2@S sitting East|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D now perhaps all end|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D looks negative one except you are forced to play the @DA|pg||
nt|haans: singel K again :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: but will Henner resist the spades?|pg||
nt|april7: now we hav e it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb: even so, I think two aces is too mich opposite 2@c not to be trying for if not driving to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: again, W's pass looks timid|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||
nt|ady: likely tgo end 3NT   or 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT shows 22/23 balanced|pg||
nt|raghavan: I feel VUL overcall of 2C should be good suit go for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: payback time :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
nt|milton_se: now she should|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry my eyes did deceive me they were one board ahead of this table|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: that would be law going too far|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR declarer played a spade towards the queen to create the entry to take the losing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c seems to be a transfer to @d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||
nt|wwalter: after this board will come a friendly chat on EW :)|pg||
nt|april7: 10 easy tricks ready for claim|pg||
pc|h5|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Hauge now leads the other semifinal 60-50 with (i think) 5 boards to compare|pg||
nt|ritong: 3Nt = i do not like @ss|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|daman: A @C will|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am going to back Michel to make this one|pg||
nt|kurtove: he may try to get entry on qsp, but will go -1 then|pg||
nt|haans: looks natural|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
nt|ady: lay down A@H    and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now no cue bid of Clubs so stopped probably|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||
nt|charles_l: lots down here|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is cold, but uptricks are heavy at that point  so she considers the best way to gather a max of tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: @c lead?|pg||
nt|pelu: they play a lot of tranfers after takeout X - so it looklike trandfer here also|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: she might try leading @H9|pg||
nt|athene: or leading small to @H10|pg||
nt|athene: that still gives time to lead to @HK later|pg||
nt|wwalter: I hope the chairs will not fly :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment if you play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|milton_se: this needs some help -- doubt that he'll get it|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has nothing to discard on the 9@d when it becomes good|pg||
nt|hedyg: should lose 1@d, 1@c and 2@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how he can avoid it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|don paulus: 1 @c strong - then ok|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: Allix amazingly passive. I wonder what Neve would have done with the @dQ in addition|pg||
nt|athene: they probably play that you complete the transfer with any weak NT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: hmm|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not this way but???|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: I win|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||
nt|athene: it gives up the legitimate play in the suit of @HQx / @HJx with east|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: this might give west time to get his long spade set up|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence take @CA, @S, three hearts|pg||
nt|haans: u sure do|pg||
nt|milton_se: if 1NT is 12-14, North is certainly worth 4C|pg||
nt|april7: preparing a squeeze which doesn't exist|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: the defence can actually stop declarer ducking a club into east's hand with certainty|pg||
nt|athene: west goes in with @CJ if declarer leads low from hand and east plays @C10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: but of course everything works for declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: B22: lead @HQ = 9 toptricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: *them|pg||
nt|xenya: they got to 5N there though|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.2 sekund faster :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are fast!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Murat|pg||
nt|murat: i wish i knew.. :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: good news for allix|pg||
nt|ritong: he sweated just two seconds|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|milton_se: will probably make after some battle|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is nice to have a known person by our side|pg||
nt|oliverc: It's like watching Klingons bidding :)|pg||
nt|murat: i got an answer from the audince "diams. +4 +11 hcp"|pg||
nt|april7: if 2@C is not forcing, why doesn't S pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u win 9 out of 10 .)|pg||
nt|april7: very odd bidding|pg||
nt|murat: i guess NS is a Polish pair which i know nothing about them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: would you raise?|pg||
nt|ritong: or try no trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets guess ( nothing in CC) that 2NT asks for force|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Hedy / when 2@H ) GF / then 2NT forcing >(>(|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tobias - is this team in a chance for reaching SF > If u feel so, send me the file  Editor@@BridgeIndia.com  |pg||
nt|april7: a nice @C contract going down the drain|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: strong club and negative - now is 1@H any 20+?|pg||
nt|panja: S made it very easy, ok if 1@S is limited|pg||
nt|charles_l: S shows she can psyche 1@d too|pg||
nt|panja: if 1@S could be stronger, NS could easily lose a 6@C slam|pg||
nt|athene: now Allerton gets a chance to make his second rebid :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Three bids on the 11 count?  No.|pg||
nt|athene: but he declines it|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't think 2@D shows extras in that position|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt sort of limited your hand?|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like a flat board|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d relay again|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play low|pg||
nt|milton_se: AD and D -- let them play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Develop a D trick may play A and small D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: or perhaps 4+ hearts, forcing, á la Meckwell|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10 fast, but could be 11 :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 11 on this lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't like N's sequence here. |pg||
nt|ady: thats the winning bid by west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: 3NT is possible, don't think you have a raise|pg||
nt|ritong: well it is a matter of @d length with east, i think|pg||
nt|ritong: suppose east has two @ds, it probably will be better in @s|pg||
nt|ady: needs an accurate defence to beat 4 spades if leading clubs   msut not play 3rd club   or will later be end played  after trumps drawn and a diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming south does not hold six|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: lots of tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showed Diamonds|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C? - who knows|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: and into the soup we go  |pg||
nt|henryb: Only one of the four pairs on vg managed to reach even 6@c|pg||
nt|dcbutler: but doesn't E rate to be short in diamonds?|pg||
nt|raghavan: we both thought the same|pg||
pc|h2|nt|charles_l: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|wwalter: a fast claim now :)|pg||
nt|ady: good result for Badger|pg||
nt|haans: board 10 will decide :)))|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: ok 1@H natural F1 by the look of it|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light opener, ok.  1NT rebid, the misdescription starts.  Passing 2@C carries the connotation you're fine defending that, again, not my cup of tea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 4 imps for Neve|pg||
nt|athene: should make this even if he tries to drop @CKx with north|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|murat: i'm having some informations.. Polish pair was a part of Polish Bermuda Bowl team last year..|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: then everything else natural|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brgpro: sorry, was away|pg||
nt|raghavan: same by declarer too!!!|pg||
nt|milton_se: As did South|pg||
nt|raghavan: W has to play Spade|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all cards / but missing 2 Aces / so they will stop|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brgpro: she went down...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dcbutler: fortunate the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|milton_se: y and E has to play 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Going good till now for S - should start on trumps now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|milton_se: hasn't this relay sequence made clear that 2 aces are missing??|pg||
nt|raghavan: Knowing their system will help in good commenting by us|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brgpro: well, She ran @h9...that needs @h8 on side and one of the @hQJ, less chance than playing @h to the K i think|pg||
nt|athene: well, given time declarer can come to three hearts, three clubs, @SK, @DAK|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they know, they play turbo and Fantoni has shown 1 keycard|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that most of the relays are distribution and HCP / not Aces|pg||
nt|haans: you really know a lot hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT over 4@s would have shown an even nr of keycards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|milton_se: better use for controls than hcp, I'd say|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: defence should make at least 6 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: going for the immediate spade pitch|pg||
nt|hedyg: any 5 level bid shows an odd number|pg||
nt|haans: knowlege at this ttable|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: perfect shift by Bocchi|pg||
nt|athene: now|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna can t give an entry to a declarer with singleton @s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am a Fantunes fan :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oliverc: Well I have their CC up on screen now, but I suspect we'll not be hugely wiser|pg||
nt|oliverc: except where opening bids are concerned|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: now the defence are poised to take three spades and two clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: even with the @S switch (looks odd), this is down 1|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't put diamonds 6-2 on this auction!|pg||
nt|ritong: so my guess is a @h comes|pg||
nt|haans: i have their full system Will read it some day :))|pg||
nt|hedyg: by then they will have changed it|pg||
nt|milton_se: so not even bad bidding makes you doubt? :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubt in Fantunes???? never!|pg||
nt|haans: give me you mail adress|pg||
nt|hedyg: having already shown a @c control earlier Fantoni with the 5@d bid showed an odd nr of keycards and @d control|pg||
nt|haans: have it now|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5 rounds and not knowing that before...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if no @d ruff now he can claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: you know nr of keycards before Bertil?|pg||
nt|milton_se: with a relay system, certainly|pg||
nt|hedyg: a different relay system|pg||
nt|hedyg: their system seems to work fine for them|pg||
nt|haans: but few have decided to play it|pg||
nt|milton_se: I wouldn't like to be in 5 on that...|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: next match in 50 minutes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d8|nt|athene: now the trump promo on the spade|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: @D ruff|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: could declarer have squeezed Bocchi in hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: exit with a spade at that poit|pg||
nt|athene: point|pg||
nt|athene: now if Sabine cashes, she kills her partner|pg||
nt|raghavan: All EW trumps can win tricks now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|milton_se: or S|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: also in 5@h in Open room|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|nt|murat: so some new imps of No Name|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: well, no chance now for sure|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|pc|c8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: if the card in trick 1 were shown correctly, W should now E had a singleton @H|pg||
nt|xenya: *cards|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d9|pc|h3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|don paulus: it all looked so promising :(|pg||
nt|milton_se: costly mistake|pg||
mc|6|nt|pelu: from kibs: Why didn't Sabine take the @CQ and play @SQ??? - help partner!|pg||

nt|charles_l: Open one browser window per table.|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt is a great spot for NS here|pg||
nt|haans: 5@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: can they avoid 3NT?|pg||
nt|milton_se: no game here w best def|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S by N will go down on a @H ruff by W|pg||
mb|d|nt|kurtove: 5 sp is 3 down with best def|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|raghavan: This  of NS has not helped them now - they lost 5IMP|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: yes, that might have been a good play, but Bocchi didn't need it|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S  - an unklikely contract|pg||
nt|haans: but does 4@H mean single spade|pg||
nt|haans: changed times |pg||
nt|pelu: so last board 5 IMP for Angelini = 16-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed, 30 minutes earlier than i announced, sry|pg||
nt|haans: first time 10 then 11:40 13:20 17:30 19:10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 8  here 4H made 5 Open 6H -1 so MC Leish picks up 11 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: this board can be bloddy|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C = both majors?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: note that 3N is cold for NS on the last board|pg||
nt|pelu: do u like the X from S? - 2@H or 2@S (Michael) in my book|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 5@C - strong @C-suit and no @Hs ?????|pg||
nt|milton_se: that opening bid might help NS to stay low|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@s without @h lead|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that @D8 in trick 1 ask for @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: but will have to guess the position of @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: CC says it's a 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|hedyg: ty Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: corrected on our website|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C not alerted so presumably improvisation|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@C natural or...?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D an underbid and 3nt not really very good|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but not alerted|pg||
nt|athene: actually i think a simple 3@D wld have been OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, nice Morton's Fork possibility here|pg||
nt|brgpro: seems there was an misunderstanding of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: by playing @c4 he set up "mortons fork" - if West take @CA the 2 discards - if not: the @C-trick go away|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather unfortunate...W has sort of "Nat" @hK lead...|pg||
nt|charles_l: S might suggest it over 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: but N bids 4@h|pg||
nt|wwalter: a manly bid :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: real men bid game :) (and try to make it)|pg||
nt|panja: not an easy lead, but @C is safe|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 22 the other room reached to high in 6 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *too |pg||
nt|jcwla: Should work like a charm here if natural.|pg||
nt|athene: but west perhaps just wants to stop the club lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: it didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: he made LOL|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it difficult to bid game in S and make it - 2 Club losers Da - will D  belead |pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: has there been a misunderstanding here? Sabine knows that 3NT isn't solid diamonds...|pg||
nt|haans: only brits play 5@C as slam invite|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that the X = @h + minor - so S has shown his hand!|pg||
nt|kurtove: diamond lead, ruff and small heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=0-11, 4@hs|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes will have to drop QC, since he can't afford E having the trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@d acts as 4sf here?|pg||
nt|april7: @D lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|charles_l: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|henryb: "The Fat Lady is Singing"|pg||
nt|ritong: north went for the practical bid|pg||
nt|ritong: a second cue wouldn t have scandalized me|pg||
nt|ady: north right gave up once south shows some heart values|pg||
nt|daman: has to duck 1 @H and maybe more|pg||
nt|daman: pitching @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding has maded it easy'er for N to play @Cj|pg||
nt|haans: and this was board 10 welcome back in 40 minutes! |pg||
nt|raghavan: Will E signal his D Ace now?|pg||
nt|milton_se: Welland can't expect more than one ace w East, so D is mandatory|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wwalter: 4 wich pair? :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: maybe will fines the @h :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: he has not made it yet......|pg||
nt|wwalter: it sould be simple now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brgpro: Bocchi thought pd denied @d control|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can finesse in @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: but now it's over|pg||
nt|milton_se: 11 tricks probably|pg||
nt|haans: trust we will see team salokin again|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 4S down  so ew making 4 will get them 1 IMP|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|wwalter: made|pg||
nt|wwalter: or not LOL|pg||
nt|charles_l: he may be preserving his options to misguess @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|murat: he goes down now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brgpro: @c i meant|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2 x A from S - have a bet? :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: no|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wwalter: if he plays @s could come a problewm :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: it was a good pass by S, although 4@S is an execellent contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: Friends- We thank all great Kibitz, co commentators, VuGr operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: in 3NT on a @D-lead decla must topplay @Cs - if @cQ in West no problem - if in East has to drop!|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last board|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wwalter: + 11 or -6? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: well if you bids em you has to makes em :)|pg||
