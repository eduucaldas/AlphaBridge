nt|Walddk2: Your commentators for this match are Bart Bramley, Jack Oest, Joe Stokes and Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am Roland Wald|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hey all|pg||
nt|joest: this one looks pretty pedestrian|pg||
nt|jstokes: as long as they figure out they have no spade control|pg||
nt|bbramley: at the other table a double of an artificial spade bid helped N/S stay low|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to our Meckwell expert, Walter Johnson|pg||

nt|joest: hey Walter|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c may be artificial minimum.  NOt sure about n-s methods|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dinos1: hello everybody|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bbramley: slam if often hard to avoid when you a lot of extra high cards, enough aces, lots of trumps, etc.|pg||
nt|jstokes: and enough tricks if they don't take their 2 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: and altho it can be set, it's not a "no-play" slam - E/W better cash or they don't set it|pg||
nt|joest: I'd be mildly surprised if 3@s ask isnt next on deck|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dinos1: EW play nat. system, so 2@c is strong (or weak 2@d)|pg||
nt|xenya: a fairly quiet 3N for starters|pg||
nt|finch: Hi.  Looks like I have to support China for the commentators!|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: sorry for the biginning , we had problems with the rama|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Frances|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: ouch|pg||
nt|joest: hard to know without the explanations  If 4@c denied a spade control,that's a good thing|pg||
nt|jstokes: that 4@C may locate the lack of a spade control|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dinos1: mb opening was 2@d?|pg||

nt|andyv:  4@h normal unless E/W get active in @s suit|pg||
nt|daman: this hand has the potential for disaster    lots of points, a fit, but only 11 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|finch: East opened 2@C showing a weak 2 in diamonds, West enquired|pg||
nt|joest: will Rodwell bail or stand?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: stand i guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: bail  :)|pg||
nt|joest: another brilliant bbo prediction|pg||
nt|bbramley: what went "wrong" is that they knew they had enough "stuff" for slam and didn't check on the details of specific controls|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@s is multi-meaning|pg||
nt|jstokes: NS might want to be playing this one|pg||
nt|joest: well whatever it might mean, I think Robinson will kick things off with 'double|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck shows min/max|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|bbramley: getting out to 3@C looks auto to me|pg||
nt|joest: would you feel the same way vulnerable bart?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C shows max|pg||
nt|joest: where if things went seriously wrong...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: yes - with 6 of them i'm always there|pg||
nt|joest: it's like whether to transfer over a 1NT.  Just pick a rule and go with it.  It saves brain cells.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: imo, with a bala hand i pass, otherwise get to the minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 2@d in their sys is 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|bbramley: my rule for whether to get out to a major is: ALWAYS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: no matter what the opening was, EW clearly belonged in 3N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it rarely pays to get to the 3L if you're BAL|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson talked out of further action by his club holding|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dinos1: so closer to 2@d than to 2@c :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: am I nuts or might one consider 3@s as south when partner enters vul at imps?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bbramley: consider, yes|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|joest: nuts, definitely|pg||
pc|hK|nt|finch: auction as posted has E/W the wrong way round due to hurry to catch up i.e. East showed a weak 2@D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|finch: NS play strong club. 1NT is 13-15 so South is super-maximum|pg||
nt|xenya: that's possible, yes|pg||
nt|joest: If Walter and Bart are passing, we should all be passing imho|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|finch: 2@D was FG Stayman, 3@D I assume natural|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: only a @S lead beats it?|pg||
nt|finch: and North showed a heart slam try.|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
nt|finch: When West didn't double 4@S East was never going to lead one|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c8|nt|joest: so should n-s have bid game or is just 'one of those things'?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bbramley: depends a little on what other meanings 2@S might have|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jstokes: North might consider bidding again over 3@C (but certainly not without risk)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|finch: With the @DJ short, 6@H was probably always going to make on a non-spade lead,though the club made it easy|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|nt|dinos1: if X 4@s then 6N is makeable|pg||
nt|joest: walter, was there any inference that Jeff had clubs once he voluntarily accepted?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|finch: West didn't want to double 4@S because he had a club honour as well|pg||
nt|finch: That's a very good board for China|pg||
nt|dinos1: they play by S in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: (they call the director|pg||
nt|finch: Did West perhaps think 4@S was natural and there's a question over the alerts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: no |pg||

nt|andyv:  anyway, should be able to ruff 3@cs, give up @d and survive this|pg||
nt|daman: why not?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead would have made it exciting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S does not need to bid over 2N as he is virtually certain to get another chance and it will be very helpful to hear more, plus it will put his later actions in a context|pg||

nt|bbramley: at other table Hamman (North) bid again after doubling 2@S on the first round|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's more about @S cards|pg||
nt|joest: thx|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bigtrain: since the most likely meaning is NT invite|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|joest: 1@h = transfer|pg||
nt|bbramley: meck in there with my kind of double - actually, this one is a bit much even for me :)|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|joest: you have a patent on it bart|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks normal to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you need to strain to act over 1@C|pg||
nt|joest: if that looks normal toyou, I'm going back and bidding 3@s on the earlier hand :)|pg||
nt|joest: my longest suit is their suit|pg||
nt|bbramley: it has many strikes against: no aces, 4 of opener's suit, vul vs not, passed partner|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you've got support for all the suits jack :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bbramley: the one that tips me against is 4 of opener's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: North has faiththat partner has something for an opening bid|pg||
nt|dinos1: he has... @sQ :)|pg||
nt|finch: This may turn into a flat board, as declarer will play it very carefully having been doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: you were right , I believe that he didn't alert it|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: when my partner competes to the two level or, god forbid, the three level, will you be happy tabling this? :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: meckwell believe in very aggresive early intervention...  meck felt it was now or never|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c is quite the invite|pg||
nt|bbramley: altho if N/S open 1@C on all balanced shapes then i'm in there|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm a big believer in the philsophy myself|pg||
nt|bbramley: as am i|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bbramley: it's the primary reason to get in on balanced garbage, because it's the safest time|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: I do it a lot too but every good principle has its limits.  The colors, no aces, my four card suit is clubs.  This is where I get off|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|finch: From North's point of view, if partner's second suit is clubs this could be going for a huge penalty|pg||
nt|finch: Hard to blame East for the 4@S bid, that's what a pressure bid (4@H) is for|pg||
nt|finch: Unfortunately West may run the jack of spades, expecting KQxx in North's hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: why unfortunately?|pg||
nt|finch: Unfortunately from declarer's point of view.  Fortunately from North's.|pg||
nt|dinos1: he'll lose 2@s 1@d 1@c|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|joest: btw do you feel the same about takeout doubles over 1@d as over 1@c?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i've absolutely spent to much time with meck becuase it wouldn't occur to me not to act now|pg||
nt|bbramley: well jack, even if you're in the 95th percentile of doublers, SOMEBODY has to occupy that last 5%|pg||
nt|joest: hey I double on 4333 way more than most|pg||
nt|bbramley: and we're looking at him|pg||
nt|joest: I think we have a nonrepresentative panelhere in that regard|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|dinos1: now N shd cover @sJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|finch: doesn't matter whether he covers or not, he has more trumps than declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|finch: he just has to be careful not to ruff yet, to cut declarer off from hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: only becoz dcl has no entry to @c's|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, has to ruff next @c|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|finch: I'm not sure East gave the play in this his full attention in the 'counting to 9 tricks' department |pg||
nt|dinos1: but to beat it S has to cash @hA before safe exit|pg||
nt|finch: IN fact the 1@C opening in the other room wasn't precision, it was from the only natural-style Chinese pair|pg||
nt|xenya: he has a @D exit|pg||
nt|finch: West did well to respond|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, b4 safe @d exit :)|pg||

nt|bbramley: down 2 = 11 imps for USA1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think it may be 12 when all is said and done|pg||
nt|bbramley: he can escape for -2 by winning ace, ruffing last @H and cashing @Ds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: N presumably showed an even number of @Hs -- now S shouldn't go wrong|pg||

nt|bigtrain: this is the way for them to play @C after a NT overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: We've learnt that the 2@D overcall shows a weak hand in a major|pg||

pc|h5|nt|finch: Me too.  3NT is going fewer off as well.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|xenya: this will probably go down but not by 3 -- also careful defence is needed|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @s will destroy communications|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: while the @CJ would establish enough tricks to defeat the contract it seems|pg||

nt|dinos1: @hK - @d's. what dcl can pitch?|pg||
nt|dinos1: only 3@s so 4th @d will sqz him|pg||
nt|finch: Not trivial for EW to discard correctly either, they can't see declarer's hand and have no idea of his shape|pg||
nt|finch: A heart back will help East because he'll know about the heart position|pg||
nt|dinos1: EW have easy discards|pg||
nt|finch: But still knows nothing about the black suit layout|pg||
nt|dinos1: E knows that pd must have @cA esle 3N is cold |pg||
nt|finch: I bet you this would make from this position at my local club.....|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he knows something about declarer's @S after the @S7 from W|pg||
nt|finch: Good hand for EW to show their analysis stills|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, although I assume the @S7 could be from 7652 or 97652?|pg||

nt|joest: there are all types of 'odd takeout doubles' that create swings :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: If North started with  6 spades he was down to singleton @CK and West needed to rise|pg||
nt|finch: but I think that would have made his discards a little silly|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm sure he was holding his breath when he passed|pg||
nt|joest: something happened to one of the east-west aces in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Kholomeev should have figured out why declarer did not cash the last diamond I think|pg||
nt|xenya: he played it very well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Hamman's somewhat strange approach paid off|pg||
nt|joest: yes.  Partner could be 3=3=3=4|pg||
nt|bbramley: hmm, zia made 5@S doubled off 3 aces (and the trump king)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S normally shows @H and @D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jstokes: heart led to ace in other room, then diamond underlead (!)|pg||
nt|jstokes: still waiting for the club ruff|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: Rod has a double fit no matter what Meck has|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: a well-deserved 14 imps|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bigtrain: he's very happy with knowing @D though|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch: another very delicate defensive problem for EW|pg||
nt|joest: boyd had lots of d vs the reds|pg||
nt|joest: but Robinson has lots of O|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: Wang and Zhuang have had a terrific set. No errors, plenty of good stuff|pg||
nt|dinos1: E shd pitch 1@s to show no @s interest|pg||
nt|finch: we can see  this needs a club switch, heart through, club, heart through but I think that's impossible to find at this point|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, @c - @h back - @c - @h|pg||
nt|finch: If West has the @SA rather than the @CKJ there's no hurry to do anything except be passive|pg||
nt|finch: The 1NT opening is 13-15 by the way|pg||
nt|dinos1: how u'll beat 1N if W has @sA?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni was also doubled in 1NT. He collected 280|pg||
nt|dinos1: instead of @cKJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: will meck underlead the diamond? :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: or the heart?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: afraid something like that ids going to happen here too|pg||
nt|finch: How about North has xxx Ax xxx AKJxx and upgraded a 12-count?|pg||
nt|dinos1: E needs pd to have 2 entries to lead @h thru - else he'll be endplayed|pg||
nt|bbramley: old rule - when you want a ruff, lead trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: but i still think declarer will go down|pg||
nt|finch: Declarer probably now thinks the @SQ is offside...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dinos1: now @c?|pg||
nt|finch: now a club looks more obvious, yes|pg||
nt|finch: declarer must have thought he needed a heart honour right to get to 7 tricks assuming only three spades|pg||
nt|dinos1: E knows @sA @hAQ|pg||
nt|finch: technically he doesn't know about the @SA as West would have ducked.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can he be certain that West does not have @SA?|pg||
nt|finch: but I agree the heart position looks clearer now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frances was faster, as usual|pg||
nt|finch: I just type faster!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am lagging with 10 tables up on the same pc|pg||
nt|finch: I think West's signals have all been reverse count, so the honour distribution is still unclear|pg||
nt|bigtrain: using the old chesnut...  when you want a ruff, lead trump  :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|finch: got there!|pg||

nt|dinos1: yes, strong dbltons|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|finch: although I see Gromov opened 2@C - do they play strong club?|pg||
