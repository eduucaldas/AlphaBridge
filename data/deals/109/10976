nt|haans: but what could she do|pg||
nt|chick: void is void, true, but unless you have extra trumps for crossruffing, partner having values in your void means she doesn't have values where you need them.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but if only 8 trumps North does not wnat to get too high, and South is a passed hand |pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@D would show some more distribution and still no more points facing a passed double for me, I think this auction was reasonable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course north should have  bid 3d first to shopw some values and also to disrupt e/w then south would hacve found the punishing double|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: over stronger NT -- 1N-2@C specifically asks for 4@H|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is auto-FG   2@C covers Strong @H/@S or 22-23 bal|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: hmm  from what i see  2@S would be (@S & @D) or (@H & @C)|pg||

mb|4S|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: I like to open weak, make crazy pre-empts but 3 things are sacred to me: direct t/o dbl is good(might overcall with up to 18 points),multi or weak dbl has NEVER 7 cards(can have 5 ...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or even 4) and 1 NT overcall is always nonmin 15|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: how rude -- 1st they interfere with my strong 2@C -- then they have 2 cashing aces and partner wasted @SA  and NOW a ruff!!!|pg||
mc|11|nt|mmmakela: meant multi or weak 2|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Life is not fair?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither is bridge -- and that's much more important than life|pg||
