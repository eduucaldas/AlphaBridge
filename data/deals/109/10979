nt|roswolf: hi rob|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS playing what they call Tarzan Precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: the clock starts now, here we go|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it's a variation of symmetric relay precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: official time for 16 boards is 2 hrs 10 mins|pg||

nt|vugraphzvr: both doubles were alerted|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably N dbl showed point count and south's was T/O|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one presumably takeout, might get converted|pg||
nt|Gerben42: XXX convention|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: thx Al |pg||
nt|MolvaM: we start with a quiet 20 hcp - 20 hcp deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 1st dbl points, 2nd dbl T/O, 3rd dbl gotcha|pg||
nt|roswolf: north let them off the hook|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was a possible down 4 in 2@dX|pg||
nt|rhelle: on a trump lead, definitely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: might have even found a @C lead by E |pg||
nt|roswolf: missed game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: I think that EW are a little bit passive |pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not impressive - and 3@c is not exactly secure with this trump break|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but might still make this even though trumps are not splitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps north should have tried 2nt if pulling the double|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: sometimes one of the reasons for leaving in such doubles is that if you run, you might miss game because your side will misjudge the combined strength|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 11-15 HCP, 6+@C or 4405@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=RELAY|pg||
nt|roswolf: fireworks here?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|stoffers: have to avoid 6@h here, roughly 40%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl = 0-5|pg||

nt|Gerben42: thanks Rob, you're the expert in the system, I'm just happy I know one thing :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double 0-5 is most unhelpful range|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, there is a distinction here between X and 1@s - they are both 0-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: whats the difference|pg||
nt|rhelle: in my system 1@s shows 4+s|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|MolvaM: another relay?|pg||
nt|stoffers: 2@s new relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect this and more relays from Groetheim|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2NT would be natural here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: will lose enthusiasm after finding abt the @d void|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: but Tundal can still have this shape and @CQ|pg||
nt|stoffers: lenn needs A@s, A@h and A@c, and then some work to be done to make 6@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we have seen that norway plays an aggresive game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @CKQ actually better than @CA|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 4@d now? to show void?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvr: all of these bids (except 2@h) have been alerted, but not explained|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D = I want to make up for last hand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks too much|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think it's justified with his hand - he knows partner has a max with @d support|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well presumably 4@D is max end of range|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might make too|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is touch and go i think|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: don't quote me, but i think 4@D is a keycard ask|pg||
nt|sybarra: and all roads led to 4 @H |pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c confirmed 6-4 I presume?|pg||
nt|stoffers: Glenn asking all the way, 4@c showed exact shape, 4@d transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: Tundal showed 3406 or 2416, a maximum, five 2-1 points, and a control in clubs|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@d showed 4@h 6@c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle: by te way, tey reversed the meaning of X and 1@s = X shows 4+@s, 1@s denied them|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D showed 64 - and maybe short @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 4@C clarified 3=4=0=6|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: the explanation offered at the table is above|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trumph lead from S is my choise|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

nt|vugraphzvr: if the software fools me, why shouldn't it fool you also? ;)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and you are the winner shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs who use 1@C=2+ define 1@D as 4+ and always unbal|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or  1@D-1@H;1@S is always unbal and 1@D-1@H;1N may contain 4@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: nice lead problem|pg||
nt|Gerben42: would lead @H9 but doesnt want a ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|stoffers: (on a @c lead)|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days they run to 4 nt or so |pg||
nt|MolvaM: pd may not give any help and you warn declarer about the stack|pg||
nt|stoffers: how can they when they didnt bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: well true Krister |pg||
nt|sybarra: *Cnhrister|pg||
nt|stoffers: hehe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think 2nt is better than 3@h from S. He could have bid 2nt over 2@c with another hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and you normally wont be able to get this a millon down. so double converts a 50 into 100|pg||
nt|sybarra: *trying that one more time  Christer|pg||
nt|stoffers: correct shirley! :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction implies partner holds @C values - but maybe Tundal expected dummy 4261|pg||
pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: but sometimes you end up with -590|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stoffers: yes, 2NT over 2@h is better|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: this could cost a vital tempo|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|stoffers: 3@h sounds like K@h and xx @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i still vote for 1N over 1@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rhelle: only if East guesses to play @cs, of course|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you have to lead @D to beat it 2 tricks|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, @d switch now is still -2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes now but not always|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond looks routine|pg||
nt|rhelle: with A10x in dummy? I don't think so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart and diamond shift would have been down 2 also|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also a serious case for the @hJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but if you lead @H partner wont shift to @D I'm afraid|pg||
nt|rhelle: North knows from the lead that South has good trumps, and doesn't want a ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he should|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: but partnership may require 1@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stoffers: and somethimes you end up with +500 Molva..|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @C4 is encouraging|pg||
nt|stoffers: -300|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no presence at table. A @d finess must be taken. Of course E has doubled with trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did declarer read something into @S continue rather than @C attack?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: 500, perhaps (losing 2 clubs, 2 trumps and a @s ruff from here)|pg||

nt|stoffers: 'puppet' style|pg||
nt|stoffers: tough not to lead a @d here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just reading NS notes ---  their 2-level transfers are 4+ and 2@C is always at least INV|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rhelle: even now it can go off on a trump promotion|pg||
nt|rhelle: as declarer hasn't got a safe route to hand after the @s ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: responses not Puppet -- but show 4M min/max|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N-2@C;2@H = 4@H min    --   1N-2@C;2@D can have 4M if MAX|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: Bianchedi: "3rd and 5th, right?", and Groetheim nodded yes|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: has to pitch on the 3rd heart (after ruffing the spade), then he's safe|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42: how about @HK and another @H discarding @D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: EW convention card says "usually" 3rd / 5th  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was it right to win on dummy?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I dont see 9 tricks yet|pg||
nt|stoffers: good old 'too fast 1st trick play' i think..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did declarer think @D9 was going to win???|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 3nt making seems like a good score to me from the open room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if it was 5th yes!|pg||
nt|stoffers: maybe E can be thrown in or swueezed in the late game here, lets see!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @D5 can't be 5th|pg||
nt|stoffers: bluff lead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer sees all spot cards except 10 -- so "knows" lead is 3rd from 3 or 4|pg||

nt|rhelle: that's what I mean|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 2@d and 3@c bidss were just about the weakest he could make - and 3NT isn't exactly encouraging either|pg||
nt|roswolf: they can stop in 4nt over 4@C now|pg||
nt|rhelle: so I think 3NT is an underbid|pg||

nt|rhelle: normally 1NT = good 12 - 15|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stoffers: who here overcalls 1@s in E?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in thinner days - i overcalled automatically    now, i'm not as sure|pg||
nt|stoffers: you are a bunch of chickens, all of you :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: so North considers his hand a good 12 :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well he's bidding the spots off the cards, lets see the play|pg||
nt|rhelle: and a max, subsequently|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) looks like a trick in every suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: I wouldnt. I lost too many 500's that way|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can he set up a diamond for club discard|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: and not a good 11|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, if I bid 1@s, pd (who read some dangerous books) gives me 3@s always|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar - how many who play 2-way checkback allow North to bid 2@H over 2@C with MAX and 3@H|pg||

nt|fabsayc: mind you having enough stoppers and tricks was kind of random for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but home dealing machines!|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the other room they reached 5@c|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a story from the other vugraph match - Norway vs USA2 had a two-imp swing on the 6@C hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 7@C-1 vs 7@C-2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: think about that next time your slam auction doesnt work out - it's hard even for world champions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: and 7@C isnt that bad a contract, on a good day...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my partners dont need additional excuses :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this was a bad day|pg||
nt|roswolf: south convincing himself that this contract makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: upgrade west hand on that slam to 1@C opener and make 7 from west side|pg||
nt|rhelle: South has no entry - they normally lead 3/5|pg||
nt|rhelle: so he's wondering if he should switch|pg||
nt|rhelle: as it looks like declarer has 4@ds|pg||
nt|rhelle: a @s switch is tempting, in case declarer has communication problems|pg||
nt|rhelle: switch the @dQ and @cK, and a @s switch is right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would be a strange low diamond lead then, but i suppose possible|pg||
nt|rhelle: they consistently lead low from 3|pg||
nt|rhelle: any 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yuck|pg||
nt|Gerben42: except this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense must take forever in that case|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I think he figured it out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @C should be safer -- south would not lead @CJx|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if he asked abt the leads he may know south has @cQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: no question was asked, but he is on the other side of the screen, he probably looked at their cc|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't say Rusinow|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: needs to take the heart finesse fto gain an imp|pg||

pc|h5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe Zia?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dQ|pc|h2|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|rhelle: and that effectively buries the @s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: here we go again with 1@D-1@H;1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: awkward rebid for Zia on this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 card spade from zia - not recommended|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the reason i dont like it is because it takes so long to find the suits|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think you're right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now branco must have spades, so suit unburied|pg||
