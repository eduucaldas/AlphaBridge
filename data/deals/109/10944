nt|athene: sometimes you can splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|athene: but north perhaps doesn't want to do that with a singleton queen|pg||

nt|athene: playing partner for the @CK, rather than the @SK|pg||

nt|athene: true|pg||
nt|murat e: diamond jack appears fm west on third round but spade lead beats this one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you lead a trump :) because you don't think he has either king :) and so you don't want to find his black queen for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|star6ija: kibitzers helped with the meaning of 3@H - this is the trump, want to play slam|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The diamond lead is strange given the lack of a double by West|pg||
nt|athene: he might now try to deliver a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|murat e: the rest will be easy...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|athene: it depends how likely declarer is to keycard with @DQJx|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill: do you prefer 16 brds or 20 brd peter, you have played in the bermuda bowl|pg||

nt|daman: ahem   4@S now|pg||

nt|athene: nice solid result for NS in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this board and the previous one show that these days people like to open 1nt a lot|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: the point is, if you have any of these "middling" semi-balanced hands|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: you can be really stuck later on in the auction if you open the "correct" 1 of a suit|pg||
nt|athene: especially when opps start getting in the way|pg||
nt|athene: as they are wont to do, these days|pg||
nt|murat e: cards not well placed for NS on a good day 4 spades can make but bulgaria stopped well in CR|pg||
nt|athene: also north has tenaces everywhere|pg||
nt|athene: those red suits really want to be led up to|pg||
nt|athene: X will be 4major 5minor i assume|pg||
nt|star6ija: I don;t know their overcalls.. 2 opyions are possible seeing E's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|star6ija: 5+minor and 4 card major|pg||
nt|athene: west will bid 2@C pass or correct|pg||
nt|star6ija: or 4 hearts with 5 card minor|pg||
nt|athene: now X of 2@C should be takeout of clubs|pg||
nt|athene: the point is, that 2@C might be about to get passed out|pg||
nt|athene: so you have to be able to pre-balance |pg||
nt|athene: this is much more sensible than playing X as showing clubs "because 2@C might not have clubs"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: because if east is going to bid 2@D you get another chance|pg||
nt|murat e: DBL negative...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|star6ija: obvious 5card minor with 4card minor|pg||
nt|star6ija: very bad bid by S|pg||
nt|star6ija: double would be quite better|pg||
nt|murat e: this is also negative...|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south could double 2@C for t/o|pg||
mb|2S|nt|murat e: wow|pg||
nt|athene: firstly this might lead to a penalty and secondly, 2@H might actually be east's suit|pg||
nt|athene: now west assumes east has spades :))))|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@ds is a place to escape from big penalty now|pg||
nt|murat e: eveybody likes to bid...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: north gets the big stick out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: aronov should escape himself now|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|athene: one interesting feature of bidding which i have seen many times|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a borderline decision whether to penalize opps|pg||
nt|athene: don't penalize|pg||
nt|athene: because you are often going to get a chance to double again a level higher|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||

nt|murat e: Aronov v WOndered if pd had spades but partner will be most unhappy for his anxiety....|pg||

nt|ahollan1: since EW 1@D opener doesn't show real suit - they have a bunch of bids where responder shows BOTH @C & @D|pg||
