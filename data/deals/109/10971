nt|vugraphzvr: if the software fools me, why shouldn't it fool you also? ;)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and you are the winner shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs who use 1@C=2+ define 1@D as 4+ and always unbal|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or  1@D-1@H;1@S is always unbal and 1@D-1@H;1N may contain 4@S|pg||

mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|stoffers: this may lead to a 4@h wich is doomed..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now thats interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stoffers: (on a @c lead)|pg||
nt|stoffers: or shift|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||

pc|s9|nt|sybarra: some days they run to 4 nt or so |pg||

nt|stoffers: how can they when they didnt bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: well true Krister |pg||
nt|sybarra: *Cnhrister|pg||
nt|stoffers: hehe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think 2nt is better than 3@h from S. He could have bid 2nt over 2@c with another hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and you normally wont be able to get this a millon down. so double converts a 50 into 100|pg||
nt|sybarra: *trying that one more time  Christer|pg||
nt|stoffers: correct shirley! :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction implies partner holds @C values - but maybe Tundal expected dummy 4261|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: but sometimes you end up with -590|pg||
pc|s8|nt|stoffers: yes, 2NT over 2@h is better|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @C4 is encouraging|pg||
nt|stoffers: -300|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no presence at table. A @d finess must be taken. Of course E has doubled with trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did declarer read something into @S continue rather than @C attack?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: 500, perhaps (losing 2 clubs, 2 trumps and a @s ruff from here)|pg||
nt|stoffers: 500 yes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but @D5 can't be 5th|pg||
nt|stoffers: bluff lead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer sees all spot cards except 10 -- so "knows" lead is 3rd from 3 or 4|pg||

nt|MolvaM: defnce slipped 2 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last 2 hand made me dizzier|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@h looks to be good|pg||
nt|stoffers: this might end up high after 1@h-2@d-4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: just two @s finesses thru north and a bit more|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 |pg||
nt|MolvaM: will they bid slam?  your bets pls|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will not the 4-0 in @h spoil the chances in 6@h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- but they'll explore|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: on West hand - i'm not sure if better to splinter or [my preference] show @C source of tricks|pg||
nt|stoffers: they dont hav fitjumps i think, and its one time to bid a void for them: the first round|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: exploration started|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: even if 4@D shows void -- imagine East with @CQ instead of @SQ   splinter won't tell how huge East hand is even with wasted @DK|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no more bets please :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stoffers: 9 trumps AK A is 12..cant see him going down|pg||
nt|stoffers: dont need a single finesse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: another big hand +13 or -13 imps|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: will both voids come into play at trick 1?    a) south can't lead trump  b) west might ruff @D|pg||
nt|stoffers: guess AK @c throwing spades, home on a spade and crossruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need to type faster|pg||

nt|stoffers: stoffers says cold|pg||
nt|stoffers: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes it is but perhaps @cJ can make something....|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I say he will play this hand in 9 and a half minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems crossruff needs South to hold at least 3@C - in which case option to setup @C tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|stoffers: needs only AK@c to hold up|pg||
nt|stoffers: (but a guess of wich to come home on @s or @c the 2nd time)|pg||
nt|sybarra: only made 5 with ace of @D lead |pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I think he figured it out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @C should be safer -- south would not lead @CJx|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if he asked abt the leads he may know south has @cQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: no question was asked, but he is on the other side of the screen, he probably looked at their cc|pg||
