nt|imp_jan: slam trial in between|pg||
nt|lml: okay that makes sense|pg||
nt|lml: the simplest line to 10 tricks is to cash 3 top tricks and cross ruff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: btw, in cr bertens - bakkere bid the same (in the beginning)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room did get a trump led|pg||

nt|lml: I hear from Ray in the other room that 5 is an intersting deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007: i think its unlikely to matter very much as you probably need partner with an honour anyway|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: dont you like matches that start slowly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: as a player not as a spec|pg||
nt|lml: gives time to warm up|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well after a diamond lead 3n is easy|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lady007: in that case its better to lead low in case he has Ax  and declarer Qx (Qxx in dummy and partner the ace is more or less impossible as declarer bid nt)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this was played in N in Closed Room|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|imp_jan: and east led a low heart..|pg||
nt|mariner1: a small @H from E in Closed Room made this simple|pg||
nt|mariner1: looking for 9th here|pg||
nt|lml: the diamond lead is pretty good for declarer|pg||
nt|lady007: declarer has 7 tricks to start with and 8 if he sets up a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt a laugher|pg||
nt|imp_jan: attacking hearts looks the logic approach|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a tough hand|pg||
nt|lml: East is not going to enjoy discardiing on diamonds if declarer starts with that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not that that wld be successful|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|mariner1: yes E had to discard @S not @c or 2nd @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @D are played|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: well the 4@D pretty much tells the @D situation|pg||
nt|lady007: he can discard a heart and a spade to start with|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|imp_jan: ok returning a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: East has some issues here|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe he should not pitch a heart then because then declarer knows he has 5|pg||
nt|lady007: hmmm|pg||
nt|lady007: 4441 also possible of course but that heart came very fast|pg||
nt|lml: endplays, squeezes|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i like the play of Brink, returning a diamond|pg||
nt|lady007: defenders tend to discard their 5crd suit first, and first discarding from a 4crd suit is a very good tactic to confuse declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: a heart return is probably the best for the defense|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, he has no real suit to develop so lets them play something first|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes but discarding a club wlndt be a good idea here|pg||
nt|lady007: not on this hand, no|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S out makes discarding later easier on E|pg||
nt|daman: partner is marked with 5 @Hs|pg||
nt|lady007: but in general|pg||
nt|lml: if East discards too many spades he can be endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: he needs to hold on to more cards than he has space for|pg||
nt|lady007: good return by zhao, not only sets it up tricks for the defense but it also gets the pressure of east who can discard spades later|pg||
nt|lml: a heart return might have helped then another heart when in on a diamond|pg||
nt|lady007: that would be a very good defense yes. unfortunately he has only 1 heart to play|pg||
nt|lml: this is awful close|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not possible linda, west only has one heart|pg||
nt|lml: yes of course, and you cant really attack clubs much|pg||
nt|lml: I think Brink can do this|pg||
nt|mariner1: did we lose play or is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: south really thinking|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he has every reason for it|pg||
nt|lml: he might duck this|pg||
nt|lml: then win the next one and play a diamond|pg||
nt|lady007: i think brink will make this|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|lml: me too|pg||
nt|lady007: eventually he will endplay east to play a club is my guess|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes, he is favorite to make it|pg||
nt|lml: he wins this spade and plays a diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ok, duck, why not? |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|imp_jan: dummy squeezed :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: on 4th diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not that it matters|pg||
nt|lady007: i think ducking was best to ensure they didnt have any spade communication left. otherwise west might duck the diamond , east only has to discard one card and he doesnt know with ...|pg||
nt|lady007: which shape east started with|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: East might as well throw a spade now|pg||
nt|lady007: going for the endplay would then be pretty silly if the club queen was onside, east crosses with a spade and west cashes 2 more diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: dummy squeezed on @S return as well|pg||
nt|lady007: dummy can discard 2 hearts|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i am not sure if spade discard by east is best defense|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c3|nt|lml: East will be endplayed in hearts is my prediction ... to lead a club|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: Now the @SK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lady007: heart to the king, heart back now? |pg||

nt|lady007: kind of expected but it turned out to be very expensive for the dutch|pg||
nt|lml: I would have bid 4NT on the North hand as a two suited takeout|pg||
nt|imp_jan: there is world of difference between opening 3@h or 4@h...|pg||
nt|lml: but I can see the logic of 4@S too|pg||
nt|lady007: 4nt would be great now of course but then you cannot play 4@s anymore when that is right|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||

nt|daman: Linda    please do not use words with more than 2 syllables   it gives me a headache :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like DBL better, it implies 2 places to play and you well could be missing slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: even in @S|pg||
nt|lml: what about dbl|pg||
nt|lml: ah yes|pg||
nt|lady007: actually 4@s even had chances on this lead with the spades 70 :) east needs to have only 1 heart so you can cash 5 minor suit tricks and get 5 spade tricks in your hand|pg||
nt|lml: but a lot of people play the double of 4@S is penalty oriented... high cards not necessarily shape|pg||
nt|lml: sorry $@H|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|lml: 4@H|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lady007: brink-drijver will play it more as take out but of course take out is a little different than a huge 5530 with good 5crd spade|pg||
nt|lml: and with pretty solid spades North thought he might be safe just bidding it|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|s8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: I do have some sympathy and others have done it in the field|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|imp_jan: sofar jack zhao is killing his old friends from rotterdam, especially with his 4@h opener|pg||

nt|cuan: nel sistema dei fantunes l'apertura 1NT 12-14 contiene anche le mani con 5°maggiore e 4°minore 2-2. le aperture di 2 di 9-13 punti, se bicolori, hanno sempre un singolo. ecco ...|pg||
