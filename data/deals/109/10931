nt|rhelle: 1NT = 15.5-15|pg||
nt|kista: sry i meant East|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ady: 3@D   seems a transfer to hearts   |pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle: oops = 1NT = 12.5 - 15|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes - Rubensohl|pg||
nt|kista: Yes ...Is that GF or INV|pg||
nt|rhelle: neither - it's just a transfer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: seems a weak no-trump   so 1q1  not enough for a game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 11|pg||
nt|rhelle: I disagree, Ady|pg||
nt|rhelle: 11 but wit the @sK almost certainly right, and a good 5-card suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rhelle: opposite a weak NT that is on average a point stronger - effectively 13-15|pg||
nt|kista: I am told W cud have bid 2@h to sign off |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|rhelle: West will not let this go|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kista: It wud have been better for S to have bid 3@s directly over 1N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: that looms like 500 out of nowhere|pg||
nt|ady: against a non making game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kista: this allows room for opponents to opt for penalty or game their side|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: I must admit that I find North's 3NT bid extremely optimistic|pg||
nt|ady: south also could have been better|pg||
nt|kista: North was expecting a stronger hand |pg||
pc|dA|nt|kista: but neverthless very optimistic|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|panja: B15 3Nt for EW...even 6@C if they land there...is unlikely though|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: so much for the natural @C opening...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|imp_jan: on brd 4 the indians did reach 5@c indeed as i am told now, but since there was a long pause during the bidding the score was reversed to 3@c|pg||
nt|panja: te 4-4 fit gets neglected so swiftly even after that|pg||

nt|sga1: I am not sure whether that reversal is correct. N has more or less his bid after 3@c by S. Any way director knows better.|pg||
mc|10|nt|panja: when we discuss @C fit, we aren't necessarily thinking of a slam here...perhaps 5@C much better than 3Nt..|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|kista: I am just told that board 4 - TD adjusted 5C back to 3C cos of some long pause in auction|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ady: cards lay well for e/w   can make around 10 tricks  in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S minors?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|rhelle: 2@s = asking for Min/Mx, without a 4-card major|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = min|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@d = sign-off|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|d|mb|r|nt|rhelle: apologies kibs - it may well be that 2@s has a different meaning than asking min/max|pg||
nt|kista: Rob...RD shows singleton or doubt |pg||
nt|rhelle: it could be for the minors - invitational or better|pg||
nt|kista: ok|pg||
nt|rhelle: in that case the XX would make more sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kista: 3@h probably showed a @c fit|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|nkgupt: N directed himself to lead @h defending 3nt|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rhelle: I just heard that 3@d = 5@d and 4@c|pg||
nt|ady: is this the last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|kista: 1 more|pg||
nt|ady: one  more hand     |pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not sure if they are playing 16 or 20 boards per round|pg||
