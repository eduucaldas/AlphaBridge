nt|hantveit: do we know what 1 dia in opening is?|pg||
nt|hantveit: they use some kind of strong clubs I guess?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The system dictates that you open 1@D with that hand type|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They play strong club and 2@C would be weak with both majors|pg||

mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|hantveit: Looks strange that north is not supporting partners spade. I wonder if 3H is showing some kind of spade support?|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 5@C alerted eh?  Perhaps exclusion blackwood for hearts|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5spades is last chance to get the score. The dec will probably not find the 13,6% chance for Qx behind in spades.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't know Trond, 6@C can make the same way|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, let us see how they play it - or 6 spades. I would go down every day in the week.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't have to guess spades in 6@C. One of North's spades disappears on a diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If North did think 5@C was void showing, he's not about to pass 6@C|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvh: if I heard correctly then N thought that S wanted to play clubs|pg||

pc|h8|nt|hantveit: yes, good point. You can discart a spade on dia and play on spades 3-2 any distribution and clubs 2-2. 27%|pg||
