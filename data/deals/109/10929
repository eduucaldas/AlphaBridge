nt|nicksan: North's t/o double is super agressive facing a passed hand...|pg||

mb|p|nt|nicksan: 3 NT should be ok...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|nicksan: Possible to make 13 tricks in either minor here...but only 11 if you misguess diamonds...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I wonder how many diamonds 1@D shows|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 0+|pg||
nt|nicksan: Actually, only 12 are available in diamonds...sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4405 is opened 1@D within the 11-15 range|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Which makes it difficult for North to evaluate his hand...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|nicksan: Suppose you will often pick up the diamonds after the preempt. |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|nicksan: wow!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very impressive - South unerringly picks the right slam and West saves|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Last resault: http://www.bridge.ee/KV/kvpaar.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: -500 could be good for some IMP's even if other table doesn't bid slam...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: The best saves against a slam cost less than opponents' game|pg||
nt|sssvablue: interesting choice of leads|pg||
nt|nicksan: Yes, I wonder what 2 NT showed...?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: 11 tables in play, so 10 comparisons. IMPs across the field|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|nicksan: how do you say "preemptor doesn't bid again" in Latvian? Or perhaps you don't...|pg||

nt|nicksan: I'm with you there Liz...|pg||
nt|nicksan: north could have done better here if he'd taken the first heart and played another spade...entries were a bit blocked...but in the end all was well for West|pg||
nt|sssvablue: An original spade lead would have been more challenging|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: Like  J109   AKxxx   earlier today. Sester was in slam and had to play that suit for no loser|pg||
nt|nicksan: This one seems to belong in 5 @D, but that's not easy to bid...|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 5@d is a trick short|pg||
nt|nicksan: Apart from the three to losers that is...|pg||
nt|sssvablue: probably heading to 4@s|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Unless North bids 4@h first|pg||
nt|nicksan: 4 @C = clubs + spades...Jumping Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He dropped Qx offside|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Inspired :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: I can't do those things even looking at all the hands...|pg||

nt|vugraphzvh: Rubenis is shaking his head|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|nicksan: Spade lead from north beats 5 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And 4@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't get to hand quickly for a club finesse - these things are too close for comfort|pg||
nt|vugraphzvh: doesn't look like his happy with what's happening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Probably thinking, "Was it something I said?"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nicksan: I think perhaps 4 @S was unbeatable "double-dummy", but 5 should be too high...unless|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nicksan: How about 4 @S ?  West is cut off from the world with his hearts...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: nah|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: he can ruff a club|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||

nt|rodal f: major|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h3|pc|d3|pc|c4|pg||

nt|jstokes: in the other room on that last hand, the spade ten was covered with the J and Q; declarer finesses again in spades and made 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|jcwla: Last board of the day, right, Raul?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvh: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvh: after that it's bedtime|pg||
nt|vugraphzvh: god I'm tired|pg||
nt|jwit: Big misfit here.  May get to 3NT, which should not have much of a play with best defense|pg||
nt|lml: you should either not cover or cover high|pg||
nt|lml: covering low is no use|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: thats why the king is a cliche :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jcwla: Thanks to all who have helped along the way, starting with Raul and Roland Wald, and including Linda Lee and the other room commentators.  Thanks also to all specs -- some great ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: comments throughout the day.  I'll be back with you (and Roland) in just under 12 hours for Round 13.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jwit: Even with a heart lead, 3NT won't be easy|pg||
nt|lml: guessing 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: Luks likes his major cards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: I agree with him though I think 3@C is right |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: I like 3NT myself with those big major suit cards.  By rights they should have missed a making game on this auction|pg||
nt|lml: they probably play that diamonds can be shorter than clubs in this auction|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: well partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|lml: and you are NV|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think you want to push for close games NV|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jwit: I think the hand is just too good for 3NT which could be passed, however, maybe caution is not bad on a misfit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: NV games are overrated|pg||
nt|jwit: Too good for 3C I meant|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: it is equal to play the partscore or the game so odds need to be 50.1% to bid the game|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|lml: and I have a handy calculator to check that out|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|jwit: It is close.  Maybe the lack of texture in your suits and the misfit, make 3C the right bid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jwit: But on the other hand, you do have 14 prime high cards|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzvh: end of round 20|pg||
nt|lml: he is going to win the same 5 or 6 imps for not bidding the game if they do so at the other table|pg||
nt|jstokes: and the degree of misfit is hard for East to judge; 2NT covers a lot of territory, including hands with some fitting minor suit cards|pg||
nt|lml: West can bid again if he has a max|pg||
nt|jwit: However, if partner has some fitting minor suit cards, you are more likely to be missing game|pg||
nt|lml: you are precluding game just letting partner in on the decision|pg||
nt|lml: arent|pg||
nt|jstokes: it would unusual if partner, as a passed hand, bid over 3@C|pg||
nt|jwit: Perhaps you're right Linda.  Maybe the poor texture of your suits should be the deciding factor.|pg||
nt|lml: he would need some minor suit cards|pg||
nt|jstokes: anyway, +110 looks pretty good on this one|pg||
nt|jwit: For example, if he had AJ10xx of clubs and A109xx of diamonds, I think 3NT is clear cut|pg||
nt|lml: yes any slight improvement would push me over|pg||
nt|lml: I think people bid the same Vul as NV and that is wrong|pg||
nt|lml: Vulnerable the odds are 2-1 in your favor, NV its 50-50|pg||
nt|lml: you need to think poker|pg||
nt|lml: I dont what that means but it sounded cool|pg||
nt|jwit: And there it is 3NT going down in the closed room, so on this hand anyway, the conservative bidders are right|pg||
nt|jwit: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|jstokes: is this it?|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, I believe so, for this segment|pg||
nt|lml: unfortunately you lose breakage in a 3 of a minor.  3 of a major you get 5 imps|pg||
nt|lml: thanks|pg||

pc|sA|nt|vugraphzvh: but he knew he made a big mistake|pg||
nt|jstokes: very friendly lie of the cards for EW|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|jan141: wise pass by south|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't argue with success in terms of landing in the right spot.  However, S has not done justice to this hand.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Bit strange to se that a A was missed by defence at the other table|pg||

nt|jan141: But even it's nice to see that good players also have blind spots ;-)|pg||
nt|lml: very tight now.  The CR got to the vul game that was played in 3@H here|pg||
nt|jstokes: two more for this segment, or is this the end of the match?|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 27, N/S has yet again eschewed the major in favor of 3NT and with that dream @C layout (K-J tight onside), should come home for more IMPs.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|lml: I think this is it|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: or even a ruff in diamonds which was quite likely missing the trump ace|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, not only did 3NT not come in on 27, it went down 3 for the LOSS of 3 IMPs.|pg||
nt|jstokes: even if South's minor length is ambiguous, 3@C seems quite a position;  how about 2NT instead?|pg||
