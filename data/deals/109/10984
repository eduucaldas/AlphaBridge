nt|sga1: Void in @s was discouraging for her|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This is just a personal opinion, but I think 4@H is wrong on two counts: excellent outside controls and a second quite adequate suit.  |pg||

nt|panja: multi....given the status of natural by God's authority, by conrast a 4-card overcall at 1 level is brown sticker..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: always nice to have both majors facing a multi opening - you can pre-empt to the three level and transfer the problem to the opponents |pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3H!|nt|athene: the problem with 2nt is, if opps bid spades, you have to bid hearts to show the extra strength and length and now if partner DOES want to return to diamonds it's a level higher|pg||

mb|4S|nt|athene: you are much happier bidding 2NT with 5 hearts and 6 diamonds|pg||
