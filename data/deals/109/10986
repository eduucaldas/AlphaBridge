mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lady007: hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have got the Netherlands N/S convention card in another window, but whether I can locate the meanings of a bid in time is a different matter.|pg||
nt|flash: both pairs are Precision-based|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Marion Michielson|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|flash: i think that Marion will have you/us covered, David  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 2@C natural and limited|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Excellent.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@D asks; 2@S shows 4-card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|brolucius: Now 3@C is (usually) not quite forcing, so West must find another bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW  of course play Precision|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|rhelle: good morning / afternoon / evening everyone|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Rob|pg||
nt|lady007: actually i dont know so much about the NS system as they play strong club with lots of artificial relays |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: fortunately, I do :)|pg||
nt|flash: we can see that there are far too many side-suit losers to make slam reasonable here; can the players diagnosis this condition (in time)|pg||
mb|6C|nt|brolucius: 3NT would have been easy, but they have climbed beyond that ridge.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's way to high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: all the controls are there - just not the tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 10 tricks looks the maximum on this hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D is a relay and 4D showed fragment.  Unfortunately East opened a 10 count here so even 5C can't make|pg||
nt|brolucius: Will I be thought old-fashioned if I mention that East did not have much of an opening bid?|pg||
nt|flash: yes, but welcome to the club, David|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a good start for my countrymen.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Add the @SK to the East hand and there is still no slam.|pg||
nt|rhelle: I totally agree David - especially since the Ace is singelton|pg||
nt|brolucius: West was also flying his kite a bit high on those values.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if West's HK were in spade, then south needs to find the kiling D lead to beat 6C|pg||
nt|lady007: i think west is too blame here, Axx in your partners 2nd suit is a bad holding with many losers|pg||
pc|c7|nt|flash: it's not unusual for a player/pair to try to set the tone for a match early - of course, sometimes the tone is quite off-key...|pg||
nt|lady007: Ax would be much better and then Axx in partners shortness instead of Kxx|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|rhelle: I can't even begin to think of a distribution where this would make - even 1 time in the double void is not enough|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|flash: fair warning - South is a most 'thoughtful' player...   we'd expect to have comparisons pretty much throughout|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|brolucius: The lesson for us all to learn is "don't overbid on both hands at the same time."|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lady007: also 4@d was overdone on the 10 count. pretty bad to end up in a slam like this on a unopposed auction|pg||
mc|11|nt|rhelle: he's saved a trick by setting up the 4th @s|pg||

nt|lml: good morning from Canada|pg||
nt|daman: and NS have no useful sacrifice|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT does seem a very likely spot doesn't it|pg||
nt|daman: count on it|pg||
nt|daman: a vanilla hand to begin|pg||
nt|lml: West has a balanced 15 count and nobody every plays in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: hello everyone we are starting the vugraph|pg||
nt|lml: I always like that.  I find that the two boards I am mostly likely to mess up are the first and the last|pg||

nt|vugraphzvr: good game for everyone|pg||
nt|daman: Chinese Taipei     http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/SaoPaulo.09/ASP/participantsDetailTeams.asp?qteamid=CHINESE TAIPEI@@782|pg||
nt|lml: Are you surprised at how well Chinese Taipei has been doing?  |pg||
nt|daman: I am|pg||
nt|lml: me too.  We run a contest to pick winners on bridgeblogging.  We had a lot of entrants|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think anyone picked Chinese Taipei to make the top 8|pg||
nt|daman: 12/22    need to move up a bit though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I am told they are in 6@C in the other room on a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lml: and here we thought 3NT was obvious|pg||
nt|lml: I guess some people do play in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: it is to me|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good point by Marion. Having 'operated' with a 10-point opening bid, East should have tried to keep the bidding below 3NT at his 3rd turn. |pg||
nt|flash: Bakkeren-Bertens vs Chen-Yang at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Easily worth a strong club on the South cards, but some would still open 1@H, fearing big intervention in spades.|pg||
nt|flash: teams will usually adopt a fixed rotation; with 3 matches each day, each pair usually gets 1 match off|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = @s (4+) and 9+ points :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sometimes pairs that bid a no-play 6@C are given two matches off...|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2S|nt|rhelle: he must have been thinking about a pass - but Vul agaianst NV, that doesn't pay|pg||
nt|lady007: of course there is the dangerous of opponents intervening with spades, esp at this vulnerability, but you have a huge hand and might even be able to rebid 5@h over 4@s, and after ...|pg||
nt|lady007: opening 1@h, partner will never believe you have such a great hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: Ch Tpe played only two anchor pairs in the last two days.  This is the first match we see the 3rd pair Yang-Chen playing|pg||
nt|flash: or a mild tranquilizer...   the coach requires stronger medication|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now perhaps 4@H, rather than 3@H. No, he has preferred 3@H.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h breaks te realys, and is natural|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Patrick - the daily schedule isn't extremely demanding, but the length of the event makes this a marathon|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, especially for teams who have hope to play the second week|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lady007: ok, easy 11 tricks, this shouldnt take too long|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|flash: in Shanghai, we likened it to the movie Groundhog Day - each day was a repeat of the previous one - we hoped to get it right eventually and break the spell...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rhelle: sensible aution - and the chance to get rid of some of his @c losers|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: if they were to claim when they should they could have a smoke that much faster|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: they use to open all 10 pts hands with shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lady007: of course it does make a difference that the chinese taipei east could open 2@c, which is much more attractive than a 1@c opening that doesnt mean anything|pg||
nt|rhelle: on board  2 NS are also in 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|brolucius: A test for E-W now, to stay as low as possible.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007: this is also a little high|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT on a combined 19-count does not seem to pass the test.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|flash: the 2@H opener is nominally a std weak 2...   (noted as usually 6 cards)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: though no double no trouble, still 100 a trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'Nothing wrong with my 3NT, partner. If you held 7 points more, we would be OK.'|pg||
nt|lady007: my captain always complains that our junior team keeps bidding 22 or 23 point 3 nts but at least we usually have more points than our opponents|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shen and Shih won the transnational mixed teams in Beijing last Oct., probably with better lucks there.|pg||
nt|flash: most roads seem to lead to down 3?|pg||
nt|lady007: spade switch is gonna be expensive for ew|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..or a diamond.|pg||
nt|lady007: but indeed, most other cards are as well :)|pg||
nt|lady007: even a club seems down 3|pg||
nt|lady007: he just doesnt have more than his 4 clubs and 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|lady007: this might take a while|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade switch kills the extra club winners.|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the other room South passed, West opened 1@h, North 1@s, South 1NT|pg||
nt|flash: the defense can cut him off from his @C tricks (at least temporarily), but then would have to surrender a 6th trick elsewhere|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT on 21 points makes more sense than 3NT on 19.|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's strange to see the same suit being bid by different parties, in a different tempo|pg||
nt|flash: @D lead yielded an overtrick on Board 2 - 1 IMP back|pg||
nt|rhelle: make that suits :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is Muller usually slow?|pg||
nt|rhelle: North now bids 2@d|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|rhelle: Yes, Muller is quite often VERY slow|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, he can think forever on one hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: but he then normally plays the right card|pg||
nt|gracelin: if East wants to balance, he might consider double which will allow West to convert to penalty.|pg||
nt|flash: style points for the @SJ!!!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well it was (almost) worth the wait. He has found the @SJ.|pg||
nt|lady007: but he's not slow like some players who think forever on every card they play|pg||
nt|rhelle: and the @sJ is a great card, imho|pg||
nt|brolucius: Worst is to spend ages finding a totally fatuous switch, which gives the contract.|pg||
nt|flash: mistakes are best made quickly?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: and what is north thinking now ?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rhelle: the defence can now throw either hand in for -3|pg||
nt|flash: now the defense has run out of quick/easy tricks - whatever they play will (eventually) help declarer|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, North is pretty sure his partner has the @hAce|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||

nt|brolucius: And he can endplay either hand, as Rob pointed out earlier.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s2|mc|6|nt|brolucius: Three down vulnerable, which is about what the E-W auction deserved.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller's 2@h opening turned out to be very well timed|pg||
pg||

nt|lml: well I would have opened that 1@C but perhaps they have a very strict point count limit|pg||
nt|lml: how can you devalue that beauty|pg||
nt|daman: to me   I would open a strong @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|daman: he did not open 1@C strong|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: I know some people who play you HAVE to have 16 HCP|pg||
nt|daman: fun hand here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|daman: ew in 3nt, other room|pg||
nt|lml: I dont really love the 1@S overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: maybe it is just me but I dont think you have to overcall every hand with a five card suit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|daman: I would bid 1@S     need to keep the playing field level   I suspect 75% of experts would overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: his hand isn't trash|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dcbutler: i'd guess it's more like 90%|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 1@S can be preemptive|pg||
nt|lml: he obviously agrees with you|pg||
nt|daman: well  90 was my number too but I toned it down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|lml: Hi there|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David   nice to see you again|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hello david|pg||
nt|lml: this could be moving to a problem place for North-SOuth if they are not careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they were not|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|dburn: well, no great harm done - East-West were going to make 2@c|pg||
nt|lml: well no double anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: I thought they might end up in spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: that might not have been fun|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid 2@S with the South hand|pg||
nt|daman: standard bidding|pg||
nt|lml: me too |pg||
nt|dburn: no real reason for South to go back to spades - North is often 4-5 in spades and diamonds for this kind of bidding|pg||
nt|lml: really?|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, no he isn't|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: EW in 3NT in the other room apparently|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: it will not be consistent bidding if EW don'tbid game here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rhelle: North should definitely pass this one - they pas very sound 1NT openings|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|rhelle: although now X is warranted, I guess|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The E-W cards fit well, but hard to imagine them bidding game, with seven losers opposite a single raise.|pg||
nt|lady007: this time game is actually pretty good for ew|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lady007: and the double might backfire as he will now know how to play the diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again East has overbid, but this time there might (possibly) be a happy ending.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 3NT is good ... but ooposite a maximum of 15, not so easy to bid|pg||
nt|gracelin: West knows East has a maximum of 15 HCP by failing to open 1C|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|rhelle: the other table is in 4@h, which has no play|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: unless you find the @dQ of course|pg||
nt|gracelin: They tried a 25 pts slam, a 19 pts 3NT.  So it's inconsistent to miss this 23 HCP 3NT/4H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT is a safer partial than 3@H, which would go down if you misguess the diamonds. |pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h is a fine contract|pg||
nt|lady007: on the diamond finesse, but unlikely to make unless you have extra information|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s7|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|gracelin: like a take-out double by north as here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You would normally play South for the @DQ with that combination.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lady007: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|lady007: as you need north to have exactly Qxx|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Because you can pick up @DQ-x-x-x, but the double gives you information that North is not likely to have a doubleton diamond.|pg||

nt|brolucius: It might instead have gone 2@H - Dble - 4@H at the start, with the same effect if North viewed his assets similarly.|pg||

nt|gracelin: And Shen-Shih already considered as one of the best pairs we could provide.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5C was not a mistake exactly, it was bid made under the pressure that North had exerted. West might have held a different hand for his 2@C bid.|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rhelle: don't forget that their NT is effectively 13-15|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is up the weaker end of a 13-15 range.|pg||
nt|rhelle: exactly - and he has a decent 5-card suit as source of tricks|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, this is a pass in my book|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are always more excuses for overbidding than for underbidding, I have found.|pg||
