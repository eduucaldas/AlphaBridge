nt|marlowepi: E seems to have conducted an auction of doubtful consistency. presumably 2S was not forcing, and all W did was compete to 3S. E already knew her pd had 3 spades, so by bidding 4S ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she seems to be saying her 2S bid was a mistake. of course, these comments assume that W could have doubled 3H as a game try, which most internationals play i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: are the odds of suit splits different according to vulnerability?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: :)|pg||

nt|chick: can take the @H finesse to get rid of spade loser, so losing 1 club, 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|sharynr: not an easy hand to play, @SA is the entry to @H which could block if covered 1st time led|pg||
nt|chick: maybe 3 diamonds :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: Sprung is asking questions about the 2@d bid, and found the answers are not satisfactory, just called the director|pg||
nt|sharynr: always a bit of a language problem at these events.|pg||
nt|sharynr: Try playing against the Chinese...you have to depend on an interpreter|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: yes, it is mostly a language problem from what I see|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: a French-speaking director was called|pg||
nt|sharynr: very handy if you have directors with several language capabilities|pg||
nt|afulton: from what i see on their convention card, 2@d is simply a natural bid, nf by passed hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: I am not really sure what info can be helpful to Jo at this point anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: Sprung is claiming that the bottom of the range is not clear, and she is entitled to know it|pg||
nt|sharynr: The French usually play very natural systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: while Hugon says it's natural by a passed hand, could be zero if she feels like it; Sprung did not accept this|pg||

nt|vugraphzwc: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: well she knows she doesnt want to lose a trick to north and she has dummy entries|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding 14 HCP, it is certainly possible to lead an honor in spades. when would it lose, i.e. when the hand can be beat?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes now with @dJ entry she may still if South has Qxx|pg||
nt|lml: she wont finesse|pg||
nt|lml: his hand is done... a plus position for USA although likely duplicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N almost marked with club queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depending on NS tendencies as to opening 1N with 5 spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Opening 1@s in third seat then not leading one makes it suspect - could be 4333|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no when N did not raise at these colors|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead seems the best chance for the defense I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: but north would not support in 2@S with 4?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and even S, that only strengthens the point about no 1N opener|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even so|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club 3 has a faint chance, but the auction has been too revealing|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes probably with 4 trumps and a singleton North would raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or with 3 trumps and an ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also the fact that S won D ace on first round is very suspicious. looks like S wants E to have hand entries|pg||
nt|lml: France won another 4imps on the previous board|pg||
nt|lml: 2well on board 22|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  North wishing she had doubled|pg||
nt|lml: 6@H is not a bad contract|pg||
nt|lml: except it doesnt make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: that is but a minor defect:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: 5 makes, though, and that may be the final contract|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nigel_k:  They should program the computer to redeal if it comes up with a slam on a finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what about a game on a finesse?|pg||
nt|lml: in a moment we might see a swing for USA 2 as they play the 3NT board which liekly will make|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Game on a finesse is ok but too many undeserved swings when it's a slam|pg||
mb|4N!|an|not BW, stopper in !S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: excellent call|pg||
nt|lml: 4NT choice of games or something else?|pg||
nt|lml: Blackwood?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: quinn did not ask for the info|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if i bid it it would be RKCB. why not?|pg||
nt|lml: just that she alerted|pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: yes i saw, all i meant was why not play it that way|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If I bid it with three card support for partner's 7 card suit it would be RKCB|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like not keycard|pg||
nt|lml: a bit of a slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: stopper? as in control cue?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: gaviard saying that she might be wrong about it|pg||
nt|lml: if Allouche has good hearts as she figurs to have then 6@H should have a play|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: a finesse is a bit more likely to work then not|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4N was obviously KC|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: dovidio thought it showed 2 KC|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzwc: it seems so...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It was a rather slow 6@h if it did show 2 KC|pg||
nt|lml: if you check the alert it says it wasnt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would have made no sense for N to cuebid, as she has controls in all suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: the alert was the info i collect from gaviard|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: i hv no info for the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|lml: I think she might have been making a slam try but if she was and partner said no why would she go|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  Anyway the final contract is ok, apart from the obvious flaw|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it also would make zero sense for N to control bid 4S and then bid a slam when S said no. so 4N was clearly KC|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: got info that 5@H might deny @C and @D cue, so must had AK|pg||
nt|lml: North and SOuth may not have been on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|lml: if they arent they need to get it togehter|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Surprising how often experts have accidents with Blackwood |pg||
nt|lml: this is too important a situation to confuse|pg||
