mb|1D|nt|lml: I am not sure if I would open the South hand if I had to open 1@D|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: the second 3 card suit gets bid by South|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure I would bother in first two seats anyway|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose this is because they are playing a strong @C system?|pg||
nt|lml: I understand that 1@C is strong but then pass by SOuth is an option|pg||
nt|garnetts: My guess is that 1NT is the right bid nowe heart stop or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|chick: what's wrong with 2@C?|pg||
nt|lml: its all Meckwell's fault|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 1@S is not my idea of fun--especially since partner has a likely four|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: I think 2@C is the right call over the neg double but I don't play what they play|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard for East to find a @D but what do I know|pg||
nt|lml: obviously not much ... lol|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: Stewart DBL was not negative -- it showed 4+@S|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose South bid 3NT because he was maximum :)|pg||
nt|chick: @Ds was the only suit not bid naturally or shown by NS.  |pg||
nt|lml: I still like bidding 2@C myself rather than raising on 3 but others may disagree|pg||

nt|garnetts: If I open this filth I rebid 1NT |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|lml: good club guess|pg||
nt|lml: I think he can make it now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|nt|garnetts: Not that hard because of the failure to  collect a raise likely partner has something in hearts|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: 1@D then 2@C shows @C & @D  5/4 either way  except for rare instances where 1=4=3=5  but after the interference that shape probably bids NT|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|pc|s3|nt|lml: so what would 2@C show in this auction|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 1@D opening was automatic for this pair - 3N   not so much :)|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ady: routine 3NT for e/w |pg||
nt|ady: no score hand 17 in our room?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: Board 17- 3 h W +1 170|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ady: thx|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: sedemed to go down CR  so more imps for USA|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: what was 4@C here|pg||
nt|murat e: ew have 30 pts between themselves but no biddable suit so going further 3 nt is not a good idea|pg||
nt|pelu: making - so +20 for US now (incl 6 IMPs from board 17) = 20-20|pg||
nt|ady: spec asked  was East's preference to 2@D forcing ?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: I am told 2@D  game forcing    system called xyz|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pelu: @S again from west = 10 tricks : 2@s+2@H+2@d+4@c|pg||
nt|pelu: best return from s = @d10|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: that was not a good return   made life easier   though west can do it himself|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: but West need 11 tricks - 10 tricks = -1 IMP AND 19-11|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: now easy|pg||
mc|10|nt|murat e: thx David and Peter see you sometime on another game and bye for the specs|pg||

nt|lml: well it worked out well for them anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when allowed  EW get to play a very fun system that Ware created called "Crunch"|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: they submitted that CC for the KO round, but it was rejected|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  1@D=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lml: they are allowed to play mosquito I think because I have played against that in the womens|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and mosquito is similar|pg||
nt|lml: most bids show 1 up|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: strange thing - Crunch was rejected by someone from New Zealand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: 30 HCP but no fit|pg||

pc|h7|nt|garnetts: good lead but curtains after North choose the desperate option|pg||
nt|lml: the SBF site has this match as a tie after 15 boards so this is the decider|pg||
