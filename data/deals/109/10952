nt|ahollan1: i believe all of the EW passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: anyone bid more than 2@H?|pg||
nt|sharynr: opposite a takeout double? where partner should be short in @D?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   then one window per table lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you can handle|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont try that without a mac  :-)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharynr: and 2@H will prob make as well, so Germany may start with a partscore swing|pg||
nt|cindy:  lynn will be kicking herself over the @d lead|pg||

nt|lml: not so much.  If her partner has the king its okay to discard and if she doesnt its ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: creating the illusion of holdings can often be as important as holding the right cards|pg||
nt|lml: if she ruffs here she is ruffing her winner|pg||
nt|mariner1: well it at least is making her think|pg||
nt|lml: if they showed her north's hand it wouldnt be all that easy|pg||

pc|d4|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

nt|mariner1: EW are in 5@C DBL here in Closed Room|pg||
nt|lml: North south has 3 top losers now but all sorts of handling charges|pg||
nt|lml: North will probably play a spade now.  SHe has to set them up|pg||

nt|cindy:  they wont let her get away with that :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't read anything into delays of bids -- it could be anything from: operator not entering bids until both players on same side of screen bid  b) network hiccup|pg||

nt|daman: failing to get their @D ruff|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c is artificial I know|pg||
nt|joest: in which case: (a) perhaps double should be for takeout|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: Interesting decision to sell out as EW can make a few clubs also|pg||

nt|joest: they bid similarly in the open but east led a diamond|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth bid 4@S over the 3@H transfer -- and made, so 36-0|pg||

pc|d3|nt|pelu: Germany was also in 5@C in Board 4 - but then East X - N moved to 5@D?? - also X - and now 6@C by S - a misunderstanding chanced from 950 (5@C X +1) to 6@C - prob making!|pg||

nt|kareno: For the specs, you see that USA1 is playing USA2 in both series, open and women's and the reason is so that no one will be tempted to help a team from the same country late in the ...|pg||
nt|kareno: round robin if, for instance, they are in either very good or very bad position and the other team is on the cusp of qualifying.|pg||

pc|s2|pg||

nt|kareno: The east hand isn't an opening in my opinion ... anyone else have an opinion?|pg||
nt|lml: I would open it with all those quick tricks|pg||
nt|janm: Sutherlin probably thinks the clubs went well for her, but won't be so happy to find that J was stiff|pg||
nt|kareno: I think 3@s will be down one for a three-imp pickup for USA1|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think I am an opener|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: the @S10 is a very bad card to see|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: A's are really undervalued in the 4,3,2,1 point count, so having 2 of them, and the king with one makes it stronger than it looks - of course, there aren't any slow tricks, but...|pg||
nt|kareno: spade back is good!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: That's a ten-loser hand :)|pg||
nt|lml: West knows she is in trouble but I think she is about to find out how much|pg||
pc|d6|nt|janm: I think she has now found out - Levitina wasn't thinking that long about which little spade to play :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: hard to imagine you will win  7 imps on the previous board by bidding a normal 3@S|pg||
nt|janm: And Sutherlin has to have a pretty good idea that the diamond is off too now, from the diamond pitch|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: It's the failure of west to do the same that wins it for you - was 3@s made then?  I thought it would be down one for 3 IMPs|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3@S did make|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: on last board|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but remember to REFRESH window for upates|pg||
nt|joest: in the open room, the German east opened 1@c and is about to play it there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  1@C=unbal 16+ or BAL 17+ [not 20-21 bal]|pg||
nt|joest: Deas and Palmer play a strong club so that won't be happening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Beth try 2N?   I doubt it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't completely discount @HK   and then too strong for offshape action|pg||
nt|joest: strong 4441 hands are very hard to describe in most system|pg||
nt|joest: The old Roman 2@d tried to deal with it but nobody I know plays that any more|pg||
nt|joest: in fact I'm dating myself by even mentioning it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I know NS have some special rebids to handle the strong 3-suiters, not sure about EW|pg||
nt|joest: maybe the players are taking a break here|pg||
nt|sastro: so - I am nobody. I play them in my multi. Just because there is no other way.....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Marshall Miles kept Roman 2@D alive for a while - not sure if it is still in play though|pg||
nt|chick: actually, I do, and I love it ... 2D is not much use for anything else where you can't play multi|pg||
nt|joest: for those few you play strong variations off of Multi, there are methods to show it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: actually they play board 23|pg||
nt|joest: who play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't think ACBL allows any strong option to 2@D Multi|pg||

nt|joest: they don't?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: I often open 1N with 6322, but not when the 22 are the majors.|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT? - 15 HCP - but open in both majors - not my bid :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- could be void|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona: could well be effective though...|pg||
nt|sharynr: she will run to 2@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "utility"  1 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 1@S=4+ or 5+|pg||
nt|sybarra: in estonia (from earlier today) they called it "beach 1 @D" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15 years ago everybody used 1x-(1@H)-DBL to show EXACTLY 4@S  -  but now you just can't tell |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- why "beach"?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue |pg||
nt|sybarra: was just the name of it in the system |pg||
nt|sybarra: from what I could tell |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharynr: assuming Pass from N|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: with major games on NS|pg||
nt|sharynr: now 2@S - p - 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: just thru it in as "amusing info" |pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or "interesting info"   |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another area where we must guess -- did Deas DBL show 3@S or just @S honor [for lead against NT]|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Knowing the tap is coming I'd assume it showed some length for the 4@s bid.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharynr: oh well|pg||
nt|ziff: Della Monta relieved.... She does not have to table the dummy, vulnerable|pg||
nt|sharynr: I would expect even a better hand for DBL and bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but not found, so Easts 1NT a successful gambit|pg||
nt|sharynr: indeed|pg||
nt|sastro: she cant see the Singleton in clubs- North should bid 4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: in fact 12 tricks on...|pg||
nt|ziff: Sabine Auken made 6@CX on a @S lead by giving up a @D, 14 IMPs to Germany|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a line for down 2 and a push?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: ...so I count the 1N oppener as a "coup"|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: don't have too much faith in Easts NT bids|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: once or twice, I suppose|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: 8 cards to go|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: A@D and claim|pg||
nt|chick: she heard you, Jack :)|pg||
nt|joest: I gave her a wire.  Anything to get to board 24 :)|pg||
nt|sastro: we are still following. Spade finesse and @D continuation gives her 9 Tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: operator back see you :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D beyond normal responses shows the 65 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: anyone for 3N?|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3@D or 3NT?|pg||
nt|ziff: 6@D would actually make here, but it is a bad contract|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe 6 diamonds, but 3NT akso likely|pg||
nt|sastro: 4 Dia|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  checking to see if Beth had 5 @hs   good plan|pg||
nt|santyclz: In other words, simple, natural bidding.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|wilkinsona: persumably the 2 hearts GF|pg||
nt|sharynr: will be tough to get to 3NT now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but tricky for west...|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3@H maybe will impart the desire to hear 3NT?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west seems to have already given a full description|pg||
nt|sharynr: but did not promise hearts....just a game force|pg||
nt|pelu: diff bid for West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose slam in the picture opposite some MAX with more normal shape too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ziff: Minimum, but excellent controls|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cindy:  if W has 5 @hs slam is definintely in the picture|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they can both tell its not "normal" shape |pg||
nt|santyclz: Or 3136 for that matter.|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes  that too|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|pelu: alerted as cue bid - but some would play 3@S for 2-1-5-5 with Hx in S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats great understanding, I would never like to risk that 3 spade bid|pg||
nt|chick: or even 3055|pg||
nt|sharynr: well if pard bids 4@S you correct to 5@D anyway|pg||
nt|sharynr: but I prefer 3@H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ziff: Well, if 3@S is cue, so probably is 3@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: Dirk's 4@D perhaps is not as bad as it sounds, cause it would describe the shape and good trumps at once|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now ruffing finesse in @C?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ziff: I do not understand 3NT after the cue. If she does not want to make a slam try, why 3@D?|pg||

nt|chick: perhaps the cue in E's primary suit didn't thrill her|pg||
nt|chick: most likely shortness|pg||
nt|sharynr: i think a mild try is enough with the east hand.. several wasted hcp anyway|pg||

nt|sharynr: although pretty bad suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in college we called them TOONs    Tricks Out Of Nowhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff: East holds a fantastic hand.... for Gin Rummy|pg||
nt|sharynr: with so little hcp, the chances of 2@C getting passed out (no balance, etc) is very small|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if EW were Balicki-Zmudzinski  they would have claimed FOR DECLARER 4 tricks ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: if you are going to bid 4 hearts anyway, 3 clubs should be ok|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: so a multi type auction from NS|pg||
nt|ziff: Can she avoid slam now?|pg||

nt|ziff: That was not the question :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: J10|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|kareno: I imagine 2nt denies club fit|pg||

nt|lml: but the players cant tell that |pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I think 4@s would have made, so Mancuso has done right to save, even if she might have been bidding to make :)|pg||

nt|janm: the benefits of opening your 5 card Major|pg||

nt|janm: bid to make a slam try - by passing, saying "please DBL" you have more certainty that partner will DBL and not cut across your intention to bid over the DBL|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: I think I would rather pass than bid 5@S here........ I think S pass was encouraging|pg||

nt|chick: and with only 1@S overcall, E cannot expect N to be spadeless |pg||
pc|s9|nt|joest: of course the next two pitches will not be much fun for north|pg||
nt|daman: can afford one @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: German EW playing standard -- i think 2N raise pretty normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 4 is suit preference for the minors maybe?|pg||
nt|joest: god bless your partner if she is watching the spots that closely :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|sastro: yes - they play reversed Laventhal|pg||
nt|daman: I thought so|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confirming everybody's hand evaluation - except Beth Palmer - KNR says West hand worth 14.30|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: the Germans have defended this very well, making it as tough on Deas as possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there difference between @H7 and @Dx pitch now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so - i don't see it|pg||
nt|daman: not much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Lynn probably thinking more about upcoming pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|joest: if you keep a diamond you maintain a diamond position once Sabine piches the ten of diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: as long as you pitch the nine from cummy|pg||
nt|joest: dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharynr: so you think she will take her 7 tricks and go home?|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||
nt|joest: the infamous guard squeeze|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and rare|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sastro: Hmmm|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharynr: spade pitch might be a clue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so cashes a few diamonds to avoid goig too many off|pg||
nt|chick: yes, down 2 is only 100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a guess ---  Palmer did NOT 'upgrade' because Deas is Passed Hand|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sigh|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|janm: Deas & Palmer are pretty aggressive, but both of them would have to push to get to game on the last board|pg||
nt|mariner1: certainly a reasonable game to try|pg||
mb|2N|an|!d|nt|mariner1: I too want to play 3@D here|pg||
nt|janm: 2NT transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|no enthusiasm|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: And 3@c presumably shows a non-accept by North|pg||
nt|lml: the only problem is that 3@D can go down|pg||
nt|mariner1: some do play 3@C as preaccept and Kxx might be good enough.......|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: the problem with this approach is that the weak hand is playing it|pg||
nt|mariner1: S being a passed hand might change the methods for some|pg||
nt|lml: may not matter on this hand|pg||
nt|janm: Kxx might be good, but the rest of the hand is pretty bad - if partner was inviting in NT, you certainly want to reject|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: exactly right Sharyn, an inference she should have made|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this match would be interesting scored at BAM  [board-a-match]|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: since I obviously don't know where I am, I shold!|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: think East was misled by the overcall|pg||
nt|joest: should|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that 1N=14-16 from North|pg||
nt|daman: undo|pg||
nt|joest: hold on|pg||
nt|sastro: he can not afford the 9 of @H|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT by North|pg||
nt|joest: can we make this a 1NT opener by north?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharynr: interesting inverted raise in comp?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT making, but 5@c looks like a fine contract (acc making 12 tricks)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: very friendly lie of the cards for EW here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice 5422 no deterent to 1N opener|pg||
nt|joest: in fairness to Lynn that last hand was much easier to play from 'up here' than 'down there'|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely transfer here |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 13-17 is a big range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't seem that easy from here either|pg||
nt|chick: as long as the 22 isn't both majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought Auken only options over 2@C were 2@D and 2@H :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe redo means my notes are still valid!|pg||
nt|joest: so what do the rebids mean?|pg||
nt|sastro: they play puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|joest: that wouldn't rule out a 2@s rebid I wouldn't think|pg||
nt|joest: operator, can you give us a hint what's going on here?  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no - i think 2@C asks ONLY for 4@H|pg||
nt|joest: I bet you can guess what my next question will be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this 1N = great 14 - 17|pg||
mb|3C|nt|joest: that hand begs to be opened 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|sharynr: really big|pg||
nt|joest: not many people turn down vul invites at imps; probably many more should, including yours truly|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: opposite 14-16 only a raise|pg||
nt|joest: eventually the red pocket will seduce her into 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@C asked specifically for 4@H - but did not promise 4M|pg||
nt|joest: although something in the red suits rates to be wasted in all honesty|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 10 out af 14 tables in 3NT in VC|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ... and a possible 12 tricks on this lead it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: surprise|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: 3 @C likely the relay, with honor 3rd or better in @D   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe without punctuation that can be taken 2 ways|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS convention card says   15-17 or "great 14"|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharynr: a @H lead would be scarier for declarer, would she duck twice and hope spade Ace with south?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we be playing in 3 @d?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cindy:  lets guess what the real contract is|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|sharynr: or just club king onside with 5 @D tricks....choices|pg||
nt|pelu: in BB 10 in 3NT - 2 in 5@c - and 5 in partscore|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i thought auction was supposed to go  1N-2@C;2@D [not 4@H]-2@H [to play]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless von Arnim treated her hand as INV|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D [weak 2@H/@S]|pg||
nt|sybarra: or fondly known as multi |pg||
nt|santyclz: The ACBL's favorite convention.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: now the last hand Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 16+ 1@C|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: yeah right....not permitted mostly |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: "Movie" says last hand was 2@h down 2|pg||
nt|joest: I'd be curious their system.  It's a fantastic system (I've been following their Bridge World matches) but surprised they don't find the spade fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = bid your major    [4@C would be Transfer to you major]|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4@D= bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: Al has it |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharynr: 1@S all pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 1@D is NAT, South did have available   2@H=4-7 HCP, 6+@H  |pg||
nt|joest: anyway this is the final hand right?  am I right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but soap & water will clear it up right away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy:  and the difference betwee 4@c and 4@d would be ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Declarer urge.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @c says transfer to your suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: responder can choose who becomes declarer|pg||

nt|ahollan1: like Charlie on the MTA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well that's just wrong on so many levels :)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|joest: Van Arnim endplayed here.  Don't know if the values shown are high enough that this is a GF.  She might just bid 4@h and take her chances.   There is always a 'natural' 4@c I ...|pg||
nt|joest: suppose|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there may be a reason (like protecting a holding) that responder wants to be declarer|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: looks as though south passed an enquiry|pg||
