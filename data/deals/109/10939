nt|athene: or good afternoon or whatever :)|pg||
nt|athene: NS play fairly standard (strong NT, five-card majors)|pg||

nt|athene: weak NT, 4-card majors|pg||
nt|athene: and just to keep up the contrast, NS play upside down carding and EW play standard|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Yes, I would think so|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jallerton: 2NT = any 2 suits|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: 3@C pulled to 3@D now west has shown reds|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|athene: now west should, technically, perhaps redouble rather than bid 3@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: most operators wait until both players on same side of screen have bid before entering calls|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: the other side of the coin is, you can try bidding dubious slams and grands "knowing" they will sac|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is probably some sort of game-try for one or other major|pg||
nt|athene: a simple 3@S would be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|jallerton: although it is unusual for the pre-emptor to bid again, so relying on it is dangerous|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@C = invite game in @H, 3@D = invite in spades|pg||
nt|athene: on the general principle of linking the lower minor to the lower major|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = "any strength"|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: inviting after a 2-suited overcall can be difficult; that's why some pairs prefer to restrict the bid to "weak or strong" hands|pg||

nt|bbramley: 3NT should make, but why play there?  however, if N bids again S may get them too high|pg||
