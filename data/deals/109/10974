mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|joest: i could see east-west getting out of their depth here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H is apparently an unspecified four card major|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@H was probably either major (many pair play that way)|pg||
nt|cicus: and 2@S a relay|pg||
nt|cicus: W should have a good picture of the E hand by now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam may still be possible|pg||
nt|cicus: with all that duplication of values, slam is not all that bad|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|joest: I believe 2@h showed some four card major, after that you've got me|pg||
nt|joest: but this feels like RKCB for hearts|pg||
nt|joest: Bulgarians stormed into the slam at the other table though|pg||
nt|cicus: I hope E is aware that @Hs are trumps|pg||
nt|joest: Stewart: "What is my response with two key cards, no queen of trumps and avoid?" :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if all responses are shifted down, does that mean 5@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||

pc|c3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|cicus: bad @H distribution makes this hopeless if S switches to a trump now|pg||
nt|joest: I think Danailov is on Woolsey's side of the screen so he might be aware of the mixup|pg||
nt|cicus: a triumph for Bulgarian slam bidding methods|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is a triumph for not using any form of low level blackwood|pg||
nt|cicus: or maybe setting trumps early has its merit|pg||
nt|joest: a lot depends on what 3@d meant.  I logical guess is "hearts and a max" where 2NT and 3C would have been the minimum calls|pg||
nt|cicus: I must think 3@H would not have been forcing by W|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|joest: so then what would 4@s be?  At attempt to play?  Why didn't partner bid it earlier?  Then again why did partner not set hearts with 3@h?  I think we'd have to ask them these ...|pg||
nt|joest: questions|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s2|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: problem was he did not know the major when he relayed with 2@S, so might make the bid without game values|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|cicus: I play a similar system in which 2@S creates a game force|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|joest: we're guessing. If 3@d showed extras, I would think new suits would be forcing (or suit agreement)|pg||
nt|joest: let's put it this way|pg||

nt|jerry72: thanks to all volunteers really! even this is not 100% quality, we are satisfied to watch bermuda bowl realtime from the other end of the world....|pg||
nt|star6ija: sorry operator, it was not personnaly against you, this is second day and still the same... connections of course should be tested few days earlier|pg||
