mb|p|mb|1D|mb|3S|nt|nicksan: Possible to make 13 tricks in either minor here...but only 11 if you misguess diamonds...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I wonder how many diamonds 1@D shows|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 0+|pg||
nt|nicksan: Actually, only 12 are available in diamonds...sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4405 is opened 1@D within the 11-15 range|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Which makes it difficult for North to evaluate his hand...|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|d|nt|nicksan: Suppose you will often pick up the diamonds after the preempt. |pg||
mb|6C|mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|nicksan: wow!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very impressive - South unerringly picks the right slam and West saves|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Last resault: http://www.bridge.ee/KV/kvpaar.htm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nicksan: -500 could be good for some IMP's even if other table doesn't bid slam...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: The best saves against a slam cost less than opponents' game|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|lml: just a joke|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think South should pass for now over 2@D... |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jcwla: Multi here, a rare case where W is 100% sure of suit.|pg||
nt|lml: and he did|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: A violation of the 8-card-suit rule here.  S will double for takeout.|pg||
nt|lml: West is going to keep his 7 spades to himself and play on the 6-2|pg||
nt|lml: sorry 8 spades|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|lml: I would have bid 4@S in the first place|pg||
nt|lml: this is just a silly auction... hearts are okay but maybe spades but then if you don't like them?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and North is superwimp|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: now will north bid?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: NOrth is playing with different cards then I am|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzvj: it looked like E was not sure what the bidding was, probably N wanted to let him struggle|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: This hand has play for slam and S has no clue what is in N's hand.|pg||

pc|d7|pc|h7|pc|d6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: Yup -- though the OR N/S deserve a better fate.  They bid the @C slam.  At least W in the OR did not violate the 8-card-suit rule.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s4|pc|h6|pg||
mc|7|nt|lml: well the West hand is why you play that 4@H and 4@S over multi are natural|pg||

nt|nicksan: I'm with you there Liz...|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Like  J109   AKxxx   earlier today. Sester was in slam and had to play that suit for no loser|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Inspired :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: I can't do those things even looking at all the hands...|pg||

mb|2C|an|Majors|mb|p|nt|lml: 2@C is majors?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|lml: a strange choice.  Yes he has clubs but he has Majors too|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|lml: I suppose he gets both suits in this way?!|pg||

nt|lml: 5@D is best not 3NT|pg||
