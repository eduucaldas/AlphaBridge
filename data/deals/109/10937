mb|p|mb|6C|nt|jbgood: 3 @d here / no listed scores as yet for CR|pg||
nt|finch: EW can make 13 tricks, but 12 looks a good target|pg||
mb|6S|nt|finch: It must be tempting to bid again as North. Certainly that's happened at a few other tables|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: East's pass is forcing, and tends to imply first round spade control|pg||

nt|finch: 7@C is playable - and better than it might be if you think North has a phenomenal number of spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 7 NT if needed|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|finch: on this auction you know North just has lots and lots of spades, with a two-suiter he might well bid his second suit|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|finch: The Norwegians are known not to be shy in the auction, and this will get them to 3NT I assume|pg||
nt|finch: 5@C is fractionally better, as a non-heart lead gives you a chance with clubs 3-0 but diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that Guadeloupe did not show. Score is  0-0  against Italy after  0  boards|pg||
nt|finch: while 3NT needs a non-spade lead and hearts 4-4 if clubs don't break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=782&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|rayhaa: after 3@h it looks like rdbl imply @c support|pg||
nt|finch: South may well be thinking about 5@C as he has a very suity hand with aces rather than soft cards|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: 2NT would have been invitational+ with clubs, redouble was any 10+ hand.|pg||

nt|finch: both side aces, that is|pg||
nt|ybob: if J @D lead win too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: has to duck twice - then di shift sinks it|pg||
nt|finch: With the spade pips as they are, declarer can play low on the lead which blocks the suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|finch: Easy to see double dummy. If you trust declarer to have his bidding, do you know that partner has no entry|pg||
nt|finch: ...and hence continuing spades can't gain|pg||

nt|jbgood: sp 8 indicated a not so good suit i think|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

pc|s5|nt|granguru: mistaken|pg||

nt|MolvaM: no harm in finessing|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and not much damage in imps if he doesnt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thinking to block @sQxx with north?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer is afraid of the club finesse of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: possibly declarer has fielders choice|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: it seems we are miles ahead of the open room . . . i guess normal when chagas is playing|pg||
