nt|tomi2: 2@D is a relay asking how many spades E has and how strong he is|pg||
nt|tomi2: promising at least 3 spades and GF values|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: oh Polish style?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S would have been the response without the double|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: looks like a @S lead is the only one to defeat 6@Hs|pg||
