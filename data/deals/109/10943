mb|2S|nt|chick: they won't find 7 with that trump suit|pg||

nt|chick: how many spades to bid?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: reckon on a sac by north maybe|pg||
nt|sharynr: 8|pg||

nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4-9 HCP, 5+@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now the good hands try to find bids|pg||
nt|joest: Auken has to make some game try I would think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator usually will not show bids until both players on same side of screen have bid|pg||
nt|joest: just because partner is at favorable doesn't rule out a game!|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Jack :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we won't know if delay is Auken or Palmer|pg||
nt|joest: hi there|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: but during the play of hand   delays = Beth Palmer :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sastro: now 5 Spades|pg||
nt|sharynr: will west hang partner?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west may raise|pg||
nt|chick: 6@C works too, even 7|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would definitely bid 6|pg||
nt|ziff: Della Monta holds a monster for a passed hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: absolutelt|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and singleton in opps suit, sure|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharynr: y|pg||

nt|chick: now 6@Ss?|pg||
nt|ziff: In front of partner?|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant exp that pd will bid 6@S - so N has to make the desission|pg||
nt|sastro: 6 Spades gives the chance for a forcing pass- so they may rich 7|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: double must show some spade support Iguess !|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: tough decision in a big match...|pg||
nt|ziff: true|pg||
nt|joest: I don't think you can afford to pass Lynn's hand second seat, but I can't see bidding 4@s out of fright|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|sharynr: so another potential pick up either way|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|joest: USAI and Germany both winners last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs use updside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|sastro: by consequent Dia- continuation West will loose control|pg||
nt|joest: that is even if she would work out to spear a stiff spade honor offside|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: ...so perhaps the 4 spade starter not enough...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|sharynr: in 3rd seat, perhaps not|pg||

nt|sharynr: and then?|pg||
nt|ziff: I expect her to make 6 after choosing the safety play in @Hs|pg||
nt|sastro: 7 makes on a Hart-Dia -Squeeze|pg||

nt|joest: At the other table, facing a 1@c opener at her right, Kerri Sanborn bid 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but very understandable choice|pg||

nt|ziff: don't trust her NT openers, either :)|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 5 Sweden will score - the 2@S hand (140) Auken-von Arnim are on 5-level??|pg||
nt|joest: what happened to board 22?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact  ACBL doesn't always allow 2@D when just weak 2@H/@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: herve speaking|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: operatora ask me to come |pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: i dont know if they miss a board or something|pg||
nt|sastro: aha - than you have to argue in the ACBL :)|pg||
nt|daman: looks like they missed Board 22|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 8 cards to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 7|pg||
nt|chick: ACBL allows multi, including the strong NT option, but only in events that allow Midchart or higher conventions|pg||
nt|daman: mayve they have a bad conn and have to reboot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argue with ACBL -- probably one of the most futile concepts known to man|pg||
nt|joest: I do not pretend to be an expert on ACBL legalese.  Once upon a time but not now|pg||
nt|daman: board 23 looks like it may go the same direction as Board 22 :)   very slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: ok|pg||
nt|joest: board 22 went into the ether!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: they play 3nt =3 on this one|pg||

pc|h4|mc|12|nt|daman: nicely played|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: of course they forgot to play 22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good bidding too :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: they now play 22 but....|pg||
nt|joest: id be curious how she made six|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: and that s funny thing|pg||
nt|daman: with great skill|pg||
nt|joest: b/c she's taking a risk playing clubs after a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: because of security feature i cant go back :( booooooooooo|pg||
nt|daman: just tell us the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: so i will update score of 22 and play will resume at 24 :)|pg||
nt|joest: fine|pg||
nt|joest: thx TAmara|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: its herve but tamara is not ver far from me :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: they are playing 3 NT by east on 22|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 5@D lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 6@D sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: declarer in the tank since lead|pg||
nt|joest: Herve, which board are they on in this room?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Bermuda bowl   Italy, USA1 and USA2 all behind in their matches|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: they actually play 22 now but they played 23 before|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: but i cant go back so we have to wait board 22 to resume normally at 24|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Daily Bulletin listed which teams would be on vugraph today -- let's hope they continue that throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: ok q@d...10@C to 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/SaoPaulo.09/Bulletins.htm|pg||

nt|joest: East: @SAQxx @HK @DAJ10x @CAQJx|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Arnim in the tank|pg||
nt|joest: diamond won by the queen in dummy and the ten of clubs passed to the king|pg||
nt|joest: right?|pg||
nt|joest: "Chat Vugraph" is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: she returned @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: no 10@C was ducked|pg||
nt|joest: and then club continued?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes to the king|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: A@H then 5@H|pg||
nt|daman: Guadaloupe up 34-12 vs USA1 in BB|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: chat VG is 1000% missclick proof|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: and unfortunately it will be longest board of Venice cup|pg||
nt|daman: New Zealand up 34-11 vs Italy in BB|pg||
nt|joest: well there is a winning line from this point by rising @Hq and hooking the spade but I suspect not many are following the play :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Q@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: spade discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: spade to Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: A@D and claim|pg||
nt|chick: she heard you, Jack :)|pg||
nt|joest: I gave her a wire.  Anything to get to board 24 :)|pg||
nt|sastro: we are still following. Spade finesse and @D continuation gives her 9 Tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: interesting pass by Deas|pg||
nt|joest: many would chance double, correcting 2@d to 2@s although that could work out poorly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|ziff: 3@C if playing Precision :)|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm, pretty unilateral on W's part|pg||
nt|joest: she's a passed hand so a direct 2@s was possible|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: clubs are dead, it seems..|pg||
nt|sharynr: well if not looking for club contract i guess 4@H will do|pg||
nt|sharynr: although pretty bad suit|pg||
nt|pelu: u have 4 loser-hand, so even in natural system 3@c is my bid|pg||
nt|ziff: At least it avoids the crux of how many @Cs to bid....|pg||
nt|sharynr: best lead for a tap|pg||
nt|chick: not exactly a good reason for not bidding them :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|daman: thats what they did in the OR|pg||
nt|joest: but since both 2@s and 2@c could be going down, pass looks like a winner|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wilkinsona: a slight rearrangement of the defensive values would make that 4 hearts a bad bid|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|chick: but 2@C would not be forcing over 1N, so I think 3@C is essential|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ziff: East holds a fantastic hand.... for Gin Rummy|pg||
nt|sharynr: with so little hcp, the chances of 2@C getting passed out (no balance, etc) is very small|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if EW were Balicki-Zmudzinski  they would have claimed FOR DECLARER 4 tricks ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: if you are going to bid 4 hearts anyway, 3 clubs should be ok|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharynr: I am sure SOuth is NOT expecting the "correct" :)|pg||
nt|chick: bet N didn't expect that :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so a multi type auction from NS|pg||
nt|ziff: Can she avoid slam now?|pg||
nt|sharynr: interesting. now North knows South is willing to play 4@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: how does she porceed to show the hearts+ big hand?|pg||

nt|ziff: 6@H :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...happens so rarely|pg||
nt|sharynr: and give up on 7?|pg||
nt|ziff: That was not the question :)|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose 4N is an option, if ace-asking|pg||
nt|pelu: when opp pass with out problem, then u sh be careful - the multi has 2 strong : 1) GF with @D and strong NT|pg||
nt|sharynr: how big is the "big" hand supposed to be?|pg||
nt|sharynr: ah, Peter answered|pg||
nt|ziff: Seems to contain 22 balanced amon the possibilities|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well thats also a fairly weak opening 2... this bid seems reasonable and will get a pass|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: even this contract a bit iffy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|sharynr: 6 does not look to have much play, already getting lucky in diamonds|pg||

nt|ziff: This will be a nervous hand for N, she does not know - as we do - that she cannot go wrong in @D|pg||

nt|joest: Sanborn let 1NT alone in the open|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|joest: getting the club ruff is the story here|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|joest: palmer knows Deas cannot have any outside entry|pg||
nt|joest: if she plays king of diamonds, then a club Auken must guess the spade|pg||

nt|daman: so  well done Sabine|pg||
nt|joest: just kidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: invoking Zia's rule?   if they don't cover - they don't have it|pg||

nt|joest: they will make once in a while but go down often|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: but North could be very weak. so south cannot bid again...and max 24 HCP don't need to push|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: I am told at twenty minute after the hour|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: 50 minutes|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|sharynr: was this a negative free bid auction? making 2@H forcing?|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ziff: It wouldn't even promise 5 @D for me|pg||
nt|chick: nor me|pg||

pc|h6|nt|pelu: close to 3@s for me|pg||
nt|sharynr: but 2@S next choice|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no entry for the spades, but this looks too much|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR East raised 1NT to 2NT  do we agree with that bid?|pg||
nt|joest: ostensibly playing spades Q, then J should show heart strength and help Auken with her pitches|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|pelu: yes 60% - 30% - 10% for 3 - 2 - 1|pg||
nt|ziff: Terrible contract, but it might make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems so....|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes pass @H8|pg||
nt|pelu: down easy om @C-lead - but making - set up @h|pg||
nt|sharynr: declarer may wonder if south actually would bid 1@S with onlg @SAJ and no @HA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: and with only 1@S overcall, E cannot expect N to be spadeless |pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: of course the next two pitches will not be much fun for north|pg||
nt|daman: can afford one @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: German EW playing standard -- i think 2N raise pretty normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 4 is suit preference for the minors maybe?|pg||
nt|joest: god bless your partner if she is watching the spots that closely :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|sastro: yes - they play reversed Laventhal|pg||
nt|daman: I thought so|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: the Germans have defended this very well, making it as tough on Deas as possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there difference between @H7 and @Dx pitch now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so - i don't see it|pg||
nt|daman: not much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Lynn probably thinking more about upcoming pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|joest: if you keep a diamond you maintain a diamond position once Sabine piches the ten of diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: as long as you pitch the nine from cummy|pg||
nt|joest: dummy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharynr: so you think she will take her 7 tricks and go home?|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||
nt|joest: the infamous guard squeeze|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and rare|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sastro: Hmmm|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharynr: spade pitch might be a clue|pg||
