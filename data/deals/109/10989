nt|brolucius: How unfair when the Bulgarians bid so well, after the same start, to reach 4@H.|pg||
nt|ndemirev: why aren't they leading 3rd club? ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: great lead btw, if only he could get to the S hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: South will have signalled his entry with a suit-preference card on the second round of clubs.... if only he had one.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c was surely for @D, hoping for A in N|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: With 5 clubs in his hand and 8 already gone, South will not be expecting a club continuation.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: don't quote me - but sure looks lilke 3@C showed @H|pg||
nt|athene: they might play some sort of transfer advances to overcalls, although not much on the card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another good guess from spec -- substituted cue|pg||
nt|athene: NS generally play upside down carding|pg||
nt|athene: but they play standard at trick 1 when an AK is led|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: just to keep everyone on their toes :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including upside-down suit-pref|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they have tons of notes to define when carding is standard vs upside-down|pg||
nt|athene: declarer must decide whether to go for spade ruff(s) or try to establish diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just wish i could get a peak at the book someday :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or a peek|pg||
nt|athene: the two strategies are really diametrically opposed because if you want to bring in a long suit in dummy, the last thing you want is to get dummy forced|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|athene: he may just play on diamonds, allowing south to ruff, hoping a ruff is from trump length|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: but he is unlucky here, on that score|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: but trump to dummy, diamond ruff high, trump to dummy will solve matters|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: his only real concern was 4-1 trumps in which case it was overwhelmingly likely the diamond ruff would be from the four trumps|pg||

nt|brolucius: Making that 4@S, as well as the 3NT, would have been too much, even for Zia.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I have always favoured 2@D as Michaels, over a possibly-short 1@D, but neither team is doing that here. What's more, they have been dealt massive diamond suits to bid.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|cT|nt|hedyg: i believe this 1 is rather recent|pg||
nt|ndemirev: yes, already in two boards we see the necesity to have 2D natural over precision. I always support natural over prec 1D and over natural 1C. It maybe mostly personal taste though |pg||
nt|brolucius: West ruffs high, with the @C10, as an uppercut. He attempt to drive out a high trump from declarer's hand to promote the value of East's trumps.|pg||
nt|hedyg: they dealt us these hands to show the necessity of natural 2@d bids|pg||
