nt|rhelle: otherwise it's a real bloodbath|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess he has no option but to continue spades even after a discouraging 8|pg||
nt|imp_jan: @SQ|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north might have ten dbl|pg||
nt|rhelle: if he continues @ss and East sees North having 3@ss, there is a strong temptation to finesse in @cs|pg||
nt|lady007: 8 discouraging?|pg||
nt|lady007: and now what? afraid declarer has KT?|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe he should encourage even not holding an honour with like 0 points in the other suits|pg||
nt|rhelle: clearly :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: norwegian fans complain about the 8 - either encouraging 6 or dis ten they say|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 8 is certainly the card that gives partner most problems|pg||
nt|jbgood: playing oldfashioned udca the 8 would show a higher card|pg||
nt|rhelle: from South's perspective, the @cs are running - so giving a trick away is curtains|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lady007: that must be oldfashioned "i like to play the middle card so you have to guess"  udca|pg||
nt|lady007: and surely not the kind of udca boye is playing|pg||
nt|jbgood: so back to my first statement: does he have any options but continuing spades? Yes, he tells me, clubs:)'|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer can take this, and play @ds now|pg||
nt|jbgood: Marion, what you said was to the point:)|pg||
nt|lady007: lol, sorry :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed - I have the feeling that they will discuss this hand later|pg||
nt|lady007: a spec suggests playing the ten of spades|pg||
nt|lady007: that may look very weird|pg||
nt|lady007: but it might be right|pg||
nt|rhelle: especially with a singleton honour in dummy|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i wld have continued with @SQ|pg||
nt|rhelle: as partner is likely to lead from a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|lady007: if declarer has Q9xx (you assume partner led from AK first) then a spade return might cost, but if partner has the 9 himself, he might be able to figure out the suit as east didnt ...|pg||
nt|lady007: introduce a 5crd spade suit|pg||
nt|imp_jan: catering 10-8 dblt|pg||
nt|rhelle: another good point :)|pg||
nt|lady007: but thats not 100% of course as Qxxxx is a suit you might not bid anyway|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well we may expect bauke to think another 10 minutes|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 imps for E if he guesses well|pg||
nt|lady007: i think this hand is very interesting. what about continuing a low heart from brogeland? did he know his partner always has only 5? or was he afraid declarer had Kx and the queen ...|pg||
nt|lady007: of clubs and he would be squeezed and endplayed?|pg||
