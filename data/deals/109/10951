mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 0-3@S, implies minors|pg||
nt|petergill: In the Seniors, apparently Barbados is having a big win over Italy, I am told|pg||
nt|djneill: I would have rebid 1N, hones in on the HCP and the @h9 helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since EW 1@D opener doesn't show real suit - they have a bunch of bids where responder shows BOTH @C & @D|pg||
nt|petergill: Round 2 matches here on BBO should be Italy - New Zealand, Australia - Norway, Bulgaria - Morocco, and in the Women's Germany - USA1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a peaceful 2S or an impossible 4S now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jerry72: definitely not 2 ;) |pg||
nt|jerry72: as far as I know them ;) |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The delay might be writing down the explanation of 1@S, using screens of course - screens across the table are used at all World Championships|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@H must have shown shortage|pg||
nt|djneill: rkc 4@d?.... they will get to the cold slam then|pg||
nt|jerry72: omg ;) |pg||
nt|jerry72: he's genious...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D RKCB in clubs|pg||
nt|djneill: it's wild and woolsey|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure seems like dangerous use of 4@D|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT = 2 and no @CQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe worried about partners dummy play|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@D -1 next pls |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||

nt|djneill: if you are going to overbid, go for the gusto :-)|pg||
nt|petergill: Needed 3 KC to bid 6@C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|odysseus69: i like that lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: 4@H as RKC seems much safer|pg||
nt|petergill: West liked having @HA opposite the known singleton = no wasted values |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: making now|pg||
nt|ybob: necesita jugar chico, ahora gana|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: bigtrain to the rescue --- 4@H as RKC does NOT allow ask trump Q after 4N response|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|flash: while this is playing out...    thnx to Gabriela Marchioni, our operator, for a great job|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our commentators for guiding us through the set|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Australia must have been happy when the club finesse worked at the other table after a low heart lead to the jack - they would not have liked @CK and @SA to be switched, |pg||
nt|flash: 2nd match due to start in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed - well done Gabriela!|pg||

nt|odysseus69: now the test|pg||
nt|ybob: 9 @S niega honor|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: After the heart shortage bid, a spade lead might have been slightly better, in case South had @SAQJ. |pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1C-2H - is this too strong for that?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|flash: check the tournament web site for the Daily Bulletins - they're quite well done and worth reading|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Thanks Gabriella, and good night to any Australian night owls out there - it's 2-10am here in Sydney - none of us can bear to go to bed with this result happening|pg||
nt|flash: we'll be broadcasting for a solid 2 weeks - this is a true marathon|pg||
nt|jerry72: it means smth else...|pg||
nt|Rafa: 19:23 ahora en Sao Paulo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S = clubs = normal in Austraiia|pg||
nt|jerry72: it means (4441) shape as long as I remember....|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S hechos para terminar|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: good negative|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: 3@C = non-super-accept, 2NT being the super-accept = normal in Australia, but not necessarily normal everywhere|pg||
nt|petergill: Woolsey's bold Dbl has hit the jackpot, assuming East passes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they stop here?|pg||
nt|jerry72: why not|pg||
nt|jerry72: we saw Danailov last board|pg||
nt|jerry72: let's see the other one now...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C now?|pg||
nt|jerry72: 3c/h is still OK may be...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|flash: and doesn't lead the @CK?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: another DBL that could work out poorly - but nice lead|pg||
nt|flash: as a matter of fact, only that suit keeps down 1 alive|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT is not clearcut - I would have opened 1@S, and I open a lot of 5332's 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead|pg||
nt|flash: again, even though Woolsey's X was take-out, this is far too close for comfort|pg||
nt|daman: this could be a big swing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pass now?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|jerry72: right sided at least....|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I would fancy a double on East- |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|d7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: limited auction and bad breaks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|c7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|flash: 4 @C tricks and 1 @D trick to lose?|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's 1NT is 15-18, ref their CC at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/bermudabowl/australia/brightling-thomson.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just to digress -- KNR thinks Thomson hand way too good for 1N|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|jerry72: but could make it I think...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: but their range is 15-18 so 18.65 not gross underbid|pg||
nt|flash: duck or disaster...|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX is not bad, if there is a trump coup it will be spectacular|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ybob: era +1 con finesse de @S antes del 4º @H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d8|nt|petergill: I think he will duck. North has @SAKQ, @HA, so probably partner has @CA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|flash: and a @D now and no coup|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
