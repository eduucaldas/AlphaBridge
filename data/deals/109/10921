nt|haans: not bidding spades you find 4@S easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are that hand wourth 1@D?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Rodal whatever the present day experts say and do - I still want a disciplined weak 2 bid - 7-10 with 2 honors in the suit|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I agree the range is far too wide in many partnerships|pg||
