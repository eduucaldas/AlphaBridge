mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: 2NT is a jump I'm always scared to make opposite my partner's third seat opener but sometimes there are just no alternatives|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wilkinsona: well bid then, a chance to cancel the excellent EW score from the CR|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: spades seem harmless now|pg||
nt|joest: the very fortunate diamond lie will speed up the play|pg||
nt|joest: although getting to dummy to play a diamond is not so trivial|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: choices, Jack this could take a while|pg||
nt|joest: true and I agree with Linda about the spade|pg||
nt|joest: declarer has at most three.  It can't blow a trick and this likes a time to go passive|pg||
nt|lml: well I wouldnt lead a heart myself|pg||
nt|lml: West is obviously ready for it|pg||
nt|lml: so you have to decide between the pointed suits|pg||
nt|joest: partner cannot possibly have diamond length|pg||
nt|lml: if Fu plays a spade declarer will have his work cut out for him|pg||

nt|lml: I am not sure the overcall got them to the wrong spot but even so it proves nothing|pg||

nt|joest: to me the issue is whether it works over the long haul, not on one hand|pg||

nt|joest: on this hand, I think Zhao could have done a bit better, either with 3@s or 3NT at the end|pg||

nt|joest: is pass a penalty pass?|pg||
nt|lml: it is for me... in my notes|pg||
nt|lml: how does 2@S play|pg||
nt|joest: I have seen good players redouble when they knew they were going down just in case the opponents would have this accident|pg||
nt|lml: better than hearts|pg||
nt|chick: better than 2@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the match could be here|pg||
nt|joest: I can't imagine redouble as being anything other than a bluff, "knowing" that a penalty pass is moments away|pg||
nt|chick: if he wants to run, he could just bid @Ds, chances are excellent that pard has a real diamond suit|pg||

nt|joest: if redouble shows 'doubt' he's out of 2@h that's for sure!|pg||
nt|lml: I see 7 tricks at least in spades|pg||
nt|chick: S has about the maximum for a WJS, perhaps he should just play it X'd|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: there is no need to put your partner under this pressure|pg||
nt|chick: his partner knows his hand, much better than he knows partner's hand|pg||
