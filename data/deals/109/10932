nt|mariner1: 6N makes and 6 @H and 6 @c|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough for West|pg||

nt|jtr: Hey!:)|pg||
nt|xenya: well 7 also makes|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Indeed, laydown|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it can make on the squeeze|pg||
nt|jtr: Or finesse even:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: might make on the lead as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: If West bids they might reach 7|pg||
nt|mariner1: depending on who is playing what|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clear for W to bid 5S|pg||
nt|jtr: Is it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to me|pg||
nt|jtr: Clearly not by the hesitation|pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone else use DBL here as penalty and 4N as takeout?|pg||
nt|jtr: Penaltyish|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|jtr: No real other option as East is there?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has two aces and E probably doesnt have a trump stack. so W has to bid because E is  marked with an offensive hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Except for us observers of course:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jtr: Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: But maybe.........|pg||
nt|jtr: 6@s commeth?|pg||
nt|xenya: that might push EW to 7|pg||
nt|mariner1: one team saved in 6 @S so far|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is a PASSED HAND, and yet E has asked him to contribute. W couldnt be stronger|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, shouldnt West thonk of 7 after partner's pass?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: think|pg||
nt|mariner1: Drijver and Brink - Netherlands in 6@S X down 800|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: yes,sure|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: i think W had every reason to bid 7 over partner's forcing pass|pg||
nt|jtr: I think he had a bigger problem over 6@s than over 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how much better hand could W have???|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: after all he could have x xxxx xxxx xxxx, doesn t he?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: no not after 4N he couldnt|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: I think he would pass 4@sx with that|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact E was perhaps understrength for 6C then forcing pass, and still you belong in 7, so that shows how close to clear it is for W to bid on|pg||

nt|jtr: Yes, East opened 1NT|pg||

nt|mariner1: I agree N had to be more aggressive|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: well, he guessed @H|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe X or 3@c best?|pg||
