nt|daman: they opened a weak NT in the CR   played it there and went -1|pg||
nt|daman: But North refuses to bid|pg||
nt|lml: the bidding here should be fairly natural most of the time |pg||

nt|lml: hi there|pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway 20 vps ahead of USA2 at this point|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to our resident RM Precision expert, Walter Johnson, who will help us with the E-W sequences|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: hi everyone|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
nt|flash: N-S convention card at  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/bermudabowl/norway/Brogeland-Lindqvistrevised.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: still a few innuts|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: minuts|pg||
nt|lml: and the convention card has their pictures on it too|pg||
nt|flash: they play a Green (Natural) card, with 14+-17 1NT openers and a 5-card major, 2/1 style|pg||
nt|lml: I hear that some funny stuff happened on board 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|flash: E-W convention card at  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/bermudabowl/usa2/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf|pg||
nt|flash: for our viewers from the USA who might not be familiar/comfortable with the WBF convention card format|pg||
nt|flash: the E-W System Summary Form and perhaps a copy of their ACBL convention card can be found through www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|flash: but, of course, we've got Walter to help us   :)|pg||
nt|joest: btw, Brogeland may bid as much (or more) than either Rodwell or Meckstroth|pg||
nt|lml: I would expect Meckstroth to open the East hand although many wouldnt|pg||
nt|flash: N-S are a relatively new partnership, with North one of the younger players in this year's Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|joest: in the closed room, Hamman and Zia bid all the way up to 2@d on the north-south cards|pg||
nt|flash: they've shown well both in US competitions and here|pg||
nt|joest: Flash, I'll be you a steak dinner if Meckstroth passes the east hand|pg||
nt|lml: so it will go 1@C double? and then what|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll take a peice of that|pg||
nt|joest: it will go 1@d double then what|pg||
nt|lml: sorry 1@D|pg||
nt|flash: no, East won't open a strong, artificial, 1@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: jeff will definitely open a neb|pg||
nt|joest: once Lidqvist chimes in with clubs,it should be off to the races|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they will miss game at this table whatever West does|pg||
nt|flash: running scores in all 3 events now off and running through http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/SaoPaulo.09/Results.htm|pg||
nt|flash: click on the event at the top...|pg||
nt|flash: Each event has 22 teams entered, 21 by qualification and 1 from the host country.|pg||
nt|flash: They'll play a complete round-robin:  3 16-board matches a day for the first week|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi All - it seems that a convention played by Brogeland / Lindqvist are under ruling - so we wait for it|pg||
nt|flash: After that, the top 8 teams from each event will qualify for the KO phase.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Director at table to decide if it's ok or not - |pg||
nt|flash: complete convention cards must be submitted (and approved) in advance|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Meckwell made a reserve about one of convention played by Brogeland Lindqvist|pg||
nt|flash: each pair is limited in the number of Highly Unusual Method calls which they can use|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Herve...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: I will give you exact convention in a few|pg||
nt|joest: Perhaps it is "Nilslands slinkningar when 1NT is doubled" :)|pg||
nt|lml: word is that Hamman did not make 2@D which was at that point cold because he was unhappy with the contract|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: the match start|pg||
nt|Zmud99: ok convention is not permitted|pg||
nt|joest: that is VERY unlike Bob Hamman no matter what the circumstance|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was thinking the same thing|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: yes that is Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|mariner1: as we know him|pg||
nt|flash: and, as advertised, a nebulous 1@D opener...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: it was : 1@S - 2@H be two different things|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: the short @C opening might prevent them from competing in @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: unless Brink balances|pg||
nt|Zmud99: maybe a weak fit in @S or natural |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|joest: i'm mildly surprised Eric didn't act|pg||
nt|Zmud99: so TD ruling ask them not to play this|pg||
nt|joest: passing is more effective b/c now the 2@c call is not 'free' in any sense|pg||
nt|lml: still South will bid on and I expect they will get to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 7 easy tricks|pg||
nt|lml: it was the race to 1NT and this time east-west won.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 1n is always there|pg||
nt|joest: the n-s convention card was marked that their offensive sequence of 1@s-2@h.  2@h was EITHER natural or a weak raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|lml: and wrong again|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: well at leas they didn't play the 4-2|pg||
nt|Zmud99: yes Jack that was this convention that Eric point out|pg||
nt|joest: isn't south at least worth a 2@d noise just in case?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lady007: lucky for the dutch its not matchpoints :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: silly to win imps on this board for making a club partscore|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like 2NT is clear with S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cK|nt|bigtrain: i can't imagine passing|pg||
nt|joest: even if you don't go with 2NT, which I concur is straightforward, at least 2@d|pg||
nt|joest: I could see wondering about Qx|pg||
nt|joest: but you can overdo that against a nebulous diamond|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: So they will get a small win for doing better by playing 1NT then by defending it|pg||
nt|imp_jan: first blood to china, that is|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|lml: I like 2@D better than 2NT but both are better than pass|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bigtrain: why...  it's a nebulous @D...  it's totally meaningless...  might as well bid a "grape"|pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye took a gamble - sometimes he follows his nose rather than the book|pg||
nt|lml: do you think it is the first board thing.  Do any of you every get that|pg||
nt|joest: walter I trust your experience on this one|pg||

nt|pef: ah there we go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: hi everyone|pg||
nt|pef: and it looks like we are going to start with zia and hammn playing a pretty routine 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hamilton Kabe is our super operator, hi Hamilton!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: Hamman and Zia discussing a bidding sequence. We begin as soon as players are ready|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: Hi all, glad to see you all here. We hope to have a very nice match|pg||
nt|buffytvs: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/SaoPaulo.09/Results.htm is the URL for up to date results|pg||
nt|finch: Both pairs play a strong(ish) NT, 5-card majors and most 2/1s as game forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|buffytvs: norway currently leading the field after the Netherlands lost hevaily to Chine in Rd 5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: heavily|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 3N NS plays well with a Quack in @H falling|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|finch: 1@H from Austberg showing spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|finch: Transfer responses after intervention are even more popular than transfers in an uncontested auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: 1@S usually played as showing 3-card support|pg||
nt|pef: well I may be wrong about that routine 3nt :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: Zia could I assume have doubled 1@S for penalties but preferred to see what happened next (if anything)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a routine 2@D on the 4-2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pef: a light opening bid and light response acted to effectively talk n/s out of their easy game|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: well this could get Norway off to a lead|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|pef: hamman and zia don't get talked out of games very often|pg||
nt|finch: When your opponents open on 11 and respond on 3 life can get a little more difficult|pg||
nt|finch: Zia's pass over 1@S caused the problems. With the @CQ I imagine he would have bid 1NT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: They could very well play Norway in a long match later on, so Zia-Hamman better get these auctions sorted out|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|finch: It looks odd playing in a 4-2 fit, but declarer's best line at trick two was probably to start on trumps|pg||
nt|finch: He can still make from here by ruffing and drawing the last trump.  The pause is probably a trump recount!|pg||
nt|pef: he's still ok|pg||
nt|pef: assuming (as already stated) he hasn't lost count of all those diamonds :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I wonder whether we have a TD call|pg||
nt|buffytvs: misinformation or misunderstanding might explain the auction|pg||
nt|finch: Hard to see misinformation with both 1@H and 1@S alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: no, Hamman thinking|pg||
pc|h4|nt|buffytvs: you're right, he has lost count of diamonds :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pef: my goodness, hamman miscounted trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: This makes me more comfortable, since even a great player as Hamman miscounts trumps...:)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: obviously upset with the contract...|pg||

nt|joest: "Billions served"|pg||
nt|lml: I love that line.|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: so a rather strange 4 IMPs|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|mariner1: nice 4@H EW here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: 2@h probably coming.   If playing transfer advances this is known to be a very weak raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|imp_jan: in the cr ton bakkeren and huub bertens play (ew), ton bakkeren recovered, he cldnt play yeterday due to illness|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder how many teams will miss 3NT on board 1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might even (ocassionally) be bid on a doubleton|pg||
mb|3H|nt|flash: with a safe retreat to @Ds, North inserts a negative X|pg||
nt|lml: I have the answer|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: this might be a support redouble.  not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: plays better in E with no @c lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: it looks like basically a cross ruff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: club lead by north no harm|pg||
nt|daman: East would always be playing it   no canape here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Only 2 others played in an undoubled partscore in the BB field|pg||
nt|joest: north has a great hand in context.  possibly a 5@d call|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know he already showed values with the first double.  |pg||
mb|5D|nt|joest: but four small hearts is wonderful|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: SJ Simon - think how much worse your hand could be|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: the bigger argyment is being vulnerable|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: he found his homors working..|pg||
nt|flash: South's starting with an X before showing his 2nd suit showed a moose|pg||
nt|lml: its not really that great a game even though it does make.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye will spend some time on this one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: 3-2 trumps and a favorable @S position?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lady007: i dont really understand the bidding but they got to the right contract|pg||
nt|imp_jan: bidding a little off beat idd|pg||
nt|mariner1: several lines of play including ruffing finesse in @D if a trump is led|pg||
nt|lml: I thought they were playing 2/1 but this doesn't look like that|pg||
nt|lady007: guess 1@d denied a major if not GF so 2@h was strong|pg||
nt|imp_jan: slam trial in between|pg||
nt|lml: okay that makes sense|pg||
nt|lml: the simplest line to 10 tricks is to cash 3 top tricks and cross ruff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: btw, in cr bertens - bakkere bid the same (in the beginning)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room did get a trump led|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on|pg||
nt|mariner1: TOOLBAR and then OPEN or CLOSED|pg||
nt|daman: this will not take long I suspect|pg||
nt|lml: ignore what I said.|pg||
nt|lml: most things work|pg||
nt|lml: you can set up clubs if you like|pg||
nt|daman: trump lead |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|daman: stands out|pg||
nt|daman: booooooooo|pg||
nt|mariner1: well its really easy with @c lead|pg||
nt|lml: this lead will not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|lml: and nothing too terrible in clubs|pg||
nt|lml: its the kind of game you don't want to be in NV |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|lml: but Vulnerable it is worth a whirl|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would have led a trump|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|h5|nt|lml: draw trump and claim lead|pg||
nt|daman: one more IMP for China|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: it does make the hand play quickly.  |pg||
nt|joest: Boye has to keep the timing right for his spade plays|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: as in "this was a good time"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: nice they are 3-3|pg||
nt|flash: Espen wouldn't have bid 5@D without the Ten of trumps   :)|pg||
nt|joest: the thirteenth spade might well come into play|pg||
nt|joest: particularly if ERic taps him now|pg||
nt|flash: good result from the Closed Room; headed for a push|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with everything splitting... he can crossruff the hand|pg||
nt|lml: this is going to be a good result at both tables.  Relatively few +600 across the field.  |pg||
nt|joest: so the first board was a push with both sides surprisingly missing a game|pg||
nt|joest: this will be a high level push|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: now South doesnt know that everything splits but if the @SK cashes then he is probably fine on a crossruff|pg||
nt|joest: I think he needs the king of spades to live in all scenarios|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=33557&st=0& entry392213  for our matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not if @C are 3-3 |pg||
nt|lml: does he have any other choices though?|pg||
nt|joest: if clubs are 3-3 how does he avoid cashing the spade?  unless he knows west has the third trump|pg||
nt|flash: pull trumps and claim?|pg||
nt|joest: that's true|pg||
nt|lml: if diamonds are 3-2 then say Rodwell has 2 diamonds, 3 clubs, 5 hearts and 3 spades|pg||
nt|joest: keep forgettng about that ten of diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: I cant come up with a distribution where the spades don't break and everything else does but I might have missed it|pg||
nt|bigtrain: bidding indicates that roddy has 6 hearts for sure|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2623|pg||
nt|joest: 2623|pg||
nt|lml: so its that or 3-6-2-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: looks like it|pg||
nt|finch: 5@D looks a little delicate to me.  I would rather defend it.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H shows a strong opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pef: with probably exactly 3 spades|pg||
nt|finch: 2@H usually played as game forcing.  May have 4 spades when he bids 2@H, but now showing a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|pef: although 4h now seems to me a bit of an overbid--I would think 4c is more descriptive|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: uh oh|pg||
mb|5C|nt|finch: If 2@H was game forcing, 4@H isn't an overbid|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: that first board is tough -- they're playing 2@C in the other room :)|pg||
nt|pef: even with spades and diamonds splitting and the j of spades onside, it looks like just tapping south with hearts should beat 5d|pg||
nt|mariner1: on last board the Open Room is in 2@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pef: but zia has been known to work magic|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|finch: Not sure how Hamman & Zia play the dbl - the US style used to be double shows exactly 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the swing will not be great|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|finch: So Zia not tempted by the 4-3 fit, while Hamman may have been catering for Zia having a monster spade hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: NS playing the 2@C|pg||
nt|pef: yes, double shows exactly 4 spades (although occasionally three in a pinch, almost never 5)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dQ|pc|h3|nt|finch: With trumps breaking, and spades 3-3 with the jack onside, this is probably untouchable|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pef: on the previous board in the open round the auction went 1d, double by zia's hand p 2c and surprisingly the south hand passed|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no so sure...|pg||
nt|finch: The natural line is king of clubs, club ruff, then little choice but spade to the 10|pg||
nt|finch: The @SA is marked in West's hand from the auction once East had the @CA|pg||
nt|pef: so only 4 clubs to Norway when 2c made exactly 2 in the open room|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Norway leads 4 clubs to 0 then :)|pg||
nt|pef: I mean 4 imps!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: which club, 7-iron?|pg||
nt|pef: sometimes they feel like clubs|pg||
nt|finch: The problem with this line is that West wins and forces declarer and he has insufficient trumps, but I think he can cross-ruff|pg||
nt|pef: yes, roland, a trusty 7 iron|pg||
nt|finch: Maybe he needs not to ruff a club but play a spade at once, to stop West discarding a spade on a club|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what if West wins and plays a trump?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am sure he is worried about 4 - 1 @D and of course the @S position|pg||
nt|pef: well he has to play a low spade from hand now and a spade back to the 10 otherwise he ends up with 2 losers at the end|pg||
nt|finch: If West wins and plays a trump he can draw trumps and claim the rest.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: @s to queen and @s to 10 should solve it, no?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pef: I think that works, spade to the queen and spade to the 10.  if west wins and plays a trump he has 11 tricks|pg||
nt|finch: Agree he needs to start on spades to get his two spade tricks in the bag. He's threatening to make dummy high|pg||
nt|finch: The thought on the spade tells him the jack is onside: West wouldn't be thinking with AJx|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I bet Z is breathing easier and for sure now|pg||
nt|finch: It would have been very interesting if East had ducked the club|pg||
nt|pef: now it's easy to make|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|finch: Particularly if he ducked it so smoothly the location of the ace was unknown|pg||
nt|pef: yes ducking the club would have been better as would ducking the spade.  if he ducks the spade, zia has to grit his teeth and play another spade back to his 10|pg||
nt|finch: I think Zia had got to the spade-to-the-10 part given he had started on spades|pg||
nt|buffytvs: i agree|pg||
nt|pef: yes, although still would have been nice to see|pg||
nt|finch: Obviously with trumps 3-2 and spades 3-3 declarer can ruff, draw and claim.|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes an playing to K@S definitely had to look unattractive|pg||
nt|finch: But he has some alternative lines|pg||

nt|imp_jan: he will lead a spade|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|imp_jan: well a black card|pg||
nt|lml: he made the normal lead |pg||
nt|mariner1: so a push|pg||
nt|lml: although some might lead a club honor|pg||
nt|joest: of course his partner only bid 2@d not jump to 3|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: but the 2@D bid was a "free bid"|pg||
nt|flash: headed for a 7-IMP swing|pg||
nt|joest: 'free bids' don't mean as much these days I'm afraid|pg||
nt|lml: I like double anyway.  It doesn't really help declarer to know that he has spade losers |pg||

nt|lml: I hear from Ray in the other room that 5 is an intersting deal|pg||
nt|lml: cute story though|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lady007: i think its unlikely to matter very much as you probably need partner with an honour anyway|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 5+@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: dont you like matches that start slowly|pg||
nt|joest: Meckwell play transfer responses in comp?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: as a player not as a spec|pg||
nt|lml: gives time to warm up|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well after a diamond lead 3n is easy|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lady007: in that case its better to lead low in case he has Ax  and declarer Qx (Qxx in dummy and partner the ace is more or less impossible as declarer bid nt)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this was played in N in Closed Room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: here they do...  surprised meck didn't bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but you did get your 2@H bid|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|joest: rebids are a problem when you bid on hands like his.  Is partner supposed to accept with a stiff?  Do you sit?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: bid naturally|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|imp_jan: and east led a low heart..|pg||
nt|mariner1: a small @H from E in Closed Room made this simple|pg||
nt|mariner1: looking for 9th here|pg||
nt|lml: the diamond lead is pretty good for declarer|pg||
nt|lady007: declarer has 7 tricks to start with and 8 if he sets up a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt a laugher|pg||
nt|imp_jan: attacking hearts looks the logic approach|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a tough hand|pg||
nt|lml: East is not going to enjoy discardiing on diamonds if declarer starts with that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not that that wld be successful|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|mariner1: yes E had to discard @S not @c or 2nd @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @D are played|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: accept the transfer with 2 (or a poorish 3)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: well the 4@D pretty much tells the @D situation|pg||
nt|lady007: he can discard a heart and a spade to start with|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cT|nt|imp_jan: ok returning a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: East has some issues here|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe he should not pitch a heart then because then declarer knows he has 5|pg||
nt|lady007: hmmm|pg||
nt|lady007: 4441 also possible of course but that heart came very fast|pg||
nt|lml: endplays, squeezes|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i like the play of Brink, returning a diamond|pg||
nt|lady007: defenders tend to discard their 5crd suit first, and first discarding from a 4crd suit is a very good tactic to confuse declarer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really not much of a problem really|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: a heart return is probably the best for the defense|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, he has no real suit to develop so lets them play something first|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes but discarding a club wlndt be a good idea here|pg||
nt|lady007: not on this hand, no|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S out makes discarding later easier on E|pg||
nt|daman: partner is marked with 5 @Hs|pg||
nt|lady007: but in general|pg||
nt|lml: if East discards too many spades he can be endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: he needs to hold on to more cards than he has space for|pg||
nt|lady007: good return by zhao, not only sets it up tricks for the defense but it also gets the pressure of east who can discard spades later|pg||
nt|lml: a heart return might have helped then another heart when in on a diamond|pg||
nt|lady007: that would be a very good defense yes. unfortunately he has only 1 heart to play|pg||
nt|lml: this is awful close|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not possible linda, west only has one heart|pg||
nt|lml: yes of course, and you cant really attack clubs much|pg||
nt|lml: I think Brink can do this|pg||
nt|mariner1: did we lose play or is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: south really thinking|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he has every reason for it|pg||
nt|lml: he might duck this|pg||
nt|lml: then win the next one and play a diamond|pg||
nt|lady007: i think brink will make this|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|lml: me too|pg||
nt|lady007: eventually he will endplay east to play a club is my guess|pg||
nt|flash: trump lead unlikely, but effective here??|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes, he is favorite to make it|pg||
nt|lml: he wins this spade and plays a diamond|pg||

nt|imp_jan: on 4th diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not that it matters|pg||
nt|lady007: i think ducking was best to ensure they didnt have any spade communication left. otherwise west might duck the diamond , east only has to discard one card and he doesnt know with ...|pg||
nt|lady007: which shape east started with|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lml: East might as well throw a spade now|pg||
nt|lady007: going for the endplay would then be pretty silly if the club queen was onside, east crosses with a spade and west cashes 2 more diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: dummy squeezed on @S return as well|pg||
nt|lady007: dummy can discard 2 hearts|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i am not sure if spade discard by east is best defense|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|lml: East will be endplayed in hearts is my prediction ... to lead a club|pg||

nt|lml: Now the @SK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lady007: heart to the king, heart back now? |pg||

pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||

nt|mariner1: and a huge swing to China|pg||
nt|lml: wow|pg||
nt|lady007: kind of expected but it turned out to be very expensive for the dutch|pg||
nt|lml: I would have bid 4NT on the North hand as a two suited takeout|pg||
nt|imp_jan: there is world of difference between opening 3@h or 4@h...|pg||
nt|lml: but I can see the logic of 4@S too|pg||
nt|lady007: 4nt would be great now of course but then you cannot play 4@s anymore when that is right|pg||

nt|joest: maybe Eric thinks this is a 2NT balance when opponents have nine spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i expect roddy to balance|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lml: thats the downside of 5@H or 4NT|pg||

pc|s4|nt|lml: 4@s was a pragmatic bid which failed|pg||
nt|lml: I think he said it all when he bid 4 card Drury|pg||
nt|flash: only a 2-trick swing on this card...|pg||
nt|joest: he might well work out to play the king|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: Linda    please do not use words with more than 2 syllables   it gives me a headache :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like DBL better, it implies 2 places to play and you well could be missing slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: even in @S|pg||
nt|lml: what about dbl|pg||
nt|lml: ah yes|pg||
nt|lady007: actually 4@s even had chances on this lead with the spades 70 :) east needs to have only 1 heart so you can cash 5 minor suit tricks and get 5 spade tricks in your hand|pg||
nt|lml: but a lot of people play the double of 4@S is penalty oriented... high cards not necessarily shape|pg||
nt|lml: sorry $@H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: of course jeff is good enough to lead low from AQx|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: should ghet it right - and make it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lady007: brink-drijver will play it more as take out but of course take out is a little different than a huge 5530 with good 5crd spade|pg||
nt|lml: and with pretty solid spades North thought he might be safe just bidding it|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course he is good enough - but it is more tempting from the actual holding|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest: i agree|pg||
nt|flash: some people will go to any length to get their partner to take an extra trick...   1 IMP to Norway...   (and a few years or layers of stomach lining off Espen's existence)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: I do have some sympathy and others have done it in the field|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: I play 4@H DBL as t/o and 4@S dbl in same spot as penalty with 4N as t/o,,,,,,|pg||

nt|lml: rats|pg||
nt|flash: not even that, but it certainly tests declarer the most|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think a heart lead beats it|pg||
nt|joest: if declarer plays double dummy it wn't beat it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: it probably will beat it |pg||
nt|bigtrain: a @H lead destroys communication|pg||
nt|joest: if dummy were known to have a heart suit, this might be a double cross|pg||
nt|joest: since not, less likely to be from the king vs a grand|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|joest: well, let's see how a world class declarer handles this|pg||
nt|lml: in the CR declarer played the @HQ|pg||
nt|lml: and went down obviously|pg||
nt|joest: double dummy he can drop the queen of diamonds, ruff one spade and squeeze south in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the squeeze does work if you see all the hands...  but since the cards have backs i would say it will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: zia was on lead, so ....|pg||
nt|joest: whether that is the right line is something else entirely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: dummy useless now|pg||

pc|h8|mc|11|nt|joest: first round diamond hook to guard against Qxxx makes a lot of sense.  He led nine to prevent rising from Qxxx and blocking|pg||

mb|1D|nt|pef: even a grand isn't bad|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|finch: A club slam by West is the best spot. Good hand for a strong 1@C opener.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pef: if you could arrange to play 7c from the jxx side, you'd want to be there.  from the other side, a heart lead means you need to guess right away|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: I'm sure they'll get to at least 6c|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I somehow doubt they will be in 7|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pef: I think I'd take an even money bet they'd get to 7 after this start|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 22  they played and made 2@C compared to the 3N off 3 here|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room|pg||
nt|buffytvs: austberg already knows there'll be a decent play for 7|pg||
nt|mariner1: diet coke Peter?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pef: so far, except for the first board, this match favors underbidding|pg||
nt|finch: Well, he knows there would be decent play for 7 if partner has all the trump honours|pg||
nt|pef: Dr. Pepper and you're on|pg||
nt|mariner1: diet here on :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|finch: I'm told the China went off in grand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: looks like 6 clubs, 4 diamonds, two aces and a spade ruff even if there's no @DQ opposite|pg||
nt|pef: 5d asking for the queen of trumps almost surely and inviting a grand|pg||
nt|finch: Three trumps with the singleton queen of diamonds does make it very awkward on a heart lead|pg||
nt|finch: I'm told Italy also went off|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: ok, pay up!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well I owe one (1st one I have lost on BBO :) )|pg||
nt|pef: actually I'll take one of the new cherry Dr. Peppers|pg||
pc|h6|nt|buffytvs: well East is entitled to bid the grand but I'm not sure why he did|pg||
nt|pef: ah, and zia found the best opening lead in a trice|pg||
nt|mariner1: you got it but those are yuck :)|pg||
nt|pef: this makes it really tough on declarer since it destroys the late entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: in fact, not sure he can make it now even if he guesses hearts|pg||
nt|finch: The only way I can see to make it is @HA, @SA, @S ruff and run trumps, squeezing South|pg||
nt|finch: But that's not a sensible single dummy line|pg||
nt|pef: yes, has to play for the spade diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|finch: maybe (very maybe) if you cash the @DA early you might think of this|pg||
nt|pef: for those specs suggesting other lines, you are missing the fact that declarer has no re-entry to his hand after ruffing the second spade|pg||
nt|finch: The problem with the winning line is that it involves assuming you start with 3 diamond tricks, which isn't obvious|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think he'll play for diamonds no worse than 4-2 -- and go down|pg||
nt|finch: The problem is that diamonds 4-2 is still not enough tricks|pg||
nt|pef: getting lots of comment from the specs|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you're right - he still doesn't have the entries|pg||
nt|finch: ace of hearts, AK of diamonds and a ruff, and you need trumps 2-2 as well|pg||
nt|buffytvs: given that it's Zia on his left, he might just stick in the @HQ anyway|pg||
nt|pef: first of all, he can't simply win the ace of hearts, play a spade to his ace ruff a spade, play a club to his hand and ruff a spade.  that leaves him with no entries back to his ...|pg||
nt|pef: hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: specs, please read all the discussion -- declarer has severe entry problems|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and yes, we can see the squeeze works -- but why would he play the hand that way?|pg||
nt|pef: I believe the only line that works now is the very hard one of winning the ace of hearts, probably playing one diamond and deciding the queen is an honest singleton, ruffing one ...|pg||
nt|pef: spade and queezing south in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: if he does go up with the ace of hearts he probably will make the hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: may take a whle to play this one though|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|pef: so a very hard hand for declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pef: the queen of hearts was a very reasonable play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not unreasonable|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|finch: I think this was probably the right line. The heart lead doesn't tell you anything really about the location of the @HQ|pg||

nt|buffytvs: in the OR they are playing 7@C from the short side|pg||
