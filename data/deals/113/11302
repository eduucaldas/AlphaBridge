pc|d6|nt|nickf: the most threatening lead, but plenty of tricks here|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3N can be let through but shouldn't be|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: excellent lead for defence|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: agree. I hadn´found @h 10|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: key play here is that south must of course duck the D10|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lestergold: oh east has made an error - this play would lose even against a 4/2 dim break|pg||

nt|lestergold: this has been played appalingly- with only one shot available in clubs she should have tried the ten of clubs it was only chance left|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: playing north for Jxx clubs for the contract |pg||
pc|c2|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 80% of Western Australians play Acol we were told earlier|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 6@C looks awfully good - too good for you, Roland|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6NT is obviously best if played by North|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Easy game :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 7 for Roland perhaps? -- it makes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: BBO Vugraph is great - I never lose to a queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I would make 7, but only because I know the layout. I would likely go down in real life|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: you would get a trump lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: If West dos not lead a trump against 7 would you not play her for the queen?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: easy!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is nothing like female intuition. Smith should have been in 7|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jcwla: A Roland game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|jcwla: Pass would not occur to me with the W hand at round one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now what woyuldu do as south here?|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|nickf: might get out for one off here with a club to the 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think passing is poor because you know they are running|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c from me as S|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: west could have shut the auction up by 3D here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fast 3nt is makeable on NS|pg||
nt|ahalim: 6NT from N is OK too|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: in fact...|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a lucky make in spite of only 21 combined|pg||
nt|lestergold: and what a swing if it is allowed to paly there|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk4: 7 is fine by either if you guess clubs as Smith did in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: right|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has made two poor decsiiosn in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: taking out 3N undoubled absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here the bidding sequence wa almost as dreadul as the previous card play I hopethis is going ti improve|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|granguru: hi|pg||
nt|ahalim: no @D lead so no anxious moments for S|pg||

pc|h2|nt|nickf: NTs no good.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: for all south knoes she could be taking out 3N into an unmakeable club contract and what is more she hyasnt promised any great high card strength on the auction so far|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|nickf: next the spade ten|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|granguru: Michael Rosenberg created a nice signal for these ruffing positions : Q and 10  asked for the higher suit J and 9 for the lowest one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 2 @s loosers?|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|jcwla: West's inaction actually placed her side in position to gain, but DD defense much easier from the VG booth.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Don't like this weak2 much - wrong sort of suit, too many controls. Hard for East to bid 4@S now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|xenya: i would consider 4@S almost automatic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H would show a stronger hand in my book|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: many play 4@H here as weaker than 3@H.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose this may go enough down to compensate for the game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: They could have taken 500, now only 300|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, maybe 500 after all|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She needs to take a first round finesse in hearts to escape for down 2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: and did not|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West appeared to be giving suit preference for clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: probably 3 off, yes|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

nt|ahalim: welc back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 6S looks infrangible tho not easy to bid with confidence|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nickf: good slam here NS, too bad the spades dont break|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|granguru: Good result for NS  in open. They should lose 2@H and 2 black aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: the qH a very big card here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: now by showing hearts north has paved the way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Depending on what 2@s shows, I had thoughts about supporting with @sK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they have reversed the board again, Smith has the south hand and Merven has the E hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: Here W declared the @H suit..Problably 3@H will just make |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north is too powerful to just 'sign' off in 4S maybe 5Swould be a better choice|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Mike! S has 3 key cards @sK, @hQ abd @cA|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry i got kicked out|pg||
nt|ahalim: very timid bidding by EW|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: south with key honours in the majors should know what to do if north bids 5S which after all is likely to be pretty safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: the difficult auction was going well until north took the chicken exit with 4S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do you think about 3@s on 3@h?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: instead of 4@c|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hA|pc|d2|pc|s9|pg||

pc|d3|nt|lestergold: if 2 showed a one loser suit in their methods perhaps buty it may b ambiguous showing either self supporting suit or delayed strong support for diamonds with a strong side suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it would in standard Kelsey slam bidding|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Opening 1@C with this is not consistent with 2!AS on the previous deal.|pg||

nt|lestergold: Kelsey wrote an excellent boojk on slam bidding many years ago which I think certainly in the Ul l;aid the foundation s of sound slam bidding priinciples|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Fortunate not to get to the unlucky slam, seemed like it might have happened after 3@D.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|granguru: but not reachable|pg||

nt|nickf: East opening 1@H in the Open Room|pg||
