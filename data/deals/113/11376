nt|haans: and we start with a part score|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Ralf Willquist and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our operator, Daiva|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also welcome to Marek Wójcicki|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|mareczek: Unia has 4 VP advantage|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: i hope they will win|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mareczek: hi to all from Vilnius...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: EW some spades?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: starting with a multi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hidy.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|brolucius: I expect East will pass, after due consideration.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has a good idea of which suit West has got|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@c invitationa, 6+ clubs|pg||
nt|mareczek: team Auguri - two pairs nominated to the Polish team for nearest European Championships|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: i don't think so|pg||
nt|mareczek: invitational|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: I know this system well, believe me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with P from E? I had introdused my @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry, it was invitation|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 3N here if EW let them play it|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1nt one round forcing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||
nt|sharkey: surprised S passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: that i did not understand|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@h in red is impossible in serious game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a true Bramley x in s.  For the genuine article, you have to be 4333 with 4 cards in the x'd suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2° suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Now we play the open part of the turney. The turney are made by EBU for federations with less then 500 members. Last year played in Monaco and won by Bulgaria. They and Romania 3rd ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: have passed 500 and did not play from monday when turney started|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Marek:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: East has nothing attractive to do, but (let's hope) he will soon select something or other. Yes, a trump.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like N also had some knowledge....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mareczek: trumps now, and trump after @d ace|pg||
nt|mareczek: reduces declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as I was about to say, on this hand it would be a good idea to lead it too|pg||
nt|rodal f: BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unia in lead by 161VP against Auguri 157VP before the last match|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: I predict 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - N's opening though I understand...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|santyclz: Classically s's auction would show a hand too strong for a 1nt overcall.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|xenya: the auction looks mysterious but they certainly kmw what they are doing|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for my prediction|pg||
nt|mareczek: hi again from Vilnius|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: *know|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Marek|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: continue this way and EW win :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: N seems to have overbid here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I guess most of us would have led the @HK. Tough|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To get 17 VPs (which Auguri needs) you need to win by at least 6 IMPs. It's that close in a six-board match|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mareczek: west probably did not expect that this game can be set...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Belive bough pairs play Polich @C as at the other table last match|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mareczek: but if EW biod 4@h, they probably will make it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: but it must be a difficult hand for their methods|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and i will miss 4@h many times - like now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: good switch, but the @H7 and @H8 provide protection|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems I was correct after all :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mareczek: Jagniewski Kwiecien played rather sopisticated system wuth many transfers and relays|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|xenya: playing WJS, it might be easier -- 1@D -- 2@S -- all pass|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ardf10987: If some declarer has to be "reduced", why not me... (over 100kg) :) I would be happy :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hope u know there system then Marek:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: I mentioned earlier that E/W were unlikely to concede an early 13 IMPs. It seems that Vainikonis is equally determined not to concede even 1 IMP.  His trump plays have worked well.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
mc|11|nt|sharkey: I haven't seen a 2@C opener like this before - normally shows an opening hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i see that Newton's eleventh Law holds here too---if you lead from KQT the dummy will hit with Jxx (or longer). |pg||
nt|mareczek: more or less|pg||
pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So UNIA by 4 VPs from AUGURI before this match, the last of the Open Teams|pg||
nt|cicus: had to switch to spades to prevent the 2nd overtrick|pg||
nt|cicus: hardly easy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|cicus: this is a potential swing as 4@S fails|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To get 17 VPs (which Auguri needs) you need to win by at least 6 IMPs. It's that close in a six-board match|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|xenya: every single imp counts now|pg||

nt|xenya: some fun here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: really?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think there is no opening-lead card combination on the highly-approved list that flouts statistical likelihoods so consistently|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1  I mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One of my principles. Bid the first time you can, you will probably have a second chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS are in 5@D on 7 in Closed Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D has no real play so good start for Unia|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: here club ruff beats 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Daiva, did 3NT really make?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mareczek: but NS should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: At 18.00 on a Monday, unless Italy is playing on BBO VuGraph.|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe|pg||
nt|mareczek: Buras Narkiewicz were just nominated for the Polish national team for Europeans in Ostend|pg||
mb|d|nt|mareczek: this is potential swing board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But it also meand that you and your partner must have som brakes too|pg||
nt|rodal f: An UNDO vug opperator?|pg||
nt|rodal f: thx:)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ralfwil: means..|pg||
nt|mareczek: second pair are Balicki Zmudzinski|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: S will bid something -- then...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can only see  4 tricks for the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: not have....|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C is the spot here EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now that South has bid hearts, EW need to get their clubs into the auction |pg||
nt|mareczek: I think N has opened 1@s|pg||
nt|mareczek: operator's mistake|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardf10987: pratic bidding:) when make...|pg||
nt|haans: OPERATOR Name of players?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mareczek: 3NT is a great bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: A brave bid by South, who should be rewarded.|pg||
nt|mareczek: when partner has passed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://vilniuscup.sportbridge.lt/  -  Tournament Site|pg||
nt|mareczek: playing on the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: i think i am tired|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: U do a suppurb job Daiva:) U have the hardest one|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: ;)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: I liked also East's 3@C, although it has not worked out as he intended.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer only claimed eight, which is a different matter |pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@s = strong, 5@c and 4@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might be thinking slam now....... though it has no play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think double is better than 1NT with 4-3 in the majors and only one diamond stopper|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a buze-induced result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: it was 1 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Roland|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@c was transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2@d is take out for majors|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think it will finish in 5@c doubled...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mareczek: but once again Vainikonis made life extermely hard for the opponents|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a hard one by the good lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: bloody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/team/vilteamrunda5.html  for running scores|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: a risky @h!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will only cost one trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Joe|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was in the other room too, but doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are those who might open the E hand in third, even vul|pg||
nt|mareczek: now better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: Not a terribly exciting hand.  More fun in matchpoints or board-a-match.|pg||
nt|mareczek: 11d negative or intermediate with minors|pg||
nt|mariner1: well @H lead and this is done in|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: declarer could have got a ninth in the end-position, according to the position on MOVIE when he claimed eight. |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: this happens to be an easy make -- even 10 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|xenya: actually always 10 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it has if North leads the @CJ, but I don't think that is going to happen|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Needed to cover with a honor from W.|pg||
nt|rodal f: ORs lead was @D9 for a easy play|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: Buras is sleeping like before|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ryskiel_: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: even a Rabbi can't make this one.........|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|sharkey: West's 1@S appears undiciplined with only ywo jacks - may be conventional....?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mariner1: Rabbi's Rule = when King singleton play the Ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: turns out to be a good save, undoubled too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: *two|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There was an end-play on East available.|pg||
nt|mareczek: on the second table WE were left on their own devices and stopped in 3@d|pg||
nt|mareczek: balicki Zmudzinski sitting NS did not enter the bidding!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: or, as Walter Johnson points out, no heart lead at all|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Marek and all|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: note that clubs are frozen now|pg||
nt|mareczek: running scores http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/team/vilteamrunda9.html|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: that is the defence can't play them without giving declarer another trick in the suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not just "could Have"|pg||
nt|mareczek: perfect defense|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|haans: nowday people seldom pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room here in 3@D EW|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Nort shoul discard high clubs because that was SPS position|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|xenya: actually 5@S X 2 down would be a par|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Sikorski should have followed with @CJ to show values in hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Ryszard|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: but hope for @D Ace in partners hand he discard accordingly|pg||
pc|d9|mc|8|nt|mdgraham: I'm English, Marshall - understatement is the name of the game |pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|othered1: do you double 1@S opposite a passed partner?|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: i do|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: it's 5-4-3-1 afer all|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Daiva|pg||
nt|ralfwil: according to what Roland said. If EW had competed with 3@h, there had been win|pg||
nt|santyclz: Again rather tame, everybody's 4@h.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 in a black here|pg||
nt|mareczek: one more energetic board|pg||
nt|mariner1: can even make 6@H|pg||
nt|mareczek: not 6@s by N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West probably expected better clubs for 4@C (just guessing though)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3C|nt|mariner1: 6@S has issue if played in N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: which is possible after a D instead of 1nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi. Lost con:( Stucked at BBO|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: That 3NT might possibly be the 'early 13 IMPs' that I mentioned. If Lithuania end in 4@H and go down on the club ruff.|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@c - Polish club - natural 15+, balanced 12-14 or strong - 18+, any distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Ryszard|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@d transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to stay low here due to breaks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will N try 3@H? Hard now|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Gdansk must mean polish team?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: they play last month in Pula so probably they stealed some flags|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mareczek: 2@d - majors|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anything higher than the 2 level spells problems here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in 15 South play 3 NT and lost 1 down before after @S lead|pg||
nt|xenya: we saw this hand a few minutes ago -- it was 3N by NS 2 off|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: They might not mind the wrong flag for that result though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: On Board 12, the Closed Room is also in 3NT. Well bid.|pg||
nt|mareczek: trump lead once again?|pg||
nt|mariner1: S likes to hear @D by W|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mareczek: W has bid take out for majors - so 4@h was out of question|pg||
nt|ardf10987: 1@C not garanting suit prevent 3@C bid fromWest...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: repeat bidding @S suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks an easy make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Easyer in OR by 2@C from E. Then NS bidded 4@H for a nice sac EW|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|sharkey: http://vilniuscup.sportbridge.lt/|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D denies 4 card Major?|pg||
nt|mareczek: if West will double 6!|pg||
nt|mariner1: mission accomplished|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: West has been a bit passive in the auction. Why should 3@C not be a worthwhile spot? I realise that his partner is likely to be 12-14 balanced but he may hold some clubs in that.|pg||
nt|mareczek: S can retreat to 6NT?|pg||
nt|mareczek: double 6@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he can, but he'd better not |pg||
nt|mariner1: Wojo points out W can underlead @D and get a @c ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If he does, West will lead fourth highest of his longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: north is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: very serious face|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Daiva|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does not know S has @c fit yet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If West does double 6@s, East can (possibly) tell from the NS bidding that West is not void in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there is a defence to 6@H - diamond underlead  |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think N should bid 6@C here as choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course my thinking could not possibly be influenced by being able to see all|pg||
nt|mariner1: the hands :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Joey Silver says S should have bid 4@C and not 4@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I remember trying this sort of underlead once - dummy had singleton ten, of course |pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 2 was flat - a contract of 3N-1 |pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room NS are in 6@S and W underled the @D and got the ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So South was declarer in 6@S?|pg||
nt|mareczek: in the style NS play 6@c is rather invitation yo grand than proposition|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marshall, I can tell you that we took good care of Obama and that he is on his way back now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: maybe Eats led @D10 and East followed with the D!3|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh no E led 10@D and and it held the trick,,, then E led a @c to be ruffed......|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was misinformed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told that is what happened, thanks all|pg||
nt|mariner1: good news is the @SA is singleton, that is also the bad news|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: 1@C must be Polish -- weak NT or some strong hand, 1@D -- negative response, but i have doubts about the 1@H rebid|pg||
nt|santyclz: W had a problem, does 3@s on this auction show better than a min opener or any hand w/4@ss?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: thx Roland. i guess is have to move back to my apartment then|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: i'd hate to rebid a suit headed by 8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the house-sitting was fun for a while|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ryskiel_: re Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: re|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: http://sf2009.sportbridge.lt/ talk only about team play made before|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why is East taking so long?|pg||
nt|haans: i say his not |pg||
nt|haans: internet problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W has to be careful now. If S ducks and W plays another @s..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, wd West, indeed|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|mareczek: it is sensible policy to bid with a spade fit, not to pass|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: on torture I dont admit for such suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: especjally having such clubs|pg||
mc|9|nt|mdgraham: Hold the Bulletin|pg||
nt|mareczek: It will be written, surely...|pg||
nt|mareczek: Bulletin editor is fifth member of Unia team :)|pg||

nt|sharkey: I dont know - S has relayed with 2@D |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS in the optimal contract - advantageous lead - why call Director - must be EW|pg||
