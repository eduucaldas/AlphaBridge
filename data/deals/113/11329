nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2° suit...|pg||

nt|sigiuna: so we are starting the last match today|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS take few minutes to discuss EW system and countermeasures|pg||
nt|sigiuna: and the last match of round robin..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Monaco as leader after round robin took Belarus for semifinal|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  play starts in few minutes - both pairs take their time to get detailed description of opps' systems|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: re Hi:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we have new N and other NS system - based on Polish club|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  sorry, new player took S seat|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are asking NS about the system, but 1st board belongs to EW, as it seems|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: so You suggest Swieta they should ask yourselves about system?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: There are better signs then smiley|pg||

nt|xenya: i've lost my link to the running scores -- will someone give it?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|xenya: ah, thanks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mareczek: both teams safely qualified to play off|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzxj: There was a very short break, and now we are back for the last 10 boards without a break|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hi Ralf|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Thanks Monika@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no supp dbl by N (guess not in use) makes it hard now for S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: As I know, Estonians have a flight at 8 p.m. local time, so everybody was asked to try to play a little bit quicker :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mareczek: Estonia has 20 VP advantage over the 5th|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Drury type it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Giannarigo Rona, EBL President and new elected WBF President arrived last night and attended the semifinals opening ceremony to address to all the participants with greeting words|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  He congratuled the players with the results already achieved by them and underlined the importance of the event. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sigiuna: Monako is the leaders, Estonian team on the third place|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting E's action - of course he can allow himself to pass first round, but what now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: excellent and what is time now, 06.00 PM|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: Hi Markku,  Monica and Rashed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ryskiel_: if North opening is only weak S should pass....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: Hello|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes a typical drury sequence. |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Play would not be a problem-cards placement very friendly|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Talking about small bridge federations Monaco surely qulifies; wonder how many members?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Qualifies*|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  As by his words, EBL will do its best to make next edition of the Small Feds to the real European Championship|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Great scoring program devised by Jan Romanski of Poland|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Jan is also the chief TD in Vilnius|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  could be to high already|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in CC of NS 2-meaning multi is mentioned - either weak-two in major or 23-24 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: they are also top two players in Lithuania in a national ranking|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: with the @SA well placed, lose 2 trumps and a club|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|sK|nt|xenya: just take care to ruff a @H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so we have an easy game for the start - just right for the players to overcome starting nerves|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: after this lead 5 @D makeable but needs some skilfull in declearer play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In a group match I think Lithuania won from Monaco|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but no carryover I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: no carry over indeed|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: Why not play @hQ, When you must ruff a @h also with @hK on side?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  As about the countries - Belarus faced Monaco at the bridge table in 1993 in Menton and in 1995 in Vilamoura|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I think even worse|pg||

nt|xenya: pass|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what else? or are you ready to beat 3NT?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Flat board|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think 1 @C just missleads partner and has no pre-empt or lead dir value so why|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: i think they can play va bank the last boards...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: not much to the play here it seems|pg||

nt|mmmakela: even with bad suit wouldn't blame a 2 dias overcall either |pg||

mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: For me it´s dangerous to change my play even in the lead|pg||
nt|benislovas: they do not need any 500 humd|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  I hate like-E's hand on 3rd and 4th seat |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: WE have 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 42 to 6, is no competition in 8 boards:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: A flat board I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|benislovas: hundreds :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Monaco needs 3 more boards like this with big swing potential|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ryskiel_: 3 @S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: wow|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @H very strange bid with that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  NS allowed W making 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see the show here|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  1@h from 4 cards, 3@c nat, with fit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: look as 11 imps for Monaco|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That helped declarer from an hopeless 6@h|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now it is practically over|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now even 13 tricks after a @d ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ryskiel_: 3 NT is makeable - 4 @S,2@H,2@D and 1@C|pg||
nt|mmmakela: universal 450 however u play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree-no comments|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well small now and again small on club return and ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this board: 4@H was a weird bid:6 @H was sound: @D A was a somewhat weird(maybe SOTM) lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  rarely played contract 1 in a suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed, you are right|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|ryskiel_: Monaco s bid very agresively all time with good result as we see|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: as stated lol|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: indeed but it's hard to see what EW could do -- anyone for a double by E at his second turn?|pg||
nt|benislovas: OR also found a lead of AD|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  even if - NS can compete with 2 @s|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they might|pg||
nt|sigiuna: It was so in CR..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky guy found @d third|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|brolucius: Allavena/Fissore have had a good second half and may harbour some thoughts of a wonderful recovery.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D was the multi and 3@H was pre-emptive, indicating that N/S should compete to three of partner's supposed major when North held a weak-two type.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: Not so much value in 3@H when both opponents had already passed!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|ardf10987: He could have lost a @S 4-4 fit, here...|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, as Marco points out... if South responds just 2@H, with a 2NT rebid, they would have the space to investigate a possible 4-4 spade fit. |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to my entertaining fellow commentators, Marco and Marek. Also to the rest of the hard-working team in Vilnius.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|rnmalik: This slam shoul be bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now a very good slam missed in OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Marco Catellani|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2NT opening by NS promises 21-22, so, 1@c from S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a slam as a change. Can they bid it?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: keep the fingers crossed:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt..|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ralfwil: 3@d for me as S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  real disaster in OR - EW found their way to @c game...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: low pointwise so hard to bid I suppose|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so there was the big chance for monaco; any other lead besides diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rnmalik: now possible 4@H again 5@D would show void|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardf10987: Hi all. I normally play with Fissore... but I can see now it's all better (without me) :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Marco|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in such form Monaco became as favorite team in Open ECh|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good bid|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  hi Marco, don't apply self-critizism - who knows how it could be with you :-)|pg||
nt|minnie lee: can this be right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardf10987: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion @dA is a bad lead from !AQ and with @hK|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: again, NS can make 12 tricks -- and again, it's a poor slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N made it easier for E|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And N-S forgot to save in 7@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: actually they will do well to get to 5 i think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd bet for bidding mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-800|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardf10987: yes, bad slam... and restricted choice in @D not good here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but if you are able to bid such one, you must be Deep Finess to bring it home|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this contract looks like normal one|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: i would prefer 3@H as S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N thinking if 4@D is 5/5 then has 3 @C and with @C with him thought has a play|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the 4 @H bid made it hard, normally a highly ditributional hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In that hand I would lead a @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Indeed. The auction in the other room was without arms and legs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm told, E in OR bid 2@c answering partner's 1@s|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I like I @D opening made in OR, sometimes the lower opening is more pre-emtive|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I kind of sympatize with DA lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  even after bi-color double?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  applied by E|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|xenya: @Ds had been agreed i guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they reached 3NT (not unreasonable), but W pulled to 4@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: saying you have an opening hand strongly suggests opps don't have slam|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  3@s played by E at the table|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ardf10987: who can disagree that doubling with a 4333 show (some) support for all unbid suits?|pg||

nt|vugraphzxj: Last board of the match|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ryskiel_: 3 NT lay down after natural @D lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this board could bring some imps for Belarus if NS avoid @c slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: tricky board. Caution required|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so if no appeals we congratulate Lithuania as the best Small Bridge Fed on this side of the Globe!|pg||
nt|benislovas: 3c for W?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  last board tonight|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And Monaco has 10 IMPs less than shown on the scoreboard?|pg||
nt|ritong: then the contested board comes into the picture|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  bid and beaten next door|pg||
nt|ritong: that is the TD decision|pg||
nt|benislovas: what about other side of Globe? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the commission might adjust less severely|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If that ruling is upheld, Belarus wins if they make 4@S here|pg||
nt|ritong: like two thirds one third, you know |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Heard Nauru has a very strong team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Congratulations to Lithuania for playing good bridge and duly assisted by Monaco|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ardf10987: I may agree :) But I think basic line was dictated from "quiet" level...:)|pg||
nt|ritong: well..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Passing 2@S is a little wet|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  result rather stands - Jan Romanski realized that N (who made wrong move in trick 2) didn't ask anything, so, rather result on scoreboard is correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Sveta|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So it would not have mattered anyway what N-S did here|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  one more important issue now - 4 top-teams captains' meeting - where the semifinals will be decided |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 dias seems out of my vocabulary|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The best Saulis can do is pass the double, lead @SAK followed by a heart|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: NS got to 3N on 29 in the other room, declarer misguessed @Ds (naturally), 12 imps to Estonia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N had points but no bid, thus the action dbl|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  3@d asks for stopper, 4@d - full exclusion (like singleton or void)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ardf10987: I'm seeing results not very happy for Monaco now... may be my (bad) play influence results also when I'm simply kibitzing :)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: I like the final pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 in a @h contract, so 1nt on EW is OK|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But they are safe|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: is there a break after the first 10 Monika?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Monaco - Lithuania2 - Estonia - Belarus   the likely qualifiers for the semi-finals|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: a good pass. After the bidding, and with only 4@d it´s possible(!) for S to double 2@c- ergo probably a 5-card @d|pg||
