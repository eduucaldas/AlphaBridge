mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: interesting overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 200 new specs. Running scores: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009leaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: normally if you are going to overcall in a 4-card suit, it has to be a GOOD 4-card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room north took the "textbook" line of passing the 1@D opener |pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: he can't have been too pleased to hear his partner's sandwich 1nt overcall (promising the unbid suits)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: good morning...sorry I have information of 10:00 start|pg||
nt|doks: ok new board and some games available for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yextbook much better|pg||
nt|haans: t|pg||
nt|athene: never much fun to show preference with 2-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi William:) Welcome|pg||
nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and that's not a textbook re-opening action either|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: it's routine to open with shortage - even a doubleton|pg||
nt|doks: 1NT shows 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but with three, you have to ask:- why didn't partner do something over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either he has utter rubbish or he has spades|pg||
nt|athene: either way, you might be better-off passing it out|pg||
nt|athene: sorry it's routine to *re*-open with shortage, i meant to say|pg||
nt|peachy: Janis, what does S do if he doesnt have 4H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: 3nt is good as the @CK can't be held up|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I don t like reopen double wit 3 cards in opps suit and no atrengh advantage|pg||
nt|rodal f: W woun't like his X when he see all cards. Es pass can't be for penalty as long as he have K53 himself. PASS all times|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: but of course just looking at the NS cards you don't want to be in 3nt because you expect a heart lead to kill the entry to the clubs|pg||
nt|doks: 1@D promise unbal hand, so different bid|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I dont know their system, thanks!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|athene: sorry 3nt is good as the @CA can't be held up :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have showed his opening. Why tell it twice?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, with Hxx in overcall suit and minimum opener, it's normal to pass|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: That could be a risk William:) Would have made W extra happy|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a fan of the 1@S overcall; prefer pass or 1NT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: this time|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: and prefer pass to 1nt :)|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: result on the table is near ice hockey match|pg||
nt|athene: south in the other room might have considered doubling 4@H surely|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he was worried opps had a better spot (5@D or perhaps 5@C)|pg||

nt|athene: 3nt from west is interesting; you don't expect to be able to use the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so it's a question of whether the diamonds are a trick source|pg||
nt|haans: E will rebid @H|pg||
nt|athene: partner might have @DJx or something if you have been living a good life|pg||
nt|athene: but i wouldn't bet on it|pg||

nt|haans: Hi all and Welcome to 2nd EBL Small Federations Trophy, Vilnius, Lithuania http://sf2009.sportbridge.lt/|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Raijja  Davis my co-comm|pg||
nt|doks: 1@S is not everyone choise with N cards, but Maija basicaly bid 2 @S :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Hans|pg||
nt|doks: hi Hans|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S could cost to much|pg||
nt|doks: I agree, but I know her too long and familar with her methods :)|pg||
nt|haans: make it simple show support|pg||
nt|peachy: or bid 2D, nat and forcing I assume|pg||
nt|doks: now everything is up to EW aggreements|pg||
nt|haans: minor suit slams harder to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: @D easy can be best suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Hopefully something will happen so we get handball resault Ryszard:) Makes it funnier for specs and us|pg||
nt|doks: in open room E and N passesd, W 1@C was Polish style and later W show good hand with 5@H|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT alerted so I assume it shows H support?|pg||
nt|doks: if W open his ugly 11 count is hard to stop below 6th level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: They have got to 6@C in Open|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: sester isn't scared!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: for @H lead??|pg||
nt|haans: very good double|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, Sester wants a heart lead :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Asking for @H, but non at pard:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: Seryi is asking about what double means|pg||
nt|athene: south knows the hearts are going nowhere so the question is simply how good west's minor is that he is hoping to run|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec say: Shure 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: As I understood, he explaiined is just a double considering partner's opening|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: it disclosed after West rebid|pg||
nt|haans: more the hard a certainty|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H = singoff|pg||
nt|doks: now E see all 5 Aces, what to do?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: then 2 NT should be GF with @H support|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: he should ask for 6th Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I think you are right Ryszard|pg||
nt|haans: ask aces find the Q + kings|pg||
nt|haans: well done there|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: Orac allerted 3 clubs....|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 2@S = no spade suit only show stopper in spade|pg||
nt|haans: never never support|pg||
mb|6C|nt|athene: i would have said, looking at west's minor suits, he is surely worried that they lie well for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he isn't hoping north can lead hearts through and he can lead spades back|pg||
nt|athene: that's just fantasy|pg||
nt|athene: how many hearts are in this deck?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: at least 15|pg||
nt|doks: But @D K is at least 3times more valuable, then others, so need good methods here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: most danger for West-East is to land in 7|pg||
nt|haans: no @DK no grand|pg||
nt|peachy: I think they stop safely, have not shown aggressive bidding in this match, why start now:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: can be 4 NT asking for aces???|pg||
nt|doks: 6@H and singlleton @D and grand still good|pg||
nt|haans: i would assume 45@S asking|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S|pg||
nt|doks: if W asking Aces, he is very brave|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 4 @S looks as a cue bid|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The Scientific Method :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: This is bad enough on a spade lead. Levenko has plenty of entries|pg||
nt|athene: heart to ace, diamond to @D10|pg||
nt|rodal f: There are a chance for 9. @H for A and @D hooed by 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he does that, yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: was it heart lead directing for declearer?|pg||
nt|athene: south should have seen that his clubs and diamonds mean west's 6- or 7-card minor is very happy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am more inclined to think he will finesse the queen|pg||
nt|rodal f: hooked|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i think 4 NT was "keep ball in air..."|pg||
nt|doks: so rest in 6@H, next board|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps south doubled to try to induce the run to 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: has to hope two rounds of spades lives|pg||
nt|haans: ruff 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|doks: In this board one team even manage to pass 2@D, so not biding cold slam in other room stil give 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|haans: called dummy reversal|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|haans: you need to know you opponets |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@CN in OR|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C is strong and 2NT is a 4441?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: yes Soth should fell smelling and double this 4 @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West in the other room tried to be cute and let the doomed game make|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|haans: 6@C in OR no 6@H?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: north keeps it simple|pg||
nt|rodal f: Polich club and 1@C show: (11)12-14 balanced - 15+@C - 15+ - 18+any|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer eliminated hearts, drew trumps and took the club finesse. West ducked|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: So 18+ now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 6 @H in OR|pg||
nt|haans: EW must attack spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: now north will find the @HQ and @CK and bid 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S = queen?|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S asks for @HQ; south will bid 6@C showing @HQ, @CK i imagine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then came @CA and another|pg||

pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Sr. Bidding was not ended in OR. 6@H the end there|pg||

nt|rodal f: Well done it is:)|pg||
nt|athene: polish club can be very fragile after intervention|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 9@H is makeable too after J@C finesse|pg||
nt|haans: N did not show @SK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: in the other room it looks very much like a standard Precision auction|pg||
nt|doks: 2@D, 2@S and @C K for defence|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: W attack spades, no 9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: where north has to bid a negative 1@D first and then catch up|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Ok. We make some extra level. But what to give as bonus at level 8 and 9?:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but this is a horrible idea|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, now 9:)|pg||
nt|doks: still only 8 tricks|pg||
