mb|1S|nt|hedyg: why? NS can sac in @c|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: 2NT now|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|sigiuna: 2 NT by systems showing strong hand..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT does not cost more than bidding 3@d|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunate 3@D loses the big club fit|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|doks: no more @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..he can bid 4NT now over 4@s|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: or even 5 @c, but vulnerable it is not advisable to do either|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sigiuna: opening 1 spade is from 5 spades..|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

nt|sigiuna: The running scores: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009runda7.html |pg||
nt|athene: when in with the diamond, north can lead @H10, and south plays @HA and another|pg||
nt|athene: what will declarer do?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can afford to lose 2@hs|pg||
nt|athene: oh sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: just not 3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: i was just wondering if he could diagnose the position and drop the @HQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sigiuna: So they have to play hard and resultive... if they want to try their chance in semifinals..|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to guess that N has 5 @cs|pg||
nt|athene: i think he will know north can't have singleton @H10 as he would surely have led that at trick 1|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|athene: but north could still have @H10x|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: singleton @H would give N a 6-6 hand in minors..|pg||
nt|athene: but with that holding he might exit the small heart not the @H10|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mareczek: he can throw N in with the third @d|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry of course north was void in trumps|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|sJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mareczek: to force heart lead from N|pg||
nt|athene: he might well have a singleton @H10 - except that 0-1-6-6 is even less likely than what he has, of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why declarer should drop the @HQ, anyway|pg||

nt|athene: declarer doesn't know quite how friendly the clubs are|pg||
nt|sigiuna: yes indeed, so he is in hard thinking now :)|pg||
nt|athene: he must play trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in 7@C is a singleton and E falsecarded the 9@C with the 8?|pg||
nt|doks: this slow play will allow us see comparisons for all other boards|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely imo|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: well he wont make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he decided that if the club lead really was a singleton, he couldn't survive|pg||
nt|athene: because east could surely get the lead in hearts to deliver the ruff, even if he didn't have the ace of trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: so then 9@c from E would have been preferential for @H to give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|mareczek: if the lead would be from singleton, the defenders would not rather duck a trump|pg||
nt|athene: but playing this way might risk defeat when the lead was a doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: if west had @SAxx and no more clubs he might duck the first trump|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a singleton @c W might have jumped with A@s and played @H for  ruff and down|pg||
nt|athene: hoping his partner could signal suit preference in trumps to say which red suit to lead?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|d5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@c already is suit preference|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but with three, you have to ask:- why didn't partner do something over 1@S?|pg||

nt|viren169: shame...|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|athene: but of course just looking at the NS cards you don't want to be in 3nt because you expect a heart lead to kill the entry to the clubs|pg||

nt|doks: opponents bid game, U see 12 points in Your hand, partner ussualy have not a lot of points|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: W is thinking|pg||
nt|athene: if you are marking west's leads out of ten maybe it's:- @S-6, @H-5, @C-4, @D-0 :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|doks: @S 98 is happy moment for E|pg||
nt|doks: W|pg||
nt|hedyg: S might duck this|pg||
nt|athene: the @SQ would only give a trick away, usually, if dummy held three spades, but in that case he would probably have bid 4@S not 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|doks: S! cout is clear, so @S 6 must be suit preference|pg||
nt|doks: @S count|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: dummy is screaming @C and 5@ss known in S..|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe E thinks his pd lead from AQJ and needs him to play @s back|pg||
nt|hedyg: that K@H from E didnt help W|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: well, maybe east feels he can afford to lie, since the @S6 was truthful :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|sigiuna: Round 9 - the first round after dinner will start at 17.00 by Lithuania time..|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 then @S7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|sigiuna: and after this match we will have a break for dinner :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe he felt the club shift was sufficiently blindingly obvious there was no need|pg||
nt|hedyg: so -2 here|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: result on the table is near ice hockey match|pg||
nt|athene: south in the other room might have considered doubling 4@H surely|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he was worried opps had a better spot (5@D or perhaps 5@C)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer the 2@D response to the 3@D in Open- even if it means this type of flat board|pg||
nt|haans: yes only card for 2|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|doks: another promising result for Latvia in open room|pg||
nt|mamos: nothing has gone well for EW in this set (apart perhaps from 25)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Running scores    http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009runda5.html|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt from west is interesting; you don't expect to be able to use the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so it's a question of whether the diamonds are a trick source|pg||
nt|haans: E will rebid @H|pg||
nt|athene: partner might have @DJx or something if you have been living a good life|pg||
nt|athene: but i wouldn't bet on it|pg||
nt|peachy: after W opens, they will do same here|pg||
nt|haans: Hi all and Welcome to 2nd EBL Small Federations Trophy, Vilnius, Lithuania http://sf2009.sportbridge.lt/|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Raijja  Davis my co-comm|pg||
nt|doks: 1@S is not everyone choise with N cards, but Maija basicaly bid 2 @S :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Hans|pg||
nt|doks: hi Hans|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S could cost to much|pg||
nt|doks: I agree, but I know her too long and familar with her methods :)|pg||
nt|haans: make it simple show support|pg||
nt|peachy: or bid 2D, nat and forcing I assume|pg||
nt|doks: now everything is up to EW aggreements|pg||
nt|haans: minor suit slams harder to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: @D easy can be best suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Hopefully something will happen so we get handball resault Ryszard:) Makes it funnier for specs and us|pg||
nt|doks: in open room E and N passesd, W 1@C was Polish style and later W show good hand with 5@H|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT alerted so I assume it shows H support?|pg||
nt|doks: if W open his ugly 11 count is hard to stop below 6th level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: They have got to 6@C in Open|pg||
nt|viren169: 15-17 NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@C likely to be 5 card ask|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: sester isn't scared!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: for @H lead??|pg||
nt|haans: very good double|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, Sester wants a heart lead :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Asking for @H, but non at pard:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: Seryi is asking about what double means|pg||
nt|athene: south knows the hearts are going nowhere so the question is simply how good west's minor is that he is hoping to run|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec say: Shure 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: As I understood, he explaiined is just a double considering partner's opening|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: it disclosed after West rebid|pg||
nt|haans: more the hard a certainty|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H = singoff|pg||
nt|doks: now E see all 5 Aces, what to do?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: then 2 NT should be GF with @H support|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: he should ask for 6th Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I think you are right Ryszard|pg||
nt|haans: ask aces find the Q + kings|pg||
nt|haans: well done there|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: Orac allerted 3 clubs....|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 2@S = no spade suit only show stopper in spade|pg||
nt|haans: never never support|pg||
nt|haans: respones lighter and lighter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would have said, looking at west's minor suits, he is surely worried that they lie well for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he isn't hoping north can lead hearts through and he can lead spades back|pg||
nt|athene: that's just fantasy|pg||
nt|athene: how many hearts are in this deck?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: at least 15|pg||
nt|doks: But @D K is at least 3times more valuable, then others, so need good methods here|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont find flat 8 counts very productive oppoite 15-17|pg||
nt|viren169: pass is probably best over 15-17|pg||
nt|haans: nor me|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe they are playing 16-18|pg||
nt|haans: losÃ­ng to bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ryskiel_: most danger for West-East is to land in 7|pg||
nt|haans: no @DK no grand|pg||
nt|peachy: I think they stop safely, have not shown aggressive bidding in this match, why start now:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: can be 4 NT asking for aces???|pg||
nt|doks: 6@H and singlleton @D and grand still good|pg||
nt|haans: i would assume 45@S asking|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S|pg||
nt|doks: if W asking Aces, he is very brave|pg||
nt|haans: they may go down in 2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no15-17 I listen|pg||
nt|viren169: would you bid 2@C with a 44xx shape and an 8 count over 15-17 NT?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: 4 @S looks as a cue bid|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The Scientific Method :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: do like the body|pg||
nt|frankaus: if opener has 4@H then game is quite possible|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: This is bad enough on a spade lead. Levenko has plenty of entries|pg||
nt|athene: heart to ace, diamond to @D10|pg||
nt|rodal f: There are a chance for 9. @H for A and @D hooed by 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he does that, yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: was it heart lead directing for declearer?|pg||
nt|athene: south should have seen that his clubs and diamonds mean west's 6- or 7-card minor is very happy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am more inclined to think he will finesse the queen|pg||
nt|rodal f: hooked|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i think 4 NT was "keep ball in air..."|pg||
nt|doks: so rest in 6@H, next board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: but perhaps south doubled to try to induce the run to 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: has to hope two rounds of spades lives|pg||
nt|haans: ruff 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|doks: In this board one team even manage to pass 2@D, so not biding cold slam in other room stil give 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|viren169: lots of specs like 2@C with 4-4 in the majs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|haans: called dummy reversal|pg||
nt|haans: yes only think that can make be respone to 1nt if looking for major game|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: well done|pg||
nt|rodal f: Serious Roland? After Ns opening|pg||
nt|viren169: otherwise a pass... I tend to agree with that strategy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|ryskiel_: now in BaM I as declearer change contract on 6 NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in matchpoints 8 PC is a problem, in imps I think we sholud try to agreed mayor suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: likelyhood of 4-4 fit is over 60%|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|haans: say that again and they bid with 7|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: very lucky 3-3 with the @DJ onside|pg||
nt|frankaus: so here play 2@C NF stayman , 3@C puppet style GF stayman , works 4 me|pg||

nt|athene: on a very bad day you might lose @HK, @DA and two clubs, but this isn't a very bad day|pg||
mb|2S|nt|doks: but good guess in @S for overtrick in closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: but E bid in CR making it easier for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: south has seven losers; might just bid 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: here guessing 3-1 is harder|pg||
nt|athene: but if he just invites, north will bid game of cours|pg||
nt|athene: course|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|doks: some method used here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT can be asking..or short suit gametry|pg||
nt|doks: ok next board|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on methods|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: if short suit gametry N could relay with 3@c asking which suit is short|pg||
nt|sigiuna: 2 NT asking for values of hand (shortness for example) and inviting to slam bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: so 4@S shows a maximum with no shortage, i assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st problem solved with lead|pg||

nt|haans: agree with you if not 2@H pass|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW nonvul against vul|pg||

mb|3D|nt|athene: very hard for NS|pg||
nt|haans: good 2@H|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Having closed the eyes and bid 6 on last hand can they do it again?|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit thin on values|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they are both on the borderline of entering the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this time they Blackwood|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont like 1@D and then 3@D  if you think 3@D is a good idea do it bfore they find a fit|pg||
nt|frankaus: transfer advances is the next leap forward in bidding evolution IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: MonikaB: no dbl would mean no majors, 1spade would mean 4 hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: I like these reverse majs!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|doks: pre onece again|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Maja is brave player|pg||
nt|haans: par is 5@Sx|pg||
nt|doks: You even don't know how brave|pg||
nt|peachy: power of dblfit ew, only W knows it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but each has a weak major which makes a double unattractive|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@s slightly conservative|pg||
nt|doks: in open room 1@H-3@D showing supp in @H and 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: agree bid all you can then pass|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mareczek: partner should also be on black suits for the double of 2@d|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Undo required|pg||
nt|haans: S bid 6@S?|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H = 5  spades i guess|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S = 4 card support|pg||
nt|mamos: a nice start for declarer|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1 @H show 4+@S|pg||
nt|haans: and finesse in spades|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Or well done by EW.|pg||
nt|peachy: i dont like this bidding, no matter how successful|pg||
nt|doks: so now par is reached|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|nt|ryskiel_: 3rd floor bid is lucky for Ukrainians|pg||
nt|haans: 3 imps to Lithunia|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4|pg||
nt|haans: yep 4|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: four for Latvia|pg||
nt|doks: or even 11 if E bid 6|pg||
nt|mareczek: if N bids 4@s immediately, East has first problem... he would probably bid 5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: E might still overrule, slam is only on finesse|pg||
nt|mareczek: then pass.  pass and 5@s|pg||
nt|haans: 2 finesse one iin clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mareczek: another problem for East - he will probably pass - good values, spade singleton|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H overcall may @DK be wrong|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|peachy: has diam, dont need club|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mareczek: and pass.  pass. West also has not an obvious bid - spade ace, diamond fit... can bid 6|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: Karpov didn't pre-empt in the other room|pg||
nt|peachy: but of course after Hfin lose, then has to guess cl|pg||
nt|mareczek: but still happy end for NS|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Rubins sightseeing deeply|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time from opps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But declarer has no choice when @CA is offside|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He needs the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, the only way is the best way|pg||
nt|haans: sometimes the winning way :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|viren169: looks like we may have a lesson in restricted choice...|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well as pointed out by specs, if trumps ar 2-2 @D finesse not required, which argues that declarer might have tested trupms first as a @D lead fro E when in wit the @CA would ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: certainly test him|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H looks beatable|pg||

nt|athene: so the emphasis is on safety at trick 1|pg||

nt|viren169: will N xfer into hearts over 1NT?|pg||
nt|mamos: Wikipedia says Truscott first to write but I'd guess Whist players must have known the idea even if not the terminology  - I love some of the non-bridge examples|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: should...when it is better then pass|pg||
nt|haans: as always you are right|pg||
nt|haans: jornalist tend to come first|pg||
nt|haans: do not know why :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|haans: 6@C in OR no 6@H?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: north keeps it simple|pg||
nt|rodal f: Polich club and 1@C show: (11)12-14 balanced - 15+@C - 15+ - 18+any|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer eliminated hearts, drew trumps and took the club finesse. West ducked|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So 18+ now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 6 @H in OR|pg||
nt|haans: EW must attack spades|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|athene: now north will find the @HQ and @CK and bid 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S = queen?|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S asks for @HQ; south will bid 6@C showing @HQ, @CK i imagine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then came @CA and another|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Which is correct no matter who has @CK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Sr. Bidding was not ended in OR. 6@H the end there|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: now north will bid 7@H, or possibly 8@H|pg||
nt|haans: to late|pg||
nt|peachy: shouldnt make|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|ryskiel_: decl hav nt 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: 6@C confirm the Q+K@C|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if they would have got there if west had pre-empted|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well done it is:)|pg||
nt|athene: polish club can be very fragile after intervention|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 9@H is makeable too after J@C finesse|pg||
nt|haans: N did not show @SK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: in the other room it looks very much like a standard Precision auction|pg||
nt|doks: 2@D, 2@S and @C K for defence|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: W attack spades, no 9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: where north has to bid a negative 1@D first and then catch up|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ok. We make some extra level. But what to give as bonus at level 8 and 9?:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: but this is a horrible idea|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, now 9:)|pg||
nt|doks: still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: right you are all only 8|pg||
nt|peachy: should be 8, but who knows|pg||
nt|doks: unfortunatly for NS, but maybe this is not the end|pg||
nt|viren169: need to switch to a spade pretty soon..|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: why Seryj don t continue diammonds?|pg||
nt|viren169: too late...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: now 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure I like trump lead on that sort of auction|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|athene: if you have a positive, show it right away|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: as Roland say this contract can not be made|pg||
nt|viren169: and the trump continuation doesnt seem right...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: easy defence changed on very bad defence|pg||

nt|athene: 1@H or 2@H for east?|pg||
nt|doks: and final board, big thanks for organizers, BBO and colleagues for this interesting event|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: much harder now for NS|pg||
nt|sigiuna: thanks to commentators for their hard work.. and kibs for attending..|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: south can double|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree not to pass with an ace as W|pg||
mb|p|nt|sigiuna: See each other after 1,5 our..|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|hedyg: and thanks to our excellent operator!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sigiuna: indeed, it is very hard work...|pg||
nt|athene: south plays 3nt through in his mind and can see it won't be good on heart lead|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: because he expects east to have an entry (@CA or @CK)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@H -2, worth a double by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S too passive IMO|pg||
nt|sigiuna: no double no trouble...|pg||
nt|athene: well he needs partner to have spade card too|pg||
nt|hedyg: though N could have bid on his 1st turn|pg||
pc|d6|nt|doks: these undertricks is very cheep, so big win for LITHUANIA, congrats|pg||
nt|athene: once again we see that opening and responding makes it hard for opps to bid game|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: if south doubled 2@S, north might bid 3NT|pg||
nt|sigiuna: after 9 boards they remembered their aggresive style of bidding...|pg||
nt|athene: he might trust his partner to have a heart card|pg||
nt|doks: game of course is a bit lucky, 6-2@H and @CA  well placed|pg||

nt|hedyg: showing anger at the table is not really good for a partnership|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|s9|pg||

nt|haans: yes impossible 1@D died long time ago|pg||
nt|viren169: last board coming up...|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 3N for N/S here|pg||
nt|mamos: NS have lots of points|pg||
mb|1H|nt|doks: now last board, but Latvia got nice win at the end|pg||
nt|viren169: and lots of tricks!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no chnac eon @H lead?|pg||
nt|viren169: by ducking a heart|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: only 5@C|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead @CA elsewere|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ok|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: but they probaly ended in 3 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: East has made it difficult for N/S |pg||
nt|viren169: but should still reach 3N|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dble-2@H-3@C-3 NT|pg||
nt|haans: never difficult to bid 3n|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: such result (38:19) is named in Poland "piggy draw"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did East overtake partner's @D10??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't understand a word|pg||
nt|frankaus: 26+ zars so opening by E is recomended|pg||
nt|viren169: Now the club A is likely to be wrong but Declarer will just have to close their eyes and duck and hope!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Last board are up. Thx to the supperb vug operator Juste, EBU - BBO and al there helpers, sponsors - The Lithunian Bridge Federation and there helpers - specs for ure inputs|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@d probably Precision style|pg||
nt|haans: who understand|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East needs to insert the 8 and play back the Q to make life a little difficult|pg||
nt|haans: they must have talked about balancing doubles|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ryskiel_: now result looks as in 1st quarter Basketball match|pg||
nt|athene: should be flat board here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Both teams behind|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The movie shows the overtake - but I in company with a legion of specs would like confirmation?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT by S it's easy to duck 1 @H then hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: defence set up diamonds, declarer knocks out a black ace and defence cash six|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 3@H in real life is little high, but no problems here |pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2 NT could be very ekspensive bid when North have something as Qx @H|pg||
nt|viren169: yes well done on the bidding...|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: 3@H to agressive|pg||
