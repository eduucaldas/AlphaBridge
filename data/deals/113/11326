mb|1S|nt|vugraphzxk: Hello everybody on this mach|pg||
nt|mareczek: In the final we can see two best teams of the Round Robin|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hello|pg||
nt|brolucius: East is on the borderline for showing a 'strong' spade raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: We are expecting interesting play|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C would be stronger than 2@S, showing a sound raise.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: Olanski is from Poland but has been representing Lithuania for more than five years|pg||
nt|gracelin: I wonder what system NS play that will allow a 1C opening by the south hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd seat, Patrick, everything goes|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mareczek: third hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is the Ferdinand system, where you open on almost any old rubbish when third in hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: ok, got it|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzxk: Allavena changed his bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A very complicated-looking sequence on some simple hands. E/W will want to reach 4@S on these values. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: probably 2@h was some kind of trransfer to hearts|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@c, sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: And South's double showed 3-card support.|pg||
nt|mareczek: and 2@h max of passed hand with @s fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is this the Lithuanian team that entered the competition at the last minute when Malta had to call off?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mareczek: yes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|mareczek: there is the roumor that if they win, they will sent to Malta the box of famous 999 Liothuanian vodka|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  NS take few minutes to discuss EW system and countermeasures|pg||
nt|sigiuna: and the last match of round robin..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Monaco as leader after round robin took Belarus for semifinal|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  play starts in few minutes - both pairs take their time to get detailed description of opps' systems|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: re Hi:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we have new N and other NS system - based on Polish club|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sfoxa:  Giannarigo Rona, EBL President and new elected WBF President arrived last night and attended the semifinals opening ceremony to address to all the participants with greeting words|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  He congratuled the players with the results already achieved by them and underlined the importance of the event. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sigiuna: Monako is the leaders, Estonian team on the third place|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: if North opening is only weak S should pass....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: Hello|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes a typical drury sequence. |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Play would not be a problem-cards placement very friendly|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Talking about small bridge federations Monaco surely qulifies; wonder how many members?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Qualifies*|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  As by his words, EBL will do its best to make next edition of the Small Feds to the real European Championship|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Great scoring program devised by Jan Romanski of Poland|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Jan is also the chief TD in Vilnius|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  could be to high already|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  in CC of NS 2-meaning multi is mentioned - either weak-two in major or 23-24 balanced|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: with the @SA well placed, lose 2 trumps and a club|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: just take care to ruff a @H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so we have an easy game for the start - just right for the players to overcome starting nerves|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: after this lead 5 @D makeable but needs some skilfull in declearer play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In a group match I think Lithuania won from Monaco|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|brolucius: tricks.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, indeed, and under opponent's interferences|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|brolucius: South might have stretched to 1NT, rating his spades as being worth more than 6 points over the opener.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South will now insist on game.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Excellent 1NT response when non-vulnerable. In my view it would be a crime to pass|pg||
nt|mareczek: may be 3@s would work better than 1nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It might|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: They play forsing 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't be forcing, can it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: not will probably find a bid even if West jump to 3S|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT is less risky when forcing (which is presumably the case, since it is marked as conventional).|pg||
nt|mareczek: Allavena hase made the balance of the PC at the table|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: 2NT was rather cautious. Luckily for South, North has enough extra points to advance to game.|pg||
nt|gracelin: the real trick to shut out NS is to respond 2H with the west hand.  |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: But it is risky and you might go for some very big number if the train goes off the rails in some unpredictable way.|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: S has a nice hand...|pg||

nt|vugraphzxk: now they are laffing about A of hards.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|brolucius: It seems that 6@S will succeed on a @DK lead. Declarer can ditch his clubs, whether East ruffs the third heart high or low.|pg||
nt|gracelin: after north learns that south has a spade suit, guess he will gamble 6H.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mareczek: lead directing double|pg||
mb|p!|nt|brolucius: So that puts paid to a spade slam, as the cards lie.|pg||
nt|mareczek: It will be difficult for NS to stop before slam|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mareczek: I can predict 6@h doubled 2 down after spade lead|pg||
nt|mareczek: As I am a fan of Lithuanian team|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mareczek: 3@d = @D + club fit|pg||

mb|4C|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Eas will be squeezed throw-in if he doesn't cash his club trick.  But I am sure he will.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Marek's prediction wll come true :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has made a Lightner Double, as was predicted, suggesting a void somewhere and inviting partner to guess where the void is. Usually it is in dummy's first-bid suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I also predict 500 now.|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, 300 only|pg||
nt|brolucius: A wily kibitzer suggests that North might have retreated to 6@S when the Lightner Double came, hoping for good spades opposite.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h2|nt|gracelin: but why S8 ?|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: WE have 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 42 to 6, is no competition in 8 boards:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: A flat board I guess|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 3 @S?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ryskiel_: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  NS allowed W making 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see the show here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  1@h from 4 cards, 3@c nat, with fit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: look as 11 imps for Monaco|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so it is|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ryskiel_: 3 NT is makeable - 4 @S,2@H,2@D and 1@C|pg||
nt|mmmakela: universal 450 however u play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree-no comments|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well small now and again small on club return and ruff|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rarely played contract 1 in a suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed, you are right|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2D!|nt|gracelin: 6H for EW|pg||
nt|mareczek: EW can make 6@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very difficult to bid.|pg||
nt|mareczek: but very hard to reach it|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|d|mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Again, I don't like the double of 2@H. Why not show a primary fit for hearts? |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: NS can sacrifice 7@d 4 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: The Italian may find a 4D cue with the West hand, and after East's 5C, slam is bid.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East had bid 4@H instead, which he was worth opposite a vulnerable Michaels bid, West might have thought of a slam. Probably not, but there would have been a chance.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Marco Catellani|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2NT opening by NS promises 21-22, so, 1@c from S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a slam as a change. Can they bid it?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: keep the fingers crossed:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: 3@d for me as S|pg||
mb|4D|an|majors 5+5+|nt|sfoxa:  real disaster in OR - EW found their way to @c game...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: low pointwise so hard to bid I suppose|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rnmalik: now possible 4@H again 5@D would show void|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ardf10987: Hi all. I normally play with Fissore... but I can see now it's all better (without me) :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Marco|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in such form Monaco became as favorite team in Open ECh|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hi Marco, don't apply self-critizism - who knows how it could be with you :-)|pg||
nt|minnie lee: can this be right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardf10987: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: again, NS can make 12 tricks -- and again, it's a poor slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N made it easier for E|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And N-S forgot to save in 7@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: actually they will do well to get to 5 i think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd bet for bidding mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-800|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ardf10987: yes, bad slam... and restricted choice in @D not good here...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  but if you are able to bid such one, you must be Deep Finess to bring it home|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this contract looks like normal one|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: i would prefer 3@H as S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N thinking if 4@D is 5/5 then has 3 @C and with @C with him thought has a play|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: Indeed. The auction in the other room was without arms and legs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm told, E in OR bid 2@c answering partner's 1@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: I like I @D opening made in OR, sometimes the lower opening is more pre-emtive|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sfoxa:  even after bi-color double?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  applied by E|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: sure -- to describe my hand|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: @Ds had been agreed i guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they reached 3NT (not unreasonable), but W pulled to 4@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: saying you have an opening hand strongly suggests opps don't have slam|pg||
mc|12|nt|sfoxa:  3@s played by E at the table|pg||

But little to gain for the risk involved. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: just for lead directing may worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also to frighten them away from 3NT.|pg||

nt|babyla:  ...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: North's raise to 3NT suggests a balanced hand, so West could have told that East would be short in diamonds.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This final is divided into two halves of 10 boards. There will be a short-ish break after this board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My estimate is 20 minutes. They are on board 8 in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: and we have to wait on another table - they are playing very slow|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: A club switch, difficult to find, will knock out the entry to the long diamond.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cK|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: but that C9 is a big signal, maybe C10 is even more demanding.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  few imps for NS|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s cold here, possible 12 swing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good for the match:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 3 NT lay down after natural @D lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this board could bring some imps for Belarus if NS avoid @c slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: tricky board. Caution required|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  last board tonight|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And Monaco has 10 IMPs less than shown on the scoreboard?|pg||
nt|ritong: then the contested board comes into the picture|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  bid and beaten next door|pg||
nt|ritong: that is the TD decision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: the commission might adjust less severely|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: If that ruling is upheld, Belarus wins if they make 4@S here|pg||
nt|ritong: like two thirds one third, you know |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ardf10987: I may agree :) But I think basic line was dictated from "quiet" level...:)|pg||
nt|ritong: well..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Passing 2@S is a little wet|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  result rather stands - Jan Romanski realized that N (who made wrong move in trick 2) didn't ask anything, so, rather result on scoreboard is correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Sveta|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So it would not have mattered anyway what N-S did here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dbl now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: D or 3@d|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  one more important issue now - 4 top-teams captains' meeting - where the semifinals will be decided |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 dias seems out of my vocabulary|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The best Saulis can do is pass the double, lead @SAK followed by a heart|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|xenya: NS got to 3N on 29 in the other room, declarer misguessed @Ds (naturally), 12 imps to Estonia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N had points but no bid, thus the action dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  3@d asks for stopper, 4@d - full exclusion (like singleton or void)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ardf10987: I'm seeing results not very happy for Monaco now... may be my (bad) play influence results also when I'm simply kibitzing :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I like the final pass|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: although allavena went down inexplicably, so he must be sweating right now, if not in front of a computer watching this:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But they are safe|pg||
nt|sigiuna: Leaders Monaco are relaxed.. They sure about playing in semifinals.. they are not indeed interesting in tough battle|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: is there a break after the first 10 Monika?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Monaco - Lithuania2 - Estonia - Belarus   the likely qualifiers for the semi-finals|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: a good pass. After the bidding, and with only 4@d it´s possible(!) for S to double 2@c- ergo probably a 5-card @d|pg||
