nt|haans: and we start with a part score|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: EW some spades?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: I expect East will pass, after due consideration.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||
nt|sharkey: surprised S passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: that i did not understand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2Â° suit...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: East has nothing attractive to do, but (let's hope) he will soon select something or other. Yes, a trump.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: trumps now, and trump after @d ace|pg||
nt|mareczek: reduces declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: no - N's opening though I understand...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|haans: continue this way and EW win :)|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|xenya: but it must be a difficult hand for their methods|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|xenya: playing WJS, it might be easier -- 1@D -- 2@S -- all pass|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ardf10987: If some declarer has to be "reduced", why not me... (over 100kg) :) I would be happy :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c5|nt|brolucius: I mentioned earlier that E/W were unlikely to concede an early 13 IMPs. It seems that Vainikonis is equally determined not to concede even 1 IMP.  His trump plays have worked well.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: I haven't seen a 2@C opener like this before - normally shows an opening hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: But S had a raise regardless|pg||

pc|sA|pc|h5|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: if 2@C did show clubs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: In my experience, every extra kg represents a considerable amount of pleasure.  |pg||

mb|5C|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|mareczek: 5@c worked very well\|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|mareczek: with week hand fit, bid immediately as high as it seems sensible|pg||
nt|haans: strongly agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - N hand has no defence|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anyone for 4@S on the East hand first time?|pg||
nt|haans: doubles are gettin rarer and rarer|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mareczek: Direct 4@s would work much better than 1@s|pg||
nt|mareczek: WE play Polish club|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@d is limited to max 16-17 PC|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: ty very much|pg||
nt|mareczek: so slam chances are not to high|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|brolucius: That 3NT might possibly be the 'early 13 IMPs' that I mentioned. If Lithuania end in 4@H and go down on the club ruff.|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@c - Polish club - natural 15+, balanced 12-14 or strong - 18+, any distribution|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: Gdansk must mean polish team?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mareczek: 2@d - majors|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anything higher than the 2 level spells problems here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: On Board 12, the Closed Room is also in 3NT. Well bid.|pg||
nt|mareczek: trump lead once again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: W has bid take out for majors - so 4@h was out of question|pg||
nt|ardf10987: 1@C not garanting suit prevent 3@C bid fromWest...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: repeat bidding @S suit?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|sharkey: http://vilniuscup.sportbridge.lt/|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D denies 4 card Major?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: West has been a bit passive in the auction. Why should 3@C not be a worthwhile spot? I realise that his partner is likely to be 12-14 balanced but he may hold some clubs in that.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ardf10987: May be also 3nt can be "stolen" in some way... 1@S 3@H 1@D 4@C... but I admit is near double dummy...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: might even make on soft defence|pg||
mc|6|nt|brolucius: No need to strain for the stars. It was not good to allow a 5-3 fit to play when E/W had in fact a 5-4 club fit.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some pairs would double 1@D only when they held both majors. With one major, they would bid it (on 4 cards or 5). That might help E/W to contest on some hands instead of selling ...|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mareczek: South was lucky|pg||

nt|mareczek: he took the risk of playing 3NT with 21 PC and potential misfit|pg||
nt|mareczek: hoping that club suit will work also in NT|pg||
nt|mareczek: but heart fit improved his chances|pg||

nt|sharkey: may be Daiva can find out|pg||
nt|haans: id say asking for stopper. Normally you show stopper in one of their suits |pg||
nt|haans: so east did wrong?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I dont know - S has relayed with 2@D |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS in the optimal contract - advantageous lead - why call Director - must be EW|pg||
nt|haans: just a relay meaning some acceptance for dim but do not show that suit|pg||
nt|haans: 'if dim are your suit you may pass'|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - S has 17 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: 3clubs were alerted bad|pg||
nt|sharkey: He'll bid 3 NT alone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: partner thought that with diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: Better 1NT - 2@H and... if you want to look for IMPs, bid 4@H.|pg||

nt|vugraphzxk: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009frunda2.html running scores for both matches|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: 3 NT North-South?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: We didnt get the whole story - sry|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, no problem. We could see what was going to happen. He could make the low trumps for 620.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@S is enough, facing a passed hand.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Don't know if that decision will stand - strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Pass would be too greedy, perhaps allowing competition in clubs.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: On some deals, it would work well to win with the ace, so West could not ruff a diamond honour on the second round. Here the defenders have plenty of communication, though.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1NT South because 2/1 is GF|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead makes it easy|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: ask and we will give you the score Ask whenever|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: Why did N bid 3 NT without exploring if pd has 4@S?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|haans: maybe 2@C denied spades?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sharkey: If playing Polish club he has a clear reverse bid|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||

nt|haans: have info from an estonia both play Strong Clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: So Gdansk team will win this match|pg||
