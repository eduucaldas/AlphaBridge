nt|lestergold: maybe i spoke prematurely - i think declarer is better to continue as he started and try hearts first|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you have to bid 3N for it to roll in - otherwise it is just an overtrick or two :) |pg||
nt|april7: Hi everybody and good afternoon|pg||

nt|nicksan: Yes I looked through it later....you where even right on some occations...lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: so kind Nick- still dont understand why you played a small club and not the Jack|pg||
nt|april7: N might come in after the 1NT overcall with 2 @H, but critical|pg||
nt|nicksan: Ah! N/S an internatinal Swedish pair...and former team mates of mine!|pg||
nt|lestergold: that means they cant play toi save their lives i assume|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west plays chess doesnt he?|pg||
nt|nicksan: I'll ignore that...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mats Axdorph    Jonny Ã–stberg    is it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: it was, but ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Nick its well known that most of my comments are to be ignored|pg||
nt|nicksan: So i hear...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im the court jester|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, this is pairs, not teams, it seems |pg||
nt|lestergold: to cover up my bad bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland says its imp scoring maybe butler?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Invitational Pairs (IMPs) I write in my e-mail. I wonder what that means|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we don't actually read your e-mails, Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile Roland you dealt this hand obviously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||
nt|april7: If W should play 1NT, then he might go down, except on @D lead|pg||
nt|nicksan: Perhaps they don't find out what kind of scoring until after the event?|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellmy usual comp= why do i believe roland dealt this hand virtual  lithunian dried fish to first spec who tells me why|pg||
nt|nicksan: Clue: it's not because one side has 19 and the other 21...|pg||
nt|lestergold: comp already one by a spec -its a 20/20 hand|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And the operator can't find the lead because South is declarer in 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: upgrade reasonable and 2d was transfer from north not a lunacy from west?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: undo please|pg||
nt|april7: so they play weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed   and North bid 2@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: what meaning 2D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, they play 15-17 NT and South upgraded|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|nicksan: Two trumps, two diamonds and a spade to lose?|pg||
nt|lestergold: this looks like losing 3H a spade and two diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry only two trumps so will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very tame trump layout|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: if the defence can lead four rounds of spades there might be a trump promotion for an extra trick|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: er declarer has untamed the layout|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: did he really playthis misere heart from hand/|pg||
mc|7|nt|lestergold: well absurd i didnt understand that|pg||

mb|2N|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S from North, surely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: west cant be frightened of 4S why not venture 4c he has a good hand opposite a minor two suiter|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence gets the ruff with the singleton trump (as usual)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: W can even make 5 @C on good guesses in @C and @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C isn't so good opposite five clubs - no fitting cards in the minors|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if the defence can lead trumps, you may be struggling|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i like the pressure his pard has mad this bid at unfavourable and one would expect the suiutsto be long or good and u hav equity in opps bidding 4S and going fo a  penalty|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: yes, that's the upside|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: even if N goes down it might be a good score|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: in these matches the balanc between controlled aggression/ risk is very fine but you do not win unless you push the boat out to the maximum|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: long thinkink and now asking about leads and discards...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|april7: unfortunate N can't go to dummy to take a second finesse in @S and has to go 1 down|pg||

nt|lestergold: spades for e/w dims fo N/S part score battle here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3S can be made if the clubs are guessed|pg||
nt|april7: 3d hand opening and NS might play in a @D partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless West opens a weak two or equivalent |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d of course for N/S so there is every possibility of a swing on this hand|pg||
nt|april7: 9 tricks in 3@D by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: OK llets start|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: a bad hand for inverted minors by @S so he will bid 1 NT and then raise @D if EW come in|pg||
nt|april7: South not @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: commnetator's curse at it again|pg||
nt|nicksan: Just as predicted!|pg||

nt|lestergold: weve both been ignored Avram|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: Nick is wiser he kept his mouth shut|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it is dangerous and comes with no guarantees|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: the third best contract here by anyone|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: it was diffiult for east to come in over a heart of course|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nicksan: West surprisingly quiet with his nice suit, agree.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but will roll in because of the nice diamond behaviour|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: as someone said once, better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and remove all doubt  |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|april7: but not at the 2 level vuln.!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: and equally well difficult in the pass out position|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: net result is that N/S have done well to buy this without competition|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hT|pc|d7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|april7: W should have ruffed this with the 8 of @H|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the diamond forces the 8th trick|pg||
nt|april7: why didn't W take the Q of @C?|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: not the most challenging defence of all time|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: pretensions from Gonca to partner about play|pg||
pg||

nt|april7: only if N opens|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nicksan: He would have to play it well....|pg||
nt|lestergold: two finesses 25% or thereabouts well above Roland's requiem,ents especially when both are right|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Do you agree that you must lose a trick to @CA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes you are saying that ity has no play|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Do you also agree that it's impossible to play the trump suit for no loser?|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: i couldnt play it for no loser but i dont have ur magic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not impossible, but it requires a certain amount of defensive error|pg||
nt|nicksan: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: now short break again|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes on that basis it qualifies for a roland slam|pg||
pg||

nt|nicksan: And as Mike will no doubt point out - both sides can make slam in their best fit...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might start 1@S by North, 1N by South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and then West will need considerable intestinal fortitude to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am willing to concede that this is a part score hand|pg||
nt|nicksan: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: how are our non native english speakers going to understand intestinal fortitude|pg||
nt|april7: if N opens 1@S then EW might get to a @D partial losing 2 @S and 1 @C  and 1 @D or 3@S and 1 @C |pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt whether most nativ english would understand it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, "guts" seems a bit common|pg||
nt|nicksan: E-W will go plus defending 1 NT as well..|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: didn't anticipate double....|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats a modern double at unfavourable|pg||
nt|april7: some odd bidding on this table I guess!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: obviously east belongs to the i HAVE 4 HEARTS AND AN OP0ENING BID PARD SCHOOL OF THOUGHT REGARDLESS OF THE REST OF MY LOUSY SHAPE|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|april7: now they go overboard|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: sorry caps lock acident|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: have you borrowed Geoffrey Wolfarth's keyboard, Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive got a great one of my own thx|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cant stop bidding for some reason|pg||
nt|april7: last chance to pass!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The ones without a Caps Lock key are cheaper, Mike. Bye one|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe the reason was the takeout double |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or  buy  even|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: oh east cant stop might have made 3D altho it should be defeated by spade spade ruff club and then uppercut|pg||
nt|nicksan: Needs a heart lead. Unfortunately, South has got one...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: i think 3N always makes because if south leads a club declarer will keep him out of ever enjoying th long clubs|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: but perhaps it  cant be made in any case|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nicksan: I was just going to correct myself and say that it probably never makes... |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East can't duck a heart|pg||
nt|april7: 8 of @H and down you go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: has to hope they are 5-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: they will come|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north has just given declarer a tempo |pg||
nt|nicksan: He can, but then N/S has five tricks if given a diamond...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: he better swirch back to hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||

pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: yes, but it was his only chance to make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: i think 2 level as the limit here- they would have almost certainly found thekilling defence against 3D|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: this could end in 5@C, which has a slight flaw|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: where is this auction going?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|april7: another partial,4@C by E is max but perhaps 3NT  could be stolen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: oh well, so much for that |pg||
nt|lestergold: all on the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: non spade lead it makes|pg||
nt|nicksan: Will North notice that South didn't double 3 @S, and try something else?|pg||
nt|april7: its for N|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: changed the mind|pg||
nt|nicksan: Before or after he saw dummy's singleton king?|pg||
nt|lestergold: you mean he hovered with a spade and put it back in his hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: and is a spade lead obvious from AJxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hes found it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: seven rounds of lcubs will not be easy for the defence|pg||

pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: How many spades does declarer have when he puts up the king? Less than 3, right? So partner must have at least 5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: east 's best was to try and slip a trick thru in one of the reds now south will hold o to those spades like grim death|pg||

pc|c6|nt|nicksan: Roland, unless I'm mistaken he was forced to put up the king?|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: Indeed he was|pg||
