nt|haans: and we start with a part score|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Ralf Willquist and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our operator, Daiva|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also welcome to Marek Wójcicki|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: hi to all from Vilnius...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: EW some spades?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: starting with a multi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hidy.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: I expect East will pass, after due consideration.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has a good idea of which suit West has got|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@c invitationa, 6+ clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: i don't think so|pg||
nt|mareczek: invitational|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: I know this system well, believe me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with P from E? I had introdused my @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry, it was invitation|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 3N here if EW let them play it|pg||
mb|d|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||
nt|sharkey: surprised S passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: that i did not understand|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@h in red is impossible in serious game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a true Bramley x in s.  For the genuine article, you have to be 4333 with 4 cards in the x'd suit.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2° suit...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East has nothing attractive to do, but (let's hope) he will soon select something or other. Yes, a trump.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like N also had some knowledge....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: trumps now, and trump after @d ace|pg||
nt|mareczek: reduces declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as I was about to say, on this hand it would be a good idea to lead it too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: I predict 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: no - N's opening though I understand...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: Classically s's auction would show a hand too strong for a 1nt overcall.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: the auction looks mysterious but they certainly kmw what they are doing|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for my prediction|pg||
nt|mareczek: hi again from Vilnius|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: *know|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Marek|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: continue this way and EW win :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: N seems to have overbid here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I guess most of us would have led the @HK. Tough|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|mareczek: but if EW biod 4@h, they probably will make it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: but it must be a difficult hand for their methods|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and i will miss 4@h many times - like now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good switch, but the @H7 and @H8 provide protection|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems I was correct after all :)|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|xenya: some aggressive auction by EW -- N is in a quandary now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|othered1: some might be even more aggressive with east's 7-cardd suit, but 2@S seems normal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Antway. Seems EW get payed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: Would have been nice for north to have something like a values showing double over 3@S, that might get them to 3N|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D won't be a success -- the right spot is 3N by S -- as in the other room|pg||

nt|xenya: some fun here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: really?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think there is no opening-lead card combination on the highly-approved list that flouts statistical likelihoods so consistently|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1  I mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One of my principles. Bid the first time you can, you will probably have a second chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS are in 5@D on 7 in Closed Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D has no real play so good start for Unia|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mareczek: here club ruff beats 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Daiva, did 3NT really make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: but NS should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: At 18.00 on a Monday, unless Italy is playing on BBO VuGraph.|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mareczek: this is potential swing board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But it also meand that you and your partner must have som brakes too|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: means..|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: S will bid something -- then...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can only see  4 tricks for the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: not have....|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C is the spot here EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now that South has bid hearts, EW need to get their clubs into the auction |pg||
mb|4C|nt|ardf10987: pratic bidding:) when make...|pg||
nt|haans: OPERATOR Name of players?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 3NT is a great bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: A brave bid by South, who should be rewarded.|pg||
nt|mareczek: when partner has passed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://vilniuscup.sportbridge.lt/  -  Tournament Site|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brolucius: I liked also East's 3@C, although it has not worked out as he intended.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer only claimed eight, which is a different matter |pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@s = strong, 5@c and 4@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might be thinking slam now....... though it has no play|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think double is better than 1NT with 4-3 in the majors and only one diamond stopper|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: a buze-induced result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: it was 1 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: but once again Vainikonis made life extermely hard for the opponents|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will only cost one trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Joe|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Was in the other room too, but doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are those who might open the E hand in third, even vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not a terribly exciting hand.  More fun in matchpoints or board-a-match.|pg||
nt|mareczek: 11d negative or intermediate with minors|pg||
nt|mariner1: well @H lead and this is done in|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: declarer could have got a ninth in the end-position, according to the position on MOVIE when he claimed eight. |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|xenya: this happens to be an easy make -- even 10 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|xenya: actually always 10 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it has if North leads the @CJ, but I don't think that is going to happen|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: even a Rabbi can't make this one.........|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|sharkey: West's 1@S appears undiciplined with only ywo jacks - may be conventional....?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: Rabbi's Rule = when King singleton play the Ace|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out to be a good save, undoubled too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: *two|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There was an end-play on East available.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: or, as Walter Johnson points out, no heart lead at all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: note that clubs are frozen now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: that is the defence can't play them without giving declarer another trick in the suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not just "could Have"|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|haans: nowday people seldom pass|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ryskiel_: Nort shoul discard high clubs because that was SPS position|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: actually 5@S X 2 down would be a par|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Sikorski should have followed with @CJ to show values in hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Ryszard|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: but hope for @D Ace in partners hand he discard accordingly|pg||

nt|othered1: A fast start for the event leaders.  Aggressiveness paid off|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|othered1: 5@C is good here for EW.  Very possible 3N less good wiht @H lead|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: That should get the lead right|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice of EW's methods to let south in so easily|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: If EW play Polich club they can have: 12-14balanced - 15+4-4-4-1 - 15+inkl.@C or 18+any|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2@S? i prefer 3@C, though thay heve some details agreements|pg||
nt|othered1: Ew overreached to slam, not hopeless but odds-off in the other room.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: ugly as it might look, 4@S is also a possibility|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|othered1: If this goes down, EW will have earned their push|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: they drop from smalest horse|pg||
nt|xenya: but 3N will suffer the same fate as 6@C|pg||
nt|othered1: south has to play J.  I assume second best leads|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Ain't the best spot. By @HJ it can become a puch|pg||
nt|rodal f: push|pg||
nt|othered1: raising 1@H to two over the double likely would have clarified position for south, but this can still be workedout.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, S must insert the J to beat it|pg||
nt|othered1: if they  play second best leads, why not the J?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: now low @H back|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: my supporter said 3 NT makeable - by eliminate spades, unblock @D ace and @C Ace an throw in by hearts|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Daiva|pg||
nt|ralfwil: according to what Roland said. If EW had competed with 3@h, there had been win|pg||
nt|santyclz: Again rather tame, everybody's 4@h.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 in a black here|pg||
nt|mareczek: one more energetic board|pg||
nt|mariner1: can even make 6@H|pg||
nt|mareczek: not 6@s by N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West probably expected better clubs for 4@C (just guessing though)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 6@S has issue if played in N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: which is possible after a D instead of 1nt|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: That 3NT might possibly be the 'early 13 IMPs' that I mentioned. If Lithuania end in 4@H and go down on the club ruff.|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@c - Polish club - natural 15+, balanced 12-14 or strong - 18+, any distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Ryszard|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: Gdansk must mean polish team?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: they play last month in Pula so probably they stealed some flags|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@d - majors|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anything higher than the 2 level spells problems here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in 15 South play 3 NT and lost 1 down before after @S lead|pg||
nt|xenya: we saw this hand a few minutes ago -- it was 3N by NS 2 off|pg||
mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: They might not mind the wrong flag for that result though|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On Board 12, the Closed Room is also in 3NT. Well bid.|pg||
nt|mareczek: trump lead once again?|pg||
nt|mariner1: S likes to hear @D by W|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mareczek: W has bid take out for majors - so 4@h was out of question|pg||
nt|ardf10987: 1@C not garanting suit prevent 3@C bid fromWest...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: repeat bidding @S suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks an easy make|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|sharkey: http://vilniuscup.sportbridge.lt/|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D denies 4 card Major?|pg||
nt|mareczek: if West will double 6!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West has been a bit passive in the auction. Why should 3@C not be a worthwhile spot? I realise that his partner is likely to be 12-14 balanced but he may hold some clubs in that.|pg||
nt|mareczek: S can retreat to 6NT?|pg||
nt|mareczek: double 6@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he can, but he'd better not |pg||
nt|mariner1: Wojo points out W can underlead @D and get a @c ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If he does, West will lead fourth highest of his longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: north is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: very serious face|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Daiva|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does not know S has @c fit yet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If West does double 6@s, East can (possibly) tell from the NS bidding that West is not void in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there is a defence to 6@H - diamond underlead  |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think N should bid 6@C here as choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course my thinking could not possibly be influenced by being able to see all|pg||
nt|mariner1: the hands :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Joey Silver says S should have bid 4@C and not 4@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I remember trying this sort of underlead once - dummy had singleton ten, of course |pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 2 was flat - a contract of 3N-1 |pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room NS are in 6@S and W underled the @D and got the ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So South was declarer in 6@S?|pg||
nt|mareczek: in the style NS play 6@c is rather invitation yo grand than proposition|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Walddk2: Marshall, I can tell you that we took good care of Obama and that he is on his way back now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe Eats led @D10 and East followed with the D!3|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh no E led 10@D and and it held the trick,,, then E led a @c to be ruffed......|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was misinformed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told that is what happened, thanks all|pg||
mb|6H|nt|xenya: 1@C must be Polish -- weak NT or some strong hand, 1@D -- negative response, but i have doubts about the 1@H rebid|pg||
nt|santyclz: W had a problem, does 3@s on this auction show better than a min opener or any hand w/4@ss?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: thx Roland. i guess is have to move back to my apartment then|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i'd hate to rebid a suit headed by 8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the house-sitting was fun for a while|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: re Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: re|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: http://sf2009.sportbridge.lt/ talk only about team play made before|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why is East taking so long?|pg||
nt|haans: i say his not |pg||
nt|haans: internet problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W has to be careful now. If S ducks and W plays another @s..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, wd West, indeed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|mareczek: it is sensible policy to bid with a spade fit, not to pass|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ryskiel_: on torture I dont admit for such suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: especjally having such clubs|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hold the Bulletin|pg||
nt|mareczek: It will be written, surely...|pg||
nt|mareczek: Bulletin editor is fifth member of Unia team :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I know that we can see all the hands, but surely a club switch is obvious.... |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|h6|nt|xenya: duly punished here -- EW have an excellen @H partial|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: on CR WE play 4@H|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ardf10987: May be also 3nt can be "stolen" in some way... 1@S 3@H 1@D 4@C... but I admit is near double dummy...|pg||
nt|mareczek: partner has easier decision knowing about the fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting push|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: even without the ruff, South might still finesse @h10 on trhe first round|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|xenya: might even make on soft defence|pg||
nt|mareczek: but it was more or less standard - lead of @d10 and suit prefernce by 3|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to strain for the stars. It was not good to allow a 5-3 fit to play when E/W had in fact a 5-4 club fit.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|ryskiel_: Jagniewski consider @C encouraging|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now W must take his 4@c tricks and give up|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Will only get the four club tricks now|pg||
nt|mareczek: probably finesse|pg||

pc|s7|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: well 3N is a difficult contract but perhaps declarer failed to draw inference from the auction -- in any case, he played it too quickly |pg||

nt|rodal f: They were right and me wrong |pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: If W played that way. It would have becomed a newspaper game|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps declarer was hoping for a doubleton @H in the N hand, but that was not consisten with the lead -- i believe they lead the low card from doubleton |pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Major suit always dominate the minor suits|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course the defense shown was unlikely (the @hq on the 2nd round), so i guess he misguessed the @hs and managed to lose 1 trick in each suit.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: South should bid something now. Either 1@S or 2@D.|pg||
nt|wojela2: 2@d = one major suit|pg||
nt|xenya: on 14, Euro AGRO were rather lucky to bid and make 4@S in the other room -- 6 imps to them |pg||
nt|wojela2: bold bid, but based "the balance of the table"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unusual for a Polish pair to play 12-14 NT. Maybe they don't|pg||

nt|mariner1: E thinks 2N showed some @H|pg||
mb|6H|nt|santyclz: Titled:  2 tricks for you.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some pairs would double 1@D only when they held both majors. With one major, they would bid it (on 4 cards or 5). That might help E/W to contest on some hands instead of selling ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: out to a diamond fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and no 10's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: added a point because no matter what suit is led he can win the trick if everyone plays a small card|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: two more rounds of @c staying on the table and a @d and exit in any major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South quite happy to defend undoubled|pg||
nt|mariner1: and Closed Room did find the 4@H level|pg||

pc|hT|nt|brolucius: This is the second deal in a short space of time where E/W have sold out at the two-level to an 8-card trump fit. Most experts hate doing that.|pg||
nt|mareczek: defense has 6 easy tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s7|pc|h5|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: but surely S can't have long @Ss?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: by the way that is another sequence which I see 1st time in my not short bridge life|pg||
nt|xenya: so if N's 2@D was a multi, he should have acted accordingly|pg||
nt|xenya: by bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: South is relatively Young as bridge player so many thing mixed him|pg||
nt|xenya: the whole thing is very strange|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mareczek: South was lucky|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would have bid 2@H over 1NT, allowing South to advance.|pg||
nt|mareczek: he took the risk of playing 3NT with 21 PC and potential misfit|pg||
nt|mareczek: hoping that club suit will work also in NT|pg||
nt|mareczek: but heart fit improved his chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C had little advantage over 1NT, as I see it.|pg||

nt|sharkey: may be Daiva can find out|pg||
nt|haans: id say asking for stopper. Normally you show stopper in one of their suits |pg||
nt|haans: so east did wrong?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I dont know - S has relayed with 2@D |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS in the optimal contract - advantageous lead - why call Director - must be EW|pg||
nt|haans: just a relay meaning some acceptance for dim but do not show that suit|pg||
nt|haans: 'if dim are your suit you may pass'|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - S has 17 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: 3clubs were alerted bad|pg||
