nt|rodal f: BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: and that's not a textbook re-opening action either|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: it's routine to open with shortage - even a doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but with three, you have to ask:- why didn't partner do something over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either he has utter rubbish or he has spades|pg||
nt|athene: either way, you might be better-off passing it out|pg||
nt|athene: sorry it's routine to *re*-open with shortage, i meant to say|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: 3nt is good as the @CK can't be held up|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I don t like reopen double wit 3 cards in opps suit and no atrengh advantage|pg||
nt|rodal f: W woun't like his X when he see all cards. Es pass can't be for penalty as long as he have K53 himself. PASS all times|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: but of course just looking at the NS cards you don't want to be in 3nt because you expect a heart lead to kill the entry to the clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|ritong: but , thinking twice at it, 4@d has a lot of charm|pg||

nt|athene: 3nt from west is interesting; you don't expect to be able to use the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so it's a question of whether the diamonds are a trick source|pg||

nt|rodal f: Asking for @H, but non at pard:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: Seryi is asking about what double means|pg||
nt|athene: south knows the hearts are going nowhere so the question is simply how good west's minor is that he is hoping to run|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec say: Shure 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: As I understood, he explaiined is just a double considering partner's opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i would have said, looking at west's minor suits, he is surely worried that they lie well for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he isn't hoping north can lead hearts through and he can lead spades back|pg||
nt|athene: that's just fantasy|pg||

nt|Walddk4: If he does that, yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: was it heart lead directing for declearer?|pg||
nt|athene: south should have seen that his clubs and diamonds mean west's 6- or 7-card minor is very happy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am more inclined to think he will finesse the queen|pg||
nt|rodal f: hooked|pg||
