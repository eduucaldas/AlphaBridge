nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C I think|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|haans: EW some spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I expect East will pass, after due consideration.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||
nt|sharkey: surprised S passed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: that i did not understand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2Â° suit...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has nothing attractive to do, but (let's hope) he will soon select something or other. Yes, a trump.|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: I mentioned earlier that E/W were unlikely to concede an early 13 IMPs. It seems that Vainikonis is equally determined not to concede even 1 IMP.  His trump plays have worked well.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: only 12 in spades, on accurate discarding, but 13 in clubs, since a losing heart can be discarded ona  long spade|pg||

pc|d6|nt|mareczek: South was lucky|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would have bid 2@H over 1NT, allowing South to advance.|pg||
nt|mareczek: he took the risk of playing 3NT with 21 PC and potential misfit|pg||
nt|mareczek: hoping that club suit will work also in NT|pg||
nt|mareczek: but heart fit improved his chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C had little advantage over 1NT, as I see it.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mareczek: i think it was a correct startegy when loosing 20 imps 6 boards to the end|pg||

nt|haans: id say asking for stopper. Normally you show stopper in one of their suits |pg||
nt|haans: so east did wrong?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I dont know - S has relayed with 2@D |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS in the optimal contract - advantageous lead - why call Director - must be EW|pg||
nt|haans: just a relay meaning some acceptance for dim but do not show that suit|pg||
nt|haans: 'if dim are your suit you may pass'|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - S has 17 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: 3clubs were alerted bad|pg||
nt|sharkey: He'll bid 3 NT alone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: partner thought that with diamonds|pg||
mc|7|nt|brolucius: Better 1NT - 2@H and... if you want to look for IMPs, bid 4@H.|pg||
