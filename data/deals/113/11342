mb|p|mb|4C|an|allerted|mb|p|mb|4H!|an|no allert|nt|mdgraham: Curious how often that happens when one hand has all the defensive strength - sometimes ace, king, and another is better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then partner turns up with Qx and you have given away the ninth trick  |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: 4@H only goes down if N overtakes Q of @D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I think that was one down.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DAK, ruff, @SA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: when I asked - Jurek think one minute about result - and told - 11 triks - that's it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tell them to have some consideration for the poor operator! |pg||
nt|mdgraham: then NS have seriously misdefended|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: I hope next deals wil be better - they will play not with frends|pg||
nt|april7: so why did N overtake in the first playce?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not serious if I am allowed-bad|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N gave the NT opener a singleton @D:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which would mean the lead was from Qxx. Most unlikely|pg||
