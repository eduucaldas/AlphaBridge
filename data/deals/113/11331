nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html|pg||
nt|jcmax: Opening in 3rd seat with the East hand would be very popular I guess. The question then becomes, what should one open|pg||
nt|lesrays: 1@d works best:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed a diamonf partscore|pg||
nt|jcmax: Personally I am a big fan of of opening lead directing in 3rd seat on light hands.|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w seem to have a cheap spade save here|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lesrays: economic auction in the closed room|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the big bid by north have scared e/w into silence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Marta Sikora; welcome to you too|pg||
nt|roswolf: any idea what 3nt was in the other room?|pg||
nt|jcmax: 6@s seems to have 5 loseres, so maybe it's just better to hope they won't bid the slam. Dificult to see who should enter the bidding how as EW.|pg||
nt|jcmax: HI Marta!|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is this a 2@C opening to all of you?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and if it is, isn't Kx enough to support partner's hearts?|pg||
nt|lesrays: on the pass-out hand, if East opens a major, then surely they'l end in 1NT|pg||
nt|jcmax: if 2@C can be a semiforcing, it doesn't look so bad|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: as to the second question - yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: i doubt 2@C was classic but i can live with it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: diamonds or hearts - trumps?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: @D obviously|pg||

nt|lestergold: even 3C is not all chopped liver|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|lestergold: however it wilol be similar in open room so no great swing likely|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe he can engineer an endplay into N and save a trick or 2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: however the @D situation is as bad as the @c are|pg||
nt|daman: takes a lot of engineering to do that|pg||
nt|lestergold: even with possible end plays and restricting dim losers to one i cant see this making|pg||
nt|eggy: I think it is the Palmer style to always open the major when 4-4|pg||

pc|h5|nt|eggy: some weak no trumpers will open the minor if 17+|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe save a trick in clubs but therearent enough trumps around to aoid at least 3 losers in clubs plus a diamond|pg||
nt|eggy: probably best to cash the SK before embarking on clubs?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think there is even a double dummy line here|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|mariner1: the good news is 3N also has problems so not likely to lose many if any here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: at some point declarer will play a club and one way or the other Nick will wait for another two club tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: indeed no game making Rob|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d2|pc|c9|nt|eggy: WIth only 8 trumps the defence can normally afford ruff & discards anyway, but it has a bit of a deterrent effect cashing @SK|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: 2 off|pg||
nt|eggy: not sure whey Nick didn't continue the spades again|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|eggy: ah - if he did so and S won, Palmer could discard on the spades with clubs and save a trick|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: indeed but itsb still 2 off because Artur will be able to exit in spades leaving declarer to have to play clubs away from hand|pg||

nt|mariner1: Mike would W lead a @H vs 4@S?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: adim 2 hearts and a spade can be established in 4S before declarer can enjoy the clubs|pg||
nt|eggy: Not so sure - a heart switch after the first diamond is still on time|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think so a ht switch creates 2 heart tricks before spades have been knocked out|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we are saying same thing in which case this may well be a phantom|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any event aty least 500 against a doubtful id be very happy|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is catching up, they bid 6@D on board 1 instead of 6@H and 2 imps|pg||

nt|daman: ask Yogi Berra|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|eggy: except even with 9 it could be right to finesse here|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|eggy: now that was an error|pg||
nt|daman: err on the side of caution|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: and the roof caves in|pg||
nt|eggy: should finesse to N to give youself a better chanceof the club blockage - as here|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry whose roof is caving in here?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|daman: if the @Cs didn't block   how would you feel?|pg||

nt|lesrays: so these two teams are equal first with Dhondy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have opened as east|pg||
nt|jcmax: This is a potential loss,though, for EW, since there is a partial in @D on|pg||
nt|lesrays: and what would have liked to go off in, Geoff?|pg||
