mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting overcall|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: 200 new specs. Running scores: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009leaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: normally if you are going to overcall in a 4-card suit, it has to be a GOOD 4-card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room north took the "textbook" line of passing the 1@D opener |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he can't have been too pleased to hear his partner's sandwich 1nt overcall (promising the unbid suits)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: good morning...sorry I have information of 10:00 start|pg||
nt|doks: ok new board and some games available for NS|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|haans: yextbook much better|pg||

nt|athene: never much fun to show preference with 2-2|pg||

nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and that's not a textbook re-opening action either|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|athene: it's routine to open with shortage - even a doubleton|pg||
nt|doks: 1NT shows 4@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: but with three, you have to ask:- why didn't partner do something over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either he has utter rubbish or he has spades|pg||
nt|athene: either way, you might be better-off passing it out|pg||
nt|athene: sorry it's routine to *re*-open with shortage, i meant to say|pg||
nt|peachy: Janis, what does S do if he doesnt have 4H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 3nt is good as the @CK can't be held up|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I don t like reopen double wit 3 cards in opps suit and no atrengh advantage|pg||
nt|rodal f: W woun't like his X when he see all cards. Es pass can't be for penalty as long as he have K53 himself. PASS all times|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but of course just looking at the NS cards you don't want to be in 3nt because you expect a heart lead to kill the entry to the clubs|pg||
nt|doks: 1@D promise unbal hand, so different bid|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I dont know their system, thanks!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|athene: sorry 3nt is good as the @CA can't be held up :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Have showed his opening. Why tell it twice?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, with Hxx in overcall suit and minimum opener, it's normal to pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: That could be a risk William:) Would have made W extra happy|pg||

nt|doks: 1@S is not everyone choise with N cards, but Maija basicaly bid 2 @S :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Hans|pg||
nt|doks: hi Hans|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S could cost to much|pg||
nt|doks: I agree, but I know her too long and familar with her methods :)|pg||
nt|haans: make it simple show support|pg||
nt|peachy: or bid 2D, nat and forcing I assume|pg||
nt|doks: now everything is up to EW aggreements|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|doks: @D easy can be best suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hopefully something will happen so we get handball resault Ryszard:) Makes it funnier for specs and us|pg||
nt|doks: in open room E and N passesd, W 1@C was Polish style and later W show good hand with 5@H|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT alerted so I assume it shows H support?|pg||
nt|doks: if W open his ugly 11 count is hard to stop below 6th level|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: sester isn't scared!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: for @H lead??|pg||
nt|haans: very good double|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, Sester wants a heart lead :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Asking for @H, but non at pard:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: Seryi is asking about what double means|pg||
nt|athene: south knows the hearts are going nowhere so the question is simply how good west's minor is that he is hoping to run|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec say: Shure 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: As I understood, he explaiined is just a double considering partner's opening|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: it disclosed after West rebid|pg||
nt|haans: more the hard a certainty|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H = singoff|pg||
nt|doks: now E see all 5 Aces, what to do?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: then 2 NT should be GF with @H support|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: he should ask for 6th Ace|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: I think you are right Ryszard|pg||
nt|haans: ask aces find the Q + kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would have said, looking at west's minor suits, he is surely worried that they lie well for declarer|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: he isn't hoping north can lead hearts through and he can lead spades back|pg||
nt|athene: that's just fantasy|pg||
nt|athene: how many hearts are in this deck?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: at least 15|pg||
nt|doks: But @D K is at least 3times more valuable, then others, so need good methods here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: most danger for West-East is to land in 7|pg||
nt|haans: no @DK no grand|pg||
nt|peachy: I think they stop safely, have not shown aggressive bidding in this match, why start now:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: can be 4 NT asking for aces???|pg||
nt|doks: 6@H and singlleton @D and grand still good|pg||
nt|haans: i would assume 45@S asking|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S|pg||
nt|doks: if W asking Aces, he is very brave|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ryskiel_: 4 @S looks as a cue bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This is bad enough on a spade lead. Levenko has plenty of entries|pg||
nt|athene: heart to ace, diamond to @D10|pg||
nt|rodal f: There are a chance for 9. @H for A and @D hooed by 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he does that, yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: was it heart lead directing for declearer?|pg||
nt|athene: south should have seen that his clubs and diamonds mean west's 6- or 7-card minor is very happy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am more inclined to think he will finesse the queen|pg||
nt|rodal f: hooked|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i think 4 NT was "keep ball in air..."|pg||
nt|doks: so rest in 6@H, next board|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: but perhaps south doubled to try to induce the run to 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: has to hope two rounds of spades lives|pg||
pc|dA|nt|doks: In this board one team even manage to pass 2@D, so not biding cold slam in other room stil give 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: well done|pg||
nt|rodal f: Serious Roland? After Ns opening|pg||

nt|athene: roland is in 6NT on the hands|pg||
nt|peachy: I was wrong, D provided landing spot for third spade, forgot lead was the J|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: ah, sorry, no, 6@S :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead hurts 6NT|pg||
nt|haans: N have no good bid|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@D is normal for East|pg||
nt|athene: or whether he is feeling bullish|pg||
nt|haans: they can find slam here 2|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|athene: "well, 3@H worked well last time, let's try again"|pg||
nt|haans: now if @D supported|pg||
nt|doks: I hope, sorry I'm a little Latvia fan|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: now cheep sacrifice available|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: spades good|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down in 4@S|pg||
nt|doks: 3@S not shout out E completely|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: very hard for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: they are both on the borderline of entering the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|doks: pre onece again|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Maja is brave player|pg||
nt|haans: par is 5@Sx|pg||
nt|doks: You even don't know how brave|pg||
nt|peachy: power of dblfit ew, only W knows it|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: but each has a weak major which makes a double unattractive|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@s slightly conservative|pg||
nt|doks: in open room 1@H-3@D showing supp in @H and 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: agree bid all you can then pass|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mareczek: partner should also be on black suits for the double of 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or well done by EW.|pg||
nt|peachy: i dont like this bidding, no matter how successful|pg||
nt|doks: so now par is reached|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 3rd floor bid is lucky for Ukrainians|pg||
nt|haans: 3 imps to Lithunia|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4|pg||
nt|haans: yep 4|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: four for Latvia|pg||
nt|doks: or even 11 if E bid 6|pg||
nt|mareczek: if N bids 4@s immediately, East has first problem... he would probably bid 5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: E might still overrule, slam is only on finesse|pg||
nt|mareczek: then pass.  pass and 5@s|pg||
nt|haans: 2 finesse one iin clubs|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mareczek: another problem for East - he will probably pass - good values, spade singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: has diam, dont need club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: and pass.  pass. West also has not an obvious bid - spade ace, diamond fit... can bid 6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: Karpov didn't pre-empt in the other room|pg||
nt|peachy: but of course after Hfin lose, then has to guess cl|pg||
nt|mareczek: but still happy end for NS|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Rubins sightseeing deeply|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time from opps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|doks: nice lead and 11 IMPs for Latvia|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 6 @H in OR|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|athene: now north will find the @HQ and @CK and bid 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S = queen?|pg||

pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Sr. Bidding was not ended in OR. 6@H the end there|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: now north will bid 7@H, or possibly 8@H|pg||

nt|haans: N did not show @SK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: in the other room it looks very much like a standard Precision auction|pg||
nt|doks: 2@D, 2@S and @C K for defence|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: W attack spades, no 9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: where north has to bid a negative 1@D first and then catch up|pg||

pc|h2|nt|athene: but this is a horrible idea|pg||
