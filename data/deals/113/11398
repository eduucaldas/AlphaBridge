mb|4S|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: The alert of 2@S seems a little strange|pg||

nt|rnmalik: true not me either. I would rather bid 3@D|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Some difficulty in reaching dummy for the club finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: (Thank you for the information, Thorvald)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: chased them into better spot |pg||

nt|sybarra: my rebid of a minor suggests a 6 card suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: so doubt I would rebid that suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: The declarer has to play the K@S to make the hand-DBL by W of 4@S showed shortness|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|davidstern: Easy 4@H - Maybe 3NT by West|pg||

nt|davidstern: Good hand for 'normal' blackwood not Roman Key Card|pg||

nt|pelu: 11 or 12 now - and when N has played East can claim|pg||
nt|davidstern: 12 would make if you duck spade as north now and East then finesses diamonds|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Combined 25 count, but does not look as if this will play very well either|pg||

nt|cuttysark: He will go after diamonds, but they do not lie well from his point of view|pg||

nt|cuttysark: He may cross to dummy now to finesse @D9, hoping for Q10x in East|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|haans: to be played by N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: Very few losers in spades|pg||
nt|granguru: W is being conservative on not biding 2@D as there is a potential misfit...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This looks like a make also|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Better played by North, but a hold-up will see him through|pg||
nt|haans: he need trick 9|pg||

pc|h9|nt|davidstern: Good lead by North|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|davidstern: Welcome to Peter Lund who can probably translate the website better than I - no definitely|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|h2|nt|pelu: your calculation are mine!|pg||
nt|davidstern: Damn fine - I must be right then|pg||
nt|pelu: would u pass 1NT - or - as here - bid 2NT? - I am close to the pass-brigade|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think bidding is poor value - you need partner to have a GOOD hand for 3NT. But I am a 2@H bidder on the other hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bidding 1NT with 3 card support and doubleton spade isnt ideal unless they are playing four card majors|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - but EW open 1@H with 4-4 in the major - but still I am with u|pg||
nt|davidstern: For 3NT to be a 'spot' East must have a five card minor|pg||
nt|pelu: even with 4 card major I am with u to bid 2@H with no @s-stop|pg||
nt|davidstern: Opposite 4 major close but opposite 5 clear 2@H bid|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: but over 2@H the West hand with bid again - so same result: 3@H :(|pg||
nt|davidstern: This is the semi final of this tournament. Henrik Iversen,  Bjørg Houmøller, Jacob Røjel, Ib Christian Bank, Jonas Houmøller, Erik Eide |pg||
nt|davidstern: Team Blaksets Bridgecenter, Jacob Røn, Steen Møller, Lauge Schäffer, Thomas Vang Larsen, Lars & Knut Blakset|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|davidstern: And my keyboard has none of those funy letters - thanks for cut and paste|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: This will now make|pg||
nt|davidstern: If south ruffs a spade will be ruffed in dummy|pg||
nt|davidstern: If he doesnt the @CJ wil be the ninth trick|pg||
nt|pelu: S sh hold up @DA - that makes life harder for declayer|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

pc|sA|nt|sybarra: didnt mean to bring you a boring hand |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Defecen should manage to give declarer a spade guess, but he will get it right on the biddinh, maybe|pg||
nt|sybarra: if they play constructive raises,  then East's hand is not good enough |pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: flat board|pg||
nt|haans: NS had a good save in 4@S|pg||

nt|haans: well done|pg||

pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: He now knows who has @SJ and @S10 :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that once North had led the ace of spades, there was no longer an effective defence|pg||

nt|haans: no all fast|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||

nt|pelu: 2@D = GF|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|2234|mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure - and I would open 1NT (12-14)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would open this hand but not with one jack missing|pg||
mb|3S|nt|davidstern: If they play 1NT weak (do they) why did he not open 1NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: 12 HCP = opening - 11HCP + a good suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: They dont play weak NT - but I play 12-14 with Møller non vuln|pg||
nt|davidstern: South shuld avoid doubleton club lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|davidstern: Oops|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 2-3 in major and prob not a good 5 card suit in @C, so = 2-3-4-4-|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: same auction as in the Open Room so far - good push by East|pg||
nt|granguru: who is defending here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: but very few tricks in the 5@C contract|pg||
nt|haans: that did kill S hearts interest i think?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Always the way when you have a promising hand in 4th seat - everybody is bidding their socks off|pg||
nt|sybarra: true Liz |pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board of this segment.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I saw this board in OR-same lead, but after the ruff of @H W played a @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sems like he might have done a little better...|pg||
nt|haans: yep we all seen it|pg||
nt|sybarra: you hate to pass your pard's overcall but with no fit :(  better part of valor|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not sure I would have managed to Pass throughout as South, though I think he is right|pg||
nt|haans: i deal to tell beginners something|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: He should win ace and play a low diamond?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzyc: Killing lead|pg||
nt|dburn: well, yes, but...|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes  and thx to  Bjorn our operator   Terrific job! |pg||
pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: Moller will wait a long time before partner leads a spade through|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru: Or a @H finesse to throw the @S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: ...it's going to be hard for the defence to work out just how good it is|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: No hurry for the heart finesse - needs to get some diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: still, I guess North might shift to a diamond anyway|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: Aha - distributional information! Now heart finesse, take pitch, diamond up |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: the sputnik double tends to tell = 20-20 between us|pg||
nt|sybarra: S likely to get stuffed in I think |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make it now |pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defence|pg||
nt|dburn: there isn't one, but East is more relcutant than we are to come to that conslusion|pg||
nt|sybarra: as spec points out, ONLY CHANCE J109@c|pg||
nt|dburn: well, or a heart-club squeeze|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we know it is not there|pg||
nt|dburn: which would work if South had @hQ and any four clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the key cards in different hands. Lets convince E:)|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess East is weighing up the chance of the squeeze against the chance that North has @hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: or we are losing connection |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: ur not|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure, but South's lead might have been from 42 doubleton - I don't know if the North-South pair lead low from two small|pg||
nt|dburn: so declarer has a genuine problem, and it is not surprising that he is taking his time|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he made his decision - I confess, I would have gone the other way, and gone down just the same|pg||
