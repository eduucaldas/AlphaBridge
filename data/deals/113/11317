mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  even with lebonshohl and 4th suit forcing, S still has a problem describing the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difficult hand to bid. They will do well to reach 6@C or 6@S  ... or 6NT by North|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  so, if S had one-loser suit, 4 spades seems better than 3NT, as for N|pg||
