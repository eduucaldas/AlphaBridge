nt|haans: and we start with a part score|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Ralf Willquist and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our operator, Daiva|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also welcome to Marek Wójcicki|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mareczek: hi to all from Vilnius...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: EW some spades?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: starting with a multi|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: I expect East will pass, after due consideration.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has a good idea of which suit West has got|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@c invitationa, 6+ clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: i don't think so|pg||
nt|mareczek: invitational|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: I know this system well, believe me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with P from E? I had introdused my @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry, it was invitation|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||
nt|sharkey: surprised S passed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: that i did not understand|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@h in red is impossible in serious game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2° suit...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: East has nothing attractive to do, but (let's hope) he will soon select something or other. Yes, a trump.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like N also had some knowledge....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mareczek: trumps now, and trump after @d ace|pg||
nt|mareczek: reduces declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as I was about to say, on this hand it would be a good idea to lead it too|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - N's opening though I understand...|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|xenya: the auction looks mysterious but they certainly kmw what they are doing|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|dT|nt|haans: continue this way and EW win :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: N seems to have overbid here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I guess most of us would have led the @HK. Tough|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mareczek: but if EW biod 4@h, they probably will make it|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: but it must be a difficult hand for their methods|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and i will miss 4@h many times - like now|pg||

nt|xenya: some fun here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: really?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think there is no opening-lead card combination on the highly-approved list that flouts statistical likelihoods so consistently|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1  I mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One of my principles. Bid the first time you can, you will probably have a second chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: here club ruff beats 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Daiva, did 3NT really make?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mareczek: but NS should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: At 18.00 on a Monday, unless Italy is playing on BBO VuGraph.|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mareczek: this is potential swing board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But it also meand that you and your partner must have som brakes too|pg||

mb|p|nt|ardf10987: pratic bidding:) when make...|pg||
nt|haans: OPERATOR Name of players?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 3NT is a great bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: A brave bid by South, who should be rewarded.|pg||
nt|mareczek: when partner has passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I liked also East's 3@C, although it has not worked out as he intended.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer only claimed eight, which is a different matter |pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think double is better than 1NT with 4-3 in the majors and only one diamond stopper|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: a buze-induced result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: it was 1 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Roland|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will only cost one trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Joe|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Was in the other room too, but doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are those who might open the E hand in third, even vul|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer could have got a ninth in the end-position, according to the position on MOVIE when he claimed eight. |pg||
pc|d5|pc|c7|nt|xenya: this happens to be an easy make -- even 10 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|xenya: actually always 10 as the cards lie|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ryskiel_: hi all|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: West's 1@S appears undiciplined with only ywo jacks - may be conventional....?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|xenya: turns out to be a good save, undoubled too|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sharkey: *two|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There was an end-play on East available.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|xenya: note that clubs are frozen now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: that is the defence can't play them without giving declarer another trick in the suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not just "could Have"|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: nowday people seldom pass|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ryskiel_: Nort shoul discard high clubs because that was SPS position|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: actually 5@S X 2 down would be a par|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Sikorski should have followed with @CJ to show values in hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Ryszard|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: but hope for @D Ace in partners hand he discard accordingly|pg||

nt|april7: another partial in @D, 3 again|pg||
nt|othered1: If east doesn't have a gadget opening available, south likely will open 1@D and west will act.|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Daiva|pg||
nt|ralfwil: according to what Roland said. If EW had competed with 3@h, there had been win|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: which is possible after a D instead of 1nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: That 3NT might possibly be the 'early 13 IMPs' that I mentioned. If Lithuania end in 4@H and go down on the club ruff.|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@c - Polish club - natural 15+, balanced 12-14 or strong - 18+, any distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Ryszard|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: Gdansk must mean polish team?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: they play last month in Pula so probably they stealed some flags|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mareczek: 2@d - majors|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anything higher than the 2 level spells problems here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in 15 South play 3 NT and lost 1 down before after @S lead|pg||
nt|xenya: we saw this hand a few minutes ago -- it was 3N by NS 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: They might not mind the wrong flag for that result though|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On Board 12, the Closed Room is also in 3NT. Well bid.|pg||
nt|mareczek: trump lead once again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: W has bid take out for majors - so 4@h was out of question|pg||
nt|ardf10987: 1@C not garanting suit prevent 3@C bid fromWest...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: repeat bidding @S suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks an easy make|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|sharkey: http://vilniuscup.sportbridge.lt/|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D denies 4 card Major?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: West has been a bit passive in the auction. Why should 3@C not be a worthwhile spot? I realise that his partner is likely to be 12-14 balanced but he may hold some clubs in that.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marshall, I can tell you that we took good care of Obama and that he is on his way back now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|xenya: 1@C must be Polish -- weak NT or some strong hand, 1@D -- negative response, but i have doubts about the 1@H rebid|pg||
nt|santyclz: W had a problem, does 3@s on this auction show better than a min opener or any hand w/4@ss?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: thx Roland. i guess is have to move back to my apartment then|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: i'd hate to rebid a suit headed by 8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the house-sitting was fun for a while|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ryskiel_: re Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: re|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: http://sf2009.sportbridge.lt/ talk only about team play made before|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why is East taking so long?|pg||
nt|haans: i say his not |pg||
nt|haans: internet problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W has to be careful now. If S ducks and W plays another @s..|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|mareczek: it is sensible policy to bid with a spade fit, not to pass|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: on torture I dont admit for such suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: especjally having such clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: duly punished here -- EW have an excellen @H partial|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: on CR WE play 4@H|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ardf10987: May be also 3nt can be "stolen" in some way... 1@S 3@H 1@D 4@C... but I admit is near double dummy...|pg||
nt|mareczek: partner has easier decision knowing about the fit|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|xenya: might even make on soft defence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: No need to strain for the stars. It was not good to allow a 5-3 fit to play when E/W had in fact a 5-4 club fit.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Jagniewski consider @C encouraging|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now W must take his 4@c tricks and give up|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Will only get the four club tricks now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mareczek: and bids in puished position can always be borderline, this is  today's trend|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h2|nt|xenya: well 3N is a difficult contract but perhaps declarer failed to draw inference from the auction -- in any case, he played it too quickly |pg||

mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|sharkey: Major suit always dominate the minor suits|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: South should bid something now. Either 1@S or 2@D.|pg||
nt|wojela2: 2@d = one major suit|pg||
nt|xenya: on 14, Euro AGRO were rather lucky to bid and make 4@S in the other room -- 6 imps to them |pg||
nt|wojela2: bold bid, but based "the balance of the table"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unusual for a Polish pair to play 12-14 NT. Maybe they don't|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: 1@H showing 4+@S|pg||

nt|wojela2: on|pg||

mb|p|pc|c2|nt|mareczek: once again trump lead would be most effective|pg||
nt|haans: rode the five hundred|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After the nt-opening S must find @hJ - or?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|xenya: and it did make -- perhaps it's not so easy to beat, if at all posssible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe an upgrade - no threes or fours either |pg||
nt|santyclz: I see s has read my book on opening leads.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Titled:  2 tricks for you.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Some pairs would double 1@D only when they held both majors. With one major, they would bid it (on 4 cards or 5). That might help E/W to contest on some hands instead of selling ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: out to a diamond fit.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and no 10's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: added a point because no matter what suit is led he can win the trick if everyone plays a small card|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: two more rounds of @c staying on the table and a @d and exit in any major|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: Why didnt East bid 5 NT confirming all key cards?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @H adn @C to 9 |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: dont ask be lucky|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|ryskiel_: Soth mistaked - he bid as after 2 @D Multi opening, though also bad|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: -4 and 800|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the second deal in a short space of time where E/W have sold out at the two-level to an 8-card trump fit. Most experts hate doing that.|pg||
nt|mareczek: defense has 6 easy tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wojela2: probably South plays another syetm than North|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|xenya: but surely S can't have long @Ss?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: by the way that is another sequence which I see 1st time in my not short bridge life|pg||
nt|xenya: so if N's 2@D was a multi, he should have acted accordingly|pg||
nt|xenya: by bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: South is relatively Young as bridge player so many thing mixed him|pg||
nt|xenya: the whole thing is very strange|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: another easy hand|pg||

nt|santyclz: 3 10s is a mandatory opener now?|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|mareczek: good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: hard to find minor when you have ffound major Relays are best on that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: see 2@C mean nothing|pg||

mb|d|mb|2H|nt|sharkey: 2@C means???|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The best chance of game is 4@H, so South shows the major suit.|pg||
nt|mareczek: anyway, WE should reach a heart games wich probably would be made|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Now 1NT (what else?) This does not show a balanced hand. Oh, he has bid 2@C!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: can any specs say anything abour their systems?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H with a longer minor - < opening?|pg||
nt|sharkey: See hand 1|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think redouble would work well showing strength|pg||
nt|mareczek: then 2@h which sounds like "the longer, the weaker"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: they play too fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: i cant catch their moves|pg||
nt|xenya: and he'd better cash them quickly|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: but when Jurek try make some moore tricks he can quickly lost 2 down|pg||

pc|c3|nt|sharkey: never said that - a lot easier to comment when we don't have to guess so much|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mareczek: South was lucky|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would have bid 2@H over 1NT, allowing South to advance.|pg||
nt|mareczek: he took the risk of playing 3NT with 21 PC and potential misfit|pg||
nt|mareczek: hoping that club suit will work also in NT|pg||
nt|mareczek: but heart fit improved his chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C had little advantage over 1NT, as I see it.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mareczek: i think it was a correct startegy when loosing 20 imps 6 boards to the end|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: I see. You make as many bad bids as possible, hoping that it will work well?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mareczek: 2@c = twosuiter with hearts, at least 5-4, 7-11 PC|pg||
nt|mareczek: like Astro|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|mareczek: NS play also similar 2@d - twosuiter with spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzxk: director is here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure what East's 3@D meant|pg||
nt|haans: uonly director can help you here :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be Daiva can find out|pg||
nt|haans: id say asking for stopper. Normally you show stopper in one of their suits |pg||
nt|haans: so east did wrong?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I dont know - S has relayed with 2@D |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS in the optimal contract - advantageous lead - why call Director - must be EW|pg||
nt|haans: just a relay meaning some acceptance for dim but do not show that suit|pg||
nt|haans: 'if dim are your suit you may pass'|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - S has 17 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: 3clubs were alerted bad|pg||
nt|sharkey: He'll bid 3 NT alone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: partner thought that with diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Better 1NT - 2@H and... if you want to look for IMPs, bid 4@H.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/team/vilteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of this match now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sharkey: We didnt get the whole story - sry|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|brolucius: Yes, no problem. We could see what was going to happen. He could make the low trumps for 620.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: 2@S is enough, facing a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes, the solidity is important, and not even mainly for protection. one of the ways that the jump rebid can win big is when partner has a moderately good responding hand but ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shortness in our suit. then he will be hesitant to bid on over a weaker sequence and an easy game could be missed|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Don't know if that decision will stand - strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Pass would be too greedy, perhaps allowing competition in clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On some deals, it would work well to win with the ace, so West could not ruff a diamond honour on the second round. Here the defenders have plenty of communication, though.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1NT South because 2/1 is GF|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead makes it easy|pg||

pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Slam is not a bargain, though, so it's quite normal to stay out of it|pg||
nt|mareczek: Now east can safely conced the heart to N|pg||
