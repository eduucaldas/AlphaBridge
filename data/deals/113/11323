nt|sigiuna: and the last match of round robin..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Monaco as leader after round robin took Belarus for semifinal|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  play starts in few minutes - both pairs take their time to get detailed description of opps' systems|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: re Hi:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we have new N and other NS system - based on Polish club|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  sorry, new player took S seat|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are asking NS about the system, but 1st board belongs to EW, as it seems|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: so You suggest Swieta they should ask yourselves about system?:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|sigiuna: During this match it will be finally clear which teams will have the right to play in semifinals|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  He congratuled the players with the results already achieved by them and underlined the importance of the event. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sigiuna: Monako is the leaders, Estonian team on the third place|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting E's action - of course he can allow himself to pass first round, but what now?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009runda11.html|pg||

mb|5D|nt|sfoxa:  As by his words, EBL will do its best to make next edition of the Small Feds to the real European Championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Great scoring program devised by Jan Romanski of Poland|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Jan is also the chief TD in Vilnius|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Opener could be empty in clubs|pg||
nt|wojela2: due to misexplanation, the contract of 5@c by Monaco was misdefended|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|sigiuna: This gaved 4 additional IMP for Estonia...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d!|nt|sfoxa:  and the second strategy said - never accept wrong hand lead, cos if defender is more quick that his partner being on lead - it mean, he has good one, as in this deal|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: You visite Poland so many times so I know not only Belarusian bridge system but few other|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sfoxa:  yes, @h ace doesn't disapper as a trick, but without @s ace NS couldn't beat the contract |pg||

nt|sfoxa:  few imps for NS|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s cold here, possible 12 swing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ryskiel_: 3 NT lay down after natural @D lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this board could bring some imps for Belarus if NS avoid @c slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  last board tonight|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And Monaco has 10 IMPs less than shown on the scoreboard?|pg||
nt|ritong: then the contested board comes into the picture|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  bid and beaten next door|pg||
nt|ritong: that is the TD decision|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: the commission might adjust less severely|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If that ruling is upheld, Belarus wins if they make 4@S here|pg||
nt|ritong: like two thirds one third, you know |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ardf10987: I may agree :) But I think basic line was dictated from "quiet" level...:)|pg||
nt|ritong: well..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Passing 2@S is a little wet|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  result rather stands - Jan Romanski realized that N (who made wrong move in trick 2) didn't ask anything, so, rather result on scoreboard is correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Sveta|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So it would not have mattered anyway what N-S did here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|sigiuna: Running scores and butler: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009leaderb.html|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more important issue now - 4 top-teams captains' meeting - where the semifinals will be decided |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: NS got to 3N on 29 in the other room, declarer misguessed @Ds (naturally), 12 imps to Estonia|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  3@d asks for stopper, 4@d - full exclusion (like singleton or void)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ardf10987: I'm seeing results not very happy for Monaco now... may be my (bad) play influence results also when I'm simply kibitzing :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: although allavena went down inexplicably, so he must be sweating right now, if not in front of a computer watching this:)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But they are safe|pg||
nt|sigiuna: Leaders Monaco are relaxed.. They sure about playing in semifinals.. they are not indeed interesting in tough battle|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Monaco - Lithuania2 - Estonia - Belarus   the likely qualifiers for the semi-finals|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

pc|c9|nt|sigiuna: The position is not changing last three rounds..|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  bridgerama is downstairs here - we are in Skybar having bird's view of Vilnius|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|sigiuna: So they truly deserved to play in semifinals..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and, as it often happens, "last train" arrives earlier - Lith-2 team substituted Malta and has been doing well in RR|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, Allavena has to wait|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|ardf10987: Strong defence here, freezing @S with the @C return, and playing small @S now.|pg||
nt|xenya: thoughtful duck by Frissore|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no gain, just push|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
mc|9|nt|wojela2: so see you ain 1h 40 min on the final Lithuania Monaco|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and 40 minutes with the final|pg||
