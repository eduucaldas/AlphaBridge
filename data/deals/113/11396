mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Liggins prefers not to give away information|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 3NT is not my idea of a sound bid - David's 3@S is vastly superior|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|athene: bidding spades as north would be better if it allowed partner to bid and declare NT with heart stop|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jtr: Actually i wonder if 4@s does make|pg||
nt|athene: but since north was playing NT anyway he decided it wasn't worth it|pg||
nt|jtr: That @s7 comes into play|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|jtr: 3Nt is not so terrible, just needs @hs 4-4 or a blockage|pg||
nt|athene: or underlead of @HAK :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North might have rebid 3@C rather than 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: screen being repaired|pg||
nt|athene: north could rebid 3@C but it's a bit of an underbid - he has the sort of hand where people in bridge magazines rebid 1@S for ten marks :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: We can almost here the hammer hitting the nails |pg||
nt|jtr: Spec points out that 5@c can also be defeated on 3 rounds of @hs|pg||
nt|athene: actually, if the hearts are wide-open, it was pretty likely the suit WAS 4-4, since neither opponent overcalled 1@H when they had the chance to do so|pg||
nt|athene: and as we saw on the previous board (1@S) they overcall fairly light at the 1-level|pg||
nt|jtr: Possible Michaels by East?:)|pg||
nt|athene: it was just unlucky that the @HAK were not with the long hearts so neither E nor W had an overcall|pg||

nt|roswolf: agree mike|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok 3@D - 3@S - 3NT?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now up to Crouch to lead A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: biding omp will rewars them for playing in eiher 4s or 5c and penalise them for the lazy 3n punt|pg||

nt|jtr: 3 rounds of @hs screws that|pg||
nt|chessmaste: maybe three rounds of hearts kills that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: if you have to ruff with @C10, west has a trump trick|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jtr: 3@d looks odd to me  Maybe double first|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: 3@D is about right on values but it looks odd with such a balanced hand, yes|pg||
nt|jtr: wow 3@s is wild|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: 1NT = @s|pg||
nt|jtr: ah right|pg||
nt|athene: but there are two other issues:- firstly, west's double pretty much guarantees four diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: ...3 card support|pg||
nt|athene: secondly, east can't really have a good hand with 5+@D (no overcall)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes i am not criticising 3@d really|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe 3@D must always be this sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: (4 diamonds, good values)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, using 1NT as a support redouble was originally proposed by robson and segal wasn't it? in "partnership bidding at bridge"|pg||

nt|roswolf: we have a strange attitude to sponsors generally|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: we need some movie star  looks maybe|pg||
nt|lestergold: we have astrange atitude to ninternational competition in brideg and indeed many other sports altogether|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   makes for n/s     not clear whether they will reach game|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|roswolf: an acol opening from south - 1NT for the rest of us |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: unlikely to identify this perfecto fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: no way can richard move opposit Heather's epected ore emptive raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S will be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this premier league part of the trials this year?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: of course the game does require diamonds to behave as well as no nasty breaks so its below 50% which is not good odds for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Fleet looking at convention card|pg||
nt|roswolf: but with a few less guarantees - especially for the europeans|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now EW's system file|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: norths hand very suitable   both queens pulling weight|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's not quite a preemptive raise  nor good enough for a limit raise, one of those annoying hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think that 3S is a perfecly normal raise over 2H she simply cannot make an unassuming cue bid raise with taht colelction|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|athene: i wonder if it was a deliberate tactical decision to put the strong club pairs in same seats|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you would think you would get more swings if you didn't|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzyj: Home team has choice in sets 1 and 3|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: this is the last board of the segment - thanks to my fellow commentators David Greenwood and Mark Horton, our operator Roger Bryant, and the EBU (Max Bavin)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: we will be back shortly with more Premier League action!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: May be, but their methods are very different and have produced swings - Board 10 for example|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|ady: part score hand    2@S  for e/w  abouth the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it will be hard here for Peter to not bid too many spades at some point|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|lestergold: one wasted K and duplication in the heart suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2S!|an|6+ spades, min hand|nt|lestergold: mind you thats the advanatge of a strong club system|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps peter's system is quite good at staying low but.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it needs to!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see|pg||
nt|ady: yes many might get overboard here with that great spade suit     can be thatg those opening 1@S  may be better placed   might be passed out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: not many pass these days with a 5 count though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a lot of players would wheel out 4S to begin with|pg||
