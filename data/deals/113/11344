nt|jcwla: Really hideous from W on a @S lead, but ugly in all cases.  Should stay low.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: In my opinion - ce could...|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|jcwla: For those playing standard minor openings, it is important to open the E hand 1@D, not 1@C.  If the opps buy the contract and partner ends up on lead, you want a @D lead, not a @C ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: (most of the time).|pg||
mc|11|nt|ralfwil: Can N get more than 4 tricks in 2@hX?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: pass works if he can do it|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to pass with Qxxxx and out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1NT|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|mariner1: yes 1N reasonable to tell p you have @H however not enough to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Most play that 1NT promises more values.  2@C or an action pass the options.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1NT is constructive|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: You can bid that on a 3 count|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can't|pg||
nt|mariner1: well at least the @c are 3 3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think he can make 3@c with best play|pg||
nt|mariner1: if I have a contructive 1N I would probably pass for penalties|pg||
nt|jcwla: There are times when letting the opps make 2@CX is better than where partner will take you if you don't pass.  However, this auction was well-controlled.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I mean 1@HX.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3 3 @S and 3 3 @c help so he can manuafacture an entry to dummy|pg||

nt|mariner1: 7@C is a daring card|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he plays it as well as a GIB could at least so far:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, helps that partner has more than half the deck.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@C = Roland buys us all a steak dinner card :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why claim -1?|pg||
mc|8|nt|jaapfr: after @C7 he makes 3@C imo|pg||
