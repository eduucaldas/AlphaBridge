nt|sfoxa:  just a moment|pg||
nt|Walddk3: or 3NS+2  if South was declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: both north and south's action are on the aggressive side, thus the over board.  I can accept south's double but believe 3h enough for north|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: the defenders cannot break clubs, and trump position are most favorable, there maybe some chances for 4H to survive|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk3: East must shorten dummy now with another spade, only chance|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Well done|pg||

nt|gracelin: srry, declarer has no chance with the spade continuation.|pg||

nt|Walddk3: It is not so easy to continue a suit when dummy is void|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: yes, but I believe West has given the count signal so East is save to lead the 3rd round|pg||
