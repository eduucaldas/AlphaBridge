nt|haans: and we start with a part score|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Ralf Willquist and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our operator, Daiva|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also welcome to Marek Wójcicki|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: hi to all from Vilnius...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: EW some spades?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: starting with a multi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hidy.|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: I expect East will pass, after due consideration.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has a good idea of which suit West has got|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@c invitationa, 6+ clubs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: i don't think so|pg||
nt|mareczek: invitational|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: I know this system well, believe me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with P from E? I had introdused my @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry, it was invitation|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||
nt|sharkey: surprised S passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: that i did not understand|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@h in red is impossible in serious game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a true Bramley x in s.  For the genuine article, you have to be 4333 with 4 cards in the x'd suit.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2° suit...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: East has nothing attractive to do, but (let's hope) he will soon select something or other. Yes, a trump.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like N also had some knowledge....|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mareczek: trumps now, and trump after @d ace|pg||
nt|mareczek: reduces declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as I was about to say, on this hand it would be a good idea to lead it too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: no - N's opening though I understand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Classically s's auction would show a hand too strong for a 1nt overcall.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|xenya: the auction looks mysterious but they certainly kmw what they are doing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: *know|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: continue this way and EW win :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: N seems to have overbid here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I guess most of us would have led the @HK. Tough|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|mareczek: but if EW biod 4@h, they probably will make it|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: but it must be a difficult hand for their methods|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and i will miss 4@h many times - like now|pg||

nt|xenya: some fun here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: really?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think there is no opening-lead card combination on the highly-approved list that flouts statistical likelihoods so consistently|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1  I mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One of my principles. Bid the first time you can, you will probably have a second chance|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mareczek: here club ruff beats 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Daiva, did 3NT really make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: but NS should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: At 18.00 on a Monday, unless Italy is playing on BBO VuGraph.|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mareczek: this is potential swing board|pg||

nt|haans: OPERATOR Name of players?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: sorry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mareczek: 3NT is a great bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: A brave bid by South, who should be rewarded.|pg||
nt|mareczek: when partner has passed|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: I liked also East's 3@C, although it has not worked out as he intended.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer only claimed eight, which is a different matter |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think double is better than 1NT with 4-3 in the majors and only one diamond stopper|pg||

nt|vugraphzxk: it was 1 down|pg||

pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Not a terribly exciting hand.  More fun in matchpoints or board-a-match.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: declarer could have got a ninth in the end-position, according to the position on MOVIE when he claimed eight. |pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Daiva|pg||
nt|ralfwil: according to what Roland said. If EW had competed with 3@h, there had been win|pg||
nt|santyclz: Again rather tame, everybody's 4@h.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: which is possible after a D instead of 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: That 3NT might possibly be the 'early 13 IMPs' that I mentioned. If Lithuania end in 4@H and go down on the club ruff.|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@c - Polish club - natural 15+, balanced 12-14 or strong - 18+, any distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Ryszard|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: Gdansk must mean polish team?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: they play last month in Pula so probably they stealed some flags|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@d - majors|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anything higher than the 2 level spells problems here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in 15 South play 3 NT and lost 1 down before after @S lead|pg||
nt|xenya: we saw this hand a few minutes ago -- it was 3N by NS 2 off|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: They might not mind the wrong flag for that result though|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On Board 12, the Closed Room is also in 3NT. Well bid.|pg||
nt|mareczek: trump lead once again?|pg||
mb|p!|nt|mareczek: W has bid take out for majors - so 4@h was out of question|pg||
nt|ardf10987: 1@C not garanting suit prevent 3@C bid fromWest...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: repeat bidding @S suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks an easy make|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|sharkey: http://vilniuscup.sportbridge.lt/|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D denies 4 card Major?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: West has been a bit passive in the auction. Why should 3@C not be a worthwhile spot? I realise that his partner is likely to be 12-14 balanced but he may hold some clubs in that.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Marshall, I can tell you that we took good care of Obama and that he is on his way back now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: 1@C must be Polish -- weak NT or some strong hand, 1@D -- negative response, but i have doubts about the 1@H rebid|pg||
nt|santyclz: W had a problem, does 3@s on this auction show better than a min opener or any hand w/4@ss?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: thx Roland. i guess is have to move back to my apartment then|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: i'd hate to rebid a suit headed by 8|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: re Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: re|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: http://sf2009.sportbridge.lt/ talk only about team play made before|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why is East taking so long?|pg||
nt|haans: i say his not |pg||
nt|haans: internet problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W has to be careful now. If S ducks and W plays another @s..|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|mareczek: it is sensible policy to bid with a spade fit, not to pass|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ryskiel_: on torture I dont admit for such suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: especjally having such clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|xenya: duly punished here -- EW have an excellen @H partial|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: on CR WE play 4@H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ardf10987: May be also 3nt can be "stolen" in some way... 1@S 3@H 1@D 4@C... but I admit is near double dummy...|pg||
nt|mareczek: partner has easier decision knowing about the fit|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|xenya: might even make on soft defence|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to strain for the stars. It was not good to allow a 5-3 fit to play when E/W had in fact a 5-4 club fit.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|ryskiel_: Jagniewski consider @C encouraging|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now W must take his 4@c tricks and give up|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Will only get the four club tricks now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Can they find it with 5-4 in @S - dont think so...|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Major suit always dominate the minor suits|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course the defense shown was unlikely (the @hq on the 2nd round), so i guess he misguessed the @hs and managed to lose 1 trick in each suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South should bid something now. Either 1@S or 2@D.|pg||
nt|wojela2: 2@d = one major suit|pg||
nt|xenya: on 14, Euro AGRO were rather lucky to bid and make 4@S in the other room -- 6 imps to them |pg||
nt|wojela2: bold bid, but based "the balance of the table"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unusual for a Polish pair to play 12-14 NT. Maybe they don't|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: 1@H showing 4+@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: lazy board we can relaxed|pg||
nt|wojela2: careful defense beats 4@h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wojela2: it is rather easy for east to find it|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand that -- and more importantly, neither did N|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|mareczek: once again trump lead would be most effective|pg||
nt|haans: rode the five hundred|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After the nt-opening S must find @hJ - or?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: and it did make -- perhaps it's not so easy to beat, if at all posssible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe an upgrade - no threes or fours either |pg||
nt|santyclz: I see s has read my book on opening leads.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: Titled:  2 tricks for you.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Some pairs would double 1@D only when they held both majors. With one major, they would bid it (on 4 cards or 5). That might help E/W to contest on some hands instead of selling ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: out to a diamond fit.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and no 10's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: added a point because no matter what suit is led he can win the trick if everyone plays a small card|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: two more rounds of @c staying on the table and a @d and exit in any major|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: Why didnt East bid 5 NT confirming all key cards?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Certainly the right suit for it.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: The best chance of game is 4@H, so South shows the major suit.|pg||
nt|mareczek: anyway, WE should reach a heart games wich probably would be made|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: A little strong though it they're playing preemptive jump overcalls for a non-vul one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now 1NT (what else?) This does not show a balanced hand. Oh, he has bid 2@C!|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: can any specs say anything abour their systems?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H with a longer minor - < opening?|pg||
nt|sharkey: See hand 1|pg||

pc|d9|nt|sharkey: never said that - a lot easier to comment when we don't have to guess so much|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mareczek: South was lucky|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would have bid 2@H over 1NT, allowing South to advance.|pg||
nt|mareczek: he took the risk of playing 3NT with 21 PC and potential misfit|pg||
nt|mareczek: hoping that club suit will work also in NT|pg||
nt|mareczek: but heart fit improved his chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C had little advantage over 1NT, as I see it.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mareczek: i think it was a correct startegy when loosing 20 imps 6 boards to the end|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. You make as many bad bids as possible, hoping that it will work well?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mareczek: 2@c = twosuiter with hearts, at least 5-4, 7-11 PC|pg||

nt|mareczek: NS play also similar 2@d - twosuiter with spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Marek|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|mareczek: hi everybody from Vilnius|pg||
nt|haans: stay on Marek|pg||
nt|mareczek: I will try tu support you|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: they are having problems now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: director is here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure what East's 3@D meant|pg||
nt|haans: uonly director can help you here :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be Daiva can find out|pg||
nt|haans: id say asking for stopper. Normally you show stopper in one of their suits |pg||
nt|haans: so east did wrong?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I dont know - S has relayed with 2@D |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS in the optimal contract - advantageous lead - why call Director - must be EW|pg||
nt|haans: just a relay meaning some acceptance for dim but do not show that suit|pg||
nt|haans: 'if dim are your suit you may pass'|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - S has 17 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: 3clubs were alerted bad|pg||
nt|sharkey: He'll bid 3 NT alone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: partner thought that with diamonds|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Better 1NT - 2@H and... if you want to look for IMPs, bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The cards lie very well for declarer.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009frunda2.html running scores for both matches|pg||
nt|brolucius: Monaco collected 10 IMPs (a 4 and a 6) by competing one level higher on the boards where we saw E/W here sell out to a two-level fit.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @D4?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|mareczek: I think that Lithuania do not want to risk adventures in part score with substantial lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: But there is also a preemptive purpose|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: 4-6-4-6-4-6 will soon erode such a lead, though.|pg||
nt|mareczek: than|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: many would bid just 2H with the E hand, more would try 2C intending to rebid 3H. by i do not mind the slight overbid because it is simple and practical. true, it could lead to a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: simple practical minus score, but IMPs is about the big reward|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: Now it s an open book with @sA on W|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still 10 tricks. one @d can be discarded on @s|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, there a advantages and disadvantages, the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages on this hand.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would also bid 2@s opposite a pass pd, but 1@s if pard weren't a passed hand.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in my opinion declarer could have done better. a small @h from W towards @hK. I think N will win with the @hA and then....|pg||
