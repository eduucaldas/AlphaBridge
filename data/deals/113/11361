nt|haans: and we start with a part score|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|haans: EW some spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I expect East will pass, after due consideration.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||
nt|sharkey: surprised S passed|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: that i did not understand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2° suit...|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East has nothing attractive to do, but (let's hope) he will soon select something or other. Yes, a trump.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mareczek: trumps now, and trump after @d ace|pg||
nt|mareczek: reduces declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sharkey: no - N's opening though I understand...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: the auction looks mysterious but they certainly kmw what they are doing|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: N seems to have overbid here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|xenya: but it must be a difficult hand for their methods|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|xenya: playing WJS, it might be easier -- 1@D -- 2@S -- all pass|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ardf10987: If some declarer has to be "reduced", why not me... (over 100kg) :) I would be happy :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: I mentioned earlier that E/W were unlikely to concede an early 13 IMPs. It seems that Vainikonis is equally determined not to concede even 1 IMP.  His trump plays have worked well.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d5|nt|sharkey: I haven't seen a 2@C opener like this before - normally shows an opening hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharkey: N makes a natural @D lead as West's 2@D merely a relay bid - not necessarily suit|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mareczek: here club ruff beats 4@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mareczek: but NS should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: At 18.00 on a Monday, unless Italy is playing on BBO VuGraph.|pg||

nt|vugraphzxk: sorry|pg||

nt|brolucius: A brave bid by South, who should be rewarded.|pg||
nt|mareczek: when partner has passed|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: I liked also East's 3@C, although it has not worked out as he intended.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: np|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|ryskiel_: hi all|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|sharkey: West's 1@S appears undiciplined with only ywo jacks - may be conventional....?|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: EW may go to high in @H|pg||

nt|mareczek: and double of 3@s shows points|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: so S knew p had only 1|pg||
nt|mareczek: now Starkowki treated opponents seriously|pg||

nt|mareczek: It seems declarer could bring the contract home due to firendly position of @dKQx|pg||
nt|mareczek: and club spots - WE cannot play clubs to eliminate entry to dummy without loosing the club trick|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That 3NT might possibly be the 'early 13 IMPs' that I mentioned. If Lithuania end in 4@H and go down on the club ruff.|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@c - Polish club - natural 15+, balanced 12-14 or strong - 18+, any distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: Gdansk must mean polish team?|pg||
mc|7|nt|mareczek: 2@d - majors|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anything higher than the 2 level spells problems here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in 15 South play 3 NT and lost 1 down before after @S lead|pg||
nt|xenya: we saw this hand a few minutes ago -- it was 3N by NS 2 off|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mareczek: as in Polish systems, after double of 1@c we use old herbert negative 1@d|pg||
nt|mareczek: East should play the @c7, not the jack|pg||
nt|mareczek: but position was slightly difficult|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sharkey: Can they find it with 5-4 in @S - dont think so...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|sharkey: Major suit always dominate the minor suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South should bid something now. Either 1@S or 2@D.|pg||
nt|wojela2: 2@d = one major suit|pg||
nt|xenya: on 14, Euro AGRO were rather lucky to bid and make 4@S in the other room -- 6 imps to them |pg||
nt|wojela2: bold bid, but based "the balance of the table"|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: 1@H showing 4+@S|pg||
nt|haans: 7@S down|pg||
nt|wojela2: on|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Yes|pg||
nt|haans: very unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 7@C|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: lazy board we can relaxed|pg||
nt|wojela2: careful defense beats 4@h|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wojela2: it is rather easy for east to find it|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand that -- and more importantly, neither did N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|mareczek: once again trump lead would be most effective|pg||
nt|haans: rode the five hundred|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: and it did make -- perhaps it's not so easy to beat, if at all posssible|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Some pairs would double 1@D only when they held both majors. With one major, they would bid it (on 4 cards or 5). That might help E/W to contest on some hands instead of selling ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: out to a diamond fit.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: Why didnt East bid 5 NT confirming all key cards?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @H adn @C to 9 |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|haans: dont ask be lucky|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think it's very difficult to bid 7@C on that hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ryskiel_: Soth mistaked - he bid as after 2 @D Multi opening, though also bad|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: This is the second deal in a short space of time where E/W have sold out at the two-level to an 8-card trump fit. Most experts hate doing that.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|wojela2: probably South plays another syetm than North|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: but surely S can't have long @Ss?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: by the way that is another sequence which I see 1st time in my not short bridge life|pg||
nt|xenya: so if N's 2@D was a multi, he should have acted accordingly|pg||
nt|xenya: by bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: South is relatively Young as bridge player so many thing mixed him|pg||
nt|xenya: the whole thing is very strange|pg||

mb|1S|nt|haans: see 2@C mean nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: again not excitying board?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@C means???|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The best chance of game is 4@H, so South shows the major suit.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Now 1NT (what else?) This does not show a balanced hand. Oh, he has bid 2@C!|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Yes, no problem. We could see what was going to happen. He could make the low trumps for 620.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 2@S is enough, facing a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Don't know if that decision will stand - strange|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Pass would be too greedy, perhaps allowing competition in clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On some deals, it would work well to win with the ace, so West could not ruff a diamond honour on the second round. Here the defenders have plenty of communication, though.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1NT South because 2/1 is GF|pg||
