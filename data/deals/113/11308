nt|jcwla: Teams are Belarus, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine, and two from the host, Lithuania.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6 actually makes but is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to bid - it needs too many suits to behave|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|wojela2: either double 4@h - hard...|pg||

nt|rodal f: U see the resault now. Here u are the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|doks: @D 2 must be 3/5 lead, so take in account 3NT bid by W it looks like 3 not 1 @D?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|wojela2: from his cards it could be reasonable to think that doubler has mainly the spade tricks|pg||

nt|doks: only major misunderstunding can create any score here|pg||
nt|rodal f: At 6@C NS have a sac for 1100 in @H. At @S 1IMP to gain at the sac.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4 @S can be beaten after @D lead - not easy from West hand|pg||

nt|mareczek: 2NT asks for shortness|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a coffe break board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And S revalues and breaks the transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree since W are to lead and woun't get signal for the @D early enoug for a ruff|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: noe declearer should quess @D position|pg||
nt|rodal f: enough|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: do assume 2@S did show 4 spades|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: East shoul put the Queen|pg||
pc|h4|nt|doks: nice idea, try to manage that :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2-2-4-3 makes 11 and fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: North's acceptance looks highly aggressive, but holds a distributional hand where who knows what will make and could make 8 or 10 as easily as 9.  They pay 500 for making a vul ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: game and besides, put the pressure on early and keep it on.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mareczek: 3@d 5422 good diamonds|pg||

nt|mareczek: if partner with 5422 has not @hk|pg||

nt|lestergold: altho as cards lie 4h would roll in probably|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: is 6@C on here - don't think it's biddable though?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@C convetional since S didnt support?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if you joined us only now - there are 11 nations competing, we have 2 teams from Lithuania, second team substituted Malta|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mareczek: it is not only difficult to bid 6@c but also to make :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c has play but it depends on the hearts developing to get rid of wo spade losers and a 3/2 trump break i would not be too comfortable in 6C altho im sure roland would be delighted|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Marek|pg||
nt|sharkey: Roland wud make it....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  today and tomorrow - full round robin, 10 boards per match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Certainly|pg||
nt|sharkey: low @H to the 9...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The best line in the suit is to run the queen - around 44%|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure its possible in fact because then you need to ruff a spade in north's hand but you need to ruff a heart to develop them you cant draw the trumps and eat them as well|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009runda4.html - running scores|pg||
nt|lestergold: even low to 9h u still have to ruff one|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: NS have now a four way choice of game|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no you can do a loser on loser then i think but its very academic|pg||
nt|sharkey: see only 11 in @C|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That's wrong - you can simply lose one heart to West|pg||
nt|ritong: three work, the fourth, 3NT, does not|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C is a reasonable spot and 4H is not absurd either|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart pips are very good here|pg||
nt|sharkey: y  2+4+1+5 in @C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: mOYSEAN 4@s HERE?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that makes too yes|pg||

nt|ritong: hmm..|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: As Rixi Marcus said "Bid boldly - play bravely"|pg||
nt|ritong: south interpreted the auction as a slam try when it was just a game research, seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is only 1 line if they can manage a cross ruff after picking the heart|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point is now!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: but i8s it actually doable?|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|rodal f: Defence against 4 should be clear after the 2@D bid.|pg||
nt|frankaus: Y need to be clairvoyant to lead @C by W|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: thin @C slam - inpractice not to bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: By pass hand at N they will stop. Might N opend in o r|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@C need @H play from S|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|mareczek: Saulis should bid 3@h immediately after 1NT|pg||

pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Some use that. Your NT variant|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|doks: with balanced hand we pass, 2M is weak, 2@H here will be at least good rise with support|pg||

nt|andyv:  coffee, mike?|pg||
nt|sharkey: afternoon tea...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well here its a good looking slam apart from the nasty breaks|pg||
nt|andyv:  4N|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sfoxa:  having NS hand - 6 diamond looks great, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean 12 top tricks in either minor normally but not today |pg||
nt|sharkey: In old days 4 NT opening bid meant which Ace - 5@C being none.  Still the same meaning?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lestergold: but n?S are on a slam roll and they wont stay out of this so simple to bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S opened with game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: ideal hand for the old 4n opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - except ehre do you want to place the final contract?|pg||
nt|ritong: very close to, @c J missing|pg||
nt|lestergold: when south finds partne has an ace he will play slam|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't agree - one ace with partner does not make the South hand worth slam - you need a fit too|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: he has 2 8 card fits|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you find Ace in pd's hand, you will bid slam with S's hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: the odds are heavy for slam no one is going to pussy foot around with south's hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Also 1@C followed by a reverse into diamonds is a decent way to approach the South hand |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  except when you end up playing 1@C|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wow...impressive|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly neither has a hope here|pg||
nt|sharkey: S assuming N has more @D than @C view 3 NT bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be a push though|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm impressed they are playing in their 5-3 instead of 6-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: unlike last hand which i expect will be a big swing for san marino|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|mareczek: if 4 @d would be with 4@c, slam would be made|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: i think they ar in their 5/3 fit by coincidence south maybe feels that the solidity if the diamonds makes it safer|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: slam is really excellent, makes with " normal" breaks plus a bonus|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N expressed his disappointment to S for non-showing club support|pg||

nt|lestergold: he also knows that partner has 2 clubs at most because of failure to support|pg||

nt|ritong: so declarer, most likely, will get ruffed at trick 5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sharkey: As expected Luxemburg didnt bid slam on Board 3 so San Marino ahead now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  by 1 imp, actually|pg||
nt|ritong: if he does not, that would mean a slightly inferior play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: off 2 if play one more trump now...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: not wanting to benefit of the @d length with @c length|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: unless east isonlead and decides to gt busy with his 5 card club suit to the q not likely to be a recommended lead|pg||

nt|ritong: say you hold @s AKxx @h KJxx facing a 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|ritong: after stayman, you know he has both majors|pg||
nt|ritong: so, which one|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: if you play in @ss, it can staert @h and @h ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: if you play in @hs, this won t happen|pg||
nt|sharkey: S shud cue now - much too good for 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Henri|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if the spoades are 4/1 it can start  with a spade lead in with the supposed heart and still give ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: so, more generally, when you have a pure choice of suits, better pick the one where you have not the ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think its about 50/50|pg||

nt|lestergold: south must have taken it as game forcing and on that basis south has slam values|pg||

nt|sharkey: 4@S made in CR board 6 too - not sure how it happened|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: Roland it was reached by over bidding |pg||

nt|sharkey: It could have made up for the slam on board 4 which deserved to make Mike|pg||
