mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|eggy: maintained by a fellow commentator|pg||
nt|ady: played qietly in 2@D CR|pg||
nt|eggy: all comments gratefully received - but to him please :)|pg||
nt|dburn: half-time score in this match was de Botton 29 Scerri 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: essentially this is game on a finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For new specs. Unfortunately the score after the 1st half has not been carried forward. It is 7-29|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: not working tonight|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may get too high now|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn: er... which game is on a finesse?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I guess 4@s may be the best game|pg||
nt|ady: bidding was conservative in CR in view of north's strong hand|pg||
nt|eggy: well 4S is slightly more than a finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eggy: as is 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3NT needs a finesse and the defence to be unable to cash more than four hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: or no heart lead|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@s needs a finesse and 4-3 spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: or blockage|pg||
nt|lady007: handle you sounds like you are the player you are not :)|pg||
nt|ady: defence needs to get hearts played to create a force on North|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|lady007: oops|pg||
nt|eggy: hoever on a non Heart lead 4S has some other chances i think|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: it does, but a shift to hearts removes most of those|pg||
nt|dburn: provided that the defence continues hearts, of course|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|eggy: only if with a continuation|pg||

nt|ady: should not guess that    just win 2nd club on dummy and play a diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hyperactive auction in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D too imaginative for me|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ady: west suffered in 3@CX in CR    all cards wrong plus 5-0 trump break|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|dburn: better bid now, though - bad idea to play 3@c doubled in both rooms|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D looks routine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and pass is also routine by south|pg||
nt|dburn: pass? this is forcing, sin't it?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: then they will be overboard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: i dont think so but..............|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, we cue bid the opponents' suit and then we jump - you can't pass that unless you can show your death certificate on demand|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, what was a bad lie in 3@c doubled may be a good lie in 5@d, but there's a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D with south   would have beden a play|pg||
nt|ady: been|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not have bid 2@D and having misdescribed ny hand already - i would take my plus score (hopefully)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR is short for The Great Rose, a rubber bridge club in central London, near Marble Arch. Named after the late and great Irving Rose|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure that's got him anywhere much - no doubt he was hoping West would drop the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: i cant see 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|dburn: but his best shot for the contract was to ruff trick one in dummy, think for a long time, then take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: and hope his opponents did not notice his lead from the wrong hand|pg||

nt|lestergold: note how quick on the trigger N/S ae prepard to double part scores quite freely and usually correctly too|pg||
