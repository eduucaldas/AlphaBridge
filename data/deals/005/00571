nt|ritong: thanks, ben|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ritong: has a big incidence on tactics|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Both of these teams are six handed, you must check in the open room to find who is playing.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ritong: the gap in terms of points has NO importance|pg||
nt|swanson: Evidently there are three boards, maybe four per found.  Then we will change at least one pair.|pg||
nt|ritong: so, the arithmetic bets we usually use do not have the same weight|pg||
nt|ritong: at all.|pg||
nt|inquiry: This is the hardest form of competition... you can't rest on any hand, at any time.... |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: the goal is : win the board|pg||

nt|inquiry: If you are new to BAM, the Reisinger finals from orlando will be on vugraph here.. that is BAM as well....|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|adolfod: later she will be happy playing spade finesse against the player non dangerous, lol|pg||
nt|swanson: A third best lead (convention) would have helped Radin make the tough duck of the @CA.|pg||
nt|ahh: rehi all|pg||
nt|adolfod: hi|pg||
nt|swanson: If declarer cashes her minor suit winners here, West is not going to enjoy finding two discards.|pg||
nt|ahh: tough for west to work out trick target here is it to beat hand or save overtricks|pg||
nt|adolfod: should she play @s J?|pg||
nt|swanson: That's the play I expect, looks safest.|pg||
nt|vugraph7: resluts was down one|pg||
nt|ahh: great bd for east west|pg||
nt|adolfod: unexpected score|pg||
nt|swanson: Difficult to understand that result.|pg||
nt|adolfod: perhaps she tried to put radin with diamonds to make her play spades |pg||
nt|swanson: She probably got a club back, cashed hearts, then diamonds, and tried to endplay East with the fourth diamond.|pg||
nt|swanson: That lost when East unexpectedly held two more clubs.|pg||
nt|ahh: well probably helps captain with seating arrangements :)|pg||

nt|ritong: unfortunately this time|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|adolfod: exactly what you said, the correct play, but in this lay works bad|pg||
nt|ritong: cause attack @cs from dummy means inserting the ten if a low appears|pg||
nt|ritong: awful..|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|swanson: If anything, you would place the longer spades with West, making it slightly more likely that club length is with East.|pg||

nt|lrargerich: I agree North must use a 4 level transfer and settle in 4@s|pg||
