nt|poohbear: BAM is often a question of what you think will happen at the other table|pg||

nt|tsanders: too bad, I spent a lovely day with him in Napoli about 12 years ago|pg||
nt|poohbear: a note on the change in qualification for the final day of the Reisenger, Why are we going to 14 teams. It shortens the event. making the 3rd day is not nearly as prestigious. AND ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: most important is that each team only plays the others 4 boards  in stead of 6|pg||
nt|poohbear: If it AINT BROKE dont fix it|pg||
nt|tsanders: most of the best players in the world are playing in this tournament. Only flaw is lack of comparisons|pg||

nt|ahh: this type of scoring is rarely used in europe  i would love to see it used more  very exciting  format|pg||

nt|ahh: team of 8 scoring  often uses total points|pg||
nt|tsanders: the 1st few of Bermuda Bowls were total points. Imps came in about 1962|pg||
nt|tsanders: it took awhile to perfect the imp scale|pg||
nt|ahh: for late comers we are waiting for next move   2 board rounds are being played |pg||
nt|poohbear: now if only  they can get the victory point scale correct:)|pg||
nt|tsanders: and Edgar Kaplan had a lot to do with it|pg||

nt|poohbear: ruff a@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|csimon: yes - overruff is trump trick|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|sJ|nt|tsanders: For you folks awaking in Far East: Many experts consider board-a-match the most exacting form of the game. Equal weight is accorded each deal and every trick is important when ...|pg||
nt|tsanders: scoring is board-by-board. Scoring is 1 point for winning the board, 1/2 point for a tie, and 0 for losing it.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|mb|r|nt|poohbear: alot of thought goes into these hands even though alot of it really doesnt matter since teammates may have won or lost the board already|pg||
nt|poohbear: course cant know it for sure|pg||
nt|poohbear: rdbl shows 1 suiter most likely over weak NT dbl|pg||
nt|csimon: e/w can make at least 8 tricks in @hs and perhaps 9, so -50 N/S in the other room was a decent result|pg||
nt|poohbear: 14-16 nt I am told|pg||
