mb|p|pc|hT|nt|poohbear: but spades do and East has no entry to her heart suit|pg||
nt|bg: hearts are blocked more important|pg||
pc|h4|nt|poohbear: so declarer will wind up being forced to guess the @d'|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|poohbear: 3nt was played from the other side on board 2 and the defense had no problem switching to a heart when in with the spade ace|pg||
nt|tsanders: should be easy now|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: so awin  to Westheimer on 2|pg||
nt|tsanders: yes, a @d ruff will set 4@s, will it be found?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: quite a view there|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Allison pass is too conservative|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would bid a game|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||

nt|tsanders: A hal time: Narasimham 20.56... Sprung 19.15...Winestock 17.51...Labe 16.79|pg||
nt|poohbear: down 2 in 5 clubs for -300 against a game that may or may not be beaten but it didnt matter since EW stop in a part score here|pg||
nt|tsanders: decimals in halftime scores come from compulation of carryover from qualifying|pg||
nt|tsanders: as we have been watching this Westheimer team (Breed/Quinn) seems they are doing very well score wise|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|poohbear: if East showed 4-4-4-1 then that tipped off the heart lead|pg||

pc|hT|nt|dburn: It has always struck me as the height of folly for a 1NT opener to have to give away lots of information before becoming declarer.|pg||
nt|poohbear: if declarer ducks this entirely she can make 5 on a heart club squeeze |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|dburn: Stayman is, in truth, a pretty inefficient convention. Wonder how it ever caught on? :)|pg||

nt|tsanders: might, but could be held to =|pg||
nt|dburn: Perhaps, but East could signal for diamonds on the second round of spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: this could be held to 4|pg||
nt|tsanders: now we wait a little for the next pair to come here|pg||
nt|poohbear: alot of times none of this matters as the other table is playing in some contract where the board is either won or lost already|pg||
nt|bg: 3nt not likely to make 5 opps would surely get together after Ace and one spade|pg||
nt|dburn: It could have been held to four, but although there is a case for East to lead a diamond, it's not an overwhelming case|pg||
nt|tsanders: Now we can ask David Burn what he is doing in Orlando?|pg||
nt|poohbear: geeeeee playing Bridge?:)|pg||
nt|tsanders: no, he is commentating|pg||
nt|dburn: He is playing in the Reisinger at the weekend, and hoping to play in the Edgar Kaplan Blue Ribbon Pairs tomorrow|pg||
nt|poohbear: went to sample gourmet food at Chick filet:)|pg||
nt|dburn: But, since he hasn't got any American master points, he will have to ask Rick Beye very nicely :)|pg||
nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|tsanders: BTW, Breed and Quinn are from Texas. Glasson and Berkowitz reside in New Jersey|pg||
nt|poohbear: so I got some results. Board 10 they missed the slam so a push. board 11 where EW saved in 5h -300 their teammates made 4sp dbled for a win|pg||
nt|poohbear: NS saved I mean|pg||
nt|ritong: double good board|pg||
nt|ritong: pity|pg||
nt|poohbear: and this board was a push as well|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 2 points to Westheimer|pg||
