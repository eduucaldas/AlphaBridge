mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|kareno: Feldman's nickname is Flash, mainly because he is noted for slow play.  When we've asked him what he's thinking about, his reply has always been, "I'm thinking about every board I ...|pg||
nt|kareno: ever played."|pg||
nt|poohbear: could be a candidate for the worlds slowest pair. Though Bart would have to really turn it off to pass Barnet Shenkin one of Marks other partners:)|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|roghog: yes, especially at this scoring|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I would always double 1@s for takeout with the north hand.. who else would?|pg||

nt|poohbear: Hampson really soft pedalled his hand|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: There's actually no guess in diamonds with east having passed the opening bid.  However, with KQx of diamonds it's possible to duck and convince declarer to play the nine (or to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: rise with KTx and hope he misguesses).|pg||
nt|ritong 1: we could have an interesting @d handling here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kareno: It is a suit with many possible plays by declarer and defense.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kareno: But with east passing over 1@s I think it plays automatically even if Bramley rises with the queen on the first play.|pg||
nt|ritong 1: for the art:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, our kibitzers should learn to play the Queen in such a situation to make it harder for declarer.|pg||
nt|ritong 1: true.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|reisig: except when partner has singleton King!|pg||
nt|kareno: And in the expert game, play low with KQx and make declarer guess to play the jack :-)|pg||
nt|kareno: Now, Richie, don't pour water on my theories :-)|pg||
nt|vugraph7: 2 more rounds after this one|pg||

nt|ritong: delicate carding after the @d lead, though|pg||
nt|poohbear: notice that North only raised to 3 spades with his 12 count|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 reasons . 1 they open very light and 2 aceless|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kareno: They open quite light in their style.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|kareno: So, if the score posted is correct, our fine team that we've watched all day should qualify with just average tonight.|pg||

mb|5H|nt|reisig: There are other ways|pg||
nt|ritong: oki|pg||
nt|vugraph7: The running tally on this screen only shows a 2 board carryover for Brachman, but they were the leaders after day 1 and actually have a full 4 board carryover|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|reisig: The 4@s bid = NO SLAM|pg||

nt|kareno: a slam try.  Greco disciplined here.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hampson should make a play that will tell his pard he has the @D king|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: reason that EW can open 1nt with 4-4-4-1 is because they play a canape system. which means that they bid short suits before long suits. therefore 4-4-4-1 is a very hard hand to ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: BAM is the ultimate form of Matchpoint scoring. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: It is most important not to step out and put boards at risk.. most often they will be won or lost on better defense/declarer play.|pg||

nt|vugraph7: Actually a sneaky director is getting the results from the Brachman EW pair and bringing them over to me after each round.|pg||

nt|vugraph7: I'm entering them so that we have an actual comparison, but all I get is the results.|pg||
nt|tsanders: for you late comers: Many experts consider board-a-match the most exacting form of the game. Equal weight is accorded each deal and every trick is important when scoring is ...|pg||
nt|tsanders: board-by-board. Scoring is 1 point for winning the board, 1/2 point for a tie, and 0 for losing it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, right, east was passed.  However, west had a great hand and east could easily have had more.|pg||
nt|vugraph7: Eric and Geoff don't think that 2nt was GF (esp since rees was a passed hand)|pg||
