nt|Walddk2: Make your partner happy and support. Shuman will be thrilled to hear 4@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|stewball: at this vul it doesnt seem like a winning tactic|pg||
nt|mikeh: I don't mind it in the context of the method... I like to hold an Ace or at least a King when I respond light|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: regardless of their methods|pg||

nt|stewball: this 2@h bid is likely tactical given Koch is a passed hand|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dinos1: and the only forcing is 1n?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikeh: but do they not have it as at least constructive? otherwise the forcing notrump becomes overloaded, if it has to contain invitational hands as well as big ones?|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|stewball: lots of non strong club hands make game|pg||
nt|cascade: yes especially if there is a heart fit|pg||

pc|d3|pg||

nt|stewball: can any recall a women pair winning the blue ribbons before?|pg||
nt|mikeh: but he knows that if south has great @H and @C, he cannot hold a @D stopper as well, so 9 tricks seems very unlikely. He is hoping, I assume, for a good 5-5 or better|pg||

nt|reisig: 2@c risky|pg||
nt|stewball: auctions starting with 2@c are one of the major weaknesses of a big club system|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cascade: yes to minimize undertricks you need two spade stoppers or more values|pg||
nt|mikeh: esp opp a passed hand, and since 2@Cx making is low cost for opps|pg||
nt|stewball: ive been advised that no womens PAIR has won the blue ribbons...would be a great coup for them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: because of the wide range,,some systems would require a 1@d start with Ames hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|reisig: with 7 easy tricks ...will gain a bit|pg||
nt|mikeh: that looks like a conservative view by schermer, with the equivalent of a 13 count in prime cards|pg||
