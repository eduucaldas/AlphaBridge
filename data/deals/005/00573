nt|csimon: the great shuffler has been working overtime!|pg||
nt|inquiry: Most people consider Board-a-Match Teams to be the toughest type of event in tournament bridge.  |pg||
nt|inquiry: very nicely played by ames|pg||
nt|gerben42: as 12 has not been played yet they can still avoid that board from being cancelled as well assuming they were switched|pg||
mb|1S|nt|inquiry: now we are back to the real 11... it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|aconterno: all overtricks count in this format|pg||
nt|gerben42: yes|pg||
nt|gerben42: that looks more like it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|aconterno: u get 1 point for winning a board|pg||
nt|gerben42: correct as well as even if the @H hook works you still need another trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Cohen is wondering (a) where are the clubs (b) what is all this bidding.|pg||
nt|inquiry: Right. This makes Board-A-Match is very demanding because EVERY board is equally important.  There is no hand you can relax on.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|inquiry: Vulnerable they would bid game for sure, not vulenrable, they have to push a little to match the resullt in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|gerben42: forcing NT by north who will now invite|pg||
nt|inquiry: The club bid improved north's hand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|csimon: Bjerkan shows us just how little is needed to try to sabotage the opponents auction!|pg||
nt|aconterno: a lot of points in this deck|pg||
nt|inquiry: some one else will have to example the bidding here to me... |pg||
nt|gerben42: sure that is a strong @C|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|swanson: Linda Lewis in the North is likely to bid again even after the double.  She does |pg||
nt|swanson: not have a defensive hand.|pg||
nt|aconterno: but what 5@c or 5@h?|pg||
nt|csimon: I think Lewis has a very difficult decision here at the equal vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gerben42: maybe it's the other way around|pg||
nt|inquiry: nicely done... to carry on to game. Not vul, there was a chance koch would pass, but he didn't think long|pg||
pc|d4|nt|csimon: this contract has very few losers on top, but lots of handling problems|pg||
nt|gerben42: but still a bit light for strong @C|pg||
nt|inquiry: As we said last time this hand was up (hehehe), if EW push hearts it will make five. On this lead, Rosenkrantz team will pick up one imp|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|gerben42: must be other way around Koch does not have a pass|pg||
nt|inquiry: this doesn't seem right to me... nor does diamond king look normal.. I think we are upsdie down wth a low diamond lead.....|pg||
nt|gerben42: audience says this bidding is board 12|pg||
nt|gerben42: operator are they playing 12?|pg||
nt|gerben42: on 12 Chambers will  have a natural @DK lead|pg||
nt|inquiry: Five spades, 4 clubs and a diamond is 10 tricks. If EW start hearts it is possible to set up long heart for an 11th.. here he will win 10, but lose 8 imps|pg||
nt|gerben42: they are in fact playing 11 but the cards from 12 are in board 11!|pg||
nt|gerben42: remember these cards we might see them on the next board...|pg||

nt|swanson: A trump lead would have been better, but I only see 9 tricks for declarer.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting 4@H here (if they get that high). It depends on a restricted choice guess|pg||

nt|jjsb2: looks hard to avoid a game NS would probably be 3nt |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: I never played against Reese.  Would have been fun.  Shapiro was playing until recently - might still be playing.|pg||
nt|aconterno: @s will win the partial score?|pg||
nt|gerben42: as they did in the open room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gerben42: another strong @C|pg||
nt|jjsb2: probably uncontested auction note u better not play 4@h |pg||
mb|1H|an|reds or blacks|nt|jjsb2: well 4 @h it will not be |pg||
nt|jjsb2: :) |pg||
nt|gerben42: but maybe still 1@Hx|pg||
nt|gerben42: or 2@Dx|pg||
mb|d|an|8-11|nt|jjsb2: yes we migth have some action now |pg||
nt|gerben42: if NS play negative doubles this would be the time for one|pg||
nt|gerben42: ahh|pg||
nt|gerben42: now that's interesting, harder to catch them now|pg||
nt|gerben42: 1@H showing two suits of the same color|pg||
nt|jjsb2: schermer would like it's black :) but he knows already that he's in trouble |pg||
nt|inquiry: The heart overcall will help with the play in NT... i they don't play 1@Hx.. hard to pass at this vul....|pg||
mb|p|nt|csimon: Bjerkan would do well to dbl 2@d|pg||
nt|gerben42: well before they get to 3NT it will be clear that Chambers has the reds and Schermer the blacks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gerben42: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|gerben42: the @H spots are good for Chambers|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|inquiry: makes at least 4 tricks.. so rosenkratnz is picking up imps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|aconterno: Bj lost her opportunity|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|inquiry: this is why it is hard to pass this double at this vul.. .even with a six card suit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gerben42: in danger to get only 300 now|pg||
nt|inquiry: Any other vulnerabilty, pass is automatic of course|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|csimon: at this vul, west should strive to introduce the black suits|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|csimon: 3@s dbl would probably be -100|pg||
pc|sA|nt|aconterno: and a good score in this format|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|swanson: Not vul West should have come into the auction as you say Carol.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gerben42: was better to continue @C to force declarer to ruff|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think Boris Shapiro is playing any more unless there's a bridge club in Heaven. Shapiro died almost 2 years ago, aged 93|pg||
nt|inquiry: Looks like sure 4 imps for Rosenkranz....|pg||
nt|gerben42: but a @D to the J will still result in 500 if he plays @C10 next so Ames can get rid of his @S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jjsb2: i think now it's just 300 |pg||
nt|gerben42: now only 300 as Ames has to concede a @S!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|gerben42: Koch had to take the @D to return a @C so Ames could get rid of his loser|pg||
nt|gerben42: 8 IMPs to Rosenkrantz now|pg||

nt|inquiry: remember this hand when you make low level doubles at this vulnerability.....|pg||
nt|jjsb2: i'm nto sure i said the result of board 12 did i?|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 3@s making 4 |pg||
nt|gerben42: Ames gets another nice hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: you need good trumps, not just long trumps....|pg||
nt|gerben42: @HJT97 were very good cards for Chambers|pg||
nt|gerben42: tells you how important those intermediates are|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|gerben42: @HAK432 might look nicer but in fact it isn't|pg||
mb|1D|nt|swanson: This round we have Gloria Milder and Gertrude Warshaver.|pg||
mb|p|nt|truffle: north south are on a team of four floridians, we continue to see bjerkan team|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jjsb2: so we are again in a strong club where 1@d response is weak |pg||
mb|p|nt|aconterno: can stop now?|pg||
nt|gerben42: 1@S second negative|pg||
mb|1N|an|0-5 with s[ades|nt|aconterno: thi will make|pg||
nt|gerben42: 1@S shows some values|pg||
nt|inquiry: i think 1@S here is second negative, maybe 1|pg||
nt|inquiry: mabye 1NT shows @Ss|pg||
nt|gerben42: 1NT sorry shows values|pg||
nt|gerben42: might show @S too|pg||
mb|p|nt|csimon: and it will make the same   of tricks as @hs|pg||
nt|aconterno: but 3@h is 140|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gerben42: hmm okay :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: 2@S now instead of showing support?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|aconterno: in @h will make one more|pg||
nt|gerben42: I would show support|pg||
nt|inquiry: this will let them stop in 3@Hs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jjsb2: i dont think 2nt is by schermer |pg||
nt|jjsb2: that will be corrected |pg||
nt|gerben42: yes 2NT by Ames|pg||
nt|inquiry: I think 2NT isn'tright at this vul.. must be north's bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: now 3@H|pg||
nt|inquiry: hmm... maybe 1@H only promises four....|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gerben42: could Ames have 4@H and 5@C for his bidding?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|truffle: it could have been a lot worse for nt if the diamond ace was wrong|pg||
nt|gerben42: that might explain the problem|pg||
pc|dA|nt|csimon: right - 5 losers|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|gerben42: some 50s will go to the Rosenkranz team|pg||
nt|gerben42: looks like at 3 down for the moment|pg||
nt|inquiry: well.. i think 2@S over 2@C was right, but eventually with support you just have to show it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|truffle: good hand for wolff signoff|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|hK|nt|inquiry: k|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Maybe they would get to game using Wolff's sign off once opener shows 3-card support|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gerben42: the surprising duck of @DK cost the 3rd undertrick|pg||
