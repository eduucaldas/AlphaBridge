nt|copeyj: yup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The difference between losing and winning the board|pg||
nt|copeyj: @H lead, count signal and switch|pg||
nt|tsanders: Fulvio, do you find it more difficult playing or doing commentary?|pg||
nt|copeyj: or both at once?|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|fulvio2002: it is easier playing |pg||
nt|tsanders: Ha Ha Ha, and they think this is easy!|pg||
nt|fulvio2002: because you make mistake without seeing the cards .... commentating it is possible to make mistake seeing all the cards  lol|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Who needs Deep Finesse when we have Deep Fulvio? :-)|pg||
nt|copeyj: Fulvio, a question from the audience, did the four of you, yourselves and Lauria-Versace ever consider playing the same system?|pg||
nt|fulvio2002: no , when i restarted to play few years ago with Claudio we decided to play LV system but|pg||
nt|fulvio2002: i didnt like a lot |pg||
nt|fulvio2002: it is wonderfull system |pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mikeh: 2@D at this stage was artificial. 3@C is very space consuming after that bid|pg||

nt|ritong: not very bammy decision|pg||
nt|ritong: in BaM, notrumps win boards|pg||
nt|mikeh: no, but she is off a keycard. Could partner be Jx AKQxxx x Jxxxx for example?.. However, the odds are against it|pg||
nt|mikeh: especially since I gave her 14 cards|pg||
nt|inquiry: yup 6@H is a  lost board for NS rather it is 6@H by WEst or south....|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but 6NT played by N make only 12 tricks after a @C-lead|pg||
nt|ritong: really?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|inquiry: seems. 5@S, 6@H, 5@D and 1@C even on @C lead|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mikeh: well, on @C lead, may decide to duck|pg||
nt|pelu: yes besr declayer-play is to finess|pg||
nt|mikeh: since playing A will result in -1 if @H loses and @C onside|pg||
nt|pelu: and N cant count 5 @D-tricks|pg||
nt|inquiry: why, always need @H hook and iwth it, you have !1C, 6@H, 3@S and 3@D and donw one in 6NT lose to 6@Hs|pg||
nt|ritong: he can see @c drop (unlikely, ok) , then @h finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: she*|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@C+5@S+3@D|pg||
nt|pelu: u play DD - after a "@C-lead it is normal play to finess|pg||
nt|pelu: even in BAM|pg||
nt|mikeh: and on this auction, leader is going to lead a @C more times than not, with or without the !K|pg||
nt|mikeh: against 6N|pg||
