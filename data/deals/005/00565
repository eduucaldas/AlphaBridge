Declarer cannot deal with single honor offside. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|weak (?)|mb|p|nt|kareno: In a diamond contract he can certainly remove the threat of losing two diamond tricks by the restricted choice play.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: He is adding points for the excellent diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: He can add more after they break conveniently.|pg||
nt|brolucius: E-W have plenty of time to get at their black suit tricks before the diamonds can be run.|pg||
nt|kareno: However, he cannot fetch nine tricks in hearts.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: 1 round of trumps - and @d for discards|pg||
nt|dinos1: 9 tricks if play @d top|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good point. West cannot ruff the third diamond.|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually he can do well if he stops drawing trumps at one round and plays on diamonds.  He'll take three diamonds, two aces and four hearts if he can figure out to do that.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent opening lead that word have worked if North held J-9-x (a SURROUND play)|pg||

nt|brolucius: How does partner know you have the king, then, when he is leading from A-x? |pg||
nt|kareno: West knows partner is leading a short suit.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps A-x and he has to tell partner if he has the king|pg||
nt|kareno: If partner is leading from Ax he will no doubt continue - but if it is singleton A he needs to know how to get to you for the ruff.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true|pg||
nt|kareno: Or partner leads any singleton and you haven't got the ace - it's important that he knows how to get to you once he gets the lead, say, with his trump trick.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Here the @DA was visible, so a club was the only chance anyway. |pg||
nt|kareno: This is when you can diagnose that the lead is from shortness.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, there was no trump entry for the defense when dummy had AKQ :-)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Everyone is playing/bidding well and all the boards are flat.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|an|alerted|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kareno: Sontag and Weichsel are playing again together after a long hiatus.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 14 teams remain and the camera floats (so Team 1/2 score at top left is not relevant)|pg||
nt|kareno: On Rose Meltzer's team.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Well, that's good as we will get to see the best against the best!|pg||
nt|brolucius: I watched them in London, in the 1970s, wearing flower-power velvet jackets|pg||
nt|dinos1: X or 4@d?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|kareno: Weichsel's double was a pre-balance, the short hand taking the bidding pressure.  Well done!|pg||
nt|vugraph9: weichsel claimed extra points for all four jacks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Meckstroth competed to the nine-trick level because he knew they held nine trumps between the hands (Law of Total Tricks) |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|poohbear: " Feels" like trumps 2-2 from the auction. We will see if Soloway messes around to try and get a count |pg||
nt|swanson: Soloway has to find a parking place for his third spade before drawing trump.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: He knows from the defensive tempo and cards that clubs are 3-3.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense will be forced to play hearts now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|an|2+ 11-15|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|an|GF stayman|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North would have doubled 20 years ago. Many would bid 1@H nowadays. 1NT is also good.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|dinos1: thx stayman|pg||

nt|timb: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|dinos1: or wd super-accept|pg||
nt|timb: Stayman would be consistent|pg||
nt|brolucius: A good and simple method is to play the same (Stayman + transfers) opposite a 1NT overcall as you do opposite a 1NT opening |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kareno: And that is exactly what I do in my partnership.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..and mine. Perhaps we should have a game together?|pg||
nt|kareno: And we use our 2NT system if we overcall 2NT over a preempt as well, by the way.|pg||
nt|dinos1: over minor - yes, over major - better cue as stayman and rest - trf (including 2@c)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: David it would be my pleasure :)|pg||
nt|vugraph9: claimed at trick two|pg||
nt|brolucius: Too early to say that... I screw up pretty often...|pg||
nt|timb: pretty flat|pg||
nt|brolucius: If truth be told, there has been little interest in the boards so far|pg||
nt|kareno: Alan Sontag is one of the fastest players on the planet - Peter Weichsel is not.  Good idea for Peter to claim as soon as possible to leave himself time for future boards :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Interesting method, Sergey. I will take a close look at it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: BBO should organise an amusing cartoon for when the players finish so quickly|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or we can continue our previous game of choosing an awful convention for every letter in the alphabet. Who has one for C and D? |pg||
nt|brolucius: There was general agreement that Flannery and Gerber were worthy candidates|pg||
nt|kareno: Whoa!!  I play four-card majors and Flannery is very useful for my system.|pg||
nt|kareno: Was Blackwood proposed?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Someone did propose Blackwood, but (used properly) it is a great tool.|pg||
nt|dinos1: no - blkw is useful:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Too often ABused.|pg||
nt|dinos1: gerber - another story|pg||

nt|dinos1: here your contracts shd be 50+%|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kareno: Berkowitz has opened up the diamond suit and declarer can actually take TEN tricks at this point.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South splits his diamonds, declarer will have to guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: He doesn't want to lose three spade tricks|pg||
nt|timb: surely he will cash out for a safe 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|timb: nine|pg||
nt|dinos1: 10 - 10 tr|pg||
nt|kareno: What's the risk finessing the diamond?|pg||
nt|kareno: If Larry Cohen had six spades he would likely have opened a weak two bid.|pg||
nt|timb: if it loses they cash three spades and a diamond  |pg||
nt|dinos1: no risk|pg||
nt|brolucius: If it was 'no risk' Balicki would have done it by now! |pg||
nt|dinos1: if duck - 8 or 10, if top - 8|pg||

nt|kareno: I think once everyone follows the first time, it's 52-48 percent for the drop.  Just like the missing two cards percentage.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The odds are 52% in favor of playing for the drop and 48% for finessing (without any other info)|pg||

nt|kareno: :-)|pg||
nt|dinos1: say you may cash top @h's and change your mind if @h are 5-2|pg||

nt|brolucius: That's risking too much if you guess wrong, isn't it? The hearts would then be bare.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still, going down is hardly likely to be a winning board|pg||

nt|brolucius: Ah, very good. A round-robin but you compare only with one current opponent. Thanks!|pg||

nt|kareno: Precisely.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I expect Lev cannot believe the giant hand that Rodwell had for his pre-empt. |pg||
nt|kareno: Rodwell had eight clubs but bid only 3 because he held an ace.  Didn't want to bypass 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not? only @d stiff is essential|pg||
nt|brolucius: He also wouldn't have wanted to bypass 3NT if he held J-x-x-x-x-x and a stiff Q|pg||
nt|dinos1: and pard is weak passing 3@c with long @h's|pg||
nt|dinos1: I see no reason in doublig|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm disinclined to preempt with outside aces.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: do WE steal a game from us?|pg||
nt|dinos1: ace cd be in Meckstroth hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Nor do I, frankly.  But Lev felt that Meckstroth was out stealing.  How it's possible when Pepsi didn't overcall hearts I don't know but he got that idea and acted on it.|pg||
nt|dinos1: and they play 5@c instead of 3n|pg||
nt|brolucius: A double by North was no certainty but it had as much to gain as it had to lose. He can hope for 2 diamond tricks and another winner or two from partner.|pg||
nt|dinos1: so cd be 430 vs 400|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is a good point at point-a-board.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But South could have 10 points and not like to bid weak-over-weak.|pg||
nt|dinos1: and good long @h? impossible|pg||
nt|brolucius: Long but not good|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@h bid is a sign of weakness|pg||
nt|kareno: North's double puts the board out of reach if the contract can be made.  I'd be very disinclined to double myself.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he was not strong enough to bid 3@H. That still leaves quite a wide range. He could easily have one or two top cards.|pg||
nt|dinos1: ok - give me one possible hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am a very timid doubler, in general. So, if I agree with Lev (even though I know it failed) there must be some case for a double! |pg||
nt|brolucius: Any hand containing the heart ace, for a start!|pg||
nt|kareno: Suppose 3NT and 5@c both make - perhaps with an overtrick in 3N - the double now costs a full board.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's less a problem double at IMPs.  So they make it and you lose a few IMPs.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not much of a problem when you can see all four hands. That's for sure!|pg||
nt|kareno: But here pard has stuck his neck out and achieved a good result (you weren't leading hearts) and you punish him for it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think you are being far too harsh on North. He is a great player and knows what he is doing!|pg||
nt|kareno: He IS a great player.  I don't deny that for a moment.|pg||

nt|poohbear: true 5n would probably go down 1|pg||
nt|poohbear: @H|pg||
nt|tsanders: for the benefit of you late arrivals: Many experts consider board-a-match the most exacting form of the game. Equal weight is accorded each deal and every trick is important when ...|pg||
nt|tsanders: scoring is board-by-board. Scoring is 1 point for winning the board, 1/2 point for a tie, and 0 for losing it.|pg||
nt|swanson: Nickell rolls on.  They are not likely to be caught.|pg||
nt|tsanders: one can play board-a-match on BBO if you can get 7 others to play|pg||

nt|brolucius: I would bet on it being a notrump slam :-)|pg||
nt|kareno: Yep, the auction told us that :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Wow, this is some partscore battle|pg||
nt|kareno: Hmm.. I'd think 2NT was for minors - wonder what Rodwell is thinking.|pg||

nt|vugraph9: this time zia politely knocked on the screen so no disaster with the aperture|pg||
nt|dinos1: after 2@s by Zia hardly 2n was asking about 5cd M|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, well, another push round :)  Will Zia lead trumps?  Oh, no?  Not best.|pg||
nt|kareno: Club finesse?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can score some tricks on a cross-ruff and will have to guess whether to finesse in clubs.|pg||
nt|kareno: I think it's too risky of a trump return.. we'll see, though.|pg||
nt|kareno: I think he must try to hold the loss to 100 so no finesse - we'll see.  four aces and four ruffs.|pg||
nt|kareno: Not vulnerable.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: can ruff and duck @d|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, he's vulnerable.  Then he must take the losing @c finesse.|pg||
nt|kareno: I kept thinking nonvulnerable.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Did he make 8 tricks. I must have miscounted. True it is 3.45 in the morning here. Looks like I should head for the soft bed.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's LATE in England and David is so kind to stick around with us all these hours :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5 ruffs and 3 aces :))|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, the ace of spades could have been taken :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Rodwell took as many tricks as he could - didn't risk down two, hopes for a push board.|pg||
nt|vugraph9: two rounds to go; the pace is slowing considerably *yawn*|pg||
nt|kareno: Probably the single most difficult thing in the game of bridge is the opening lead.  You often have very limited information and more contracts are made and broken on the opening ...|pg||
nt|kareno: lead than on anything else.|pg||
nt|kareno: Always be sympathetic when a great player doesn't find the double dummy best opening lead - it's very hard to be perfect in that one area.  All you can do is your best.|pg||
nt|kareno: After the opening lead, you can see that the great players know more about the hand at once.  If you could always find the best and winning opening lead, you would win any ...|pg||
nt|kareno: championship event, anywhere any time.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I can't switch off the machine when such as Z-R and M-R are performing. I must hope for two duff pairs to appear on the screen.|pg||
nt|kareno: There aren't two duff pairs left, David.  Poor lad, you'll just have to stick with us to the bitter end!!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, make it one duff pair, then. There must be someone who is not world-class.|pg||
nt|kareno: So this board is a loss for Nickell who probably are still in the lead.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Usually 4@H asks for hand-type (trumps solid, or one-loser trumps and a particular ace)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, but what about the spade queen, which was also needed?|pg||
