nt|Walddk2: We will add a couple of commentators in about 15 minutes|pg||

nt|lrargerich: Stablish clubs :-)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|lrargerich: With clubs 3-3 6 spades is an easy contract|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I doubt that he takes that line luis. not percentage|pg||
nt|poohbear: needs 3-3 clubs and 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I'm very sure it's the percentage play|pg||
mb|3S|nt|poohbear: yea from up here:)|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Playing a club finesse of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|lrargerich: You need clubs 3-3 or 4-2 with the club K onside|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: One pass is missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: how bout pitching a heart on the @d and cross ruffing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Egan passed, Bates bid 4@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's unusual to cue-bid shortage opposite partner's main suit. I guess he felt free after the previous 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rbeye2: Vugraph, you are out of sequence, UNDO|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lrargerich: I think that's slightly inferior to playing the club finesse and stablish clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Glad he has to play it and not me...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting, at the other table Ames just bid to 7@S!|pg||
nt|poohbear: then the 3rd possible line is to cross to dummy in trumps and take a heart finesse and if that loses to try to guess where the Jack of hearts is|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lrargerich: 7@s is easier than 6 |pg||
nt|poohbear: but most likely to take a ruffing finesse against the jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ... and listen to this. Against 7@S East led a heart!|pg||
nt|poohbear: NOW thats a strange lead|pg||
nt|lrargerich: The lead wasn't important with clubs 3-3 declarer makes 5@s, 4@c, 3@d and 1@h=13|pg||
nt|poohbear: this lead prevents the cross ruff line|pg||
nt|brolucius: The heart lead deserves to lose IMPS (!)  |pg||
nt|lrargerich: Against 7 underleading a KJxx is quite strange. I think I never saw such a lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: if the cross ruff line will work then the club establishment line will probably work|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: The heart lead was into a bid suit. Amazing.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|poohbear: coming down to a heart guess|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|lrargerich: But the line that declarer took in 7@s was also suspicious|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: He can ruff a heart and fall back on the club finesse|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lrargerich: This is also a very bad line in 6@s|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lrargerich: If you are going to take a finesse take the club finesse not the heart finesse|pg||
nt|poohbear: why cause it went down?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lrargerich: Taking the heart finesse after the trump lead is a nonsense|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lrargerich: because you are out of the crossruff line|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lrargerich: in this line he needs the club finesse so why not take the club finesse FIRST?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: It still gives you three chances. It wasn't so bad.|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeh: test:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A predictable 3NT, but I have been wrong before|pg||
nt|mikeh: thanks roland:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|csimon: who would overcall 2@s with the south hand? white vs. red?|pg||
mb|p|nt|aconterno: 3nt is my bet too|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong 1: marty bergen, carol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All juniors I presume, Carol|pg||
nt|mikeh: If I read the bulletin correctly, Ames was the no, 23 seed so they are having a great event|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Maybe even 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|csimon: nah - the juniors would bid 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: I probably would, but partner best not try the @SK against a notrump contract then.  Probably shouldn't as partner doesn't figure to have any high cards.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|swanson: It is tough for Reygadas to bid anything other than 3NT, but this will not be happy for declarer.|pg||
nt|inquiry: 3NT by West might make on a diamond lead, but 3NT East has no play on @Hh lead |pg||
nt|panja: if South had A of Hearts, this adventure might have worked|pg||
pc|h4|nt|csimon: led it anyway - should have overcalled to bar the lead :-)|pg||
nt|swanson: On my, what did North think that partner might hold?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|swanson: Many players would have tried 1NT with the West hand in 3rd seat.  I am not certain of their notrump range, however.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|aconterno: will make a lot|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson: Will probably take 12 tricks.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|inquiry: and 6@s down at the other|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|inquiry: board 20 hand an odd result, 7@s making at one table, and 6@s down at the other|pg||
nt|swanson: Surely it was 6@C and not 6@S.|pg||
nt|panja: the problem with 1Nt with two suits open is that, if E had Kx of Hearts, it would have wrongsided 3Nt|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: David, how many books/articles on bridge did you write? Did you forget the number?|pg||
nt|qing: a slam opportunity here with the @H finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What does a nervous hotel room look like? :-)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong 1: i wondered as well:)|pg||
nt|truffle: :).....joann's partner kathleen sulgrove is also here|pg||
nt|ritong 1: hello kathleen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeh: a lucky slam here: ames seems to be in heat one, so maybe they will bid and make it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|inquiry: 4@h or 4@S on. A club lead might hond this to 10 trick  in @Hs....|pg||
mb|3C|an|cue bid|nt|swanson: Our new players are Ann Labe and Shannon Cappelletti, Vancouver and Hixson (TN).|pg||
nt|csimon: 5@s is quite a position to take...|pg||
nt|truffle: an unfortunate lead by cohen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Labe may make 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|panja: 6@S is fine, just about 50%|pg||
nt|swanson: I would expect most pairs to bid to 6@S - North does have wasted minor suit values.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|csimon: I am not suggesting that there is a better bid (I don't think there is)|pg||
mb|3N|an|slam interest|nt|inquiry: we know 3NT is serious 3NT slam try from earlier hands|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C seems to be asking in trumps, Gamma, can someone clarify?|pg||
nt|mikeh: north has very soft values but better than expected trump|pg||
nt|inquiry: it was alerted as a cue-bid|pg||
nt|panja: in case it is trump asking North's 3@S would show two honours...........|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Declarer will do quite well if she draws exactly one trump|pg||
nt|mikeh: maybe 5@S would show this?|pg||
nt|swanson: There are so many variations in the Precision style auctions these days, it's tough to know.|pg||
nt|panja: I would expect South to ask about trumps, Cue bid serves little purpose here|pg||
nt|adolfod: hi all|pg||
nt|mikeh: they may not have the ability to do that after the start they had here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|swanson: Yes, South's first concern regarding slam is trump quality.|pg||
nt|panja: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: I wonder if ames thinks club Queen is a fitting control for his partners clubs?|pg||
nt|inquiry: If ames thinks koch has two black suits and slam interest, he isn't stopping now....|pg||
nt|panja: I get a feeling North is answering something.................|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|panja: good stop..|pg||
nt|mikeh: they never seem to have got around to the main issue. From Koch's point of view, he lacked 5 level safety since he knows they are off the @H Ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|swanson: That lead will get the play over quickly.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|adolfod: if the @h 10 lacks should be a poor slam|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|panja: to answer some specs|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|panja: slam is on @HQ being onside, at best 50%|pg||
nt|panja: further, a stiff heart lead will kill it even when @HQ is inside|pg||
nt|panja: so take away a few% for that|pg||
nt|inquiry: This hand is a chance for the rosenkrantz team to cut into the 35 imp lead... |pg||
nt|swanson: My teammates always thought I was too conservative when partner and I stayed out of a 50% (or so) slam that made.|pg||
nt|panja: and take away a bit more for JTxx of Spades|pg||
nt|mikeh: e-w will breathe a little easier: the way the set has been going, they will feel fortunate that their opps missed this one|pg||
nt|panja: BTW, JTxx of Spades would be about 10% likely|pg||
nt|panja: so I rate the slam to be about 40%|pg||

mb|2H|an|0-7|nt|poohbear: oh sorry:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|qing: my view is that if 3@D sets up a game force, perhaps there is no point to show a limited raise by jumping to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|an|spades|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|poohbear: misunderstanding here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lrargerich: Maybe 2@h artificial negative?|pg||
nt|qing: pd tends to have concentrated values in the 2 suits, and probably some shape, so some points work better than others|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems to be confusion over the 2h bid|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I think 2@h is artificial negative|pg||
nt|poohbear: that would tend to make the 3h bid a transfer|pg||
nt|qing: knowing the point range does not offer much help|pg||
nt|brolucius: He bid spades (via a transfer), then hearts to offer a choice|pg||
nt|lrargerich: And completing the explanation they should play canape style transfers|pg||
mb|4N|nt|poohbear: ah so he decided to ignore the 5-6 shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|lrargerich: Maybe 4@h is 5-5 or maybe is longer hearts than spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the meantime 5 hearts is MUCH better than 5 spades cause no need to guess the Jack of spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, good point. They will do well to stop in hearts, though.|pg||
nt|poohbear: unless the defense leads a minor and then plays the other minor after winning the trump play|pg||
nt|qing: but 5@H has the virtual of going down on @S ruff while 5@S can be made|pg||
nt|brolucius: True, too, but they are unlikely to lead a spade.|pg||
nt|lrargerich: This auction looks like a strong club ad :-) "...or this may happen to you"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: ahhhhh the unexpected:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lrargerich: Is this the famous "unusual" 4NT ?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Or 4NT=RKCB and pass=stop this madness|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|qing: or the "infamous unusual 4NT"|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps West thinks that East would have given a positive response initially with sufficient controls for a slam. |pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer can play one round of hearts then switch to spades and make since the Jack of clubs falls|pg||
nt|qing: he needs to guess @S now to make this|pg||
nt|poohbear: he should play clubs first|pg||
nt|poohbear: to see how many tricks he needs|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Am I wrong or he only needs the @sA onside?|pg||
nt|qing: well he always needs 2 @S tricks|pg||
nt|qing: you are right :-)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzer points out that spade lead would not beat 5@H because declarer can take enough spade discards after North ducks 1st spade|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|qing: actually no.... :-)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Sorry I am told that Egan s first name is Mary . So perhaps my assumption of HE is mistaken:)|pg||

nt|swanson: We have an over undo.|pg||
nt|swanson: From the bidding, as mentioned, South evidently found out about the spade honors but couldn't be certain of the heart situation - even the third round of diamonds was a concern.|pg||
nt|panja: true|pg||
nt|adolfod: and the hearts J109 works too|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Reminds me of the new Zia convention|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He did that at a congress in Scotland 2 years ago. That's Zia for you :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|truffle: 3nt...with the battle for for the overtricks|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mikeh: in the other room they did not even sniff at the slam: 1@s 1N 3@d 4S|pg||
nt|adolfod: without the 9 two losers are the common result|pg||
mb|2N|nt|truffle: uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well done, 3NT is enough|pg||
nt|csimon: wrong person on lead - this won't work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
nt|aconterno: 3nt is 4-4-4-1 with singleton @h   :))))|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let Bjerkan open 3NT please|pg||
nt|csimon: lol :)|pg||
nt|truffle: now labe is declaring|pg||
nt|adolfod: seems a quiet major game in this|pg||
nt|inquiry: 4@h is mubh better than 3NT, but both make|pg||
nt|panja: with Precision bidding, non-slams too are kept in slam focus for some time|pg||
nt|swanson: It shows the advantage of a forcing club - lots of investigation below the slam level.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: oops|pg||
nt|panja: Rosenkranz's choice of opening is interesting|pg||
mb|d|nt|truffle: we missed a pass|pg||
nt|panja: oh, strong Club there too?|pg||
nt|swanson: It was clearly a forcing club because of the response.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|csimon: I think we missed a pass in between|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Adventurous overcall :-)|pg||
nt|aconterno: yes|pg||
nt|panja: is this a US event or China?|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 3@D was a transfer.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|adolfod: if not the choice of the 1@d response is almost amazing, lol|pg||
mb|3N|nt|aconterno: undo pls|pg||
nt|swanson: Bjerkan is declaring 3NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will eventually, because our operator will be unable to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: is anyone commentging on this match?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|swanson: Note that the major suit hand cannot be certain of an entry to run either major (in notrump_|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikeh: 4@S looks odd|pg||
nt|adolfod: he knows that partner has not 3 hearts, but is he sure that he has 3 spades?|pg||
nt|mikeh: exactly|pg||
nt|panja: once again, prec tell Rosenkranz that Partner is not likely to have 3 of the four missing important cards for his negative 1@D response|pg||

nt|ritong 1: we also have ben dickens from USA|pg||
nt|ritong 1: and john swanson|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: Hi.. this is Board a match event. Like a Swiss, each team will compete against the same opponents on the same boards, however, the players follow a movement resembling the Mitchell ...|pg||
nt|inquiry: movement used in pair games.  |pg||
nt|inquiry: tI gues I would bid 3@H here as soutuh...|pg||
nt|mikeh: ns bought it for 3@D on that last hand, in other room|pg||
nt|adolfod: precision and 15 17 NT, is it correct?|pg||
nt|swanson: A 1NT overcall appears normal (and necessary, in general) for West.|pg||
mb|p|nt|csimon: I believe the team names are reversed - Bjerkan & Cohen are on the Westheimer team|pg||
mb|p|nt|gerben42: at the other table South after the same start chose 3NT right away|pg||
nt|panja: good pass, again, by Koch even though 2@S is supposed to show 4 spades|pg||
nt|panja: his values are scattered, shape uninspiring|pg||
nt|mikeh: tough to stay off the @D lead here|pg||
nt|panja: W is endplayed at trick 1!!!!|pg||
nt|swanson: Something is wrong about the bidding or explaination - North would not show 4 trumps with such a pitiful hand.|pg||
nt|mikeh: agreed: 2@S showing 4 invites partner to bid, and he definitely does not want that|pg||
nt|panja: @CA would be a good lead|pg||
nt|adolfod: nobody votes for a reopening bid with Reygadas hand?|pg||
nt|panja: or, when in doubt, trump!!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: excellent lead and thinking|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|swanson: hi all.  Are the current standings available?|pg||
nt|inquiry: Thus, an East/West pair will play three boards against one opponent, then move on to take on another opponent.  Their teammates, sitting North/South, will play the same boards ...|pg||
nt|inquiry: against the  opponents East/West teammates.|pg||

nt|gerben42: I like this auction better|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ritong 1: i cannot sware, john|pg||
nt|ritong 1: we have to ask our operator, i guess|pg||
nt|inquiry: odd hand, play on diamonds and make, play on hearts and go down|pg||
nt|panja: Spade would have been fine here, but if North had Qxx of Spades, it would have been bad|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gerben42: well there is the diamond|pg||

nt|gerben42: now @DQ drops and all the contract rolls in|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mikeh: South's turn to be endplayed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|inquiry: 5@C, 1@S, 2@D, 1@H.. without risking heart hook... |pg||
nt|gerben42: a heart shift by Chambers would have endangered the contract again though|pg||
nt|inquiry: chambers does well to return a heart and put declare to the test|pg||
nt|gerben42: the @S position is still blocked|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|gerben42: well done|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a very good lead by George.  He knows he would be lucky to find partner with a high honor in diamonds.|pg||
nt|mikeh: and he also makes a good choice|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|gerben42: now 2 more @S and a @h|pg||
nt|panja: and thanks to the good lead, W can get out easily every time hereafter|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|gerben42: puts declarer for the decision|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: now last problem cash everything, get out with a trump|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|adolfod: I think that if east reopens the bidding NS should go to 3 doubled spades -500 with the same defense|pg||
nt|swanson: It seems a bad idea for declarer to relinquish spade control so early with three possible heart losers.|pg||
nt|swanson: Not overcalling 1NT has worked well for Rosenkranz on this board.|pg||
nt|mikeh: George swung low on this one, by passing 1@S, and then looks to be following it up by excellent judgment to earn his team 5 much needed imps: not bad for a old guy:))|pg||
nt|adolfod: and could work better|pg||
nt|swanson: But there is no way he would reenter the auction over the single raise.|pg||
nt|panja: In the other room, a Diamond was led|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|hJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|gerben42: 12 IMPs for Ames|pg||
nt|panja: this is a sadistic discard... I dont like it|pg||
nt|swanson: The Ames team defeated Onstott in the previous round.  John Onstott was on the winning Senior Team at the just concluded International tournament in Istanbul.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panja: is it because all of East's Diamond spots are high?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||

nt|inquiry: Most people consider Board-a-Match Teams to be the toughest type of event in tournament bridge.  |pg||

mb|1D|nt|inquiry: now we are back to the real 11... it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|aconterno: all overtricks count in this format|pg||

mb|3N|nt|aconterno: u get 1 point for winning a board|pg||
nt|gerben42: correct as well as even if the @H hook works you still need another trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Cohen is wondering (a) where are the clubs (b) what is all this bidding.|pg||
nt|inquiry: Right. This makes Board-A-Match is very demanding because EVERY board is equally important.  There is no hand you can relax on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: Vulnerable they would bid game for sure, not vulenrable, they have to push a little to match the resullt in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|gerben42: forcing NT by north who will now invite|pg||
nt|inquiry: The club bid improved north's hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|csimon: Bjerkan shows us just how little is needed to try to sabotage the opponents auction!|pg||
nt|aconterno: a lot of points in this deck|pg||
nt|inquiry: some one else will have to example the bidding here to me... |pg||
nt|gerben42: sure that is a strong @C|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|swanson: Linda Lewis in the North is likely to bid again even after the double.  She does |pg||
nt|swanson: not have a defensive hand.|pg||
nt|aconterno: but what 5@c or 5@h?|pg||
nt|csimon: I think Lewis has a very difficult decision here at the equal vulnerability|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|gerben42: maybe it's the other way around|pg||
nt|inquiry: nicely done... to carry on to game. Not vul, there was a chance koch would pass, but he didn't think long|pg||
nt|swanson: Tony Ames and John Koch are from Minneapolis.  Rod Beery and Mary Egan at the other table are from Lincoln, Nebraska.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|csimon: this contract has very few losers on top, but lots of handling problems|pg||
nt|gerben42: but still a bit light for strong @C|pg||
nt|inquiry: As we said last time this hand was up (hehehe), if EW push hearts it will make five. On this lead, Rosenkrantz team will pick up one imp|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mikeh: The @D K was an effort to beat it two tricks... but was it worth the risk?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gerben42: must be other way around Koch does not have a pass|pg||
nt|inquiry: this doesn't seem right to me... nor does diamond king look normal.. I think we are upsdie down wth a low diamond lead.....|pg||
nt|gerben42: audience says this bidding is board 12|pg||
nt|gerben42: operator are they playing 12?|pg||
nt|gerben42: on 12 Chambers will  have a natural @DK lead|pg||
nt|inquiry: Five spades, 4 clubs and a diamond is 10 tricks. If EW start hearts it is possible to set up long heart for an 11th.. here he will win 10, but lose 8 imps|pg||
nt|gerben42: they are in fact playing 11 but the cards from 12 are in board 11!|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|swanson: A trump lead would have been better, but I only see 9 tricks for declarer.|pg||

nt|mikeh: I don't see how not to bid 6@C:)) And as  the result shows, at this vulnerability, you have an extra way to win|pg||

nt|brolucius: I have a great record in high-level judgement, when commentating. Less good at the table, unfortunately.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, it would be poor tactics to raise hearts on x-x-x|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|swanson: Edith Freilich is a long time top player, as is her partner June Deutsch.|pg||
mb|d|nt|gerben42: another strong @C auction|pg||
nt|swanson: I have no objection to 5@S.  He expects 5@C to come home.|pg||
nt|adolfod: another shot for Ames, they led club in the 3 nt hand and eventually the contract was set|pg||
mb|p|nt|csimon: Edith is a fantastic lady and still plays a sharp game in her 80's|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gerben42: 1NT shows a GF balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The Jxx of trumps is enough for Freilich to bid game.|pg||
nt|gerben42: 1NT shows 8-13 HCP |pg||
mb|4S|nt|swanson: Deutsch missed a good chance there to show the few values she holds.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some would open 2@C I suppose. After all it's a 3 loser hand|pg||
nt|gerben42: now you can walk your dog|pg||
nt|inquiry: 11 trcfrom north, 11 tricks fairly on this layout. 3@C+4@D+3@S+1H, heart lead can't hurt here....|pg||
mb|p|nt|gerben42: the confusion before might have been the cause of a duplication error|pg||
nt|gerben42: this would normally lead to a cancelled board as although the same cards were held at both tables, dealer and vuln. were different so it was a different board|pg||
nt|mikeh: I like both 5 level bids|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|aconterno: she already pass, so 2@s bid was not bad|pg||
nt|swanson: 2@S seems an underbid here and 4@S an overbid.|pg||
nt|adolfod: so do I|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|swanson: Edith knows that a good partner will have the @SJ.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: In that case she wouldn't have opened 1@S John :-)|pg||
nt|swanson: Had to squeeze out the preference.|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't see any better play than to bang out the trumps and hope that one of the black suits split.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|swanson: Or the singleton trump king.|pg||

nt|aconterno: and she will be happy that succed|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|panja: S should have take out trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|swanson: Most partnerships respond to a one-level negative double as if partner had bid the suit. Thus Reygadas made a single raise.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting 4@H here (if they get that high). It depends on a restricted choice guess|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a close 4@H game which comes hope with a trump split and the percentage third round finesse in spades.|pg||
nt|swanson: (home)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jjsb2: i believe the contract here migth be the same as other table |pg||
nt|swanson: Once the diamond finesse was on, he could afford three trump losers - just don't play a second round.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb2: that means 4@h |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: One of us must explain the principle of restricted choice I suppose. John is the man for that job :-)|pg||
nt|csimon: but a very skinny game that won't be easy to bid|pg||
nt|swanson: An agressive 1NT overcall would get NS to game.  I like it better than that flimsy suit overcall.|pg||
nt|jjsb2: anyone for opening the east's hand ?  |pg||
nt|gerben42: okay news about the duplication error|pg||
nt|mikeh: I think that if s clears trump and declarer plays @D to Q, a @D by North might beat it, otherwise I think a double squeeze may arise, but I have not thought it all the way|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|csimon: this is likely to end the auction|pg||
nt|gerben42: board 12 will be cancelled as I predicted and a substitute board will be played at both tables|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 3@c is fitted and should be max of the passed hand |pg||
nt|jjsb2: not that it's nto necesserely showing a @c shortness IMO |pg||
nt|swanson: In any event, that will be another 12 IMP in the Ames bucket.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|csimon: yes, a 1nt overcall is probably well-suited to BAM, but would you do it at imps, John?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jjsb2: i'm nto sure koch will have courage to pass that... |pg||
nt|jjsb2: well |pg||
nt|jjsb2: :) |pg||
nt|gerben42: for me neither, simply maximum pass and fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gerben42: that's a big view|pg||
nt|inquiry: 3@H is probably principleof fast arrival over the double, showing a weak hand.. passing 3@Cx to iinvite...|pg||
nt|gerben42: but don't argue with success|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@S allows Koch to show interest in slam.  He thought he did - but he shouldn't have.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jjsb2: i have been told 9 cards and singleton should finish to game , here exemple to show it's not automatic |pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: In this case, the restricted choice means that it is more likely that West holds the doubleton Jx or 10x of spades that the J10x.|pg||
nt|jjsb2: good point ben |pg||
nt|inquiry: no... devaluate teh club king, norht is very minimumum... so minimum 3@H has to be right|pg||
nt|jjsb2: in any case u're loosing 2@d a @c and a @s on that lead as far as i can see |pg||
nt|mikeh: depends on the lead|pg||
nt|adolfod: a club lead is needed against 6 spades|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenkranz will have to find a club to defeat it.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|panja: if they reach 6@S, W will have to find @C lead, how likely is that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: five more imps for Ames... it seems|pg||
nt|panja: I think he will lead shorter minor, Diamond|pg||
nt|adolfod: me too|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb2: schermer is trying to picture the lead after it migth come of different holding ...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|csimon: Cohen sure did a lot of bidding on this hand!|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't think I would overcall 1NT in any form of scoring - just that it would have worked.|pg||
nt|adolfod: and this contract will go dawn|pg||
nt|panja: oh, now 1 down, low aim is crime!|pg||
nt|mikeh: this does not look right|pg||
nt|adolfod: the four hearts bidding created this scenary|pg||
pc|c6|nt|swanson: This is the first misstep by Ames-Kock that we have seen.  We don't know what 5@D showed.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||

nt|gerben42: Ames is slowly pulling away from pre-match favorites Rosenkranz|pg||
nt|rbeye2: The Ames team is a huge underdog in this match, as they were yesterday|pg||
nt|jjsb2: players on a little break i have been told |pg||
nt|rbeye2: Mary Egan and Rod Beery, at the other table, are from Omaho Nebraska|pg||
nt|rbeye2: They play all over the Midwest US|pg||
nt|jjsb2: hello richard ! |pg||
nt|rbeye2: Mary has played in a Reisinger final a decade ago, Rod has not had much national exposure.|pg||
nt|rbeye2: Both are good solid players with a nice partnership|pg||
nt|rbeye2: Tony Ames and John Koch are from the Minneapolis area.|pg||
nt|rbeye2: Tony is a part-time Tournament Director|pg||
nt|rbeye2: Both keep their play pretty localized to the upper Midwest of the US|pg||
nt|rbeye2: Another example of 'no good deed goes unpunished'|pg||
nt|jjsb2: i have been told player are now playing the new board 12 and final result will be entered when they finish |pg||
nt|jjsb2: let me take that time to thanks our operator here ! it's a very hard task to do i can tell ... thanks a lot Susan ! great Job |pg||

mb|2D|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|lrargerich: 5@h was a terrible accident in the closed room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cost-nothing 2@H on the way to 3@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lrargerich: 2@h lead-directing, aka fit-non-jump|pg||
nt|poohbear: except it let clubs incheaply|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: He is unlikely to hold SIX hearts since he did not open with a weak two|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: of course on this hand.....:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lrargerich: It also allows a cheap 2@s bid so the merit of 2@h is in doubt |pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: The whole point of 2@H is to direct North's lead against West's black-suit contract.|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Egan might have doubled with 4@s here, spades are more important than clubs|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Or ignoring the 2@h bid directly bid 2@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Not saying I wouldnt do it David . Just saying there is a cost to it|pg||

nt|poohbear: It actually worked well By keeping them out of spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: You can't really expect to shut out a black-suit fit anyway, so perhaps a good idea to get the right lead. (Mind you, having said that... E-W did miss their fit)|pg||

nt|jjsb2: looks hard to avoid a game NS would probably be 3nt |pg||
nt|mikeh: many partnerships would treat this a a two suit keycard situation|pg||
nt|swanson: Seems to me that Koch should have retreated to 5@S anyway.  He was certain of an 8 card fit.|pg||
nt|mikeh: when two suits bid and raised, count both Kings as aces|pg||

nt|mikeh: an aggressive 1@H call when rosenkranz bid @H:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|aconterno: thi will make|pg||
nt|gerben42: 1@S shows some values|pg||
nt|inquiry: i think 1@S here is second negative, maybe 1|pg||
nt|inquiry: mabye 1NT shows @Ss|pg||
nt|gerben42: 1NT sorry shows values|pg||
nt|gerben42: might show @S too|pg||
mb|p|nt|csimon: and it will make the same   of tricks as @hs|pg||
nt|aconterno: but 3@h is 140|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gerben42: hmm okay :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|inquiry: 2@S now instead of showing support?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|aconterno: in @h will make one more|pg||
nt|gerben42: I would show support|pg||
nt|inquiry: this will let them stop in 3@Hs.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jjsb2: i dont think 2nt is by schermer |pg||
nt|jjsb2: that will be corrected |pg||
nt|gerben42: yes 2NT by Ames|pg||
nt|inquiry: I think 2NT isn'tright at this vul.. must be north's bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|inquiry: now 3@H|pg||
nt|inquiry: hmm... maybe 1@H only promises four....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gerben42: could Ames have 4@H and 5@C for his bidding?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mikeh: is this analogous to 1y - dble - 1@H  2@H as natural?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|truffle: it could have been a lot worse for nt if the diamond ace was wrong|pg||
nt|gerben42: that might explain the problem|pg||
pc|sK|nt|csimon: right - 5 losers|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|gerben42: some 50s will go to the Rosenkranz team|pg||
nt|gerben42: looks like at 3 down for the moment|pg||
nt|inquiry: well.. i think 2@S over 2@C was right, but eventually with support you just have to show it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|truffle: good hand for wolff signoff|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|gerben42: Ben I think Ames has only shown 4@H 5@C|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|swanson: The redouble has resulted in the 1@H bid sort of preempting E-W out of their spade fit.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|inquiry: k|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they would get to game using Wolff's sign off once opener shows 3-card support|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gerben42: the surprising duck of @DK cost the 3rd undertrick|pg||
