nt|Walddk2: As Luis would have said: Sensible bidding by both players|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lrargerich: In my methods 3@d doesn't show a major because I like to transfer to minors with 6+|pg||
nt|tsanders: sensible up to now?|pg||
nt|pef: I thought he might be considering 3h--3s seems designed to cause a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S looks like: I can't stop clubs|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@s may not show 4 cards|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pef: unless they always bid spades first in response to Stayman which would be unusual|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: let me try--this is certainly an interesting auction|pg||
mb|5C|an|1 or 4|nt|reisig: is that natural 4NT or Blackwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|tsanders: looks like they may be playing puppet|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|lrargerich: 1 or 4? Wasn't 4NT RKCB in spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only heaven knows where they are heading now|pg||
nt|reisig: 1 or 4 what?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Jacks?|pg||
nt|pef: however, 5s can be made here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10's  He has 1|pg||
nt|reisig: :)))|pg||
nt|tsanders: he can make 5@ss if he plays on @hs instead of @ds|pg||
nt|lrargerich: 5@s should be down by comitee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is a slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww 5NT to play? :-)|pg||
nt|reisig: If 5@s makes ...the luck continues|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lrargerich: Holy cow!|pg||
nt|pef: trying for a grand?|pg||
nt|reisig: the plot sickens|pg||
nt|tsanders: luck running out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I regret my remark about sensible bidding. I apologise profusely|pg||
nt|tsanders: It was good until the 3@s bid|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I will use the word "crazy" here to be respectful |pg||
nt|reisig: I would take a break after this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No one will stop you Richie :-)|pg||
nt|reisig: I mean THEM|pg||

nt|Walddk2: ahhhh|pg||
nt|pef: thank heavens for screens!|pg||
nt|tsanders: whether or not you smoked, richie?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|lrargerich: Besides jokes anybody has a sensible explanation for this auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Your guess is as good as ours Luis|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lrargerich: I think 3@s was a mistake, 4NT RKCB in spades|pg||
nt|lrargerich: 5@c= 1 or 4 not sure about spades being agreed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pef: beery must have decided that a 4-3 spade fit would play well, egan obviously decided his partner was 4-4 and took a shot, I bet 5s was to play|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Now 5@s signoff and East noticed he had an extra keycard|pg||
nt|pef: right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|pef: and also an extra q of trumps|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

nt|pef: I like that, forensic bridge|pg||
nt|reisig: Mike didn't lead 4th best @d?|pg||
nt|reisig: :))|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if diamonds come in for 5 tricks Beery needs a heart trick, unless Shuman switches to a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As it is everything is hopeless|pg||
nt|pef: At the other table, in a really boring auction, e/w somehow got to 3nt making 4|pg||
nt|lrargerich: The other table wasn't "beery" exciting :-)|pg||
nt|tsanders: :))|pg||
nt|pef: on a REALLY good day, beery gets a club lead away from the q and diamonds are 33 with the q onside|pg||
nt|pef: then you know you were meant to win the event|pg||

pc|sK|nt|pef: time to claim|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's a difficult area. Is 2NT forcing for instance? Does opener promise another bid opposite certain responses?|pg||
