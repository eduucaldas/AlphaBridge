mb|1H|nt|athene: but if you do that of course you need the heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: ok, that is one point in favour of going for the penalty - your game might not make, i admit|pg||
nt|athene: but even so i still disagree with south's decision there|pg||

nt|athene: more penalty passes :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Thx ...hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|athene: if east doubles 2@C, that shows takeout of clubs and a trap pass of spades|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd assume X of 2@c = @ss|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he felt he didn't have enough all-round strength - if partner passes your double of 2@C that can work out poorly|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you have to wonder how long he will go without showing any values|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|athene: i don't like passing throughout on 6-loser hands when partner opens the bidding|pg||

pc|hK|nt|athene: you could bid 2@D over 2@C, perhaps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|nt|athene: partner might be able to work out you have some spades, from south's total failure to raise spades at any point|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: ah sorry spades are trumps :) was going mad there|pg||
nt|athene: ok 3nt must be non-serious then|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: basically in these GF auctions where you have established trumps, you need some way to show whether you have serious slam interest (i.e. a really good hand)|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise both partners just make "courtesy" cue-bids in case their partner is strong|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: and no-one has a clue whether you have a combined 25 count or 32 count|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but he may stop at five - after all, that missing king of spades could be the ace of something|pg||
