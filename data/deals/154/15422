nt|vugraphzrm: And now the comparisons|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   a very ambitious contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pbmarstr: No problem with the @C return, worse with a @D from south|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little bow and arrow by n/s in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, worse than a finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: there is also a potential trump problem|pg||

nt|vugraphzrk: Hello, welcome to a rainy London|pg||
nt|lestergold: Evening Roland, Panja,Raija, John and specs|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panja: we begin with a 5@D..3Nt does not look like being a make|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Asptro|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Should be an exciting match North South as apair were part of the silver medal winning England team in 2008 Bejjing|pg||
nt|panja: is 3@D weak?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Dhondy team in 1st place on 40VP|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Hillman and Bennet young players part of the junior England squad about a decade ago|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: Malio0mnwski 'signs off' in 5@d but Sanfqvist thinks with his 3 aces and Q@d he has enuf to bid one more|pg||
nt|panja: this could even go two down if @DJ guess goes wrong, unlikely, but possible..|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a rather poor contract  less than 50% because it needs spade finesse and @ds to play foronly one loser|pg||
nt|panja: was 3@D forcing? or was it weak?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sapde is of course wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have to say that I've seen a lot of indsciplined bids latgely from Sandqvist and I feel this is one of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner has said please put dummy down i want to pl.ay 5@d|pg||
nt|panja: it is not that simple..|pg||
nt|panja: let us say North held @SKxx..|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D would have gone down on this lead..|pg||
nt|lestergold: if malinowski thought that slam was possible opposite a limited opener of a strong no trump he would have bid 4@d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panja: we should ask whether South had a proper basis for bidding 5@D, taking out from 3Nt...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for the tournament website with standings after round 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sandqvist's hand may be rich in controls however he should duess that one of his bullets is likely to be wasted ie opposite a void and that Qs are opf limited vallue in his hand|pg||
nt|panja: if North started with !Kxx @HAxx @DAQx !Kxxx, say....3Nt would be the best spot..|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 3@D described as forcing|pg||
nt|panja: that is @SKxx @HAxx @DAQx @CKxxx...|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panja: I would think both the takeout to 5@D and the raise to slam are not all that well advised|pg||
nt|lestergold: always possible to find specific hands but with 7 card suit and void, you can hardly criticise Malinowski's bid here|pg||
nt|lestergold: most of the time 5@d will be a safer spot than 3N|pg||
nt|panja: we will have to find out the probabilities...but N would have one or two wasted club honours, and 1 or 2 useful Diamond honours for his 3N bid..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: Malinowski originally bid 3@d because he needed @d support to consider playing slamk when Sandqvist denied it he signed off that in my view ios the logic of the auction|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|panja: but first question first, was 3@D forcing?|pg||
