pc|h6|nt|flash: opener will pass without extra values or distribution|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But it is normal to bid a sceond suit with 5-4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's virtually 100%|pg||
pc|hK|nt|flash: similar to Roland's explanation of a scambling 2NT earlier, 4NT cannot be natural (nor Blackwood); it shows 2 places to play (usually minors) and lets partner choose|pg||
