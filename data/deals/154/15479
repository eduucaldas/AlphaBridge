mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|d|an|spades|nt|Walddk4: And good evening to Sergey Kustarov|pg||
nt|dinos1: good evening|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: the west hand is borderline but i would think X is the majority choice|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Information.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room it was easier for Hamman to upgrade his hand, with the singleton in the overcalled suit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|Walddk4: And welcome to Magnús|pg||
nt|athene: only eight tricks in 3NT, probably|pg||
nt|iceking: Hi guys |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@C is easy to play on a high cross-ruff, basically|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told brazil made 6@C on @HA lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 3NT trap|pg||
nt|iceking: Maybe north had 2 good hand for just 3clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hamman did very well to pull 3NT in the other room|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: indeed |pg||
nt|dinos1: easier for him after 1@d o/call|pg||
nt|iceking: so push Declerar cant really go wrong here |pg||
nt|athene: declarer might run the clubs but west doesn't really come under any pressure|pg||
nt|iceking: oh they are in 3nt sry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You mean can't go wrong for down 1, Magnús? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: screen down -- Weinstock asking Rodwell questions|pg||
nt|iceking: one down it is hard to see M-R misdefend this one|pg||
nt|athene: north can count eight tricks - six clubs, @SA, and a diamond - he just hopes for one more quick trick, like a seventh club or the @HA rather than the king|pg||
nt|dinos1: E will know shape after 1st lead|pg||
nt|iceking: But should north really put this hand down in 3nt after pds 2club rebid|pg||
nt|iceking: if pd has 3d there you have 2 extra tricks plus some extra chances make spades good so 5club should be the spot |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|athene: i agree there are not many hands south can hold on the bidding where 3nt makes and 5@C doesn't, but there are some i suppose|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|iceking: J QJxx KQt KQJxx something like that needed|pg||
nt|athene: the @SQ there is very revealing - it pretty much tells meckstroth that declarer is desperate|pg||
nt|iceking: but i agree i wouldnt be in 3nt here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if he just wanted to preserve a good spade holding he would duck - if he just wanted to avoid east getting in he would rise the ace|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dinos1: what now?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, even the best can go wrong|pg||
nt|iceking: spade J probably|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now declarer can make|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h shift wd beat at once|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to get his partner in to play more red cards but the spades are sort of blocked|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: declarer can duck the @SJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|dinos1: see - W showed 3@s and 1@c - so has 1-4-5-3 shape|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, and then there is an endplay on Rod later|pg||
nt|iceking: well done now he needs to read the end position|pg||
nt|dinos1: so S has 2@h only|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might build a red-suit strip-squeeze against west|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The double pretty much told him how to execute that|pg||
nt|athene: @S9, play ace throwing @H8, run clubs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: meckwell lead second through declarer so the diamond was an honest card|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's all revealed anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|athene: hearts almost certainly 4-4|pg||
nt|iceking: this should be easy now discard heart and endplay Rodwell|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @h endplay after @c's|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should get this right|pg||
nt|athene: west would bid 1@H rather than double, with 3-5 majors|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer should count it out|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|iceking: like i said earlier push:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You did|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|athene: hard for Meckstroth to find the heart shift at trick 2, after the double of 3@D, perhaps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h2|nt|iceking: did Meckstroth forget S had bid 3d so should have figured out declerar was weak in hearts |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dinos1: but Meckstroth cd know S has only 2 @h's|pg||
nt|iceking: easier here ofcourse looking at all hands|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|iceking: his pd did dbl 3d though |pg||
pc|h7|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but he doesn't have 6 of them|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: i think meckstroth might have worked this out perhaps by thinking about that @SQ at trick 1|pg||
nt|dinos1: Rodwell started with t/o X|pg||
nt|iceking: then another thinking about Rodwells shape as he only had 3spades his shape most likelly is 3-4-5-1|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer just wanted to build a heart trick (e.g. @DA empty and @HKQ) he would rise @SA and play a heart surely|pg||
nt|athene: it certainly doesn't look trivial|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s7|nt|iceking: He is just saveing his energy for the knockouts |pg||
nt|athene: hoping the @HK and @HQ are swapped|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Anyone for an upgrade to 2NT?|pg||
nt|iceking: great pdship M-R have one bad will not rattle them|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|iceking: for sure |pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth would open very light in third for the lead so this delayed overcall will tend to be a poor suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: and now 4h this looks ugly bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: 4@H is a bit mad, isn't it?|pg||
nt|athene: why not support double and then bid 3n, or something|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also a bid mad|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: well, it can make with an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: but that involves finessing the trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well yes, but that does not make 4@H a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|iceking: Most novice would never overcall 1sp with M hand with only 9xxxx, but it is importand to get spade into the picture if this was going to be part score battle|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But South has spades stopped 3 times. What more does he want?|pg||
nt|dinos1: trump finesse for +1?|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|c5|nt|athene: now east can just give away a trick to the @CK to get two back|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @c shift while def controlls @d's|pg||
nt|athene: ouch - that's two games let through in two boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It makes me sad to see someone go down in 4@H with these cards|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Yes, Hamman did, but he did not bid it here|pg||
nt|dinos1: the one who bid 5@c:)|pg||
nt|iceking: for most here dbl on 3d shows good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though south thinks it's a support double|pg||
nt|iceking: with 12-14hcp you just pass i thought that was very standard |pg||
nt|athene: they are usually played only below 2 of the major though|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: i like 3d at these colours|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@c is the answer to "what's X" :)|pg||
nt|iceking: well i dont blame north here its south who lost his mind|pg||
nt|athene: i agree it's hard to see how you will miss a game passing 3@D with south|pg||
nt|iceking: Rodwell thinking what is going on here!|pg||

nt|athene: strong club|pg||
nt|iceking: 1club strong pass probably 0-4hcp or hearts|pg||
nt|athene: pass is 0-4 or trap of hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@s now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes 10.30 local time|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: north cant defend 1nt here|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 16.30 CET, 3:30 pm UK|pg||
nt|athene: taking away 1nt, 2@C, 2@D might make a lot of difference|pg||
nt|dinos1: six spades is ok to me for 1@s|pg||
nt|iceking: good point |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: R cant really bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: just 2 flat|pg||
nt|athene: close to double, if it's takeout|pg||
nt|dinos1: as uc 2@s is much better contract than 2@h|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are about 20-20|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: not sure you want to go to the 3-level though on a 20 count with no great fit|pg||

nt|dinos1: if he wd then make|pg||
nt|athene: he knows that declarer will be very unlikely to risk putting in the ten|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to risk putting in the ten, losing to the jack and having rodwell play another trump|pg||
pc|d8|nt|iceking: and like Sergey said 2sp would have been better |pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: but by not playing the @D10, declarer is probably giving up on trying to make - although he might be hoping for @DJx in rodwell's hand or something|pg||
