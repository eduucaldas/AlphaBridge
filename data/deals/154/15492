mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: hi|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S is a west coast US team; E-W Danish.  They are in group 'C'; nine teams playing a round-robin to qualify for the KO rounds.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: same bidding sequence at both tables|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Well, the E-W team has players from 5 nations actually. Denmark, Norway, New Zealand, USA and the Netherlands|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: may be 3 @D is a better bid over 3 @C|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Huston was allowed to rebid 2@S instead of 2@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: welcome ralf|pg||

nt|ahollan1: others use the 2-step to differentiate weak vs sound 6-4 hands|pg||
nt|iceking: just one of those impossible deals to go plus on|pg||

nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: hi|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|an|pass or correct|nt|dburn: awkward for North-South now, this|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: It is not advicable to pass the S hand|pg||
nt|swanson: Passing over 2@D does not look like an effective defense against Multi.|pg||
nt|dburn: but South ought not to have to pass with that hand after a Multi|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Is Multi still a naughty word in the US, John?|pg||
nt|swanson: The contract is secure. Declarer is likely to discard a club on the low heart return and then a second one on the @HQ later.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|iceking: 3nt it is dull board 10 top tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: if van Cleef had shown unbalanced hand then contract probably would have been 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: five different nations, if you count Scotland|pg||

nt|Walddk2: New Zealand even|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|swanson: 12 tricks available here if declarer goes all out.  The likely result is 11 tricks in hearts.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: 4333 and  xxx  in diamonds not good enough for 4th suit followed by 4@H|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Std American-ish|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|swanson: If 2@H over the 2@D rebid is forcing it seems best to me - allows for investigation of 3NT or even a possible slam.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is not game-forcing|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@H acts like a preempt against youself.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|swanson: IF 2@H is not focing the 4@H is certainly sound.|pg||

mc|13|nt|Walddk2: was it 1992?|pg||
nt|swanson: Cashing the @DAK was a careful play - in case North held a doubleton diamond honor he could later lead towards the 10 in his hand.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|iceking: but 19hcp stiff two tens just 2 good as i see it|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: the point is -- there is no clear answer   and i think it is mostly a geographic location that tends to favor  heavy overcalls vs DBL|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: nope|pg||

nt|iceking: yes 3nt most likelly serious here very popular convention these days|pg||
nt|reisig: hmmm  ..no smiles and frowns?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not trump Q in 7N -- sounds like Corrollary to one of Burns' Laws   ---  a crossruff won't work in NT|pg||
nt|iceking: so after S knows pd has 3 aces and not trump Q its matter what he will pick 6nt my guess|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Shenkin in deep thought, just keeps looking at his cards and rubbing his forehead|pg||
nt|reisig: Might take 15 minutes|pg||
nt|iceking: how much do these 2 play might be misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C seems automagic, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|iceking: yes it does so he might not be sure what 3nt means|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh excellent point -- maybe Shenkin thinking 3N is offer to play|pg||
nt|iceking: been told they are playing for the 1 time |pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt rebid here for most is just natural but shows some extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if offer to play -- maybe 4N |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Shenkin still in tank|pg||
nt|iceking: then you have 2sp as some kind of default bid |pg||

nt|ahollan1: trying to show shortness in partner's suit is extremely dangerous even in practiced partnerships|pg||

nt|ahollan1: east & west have held some retched hands this set|pg||
nt|iceking: how about north dbl here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4@S should make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: too good for PASS, no offense -- DBL seems right|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Huston admits that he is the world-s worst pd|pg||
nt|iceking: for me dbl shows working points|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: Anyone for Dbl on S instead of 3@s?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other room Auken is declaring 3@C   ONLY 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Shenkin goes into the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the natives are again getting restless|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|lml: but double would work better here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me a little bit too strong for only 3@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s also without @hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: disagree|pg||
nt|lml: in the other room they bid only 2@H with the east hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: but Dbl on 2@h so why not on 3@s?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|nt|lml: the problem with double over 3@H is it suggests less than 4 spades at least to me|pg||
nt|lml: over 2@H you probably will have a chance to show spades later|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and what do you do if partner bids 4@D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|lml: thats one of the problems of doubling over 3@H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Being 26 up after you missed 3 slams is quite good, 2 at this table, 1 at the other|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 1@H is enough for me at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The suit is not good enough for 2 and you can easily go for 800 against nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rimer is deep in thought|pg||
nt|swanson: I agree.  3@C is not perfect on the East card, but what else is there?|pg||
nt|swanson: Doesn't seem like there is a lot to think about with the South cards, more like a lot of mental coin-flipping.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|vugraphzta: actually auken & rimer didnt know whose turn it was|pg||

nt|iceking: will Shenkin open |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|iceking: not sure what N should do here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ralfwil: as I polay s D after 1@h opening either at least 3 card in unbidden suits OR a stronger hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: cant really blame east here |pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphztb: Young says \\\\\\\\\i will show you what a dummy is supposed to look like|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lml: well your methods would have worked well on Board 30 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if score holds, is 23-7 in victory points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somehow i think deserves more|pg||
nt|lml: this contract has no chance now so more imps for Bramley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S quite a pressure/imaginative bid|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|iceking: N did well he really had to bid 5@D as i see it|pg||
nt|iceking: playing natural system i wouldnt have thought about this bid |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|lml: that may move them to Blitz territory|pg||
nt|lml: interesting that EW here never bid clubs at all|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: is the cash out obvious?|pg||
nt|lml: I think bidding 2@C over 1@S is a bit pushy but West was probably playing the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as W I can bid 3@c showing a longer suit and a semi support in @s or a solid @c suit.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|iceking: but it sure worked well|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|nt|lml: 2@s on a doubleton honor was a raise with not such good trump|pg||

pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: a new low for 2nt in high card points|pg||

nt|iceking: probably 2 hard|pg||

pc|h6|nt|vugraphztb: Rusinow Q@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Van Cleeff asks if he was sure that he called for the diamond|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: and he holds his head|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rimer didn't find @D shift either|pg||
