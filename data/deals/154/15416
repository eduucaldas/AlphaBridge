nt|haans: Points to Fantoni|pg||

nt|riccho:  the@h are VERY open|pg||

nt|kastan88: hi all again|pg||
nt|sybarra: is is for recording the play |pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: clubs lead to break|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia is never afraid|pg||
nt|mamos: either one down or the whole lot?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double is the correct approach, 2@c would describe less|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over t/o x 1@s still fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but personally i expected 2@d by Boye|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for North was easy pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still wld pull to at least slam|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, mistake in bidding, now on trick 5|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning all   we have had a small problem here on Board 1 but hope to bring you the result shortly|pg||

nt|h_karluk: heya Bob and Liliek, welkum aboard|pg||

nt|jeanhari: probalbly normal contract here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makes also 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: well not doubled     but Europe might win this one|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@s isnt everyones choice I would guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has brought a box of tissues to the table, blows his nose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because she knows 17 at hand, 12-13 at opener, and say 6-7 at east, so South 0-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Resume in 12 mins. Sorry lost play on 7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N off balanced, only points out values|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: US players sitting other way round - will change display shortly|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|mamos: Point a board|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: are we correct here, operator?|pg||
nt|haans: Operator Playing against which piars (compare with?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: pls ignore profile|pg||
nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Liliek:)   welcome|pg||
nt|blewah: hi pak Liliek|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to make 5@d a complete guess because of two way @c finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then 5 minor/s good save|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: dummy may be a disappointment to declarer|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: good|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: the normal 4@H (down a million)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: where NS make game with their 18HCP :)|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S seems ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 5 losers off two, in case @cK pinned off one, without double still good while 4@h fine|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Among the soundtracks she has done are Forrest Gump, Good Will Hunting and the last five Woody Allen movies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW carding is UDCA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@h required|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes it was the board slam missed at both tables|pg||
nt|haans: happy dummy :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|haans: better lead than a diamond|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven tricks seems likely though|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant:)|pg||
nt|westjava: tourney website : http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||

nt|stc: should play small|pg||
nt|udo: can v.Arnim duck this ?|pg||
nt|stc: sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so all big and real professionals, anyways our operator Russell going very well, congratulations|pg||
nt|udo: was2 @H alerted,,( both majors) ?|pg||
nt|stc: with KJ N have take the finesse the 1st time|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: W thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|haans: rare to bid 5m if 3nt possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin studies this trick in depth|pg||
nt|ady: e/w would have comfortably won the board in the very safe game of 5@D    part score only in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: nine now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|rado: declarer will try to restrict losses since even 1 trick may score a win|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: UDCA for NS|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: will he be able to keep it to down 2 only? or the inevetable down 3....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that means entry problems in case 2@c allowed to play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|blewah: the americans plays 2/1, while the germans strong club, 4 card major with canape possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the individual each team has to use a single system, even when playing in practised partnerships. |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we have "std. american" and "std. european" |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: although both are a 2/1GF system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would lead to play at hand and concede all picture cards to opps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: may end with just +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: connection down in other room will have to restart this one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: surprisingly @hQ falls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so 7 more winners at W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok |pg||
nt|h_karluk: US lost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably K now|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Europe 1; US :0|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jan_jansma: down 4 now|pg||

nt|sybarra: seems "we" play on |pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: @DT finesse and +1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far off four?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jeanhari: indeed.. and on a combined 17 HCP-count noboady would come any nera 5@D, 8 crd fit|pg||
nt|ady: hi   was in open room   but needed here    4@H  in OR    might make as cards lay|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rado: still endplay position after cashing all @C and @H|pg||
nt|mamos: or back to eleven|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nothing in the play|pg||
nt|bobholl: have to discard properly to let it make exactly but they will i guess|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos: this will be a quick one down|pg||

nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING RESULTS **** BUFFETT CUP ****  USA 48   EUR  36  ***** (First to 100 wins) *****|pg||

nt|westjava: the battle of the year 2010!|pg||
nt|jeanhari: though Auken is trying|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H now lets it make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: forcing defence (@s lead and early ruff) another deterrent factor|pg||
nt|kastan88: must be good for Europe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice hook, 1N bid helped|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: steve may hook now|pg||
nt|riccho:  the signalling is high=pos (at least thats what the play tells me)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: and now which minor by W|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|udo: not important...|pg||

nt|ady: e/w can make 4@H as they lay   but can they get there?|pg||
nt|ady: nice start for Europe    they need it|pg||
nt|haans: you must do as Fantoini did Get the feel|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  92 EUR 76 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and found!!! |pg||
nt|h_karluk: +420 cool, just exit with a @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and forced to ruff sluff|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: 10-14 with @C|pg||
nt|kastan88: CCs for both team you may find here: http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The players are playing this board the wrong way around|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|h_karluk: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the twins are comparing with Levin and weinstein  who are playing Helgemo and Helness who have scored +130 in  3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe won 16-8 this morning|pg||
nt|bobholl: they are always playing fast if you don't like it :)|pg||
nt|ady: hert game for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: prev board in fact 2N mostly played as Leb|pg||
nt|ady: heart|pg||
nt|haans: non will miss that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant lebensohl|pg||
nt|mamos: i wonder if the players like these little six board sets ?   seems very staccato |pg||
nt|edmunte1: lucky contract for Bulgaria in the OR|pg||
nt|haans: yes we may expect 10 imp to Bulgaria here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: very light 3rd pos 1@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: scoll down on the home page,  beautiful picture, looks like old castle |pg||
nt|westjava: classic!|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@h seems playable for EW |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it's a lovely playing room, big oil paintings,  exposed brickwork, and a stag's head on the wall|pg||
nt|edmunte1: hard to reach  for Croatia here|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2@d from Kalin is Multi|pg||
nt|haans: West  did some oberbidding in Ov|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stc: many guesses in @s contract|pg||
nt|rado: now E might bid some constructive fit raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cool Liliek, jill is a great personality, always humble and she doesn't even play a lot of bridge  world championships, trials. most of her close woman friends aren't even bridge ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Geoff disagreed abt Klinger's 100 winning tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: ah, this one was a "player's hand in the way of the card" issue :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there Ron described overcall principles|pg||
nt|haans: yes so CC say|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-0 Hampson here|pg||
nt|rado: 6@H makable now|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no clue about the rest of their bidding. Lets see if they finish in 4/5/6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|westjava: or 3 nt|pg||
nt|blewah: 3nt will face @s threat|pg||
nt|blewah: though @cq is dropped|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h x if all pass wld b an interesting scenario|pg||
nt|haans: Convention Cards: http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H 2@C(drury 2@H i predict|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad @D for 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|ady: may be a heart guess for 10 or 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: J of @H is a very fine card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good raise by Auken, but maybe 2@H would have won it too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant say somebody decides to start directly 41h|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be a negative double we would all make |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
nt|blewah: for 9 tricks if @s led|pg||
nt|sybarra: but Sabine Auken is quite agressive |pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins play very aggressive 4 card majors  with 1NT 14-16 so open 1M on hands like this routinely|pg||
nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||
nt|stc: looks like a win for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey Ant, gl there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back, you'll watch Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde for Europe and Jill Levin & Jill Meyers for USA, www.buffettcup.com|pg||
nt|jeanhari: close call here, as would be the play in 4@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i have no sympathy to 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: K@D lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: >|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The convention cards have been slightly modified I believe, but I don't know where sadly|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probst had a hard choice between 3@s and 3NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: bidding 3@s could have missed 3nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: even 10 points counts as a win so Justin trying for the NT bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3rd and 5th leads|pg||
nt|westjava: you know every thing,Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a nice slam @s there|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi jackson|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit 4@h|pg||
nt|ady: not certain to make 10 tricks in hearts    depends how club suit is handled|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "did you pass Gerber?" :)|pg||
nt|haans: small spade?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c more descritive than 2@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *descriptive|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think 1@H-3@C is inv with clubs though|pg||
nt|sybarra: and she as safe spot in @D's |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days your pard bids spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: the indy format is interestign |pg||
nt|sybarra: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compares. |pg||
nt|sybarra: That player will always be in the same seat at the corresponding table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: will put board 7 in later|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have opted for no-trumps in this scoring method   might have come unsuck on a club lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely would have|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa - "I might have passed a splinter"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe dbl over 4@s wld lead to 4@s disaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i read 3N-3 on myscreen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: OR Jeff and Eric lucky, they are regular partners|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 4+fit and some defense:)|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d maybe forced|pg||
nt|westjava: East will support, of course|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT for north south no problem|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: I did not think a @C would be led after the splinter|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: they make all the tricks on the normal @DK lead|pg||
nt|haans: would have tried @DK lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: no heart guess now |pg||
nt|blewah: this is a sequence of invitational @h supp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ant, i hope our boss did not read your words abt a convention:)|pg||
nt|ady: dont think europe will get anything from this hand |pg||
nt|mamos: NS only have on loser |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|westjava: I think East shd take an extra action|pg||
nt|westjava: might be 3@H better|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks better |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
nt|westjava: so do I|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't be staying bidding NT but 3NT is best manche|pg||
nt|sybarra2: difficult for you Ant, |pg||
nt|edmunte1: 3nt is not a maker here, so more IMP's for Bulgaria|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oliverc: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|stc: the good choice to play on @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: good he didn't lead the T of @C|pg||
nt|mamos: the cards mostly lie well for EW   probably made game if they had bid it |pg||
nt|mamos: one|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 12 tricks isn't easy|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everything on the right spot here, the fate of contract depends trumps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: might be keeping low because of the scoring I guess|pg||
nt|westjava: West down grade her stiff @DK|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh just as bad :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff sluff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: double dummy AK winning line|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard layout|pg||
nt|h_karluk: limitted enries to table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *entries|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: Justin against Weinstein|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a difficult game to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Sabine Auken sometimes visits USA, a nice lady from my unit 160, district 7 <Miss Joyce Hampton> hires her for top events and they win&scratch in teams|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C denies @S control?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: then 5@D now? (@S control)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it shows a mixed @h raise and very nice help to opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I swear my P key is having an off day :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwi_joker: Am told 2@C is a mixed raise, 3 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S2 out of the hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: Sabine not comfortable with 3 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice one easily would employ a losing hook|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: DOUBLE and get the point|pg||
nt|haans: or support spades later|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even 1N is available by N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: NS was vul|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have started very well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so hard to say a tie or anyone would win the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: giorgio helped|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|oliverc: No problems from here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: x not a must|pg||
nt|sybarra: just wants to give you a problem Ant |pg||
pc|c9|nt|mamos: Fantoni Nunes in 3@C at the paired table   so Bob Hamman need to make to win the board|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer will attempt eleimination here|pg||
nt|jacksond: sememta/duboin have stopped in 4s in other room so this wiil be a swing |pg||
nt|jeanhari: tempting to balance with 2NT with north hand over 2@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rado: DBL may give room for NS to find better place|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this puzzles me 100%. OK I am lost....|pg||
nt|rado: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably wld ruff at tb, @c pitch at hand wld better|pg||
nt|bobholl: this won't be good for europe most players will open E hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an endplay to North available|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jan_jansma: OK, 6@D was a try for 6NT|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 or 7 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: restricted choice in @C and no rpoblem|pg||
nt|bobholl: still searching for 12th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: Brogeland is in 6@S in OR  |pg||
nt|mamos: sorry it was  NUnes  Boye was South|pg||
nt|mamos: and made|pg||
nt|kastan88: in all matches, Europeans bid 6@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: good for europe (and tension in the matches)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Rodwell scratches his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: fans and refans his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has leaned back on his chair, one arm draped over it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nunes did a nice hold-up with @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: I still only count 8|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi!|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry all esp shirley  business phonecall |pg||
nt|sybarra: enplayed at trick 2 |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Richard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Levin, wants to lead a @D but is likely pickling pards @D trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: Ant, is Bobby in a trance?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: well I guess not:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortness might be your partner's winner, why not to lead it before declarer dumps somewhere|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @c lead was best|pg||
nt|ady: would have had to duck if K@D led|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jan_jansma: with no clue|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: he will just bang down @HAK|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (slowly)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, much thought at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: may try the spade up now?|pg||
nt|westjava: or now a @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Closed room are in 3@H, so all a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play @H to the ace and a club up also |pg||
nt|westjava: she still count Levin's hand|pg||
nt|blewah: @h has to guess but @s will likely give in to N from the bid|pg||
nt|blewah: and if n continues, will create trump problem|pg||
nt|westjava: make decision, a @H drop or finesse |pg||
nt|blewah: yes, that would be my prediction too for W|pg||
nt|westjava: dont touch your @S, Arya:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is likely certain where the K of @H is,  question is layout |pg||
nt|h_karluk: forgot to cash @dK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: BAM is Super MP Best pairs (team) close to always win :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes after @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considering @D8|pg||
nt|blewah: so Eur in this tm has won the match regardless what will happen to the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  93 EUR 81 ****   Europe ahead in all 3 matches Now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: blocked his way|pg||

nt|sybarra2: or @S I mean|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|udo: 10 tricks now,,,,,good score|pg||
nt|haans: S will not pass this time but why start with 2nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt was certainly higher risk  but was successful in OR|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: close to sqz tempo|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: 11 or 12 tricks   no difference here|pg||
nt|ady: 660 wins the board|pg||

nt|h_karluk: so far Europe near to win it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: hi all|pg||

pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: yet we dont know|pg||
nt|jacksond: a swing but to who is yet to be determined|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say Jill levin solved her @hJ problem then the picture changes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far this deal is a potential candidate to the bulletin|pg||

nt|bobholl: but do both players know each otheres habbits ?|pg||
nt|mamos: we can expect some excitement here|pg||
nt|bobholl: other rrom 5@H X|pg||
nt|bobholl: and made|pg||
nt|h_karluk: adventurous 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and mirror position in @d suit bad|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 4@c is a pass/corect bid|pg||
nt|edmunte1: showing fit for both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||
nt|mcphee: because it only gets 1 trick at most and may pass timing to the offense|pg||
nt|haans: best 2@S raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fave= in USA we mean 'favorites' in internet explorer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make a bunch of nt here |pg||
nt|mamos: good slam here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: N is suppose to be "in charge"  |pg||
nt|haans: deutch at its best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score  hand    looks like 10 tricks in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can also put your partner to an early hook|pg||
nt|westjava: cant find a @S lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead, helps to decl to pitch @d loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however transportation problem|pg||
nt|jacksond: in fact of course he has no diamond loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we see that, dK stiff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not be easy to get the 11 needed to half the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: stiil hard to make 11 tricks as i other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who would not try @cQ hook then @sK wehen hold pitch a @d at hand|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S has a little better chanses than 4@H|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: experts NEVER pass an opening bid from partner (at Teams) nonvul vs vul) !!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: NEVER|pg||
nt|westjava: yup, handle with carefully|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@d would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still a chance for 6@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: 6 nt could roll |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5 @d decided by N, S ready to correct 6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: (not to get to game themselves, but to prevent the oppo from reaching one)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3@C shows either 5+@Ss&4@H or @S and @C GF|pg||
nt|ady: showing their stoppers    but not enough for 3NT to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about leads; "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|haans: need 4@Sx to get points in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H4 out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *when|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: (in this case, both of course :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: and there are plent of tricks  is slam out of the question?|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||
nt|haans: double: in case you want to pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to guess @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @S lead may make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some bidding by Sabine, not even sure of some kind of fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: till to here USA 79, Europe 65|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oliverc: will just claim 11, I guess|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play two times clubs towards hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||
nt|haans: sqz possibilities|pg||
nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||
nt|ady: sensible auction  though if Meyers could have doubled 3@S for penalties that would win the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @CJ|pg||
nt|mamos: so Europw will win this board|pg||
nt|bobholl: on @C lead 5@H probably fails|pg||
nt|mamos: 12 tricks if either major finesse works|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sabine checks which responses to Keycard they are playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 0314  to me|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: @s lead and? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the answer is Brogeland:)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s not bad|pg||
nt|ady: West stepped in at wrong time|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry was fixed on S playing :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to play without regular partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is individual |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @dK|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oliverc: but only 10 available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clubs|pg||
nt|ady: J@D lead can get 300|pg||
nt|jeanhari: BAM-dbl :)|pg||
nt|ady: well done  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d may be unanimous in the field|pg||
nt|ady: only have to negotiate club position if east ducks twice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and two rounds hearts before west discards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sp A+ruff also needed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who knows a slip in defence - actually almost impossible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if the @c 9 would be at the table things would be easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while @sA not knocked out would just concede a @c|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: lot of upgrading from meckstroth but in BAM all is well that ends well|pg||
nt|bobholl: lose 1 trick in each colour i fear|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oliverc: Can't afford the @D to hand, though as it exposes the K@D once North takes the A@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sing @H now looks normal|pg||
nt|mamos: only a small club as it happens|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so all "suffering" under same rules |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: The norwegians have bid 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: I mean there is no net gain|pg||
nt|udo: u are rite,,,so the lead was the winner for USA|pg||
nt|udo: @D lead other room|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 135 is popular :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  good choice|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  96 EUR 78 ****   |pg||
nt|sybarra: went for the nt for the extra 10 points |pg||

nt|riccho:  are the players allowed to look into their own systemcard here?|pg||
nt|mamos: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: counting 11 just cash @dA and be happy not landed grand slam|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: ahalim: W will be strip-squeezed ME agree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would be very clever to gove declarer the extra entry to finesse in clubs twice|pg||
nt|jeanhari: still must play hearts from the table too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth leans forward, elbows on the table, cards face down in a pile|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting individual format, still usa-europe camp. normally individual is an event all players make partnership.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no easy return|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff musing abt @s count and 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sK defence not much hard|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the longer it takes , the more I expect Sabine to make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H she can make if guessing rigth|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in general 3rd 5th leads widely accepted, the picture would appear |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S4@C3 towards the front of the hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h switch - table's weakness, follow the old book|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth apologies, and continues his thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: before long suit stopper knocked out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needs 3 more tricks to set|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dK, 2 hearts |pg||
nt|mamos: this is too ambitious as the cards lie  -- |pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they are |pg||
nt|riccho:  13 tricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: each team (USA and Euro) are playing a "standard" card |pg||
nt|h_karluk: another @s hook after @hQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: clubs, but @h A favborablhy placed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : favorably|pg||
nt|udo: not to forget the 2@C bid of course|pg||
nt|mcphee: the next @H applies pressure on S hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H even|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: not clubs lead in 6nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 5NT looks like pick a slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 @h break then makeable one|pg||
nt|bobholl: !K not sure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer would obviously hook trumps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 10 tricks on accurate defense, which we can expect|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stc: another chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i shut my eyes not to see @h hook|pg||
nt|udo: next door NS bid 1@H and 3 @H so @C and @D never mentionned|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|oliverc: The hand pretty much an open book now, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h? oh acolish|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,the brothers|pg||
nt|udo: acol|pg||
nt|oliverc: I think it has to be the @H hook now at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|oliverc: Can't afford NOT to make 11 tricks from here|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Giorgio Duboin (born September 30, 1959 in Turin, Italy) is an Italian bridge player. Duboin has won four World teams championships along with six consecutive European teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: championships and a seventh European in 2010. For many years his regular partner was Norberto Bocchi; now he plays primarily with Antonio Sementa.|pg||
nt|jbgood: no records of the play in the OR - Broge will not be happy to lose that board|pg||
nt|Walddk7:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d then maybe 2@h|pg||
nt|mamos: seems a normal result|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr yves |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops sorry,  wd Bobby :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries they r both fm th family|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is unique fomat |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: he got an easy win prev hand, so they are even|pg||
nt|bobholl: show up is the rigth expression |pg||
nt|h_karluk: nah, i expect the field wld be in 5@d with same tricks, to me a tie|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and south may reopen, who knows|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jan_jansma: 10-14 again|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops 9-13|pg||
nt|rado: here 2NT 5+@s INv+ maybe|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: unfair.... You have their system in front of you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes this will happen often|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes checks the convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no doubt checking if 3@H or some such bid shows 5-5 Majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia laying in the bushes|pg||
nt|mamos: and it seems ok to consult your own card :)    a couple of times I think teams have been helping the oppo witheir system :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: Should Zia just pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: strectched mini roman|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 4 carder|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks if 1NT is forcing|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H could be 4 cards when 4@s4@H(32)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: north surely looking for slam here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: now they may and are unlucky|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     1NT likely|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult choice for N 3Nt or 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: here EW win 5@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a friendly group |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Quite refreshing to see players being allowed to check their own cards imo|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.00 BST, in about 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho:  aggressive lead here by rodwell cost s costly trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes asks for the card - he hasn't brough one with him|pg||
nt|bobholl: is this in the system notes i doubt it :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hopefully that shows 55 majors  :)  on both sides of the table  East and West :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it seems EW don't have any European system cards with them|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes that is in notes 55 majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: than i would bid 4@H as W|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers suggests that they just tell each other :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: meanwhile the director brings them a copy of the system|pg||
nt|mamos: Its a sensible gadget |pg||
nt|riccho:  it is on the card 4@d =5+5+MAJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it is not clear if the 4@D bid is actually on the system!|pg||
nt|bobholl: but did nunes know it ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Note 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Ah, think Eric's found it now|pg||
nt|riccho:  He looked on the cc, didnt he?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i still believe a questionable decision|pg||
nt|h_karluk: let's wait Fulvio's result|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: the overtrick was critical  for a Eorope gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: edit : stretched|pg||
nt|jbgood: voidshowing 4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: need to put some brakes on soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this one is THE VERY WILD contest. Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: von arnim and hamman picked double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe was dominant half of the round|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bobby decides to stay on defence in case they also reached 6@d things may change|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: @S's? What @S's?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but maybe some east west (a minority) might decide to compete with ie 5@h <prev board>|pg||
nt|ady: interesting     win and play back 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia lent Rodwell his 3@H card two boards ago, and now has to ask for it back :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Opening Bids get weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld ask Fulvio's idea in Facebook:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knew very good :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Claudio is pleased he remembered correctly :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: he cannot misclick as we, So Nunes knew|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He guessed that he remembered the bid correctly|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: 6@d pick a major suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Fulvio did not use any convention vs 15-17 1N blindly at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|haans: Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|edmunte1: identical bid as in OR|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: in BAM you scores nothing for second best contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: normally 11-15 any 4441|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: and 3@S = 2@S and 6@H, Rado?|pg||
nt|rado: unfortunatelly don't remember LOL|pg||
nt|rado: with trumps 3-3 4@S will be ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: We seem to have a mild technical hitch, but hopefully the broadcast will continue|pg||
nt|westjava: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wld be happy to play this board 31c by N|pg||
nt|haans: 1 trick short|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c by North|pg||
nt|yvesj49: cheap defence in @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not found.....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwi_joker: was told the twins' NT is 14-16 ... but that doesnt look right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 15-17|pg||

nt|jeanhari: well bid by Jason|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken claimed 10 tricks, but Meckstroth was very honest and declared that the @DK falls, so 11|pg||
nt|ady: duck   or take and switch to a sspade    easier defence    duck|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably North enquires and South shows max with Heart feature|pg||
nt|mamos: so Rodwell goes for the magic NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both M aces favorably placed|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bobholl: J of @H and Q of @S my guess|pg||
nt|kastan88: all USA pairs went for 3NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS playing udca and 2/4 leads in standard bulgarian way |pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzrj: when we pass 1NTx we have a balnced and|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fulvio liked his @s Qtx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff preferred double with same hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which indicates there were also strong NT opening values|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now we are about to see which strategy would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bear in mind this is super matchpoints|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: For Europe 4 Norwegians there : Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Brogeland- "you pulled out of slam again!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes's played cards are difficult to see from this vantage point, so please don't read too much into the pips etc :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't 5@D that already ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Hampson : "I just didn't want to get doubled :)"|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   mixing hands up|pg||
nt|kastan88: from europeans only Nunes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you want to win the board just trust your luck, place @c9 to righty |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and play a spade towards table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anyways after the opening lead quick tricks are : 1@s, 4@c and 2 @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer should produce extra 2 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzrj: leads- 3/5th, small card encouraging|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ant, you know, groans and grimaces barred but scowling free|pg||
nt|mamos: ty all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say one is @h K|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: the italian slam on 3 gives a 2-1 lead to Europe|pg||
nt|oliverc: despite the 4-0 trump break, this looks like it should make|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 3-3 among 6 is 36|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gazilli - A complex method of rebidding after a major opening and forcing 1 no trump response, involving an artificial forcing rebid of 2 clubs by opener to handle awkward rebid ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hands. Similar in effect to the Bart Convention but handles more hand types.|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 2@S bid some sort of relay|pg||

nt|mcphee: however he is still considering making some move|pg||
nt|westjava: so,when they will confirm a @H?|pg||

nt|haans: you are not happy opening 1@H and p bid 3nt :(|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt after investigation of course|pg||
nt|ady: exceptif North wins   plays a 2nd club  and then gets diamonds right    difficult|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: H H play normal count|pg||
nt|mamos: you do have a good suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: good defence by zia |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Time for Jason to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Puts down his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Now plays with the @SK, and puts his hand down again|pg||

nt|mamos: Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|ady: declarer tht diamonds must be 3-3 on the play so went to set up long diamond for a club discard    reasonable|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: why did they reach 4@S?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what you need in any level indy is just luck, say you land 3N in prev board, still can make if that's yr good day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another 9 out of ten 1N votes and all pass <i hope>|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa thought he had lost that trick, but Bobby kindly tells him the Ace won it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me @D more likely |pg||
nt|h_karluk: but who knows could touch another card|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: Europe leading 3-0 here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably a dia after @c|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: no clubs loser|pg||

nt|Walddk7: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that ended with a tie|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: probably 2@s caused to a misunderstanding, that's why Antonio might think goodish with short club|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if duboin thot 4@C was shortness i am surprised he did not move over 4@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Roland|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio could easily land to 4@h after 2@h -- just fast arrival principle|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer claims|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or may want to put him table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but no reason for that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a dia would work better|pg||
nt|edmunte1: going down now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: In Bam you sometimes score nothing for the best contract  all that matters is the score :)|pg||
nt|rado: because of vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: does vuln matter in this form of scoring much?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ant do you keep teams CC that i posted yday, way too long fave list here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the winners are already known : US|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: a push|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still tied|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Now Duboin thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe only made nine tricks so a board to USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Your vugraph operator has been given a cup of coffee, so no excuses for missed cards now|pg||
nt|kastan88: Fantoni (South) played this hand 4@S 2 down after @H lead, tried double finesse in dias|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Bob,was rather strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: its on the website hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just underlead it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and let Nunes enjoy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when declarer's doubleton Q falls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far same way|pg||
pc|s3|nt|westjava: thats why I agree with you, a dime stopped|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 4@C was the hand W expected 4@D would be a last train sort of cue bid|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: FN are probably the best pair in the world, so strange to see them in a 5-2 fit here|pg||
nt|rado: true:) but habbits|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (sorry if I offended all the other world-class pairs here)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwi_joker: again, here, they are playing in a ridiculous contract when they have a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes sir, worths to analyse, musing position|pg||
nt|oliverc: now can just exit with the Q@S|pg||

nt|westjava: I am told 18-19 balance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to have a worldgrandmaster title you must be world champ and lotsa placing points|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D for strong 18-19 balanced hands, balanced, no 5 card suit I believe is how this pair use it|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 5 card suits alter a hand a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps we can "re enact" the boards at the end |pg||

nt|sybarra: how to make +1 in nt,  I do not see a way |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@D making so Italians certainly needed to bid 5@S|pg||

nt|jbgood: Duboin decided to enter the bidding in the OR - cost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they have many special gadgets but unfortunately yet not much hands occurred to show that skills|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d was another option for west players|pg||

nt|ady: 6@C  on trump finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good bidding by norway here |pg||
nt|mamos: ta just looked at CC  -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: In fact in the match yesterday both US and Europe had to check they were playing Drury, and they both were|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quite dangerous......|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s super accept|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: slightly odd position for West  p opens the bidding  oppo bid a slam and you need to save|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2 clubs losers|pg||
nt|haans: @D finesse |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia off for a comfort break|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He appears to be suffering from a cold|pg||
nt|mamos: certainly quite tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: wont finesse the @H :)|pg||
nt|mamos: likely to go down methinks|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth be even 2 down|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wd Bob|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6@h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: most use WJS so 2@S could not be a minimum hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: as you have a lot of stress rebidding over a 2NT rebid from partners|pg||
nt|westjava: and 2nt is forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Italians try a new partnership : Augustin Madala  Antonio Sementa, i guess in five years that will give good results|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2/1 passed hands are nonforcing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can fail on the same position|pg||
nt|ady: possible to go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: so there!!  wd Bobby |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d over x would give much chances, ie responder would raise to 4@c --  i know it tells 6/4 @h+@s|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h not easy to find|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a wrong input by operator, was not a psyche|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries, happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: thanks for spotting it though :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: spade guess for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4N rkcb 0314 - last asked suit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,2nt opening is ghost for me!|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they may make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|blewah: nootice the low @s played by meyers, making sure her p have entry to her hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might suggest cashing a bunch of tricks |pg||
nt|blewah: *notice|pg||
nt|sybarra: typing same Arya,  very important |pg||
nt|bobholl: after @D K spades are guessable may be :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: yes lots of specs agree may be down two|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure Fred is saying "thx pard"   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still retains control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 controls + @h Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: i hope 1@c alerted|pg||
nt|udo: perfect fitting hands,,,,,@S 3-3|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would think everyone here was alerted :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hA+9 would be interesting|pg||
nt|jeanhari: @D K will make guess easier|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @H ruffs in S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c was drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, as soon as West looked for his notes everyone knew he was checking for Drury, so NS allowed them to agree it regardless of the convention card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: dbl very questionable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's ok Ant, so far so good|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double indicates clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead directing|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I get the impression the dbl was made partly for lead-direction and partly for comic value after the discussion :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hehe|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now migth beat it anyway|pg||
nt|ady: lucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont have sympathy to 2@s there, to me clear cut 2N|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|oliverc: everything|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true mf|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board I will re enter some of the play on the 3NT, then move to 12|pg||
nt|haans: thinking or no connect?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably Tony taking his time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: with 11 points|pg||
nt|mcphee: those 2N jump rebids also eat up room creating little issues|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: well played|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  93 EUR 75 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
nt|riccho:  He will finesse in @h I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably going to watch a few pitches on spades first |pg||
nt|mamos: partly it depends on if he thinks 3NT or 4@S is the likely contract at the other table|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: Jumping to 2M = to weak to bid natural :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I can imagine that at some tables EW will be bidding minors|pg||
nt|haans: 1@d-1@S-2@d- do you have cards for 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they did it with a delay and different way, w passed, then after xx |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for non-americans Bob or Bobby are acronyms of Robert|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say allowed by both then @c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but @h 8 still firm even covered|pg||
nt|jbgood: Sælensminde is back to playing Broge's "old" system - more or less the same Broge played with Odin Svendsen i Pau this summer|pg||
nt|ady: Fantoni needs to duck diamond|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff's 1@d opening quite interesting, probably he has different ideas when both nonvul|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: luckily didnt of course :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bobby Levin, has always been known as "bobby" |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: found a good line to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 10 of @H's dropped |pg||
pc|d7|nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems speedy gonzales at the field, gl Russell|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: nice short auction :)|pg||
nt|udo: 5th push board in a row|pg||
nt|udo: now way to go wrong, and no way for 11|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@c pre-sacrifice, might want them to put into a doubt they miss 4@s or not|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly lucky result NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fine result in my book|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we focus on the field, all around sharks :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to be honest, 1@h seems a good idea to me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 3rd seat, passed partner, both nonvul|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two hearts and a spade for defenders|pg||
nt|westjava: some one told me : nt=trf to 3@c, 3@d=trf to 3@h: to play or slam try, 4@h mild slam try @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to convince declarer|pg||
nt|haans: Fantoni played late|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks boye for @d pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sorry, just too quick for me there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Tried to catch up on the last few tricks, but I'll get the result in when they finish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think +620 |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: last board on th way|pg||
nt|kastan88: meanwhile USA is 2 up in Match A and B|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good discards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: @HQ chance play|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell attacking his side suit first|pg||
nt|Walddk7: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out regardless|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer claims after touching trump|pg||
nt|jacksond: of course helgemo/helness didnt play in Pau so Norway didnt do well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.clairebridge.com/brogelandcollage.htm   many photos there|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @D6 exit?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not for me with bad @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is Super Matchpoints|pg||
pc|c8|nt|oliverc: yes, wd|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the other room,  no way she can win the bd |pg||
nt|westjava: wow, USA fly too high at other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as east no splinter was available|pg||
nt|mamos: needs to get Clubs right to keep it to one down  --  |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess @cA+ruff ---which @dtop + ruff also same given layout|pg||
nt|haans: nothing is more difficult in bridge than defense|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|edmunte1: after Probst have shown DA+|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: meant no way she can lose the bd |pg||
nt|yvesj49: 9@h|pg||
nt|edmunte1: @S and @DK, it would have been pretty normal to play him fot 2722|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: uh oh ok undo|pg||

nt|jeanhari: daclarer cant draw trumps and start on clubs, would be short of f trumps so plays clubs  right away|pg||
nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: played with espen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the idea there|pg||
nt|bobholl: playing very clever to escape for 1 down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: @C4 = +2|pg||

nt|h_karluk: interesting |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: discussion on EW bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay thanks|pg||

nt|udo: and no damage with the actual layout|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Match A: USA 2 boards up .... Match B: USA 3 up|pg||

nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: when Zoric played small on @CQ, Roussev could have maked it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: EW will surely bid and make 4@S here|pg||
nt|udo: same biding so far|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see what can go wrong if dec plays trump before @d (keeping the 10@h in dummy)|pg||
nt|udo: in the other room 2@H-4@H followed now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or @c lead and @h back|pg||
nt|westjava: what's wrong with 3@D opening?|pg||
nt|blewah: strong club|pg||
nt|yvesj49: without the jack ?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: because that's last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: they were good enough : 1 Boye BROGELAND - Espen LINDQVIST Norway 0.82 2. 2 Claudio NUNES - Fulvio FANTONI Italy 0.71|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Zia now thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Taps his pass card|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure his "given" name is Robert,  but I have known him for more years than either of us will admit....always bobby |pg||
nt|h_karluk: East not a passed hand, over x supposedly sys on|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: board being played with Sontag as N!!!|pg||
nt|oliverc: can they stop at 3@S?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: this is a fast table|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Zia: "hopefully not too much"|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C K OR J lead puts 6@S 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have,  but only has Ax in spades,  last thing he wants to hear is  4 @S |pg||
nt|h_karluk: which Nunes did not follow the same route like Eric|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: agreed Oliver|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think wld bring +660 for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Thank you everyone, this is the last board of the set. We restart in around 30 mins.|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: bye!|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´ve read that in USA they played this in the 60s a lot. They stopped it, because the winner of the events were always the same!|pg||
nt|bobholl: good play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: well done got to the right spot|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@s is par i think and decl must have a hard time figuring if all the missing aces are in S's hand|pg||

nt|mamos: but 4@S may well make here so may turn out tob e the wrong deision  |pg||
nt|haans: shevek: Helgemo plays in 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: Helgemo Helness have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @C too even luckyer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blewah: 1 down 2 to go for guessing A/Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: S totally quiet with 3 aces may not be easy to see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board is finished I will load up 1 again and enter some of the play |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @c Q hook marked|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems straightforward eleven tricks|pg||
nt|ady: meyers mad a tight 1NT hand 16|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17  the 460 looking good to maybe win the match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we are 6 tables all days|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hook obv|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||

nt|westjava: fault no.1|pg||
nt|bobholl: 12 tricks on a double squeeze (rodwell found it) but in @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H made now|pg||
nt|haans: Most point out that @CT was what made this deal|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|westjava: for gambling 3nt, I lead a gambling honour at other (M) suit|pg||
nt|jacksond: 2NT in other romm was a grwat result for europe and was  likely to win board anyway.|pg||
nt|kastan88: B-A-M sounds as former known Soviet trans-Siberian BAM (Baical-Amur magistral)|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be that is reason to stop BAm counting|pg||
nt|riccho:  Bd 5 is a next-to-sure winner for europe (my prediction ary lousy... :))|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @H lead stops 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The europeans seem to have a stanglehold on this match  needing just half from the last two boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: and the good 3@S will bring them at least a 1/2|pg||
nt|bobholl: ouder als mijn dochter (1975)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: That was the last board, thanks all. We restart in 25 mins.|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo: Nicer in spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helness laughs :)|pg||
nt|ady: flat 17   nice tops   but needs good clubs to have a decent play|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: against three NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: unless this brogeland is a son of Boye Brogeland|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice double|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S, forcing and 4 cards support|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The slam score was wrong- +1 is correct, sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: impressed that n/s got to game,  slow start |pg||
pc|h4|nt|oliverc: @D, @H, 2 @C and a @S|pg||
nt|ady: major suit switch will leave declarer short   and that is certain to come|pg||
nt|mamos: or more if this @DK wins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considers @D10|pg||
nt|h_karluk: since 2 boards a tad aggressive approach to cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose this 4N was to play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's|pg||
nt|westjava: switch to @C now|pg||
nt|westjava: or never:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: she would enjoy to @c switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just low towards hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think this may be a long think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: musing|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C switch would not be welcome at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin as gone for a comfort break, a kibitzer sits in|pg||
nt|jbgood: good communication E-W to win another board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: significant double|pg||
nt|rado: E might have 1-2 hcp only, so declarer  has a chanse|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
nt|westjava: means thar score now is 3-1, Ant?|pg||
nt|westjava: *that|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no, score is now entered, 2.5-4.5 is correct|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I'll re-enter the play before the next board|pg||
nt|edmunte1: just a simple matter of probabilities|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: yes we have all seen better opening bids|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west also contributed well, cool x |pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: her first thoughts were best :)|pg||
nt|westjava: bingo!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now : 7 @d in bag, 2@c also|pg||
nt|mcphee: the good news is Sementa has a second @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so th tenth either spades or hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no transportation problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have 4 tricks Hamdi|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: natural lead i think 1 p for each pair|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzrj: Levin: "what's 1@S-3@D" - answer: "inv"|pg||
nt|haans: finesse in hearts for 3 hearts|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Nunes scratching his head now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: certainly in thought :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: clearly he was hoping his @S were running|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: so South did well to win the first @S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: my Gran would have approved of that lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *edit: then|pg||
nt|westjava: lovely @H4|pg||

nt|h_karluk: sure Bob, they will get their winners to set it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|westjava: and contract is 4nt:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we all see|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin is back, and North/South send out a kibitzer for some diet cokes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: edit: 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: before winning @SA Meyers checked 1@S showed 5|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: my Gran is only in 2NT on the EW cards tho :)|pg||
nt|mamos: defence does best to get ruff now because otherwise declarer can cash two clubs discarding Hearts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|blewah: push board|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: spade needed|pg||
nt|haans: bright defense needed|pg||
nt|mamos: South would have made this hand much easier if she had allowed @DK to win|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: agree|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :) i guess this is the same guy used "Pomo" nick, great|pg||
nt|oliverc: he can run but he can't hide :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's very true sir:) you nicely pointed out|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: cashing the @HA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: a heart to hand - ruff|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: common IMP play never to stop at 2nt|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mamos: still can get Heart ruff for -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess @h 9|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: will let south know|pg||
nt|edmunte1: if you went wrong you'll usually lose only 6 IMP's (vs 2nt=). If you're right you'll win 10 IMP's (vs 2nt+1)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|reisig: Sontag has been a GREAT player for many years|pg||
nt|oliverc: absolutely|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: easy defense|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: and then a @d towards table - ruff|pg||
nt|ady: heart then and it would have made if Justin plays the 6|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: west has 2@C|pg||
nt|rado: and if no Q@C would have open 2@S:)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and a spade or another @h?|pg||
nt|oliverc: still going to lose a @S and 2 @C whatever he does|pg||
nt|edmunte1: so you just need to be right in 37.5 % of cases to go even|pg||
pc|c9|nt|oliverc: needs to ruff this|pg||
nt|oliverc: high|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or slip in defense|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 13+ openings, she will drop the @CQ I think|pg||
pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: seems Sabine musing|pg||
nt|oliverc: ooops|pg||
nt|haans: and @D now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: and a @h ruff for promo or eventual winner|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hehe|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so off two was inevitable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @s K and rest well known|pg||

nt|h_karluk: it was indeed a subtle line|pg||

nt|westjava: a mathematical count problem solved by Dubuin:)|pg||
nt|haans: and also count in that you may stress opps and can get IMP at other board|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|h_karluk: unfortunately we were not able to watch all cards played|pg||
nt|jbgood: only one down?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|edmunte1: Croatia scored 11 on board 14, so we have a close finish|pg||

nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|mamos: is this a  hand for science?|pg||

nt|haans: 3nt easy make :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: :)   a two up transfer :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass is a sure thing|pg||
nt|oliverc: Auken perhaps not counting the hand right there. partner HAS to have either the K|pg||
nt|oliverc: or J of Spades to make up their 1@C Opening|pg||
nt|westjava: *Duboin|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4 or 5@D?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 I think|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: normally many people plays it xfer to spades|pg||
nt|stc: this is how you win 100 times the cavendish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt off one, whatever|pg||
nt|sybarra: a precision 2 @C  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6+ clubs |pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c 6+ 10-15 usually no 4M|pg||
nt|westjava: Arnim-Auken system, looks like close to precision I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I was only using precision as a generic description of the 2 @C bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and you are not sure about @c A, K|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: someone gets a text message loudly in the room - everyone looks|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 4@s normal spot|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: http://www.masterpointpress.com/general/bbum.html|pg||
nt|jacksond: looks impossible for declarer to get out for one down which would be a half|pg||
nt|blewah: closer to ultra canape, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: if you roll the dice and bid slam then in the newspapers, if goes down would feel worst, because the players there know their business very well|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: well  you'd want to be playing with a partner with whom you had very secure agreements on this auction ........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5@s misread|pg||
nt|oliverc: Do we know exactly what 4@H meant?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : tenace|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|haans: that 4@D looks costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 2@D shows 9 cards either way|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding on a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: surprised they didnt double 4@D (at this form of scoring).|pg||

nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||

nt|westjava: play @DK and cash @c..?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mamos: Zia knows what he has   we know what he has   |pg||
nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
nt|oliverc: so ruffing high and exiting with the Q@S should have been a sensible line of defence|pg||
