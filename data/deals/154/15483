mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: he might misguess diamonds to avoid the south hand I suppose|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|mamos: in a way its the sort of result  both sides can feel quite pleased with  -- no big minus score|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mamos: or was .....  commentators curse|pg||
nt|gulyas: knowing S has 6@Hs, among others, makes it less likely he has @DQxx as well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: wow I think that a@C was unwise after 5@C|pg||
nt|mamos: but ery difficult looking at two Clubs and six Spades|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|panja: in Precision, to open 2@C, you need six Clubs or a side 4-card Major...this hand has neither...so a 1@D opening..that bids shorter suit ahead of the longest|pg||

nt|panja: not much that S could do wrong though|pg||
nt|rv: Nystrorm will find @h switch now|pg||
nt|panja: there is the backward finesse in Clubs as a crazy idea, but this South is unlikely to go for it|pg||
nt|phil: that is the most dangerous|pg||
nt|rv: maybe even @HQ|pg||
nt|phil: declarer can't ruff hearts in dummy and realistically hold trump losers to one, and if he ruffs a diamond he taps himself|pg||
nt|rv: If Nystorm doesn't find @h switch, declarer is favorite to score this contract|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|panja: he will try to keep trump control, not ruff any @H himself, but play on Clubs..|pg||
nt|panja: so @HA, @SQ..one more trump, and then @CK and finesse..that is what is more likely|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Nystorm is thinking of shifting to low @h or @HQ, I presume he will shift to @hq|pg||
nt|panja: or rather, @HA, @SQ, @CK, @C finesse, second Spade..sequence..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Panja's line seems to be best|pg||
nt|phil: hmm.....2 trump and 3 clubs works if East ruffs and returns a trump - he can set up the long diamond with the 4th club as an entry|pg||
nt|rv: is there any better line even single-dummy?|pg||
nt|panja: what is E thinking about?|pg||
nt|phil: and if he doesn't ruff, he can play @dA, ruff, heart ruff, @d I think.....|pg||
nt|panja: i doubt he has a third option, @HQ and small @H are the only two I can think of|pg||
nt|phil: how much do we know about the S hand? |pg||
nt|phil: was told 8-11, 4@s + 4@c|pg||
nt|phil: and the lead seems to imply South is 4=3=2=4...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|panja: two easy @H ruffs now|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|panja: if S played 4@H, on a @S lead, and @SA off, the contract would be in a little more trouble than that from the other side|pg||
