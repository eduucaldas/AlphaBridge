nt|Walddk4: E-W are Crouch-Patterson and I have their somewhat complicated system in front of me|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland and Geoffrey |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We may need it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Crouch is pitiful on BBO and one of our regular commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 14-16 in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Kath   David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Hi all. Welcome to Solihull|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty   especially on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we saw Townsend & Bakhshi put up a great performance this time yesterday|pg||
nt|daman: Italians always double with hands like East   points before shape|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good evening all|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Hello Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w could easily get too high here  |pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and Laure :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Roland |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|daman: I would have passed|pg||

nt|ralfwil: now S can take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Thomas |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: welcome for the 4th match of the week-end|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lots of transfer responses on a strong club base|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|stc: 3@d probably a sort of Bergen|pg||
nt|sybarra: this likely to be a tight match,  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyone know the results?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did they keep it up?|pg||
nt|lestergold: all strong players here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: david are there any results online?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: FEGARTY beat ROBERTS 25-5; PRYOR beat BIRD 25-5; COOPER beat SHILLITOE 23-7; DHONDY beat COPE 18-11 (Cope was penalised 1 VP for slow play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Players seem very chipper for such an early hour|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||
nt|sybarra: most of us know all the names on the screen |pg||
nt|tomi2: have just one question to the local experts from France... is Zaleski playing with a team in this competition?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: 1 nt or 2 @S not much further |pg||
nt|josj: 2@S seems too high already|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: zaleski doesnt play|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h are 3-3 and a @s discard. @d are 3-3 and also a finess after the lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: this lead can help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You got the results before you asked, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's very impressive yes :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another double fit in the Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: West doing a lot of bidding |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again ralf :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: but it also looks very much a normal contract|pg||
nt|stc: as you can see 4@s by S has good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the results : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Bonjour Laure, Constantin|pg||
nt|Walddk8: and Jos|pg||
nt|josj: Bonjour Laure, Roland, Constantin|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: just for remin you : 1 match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: can make 6 now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: predictable lead which stes up 3 heart tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards!|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqvist - McIntosh are members of the England open team, and Crouch-Patterson have won the Camrose Trophy for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: both very good pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqcist originally from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|sybarra: that saved a trick |pg||
nt|tomi2: but Nunes - Fantoni play regulary in the Zimmermann team, yes? they were not available because of playing in Italy?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: spade loser soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 after 20 boards: Teltscher +19 IMPs v Rosen, Senior +7 IMPs v Small, Crouch +8 IMPs v Hinden, Hackett P +3 IMPs v DeBotton|pg||
nt|josj: the 2nd @D loser likely to disappear but the @H ruff not...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzqj: remind|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: Michelle must have been having kittens with that awful south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w could be candidates for one of the strongest mixed pairs on the planet|pg||
nt|daman: that's a pretty broad statement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: Cooper +36 v Dhondy, Cope +27 v Pryor, Roberts +19 v Bird, Fegarty +1 v Shillitoe|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|daman: I have to say I don't agree|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: wisely |pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Constantin Stancescu|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: yes easier to play the ace and finesse |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but he sin't  doing that |pg||
nt|garnetts: Must admit I cannot see much wrong with 1@H and if I had managed to bid 2@H --then 3@D wouldn't have been on my mind |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: In the balancing position here 2@H should be say a decent six card suit and a reasonable hand --what used to be called intermediate |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: the ace of clubs wont run away|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Constantin|pg||
nt|josj: hi Constantin|pg||
mc|10|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks with a correct play in @c|pg||

nt|lestergold: but should be suspicious that is exactly what to expect from a player opf King's ability|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anopther way was to play the remaining |pg||
nt|yo_yo: has he forsaken tom townsend?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i haD NOTICED EVEN THO AT THIS HOUR IM NORMALLY HAL;F ASLEEP|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry capslock|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D    3NT   likely staert|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg of course a legend and Ms.Senior one of the world's leading lady players|pg||
nt|lestergold: against the long standing partnerhsip of cooke and garvey|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from rainy central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: My second session - will try harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: so uneventful at end of the day |pg||
nt|josj: I cannot help thinking they just missed game on  1|pg||
nt|stc: I expect 4@h -1 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: strange push, same lead with same overcall in other room |pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
nt|daman: I have never heard of the legend and I subscribed to IPBM for years|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ffbridge.asso.fr/   the bracket sheet |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: fo the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|tomi2: then Fantunes can become French champions soon after missing the Italian some hours ago :) those top pros now seem to play everywhere :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Luare even better |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: classement : Payen, Cronier Laffineur, Doussot, Zimmerman|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey a great bit slightly wild talent|pg||
nt|daman: I have heard of Nevena|pg||
nt|stc: or even 4@s by EW|pg||
nt|stc: in fact 4@s is a making save !|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg is a world class player|pg||
nt|daman: you said legend    he is not a legend|pg||
nt|daman: and I have a plethora of specs who agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a matter of opinion |pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h are in, not easy to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
nt|daman: he might be a legend in GB|pg||
nt|josj: yes, 5@D should go down by ducking @HA once|pg||
nt|josj: and defeating 5@C is even easier|pg||
nt|stc: and 5@d a phantom save !|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Le classement after 2 matches: Payen 45, Doussot 44, Cronier 42, Laffineur 40, Piganeau 33|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 : After 40 boards Small +39IMPs v Senior, Rosen +33IMPs v Teltscher, Crouch +5IMPs v Hinden, DeBotton +3IMPs v Hackett P|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: fantastic pass from West    winning action|pg||
mb|3N|nt|blum1956: why not open weak 2@s? Or Multi? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  12-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: er my son has a louder voice and is a lot bigger!|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Classement = standings|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok then very well known player :)|pg||
nt|daman: cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is originally from swedn and plays a great deal internationally especially the S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the US|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You have never heard of Nevena Senior, George?|pg||
nt|pelu: but long way from US to Canada :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2 : After 40 boards Cope +18IMPs v Pryor, Dhondy +16IMPs v Cooper, Shillitoe +11IMPs v Fagarty, Bird +6IMPs v Roberts|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone make sense of this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might find 4 @H if W bids @H now |pg||
nt|josj: but how would you play 4@H on a @S lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they play 4 card majors and had to confirm 5th ht first |pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that comment,  I thougnt N had opened |pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 4 @C now?  I am sure that is what N is thinking about  |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Standings after 3 matches: 1. Payen (64) - 2. Cronier (62) - 3. Laffineur (60) - 4. Doussot (58) - 5. Zimmermann (48) - 6. Chemla (45) - 7. Piganeau (43) - 8. Vinay (36) - 9. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Delfour (35) - 10. Hirchwald (35) - 11. Vives (25) - 12. Salliere (24)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|daman: Sure I have|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C looks like a decent spot to me |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
nt|daman: sctoll up|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bonjour à tous  and hello all |pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead would let it thru|pg||
nt|daman: r*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you said you had not|pg||
nt|sybarra: true, probably not as easy it looks from here|pg||
nt|josj: well, in 3nt you just need to steal 1 @H trick :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, heard, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: can't remember her maiden name|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bill |pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tomi2: do I remember correctly that France missed to qualify for European Champions Cup this year? think they finished 11th or so?|pg||
nt|athene: I suppose you might bid 6@C on these cards if you really waned imps but it looks a bit much to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then again a helpful lead |pg||
nt|athene: @DA off, @CQ lurking around, lots of work to do to get those hearts up and running.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: Demtinev or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Delova|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrrmmmmm|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: but it works well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call me naive, but I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|h2|nt|blum1956: no way to go down in 4@s (almost)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C lead in other room|pg||
nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6-card or player ))))|pg||
nt|garnetts: They do--and in my view their card play rarely live up to their expectations--a triumph of hope over experience |pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Might there have been a pass by east to start this?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: lost it N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no alert from S on 1@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: désolée pour ces problèmes ....|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bon jour|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Carl |pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to our operator Laure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: I suppose John wanted to protect K@D|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the opening on left,  you are pretty sure where the k of @H is |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: same contract in the other room |pg||
pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: now -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dop u agree with Townsend'spass david?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure, the ruffing finesse in hearts is a good bet, but you still have to ruff another one |pg||
nt|athene: unless the ten comes down|pg||
nt|athene: it's not a ridiculous slam but you don't mind not being in it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: Best play from E is to discard @s6 on next @c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: maybe Townsend tht 3@D likley if east had anything   that +300 would not be a great loss  and if partner had nothing would gain |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very odd view imo|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: 3N is of course a normal and goo contract very unlucky that apart form spades all other 3  Qs badly placed for dclarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3nt will go down now. N has not enough of entries to finess in all suits|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East will be in trouble soon|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: declarer cashing out and maybe hoping for a mistake|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and that´s why E should discard @s6 on @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes discarding on clubs but Small has to read the position not easy|pg||
nt|josj: unlikely to happen|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes east has six diamonds too and it goes @DA, ruff right off|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Not a good start for N-S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|nt|roswolf: ok the finesse was into the safer hand but ....|pg||
nt|sharkey: S off to a good lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tomi2: that is difficult, all those "not"s :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: and if u lead a @H - then @H10|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @H's to break  and that is a claim |pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: They gave a no play game on board 1|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Hi   every one|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: He'll do the throw in now and East endplayed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we shall applaud him if he does that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East is squirming i bet|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a time to be in tank Mr. Osborne|pg||
nt|lestergold: squirming gives game away|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: time to take break and wash face with cold water?|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed will be a test of their fortitude under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have seen Townsend pass in other auctions with massive hands where he should not have|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems an odd pass to me|pg||
nt|daman: I have boxes of past issues of IPBM|pg||
nt|daman: delova doesn't ring a bell|pg||
nt|daman: yes    Deleva|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Meyer|pg||
nt|capercliff: afternoon folks|pg||
nt|sharkey: another slam...|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Cliff|pg||
nt|sybarra: jeanpaul, and clifff,  good to see both of you|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: hello every one on the 1st board he declarant received the spade lead|pg||
nt|josj: looked a normal result anyway|pg||
nt|josj: and the inevitable @S loser...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Bas van Beijsterveldt|pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Bas :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi Bas|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: I actually thought the imp "swing" would go the other way when he started playing it |pg||
nt|neobas: 4@S NS here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|josj: some work to do to make 4@S in EW, it might well go down|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s doomed because of the bad split in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Both sides deserved to suffer for getting to 3NT--life is never fair lol|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the dreaded multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: weak only version|pg||
nt|sharkey: merci Laure|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: de rien :) |pg||
nt|capercliff: N/S may do well not to push them into this slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C is suited as alerted |pg||
nt|sybarra: does E realize how good his hand it for W?|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS has a @H or @C sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: the 1st board : 1nt-p-2@s (4@h and no @s)-x-3nt ...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 11-15 at least  0  diamonds|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we call it precised Michael in France|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: sorry  seeing things  I tht diamonds 4-4 last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but once again... if E had discarded @s6 he is discarding behind declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellselway may take him seriously here and go too far|pg||
nt|sharkey: i like 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes sets them on the right path (Hopefully) |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they should reach the @d slam now|pg||
nt|athene: Always 11 here because if the defence take their clubs, declarer gets a pitch for his heart|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Li Jie bid 5@D on his own next door|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surpised N didnt bid over 3@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: either x or 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 4 @H works also?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Amazing auction really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: operator  can you explain the alerts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hopwever  6@d is on ice|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good AFTERNOON |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Mike!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GM all, sorry i am a bit late, computer very slow booting up today|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as pd undertsnads....|pg||
nt|sybarra: now he can cue @H's |pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud bid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good  potential save in 7 @c   par contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure N should bid at all, 7@c is a good save but who is to say they will bid slam?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: he choosed  the lowest cue bid I think  Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes makes sense, |pg||
nt|sybarra: (lowest cue first) |pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead would hold it, sorry|pg||
nt|neobas: Pretty straightforward board, really|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D   3@D   5@D  he bid. Partner was silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: i guess you have to open that dog (4333)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Ed & Mike|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at leats 5 @c by N now|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|haans: will Gui give them 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: well E/W do have 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it worked they kept them out of the laydown slam |pg||
nt|daman: good stuff to reach game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Ed and Marshall|pg||
nt|sharkey: W knows a @H cue shos 1. round control - no purpose showing 2. control knowing pd is 55|pg||
nt|stc: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: but things may happen ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any reason to make 4@S  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denies 6 in a minor unless a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D can have 6 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Scores from first stanza|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup not a good 13 count but an opening within the meaning of the Act|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Teltscher 86 Hackett 29, Senior 13 Rosen 49, Hinden 35 Small 41, Crouch 40 de Botton 52|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the multi does seem to work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 combined but work to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: but E didnt|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: may happen ....|pg||
nt|josj: q.e.d.|pg||
nt|athene: objectively you prefer to be playing transfer responses, then the hearts can't be attacked |pg||
nt|neobas: 2@D artificial Gameforce "Checkback Stayman" I think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@D presumably asks for the better major|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time 3NT looks slightly better|pg||
nt|garnetts: East sees no reason to do anything other than bid 3NT--things are well placed for 4@H--best lead from North though |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 4@H not 3NT sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: with W do you lead low ht or q? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small should have good 6 to bad 8|pg||
nt|daman: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 top losers and 2 out  of 3 black losers in Hallberg's hand which need to be disposed of one way or the other|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike and Marshall|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: bid  South you have no defensive trick at all|pg||
nt|capercliff: some would play a X bu N now says "I would like to bid 7@c"|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not this pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: hello everybody we are here for the fench national championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well a good club view would help the cause of n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: might on a club lead even then not certain |pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: Q in pards bid suit i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours there is a lot of equity in messing up the u]auction as n/s have done|pg||
nt|capercliff: that way he includes partner in deciding whether to bid or not|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: this pickles you pard |pg||
nt|josj: game was not missed on  1 in CR...|pg||
nt|neobas: Not sure why Cronier did that, 4@S is really the contract you want to be in regardless of what partner responds to 2@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: we can talk about that :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@C = fit to @D and values in @C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stc: even Xed|pg||
nt|athene: On a heart lead declarer has a slight decision to make|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump attack was needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry first time at this|pg||
nt|daman: he is gin for game|pg||
nt|daman: can make 5 really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he is lucky here can ruff 2 losers in dummy and just about negotiate |pg||
nt|daman: yes   maybe only makes 4    not enough soldiers for an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful when returning to hand ruffing the third@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: however has no choice as @da drops|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DK he can discard the last @S-loser - so give up 2 @Hs - but has to take @HA|pg||
nt|athene: ducking might look really silly if the lead were a singleton|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting metaphor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you guess hearts (you don't), it's 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: I lead the Q but who am I ?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont beligve 12 - but 10!|pg||
nt|daman:     not 680|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus 1 i was expecting plus 2 imposs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Soryy result not right|pg||
nt|daman: maybe 620|pg||
nt|lestergold: 650 my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 impossible|pg||
nt|daman: I think he has to lose a @S in the wash|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant place 3 black losers om two @Hs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: hi ralf & scores of specs....it's not just the players that have scores:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: Well Sandqvist ?Tosh a relatively newish partnership|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 13 tricks on this lead|pg||
nt|athene: but west would be likely to bid over 1@C with all the hearts|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: @S guess now?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: shirley. shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: suit pref?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small has left the table to put on a jumper|pg||
pc|s6|nt|neobas: This also works for +1 :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the other room teammates de botton and malinowski the latter a world class player de botton a world class sponsor and enthusiast of the game|pg||
nt|sybarra: except Thomas didnt take the K |pg||
nt|tomi2: I think this is relatively randomly... two hands of equal strenght so I don't think on the long run you win/lose something by playing from the opening hand...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: probably "negotiating" the 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: and 3 rounds of @c will set E under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sandqvist a brilliant but slightly wild card  of a player has a world silver medal to his credit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: best defence in my view tap declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can now see 6 of the 6 to bad 8 points on N|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
nt|neobas: Now it's +2 even|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|neobas: @HK coming down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|josj: low @C now...|pg||
nt|stc: strange play, I would have play @c before so many trump rounds|pg||
nt|josj: so would I|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: good swing for Hackett|pg||
nt|roswolf: has he really blocked the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: he has the ace of @H to get back unless patterson leads one |pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart now will block them for good|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I don't think the Clubs are blocked, didn't see what card was played|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah, ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah my faith in tosh is restored |pg||
nt|stc: no he must guess @c|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzqj: Lacroix is extremely nervous on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: at|pg||
nt|stc: In fact many things happened, oops, reoops and normal score !|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|garnetts: A heart to the King and North will do well to duck |pg||
nt|sybarra: argh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this was a mistake as I see it - for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: but Cronier likely to take the @H hook isnt he\|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|nt|neobas: Probably|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: Holland and Brunner partnership in real life Holland a fin player used to partner the late Arnstrong qell respected player |pg||
nt|neobas: Playing @Ds first won't give him count either... I think|pg||
nt|athene: at the table you have a much better chance of getting it right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: cannot really cost that much can it --this might now end play South |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that club switch ever going to happen?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now E can discard his @hQ and 3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: much more difficult to get to game in the other room|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|neobas: Well done :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: do they use screens?|pg||
mc|12|nt|garnetts: That was good play--better than relying on just 3-2 hearts |pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: Small is having a field day at the wheel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you a weak 2 would have worked equally well |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its no0t a victory for the multi as such merely a victory for the barrage that took place|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe a lowly trump promoted in south |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW? |pg||
nt|daman: being aggressive?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Michelle Brunner a frequent member of English distaff international team|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow usually plays with hackett senior very experienced senior player i dont know much about Levy|pg||
nt|josj: this time, 4@H does look easy...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|josj: but NS have a good vul. save|pg||
nt|sybarra: and blackwood should help them stay out of stam |pg||
nt|josj: he who makes the last mistake loses the pot...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: yes we are screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: SZ thinking about digging graves|pg||
nt|ady: part score here    likley 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: now the hand is scored as -1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: -1 is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: which hand? the last?|pg||
nt|pelu: how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is this david levy?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it was clear that North had nothing except @c support for passing 3 @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont know if EW can bid 5@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: one match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@H!? What a strange choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This mountain that SZ had to climb is suddenly taking on the appearance of Everest|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot think how West declared 5@H next door |pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that with the TOD west thought east had four |pg||
nt|daman: I think you might look at their card Nicky|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Yang psyched a pass over the Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1,  e/w lost an imp here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|daman: ask them the result|pg||
nt|josj: 13 boards seems an odd number...any reason for that?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: no it 's a match of 26 boards divided by 2 :)|pg||
nt|stc: A lack of concentration from declarer, I see no other explanation|pg||
nt|josj: this time, 6@C seems the best slam but it won't make whereas 6@S will|pg||
nt|athene: interesting silence from east|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: agressive non bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: No auction given in the movie|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: again the 3NT-4 Major choice|pg||
nt|othered1: Why alert the double,  Standard to double 1N for takout of @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to get to I think |pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: diamond lead beats this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s. time enough to find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the rosen team fresh from having given the senior team a serious pasting|pg||
nt|ady: wrong red suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i predict|pg||
nt|daman: would we all have bid 3NT with 3334 9 count?|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told that -1 was claimed at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg still has his workl cut out for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: from someone who is at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are two tens i think normal to bid vul game at ips with west's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North can't really sit this,  since his double wasn't based on defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was wondering about the alert on Michelle's pass over 1C last time. maybe she alerts all her bids|pg||
nt|othered1: his redouble, rather|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure he cant sit this. he has good defence, knows he is facing spade shortness and five hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N makes on the cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Goes down if NS get their @S trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 Nt is alright too|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 3 nt  with  j987 |pg||
nt|josj: I have to admit this makes sense...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: but i can ask if you want|pg||
nt|josj: probably it's the time schedule|pg||
nt|josj: 52 boards a day, this way, not 56 which might be too long|pg||
nt|josj: half an hour extra|pg||
nt|josj: nd use iof screens always slowing down the proceedings|pg||
nt|stc: 5@h will win 4 IMP|pg||
nt|josj: and|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe she was swayed by her two 10's|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, slam is just against the odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps with such a pure pre-empt he doesn't want to bid 3@C because it might just help opps too much|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: yes a spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: E's @h spots are just good enough to deny the defence 4 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT down on @H lead & @S switch?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - misread|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being if you bid 3@C people will finesse your partner for all the queens and you know that will work|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: from the frying pan.... into ,,,, the fire....|pg||
nt|othered1: The double, in practice, tends to deny a fit at all, but north's @S suit doesn't need a lot of support.  |pg||
nt|sharkey: placed @SK behind @SQ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a bit nerve wracking  however |pg||
nt|capercliff: no Carl, declarer gets his @d trick before defence sets up a @s|pg||
nt|josj: this  is going to be a real push|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok, i am told 3@C would be Ghestem|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: bakhshi has to alert  as he could have a longer @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H    needs club lead  to definately beat it|pg||
nt|josj: on  2 in CR NS took the final phantom save: 5@H v. 5@D|pg||
nt|josj: but 4@S on this oe looks a coffee hand so that's what I will do...|pg||
nt|josj: one|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H also made in the other room on board 1, with an overtrick even|pg||
nt|othered1: Not at all -- isn't 2@H makable?|pg||
nt|athene: well, so you have to bid 2@C or 4@C then :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: this might beat it too|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: SZ scores :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the bidding in CR is so strange, that the operator dont wont to give it :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has two trumps and above all, EW are vul & 2D X is not game so even if they make it there is a limit to how bad it can be. N has shown a good hand so if S doesnt want to move ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: towards game I think it is reasonable for N to pass the double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 2@h is not so far away|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hm as i expected Sandqvist is worried about the defensive potential of his con tribution|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @h now and small return|pg||
nt|capercliff: but E knows who has the K now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: @d switch good enuf?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the teltscher team seemed to be way in front  yesterday|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: this will be a quick match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Halberg will make it with the help from the lead now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: high @h would be  encouraging for this pair the 6  is not clear the 10 would be best hoping for AK9  in South|pg||
nt|neobas: Red neither looks attractive|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: has time to try the club as well|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: would not affect the result here|pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all, sorry, I hadn't seen the broadcast already started :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bas :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Bas|pg||
nt|neobas: Heya Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT CR as well|pg||
nt|neobas: Hej Carl|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good afternoon Bas|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: spade lead also enough    only one discard of a club  so down 1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A spade was led to the ace and one returned. Curtains|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have taken some deep trump finesses there|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|daman: he almost has to fall into it now    no?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: was so much easier to beat the hand from this vantage point |pg||
nt|josj: declarer will then need a trump finesse|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that the contract was 6@C and not 5@H|pg||
nt|stc: 10:00 is VERY EARLY for most bridge players|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: oups +2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: but after the great lead the follow-up was disappointing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room, Whittaker reasonably played partner for a singleton spade rather than @CA after West bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't fault him|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Anyway, something went 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: I think 2@S was a good decision, likely going plus instead of minus if east had taken the right view|pg||
nt|athene: but that might go very badly wrong if (for example) east is holding up with @HKxx or something|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: a push|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: I am suprised to hear that :)  |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whittaker also from Scotland originally|pg||
nt|othered1: and 670 is an especially ugly minus|pg||
nt|athene: you might run into diamond ruffs trying to get to dummy, or just get cut off from dummy|pg||
pc|h3|mc|10|nt|yo_yo: making now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But EW can still defeat 4@h with @d continustion|pg||
nt|ralfwil: continuation....|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h hasa fair potential as cards lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is different to pass the doubl;e of 2H. first off, if they make it NS will have a huge loss, and secondly N has a much better hand for defense against Ds than Hs. as against ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that, S probably has five hearts. here prudence wins the day|pg||

nt|lestergold: at this rate|pg||
nt|daman: this has the potential to be passed out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also the clubs rate to be well placed for declarer on this auction, and a better source of tricks for offense than defence|pg||
nt|capercliff: hard to stay out of game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT going down here|pg||
nt|sharkey: East may lead a @S though...|pg||
nt|stc: If N opens NS will play game and go down|pg||
nt|tomi2: at least the guys know they play ghestem. In Germany most of TD and AC cases are because people look at KQJxxxx@C and forget about Ghestem or partner raises your real Ghestem with ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: ATxx in clubs etc. :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha, yes "the Ghestem Ghost"|pg||
nt|neobas: Always haunting|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in england at most EBU tournaments we have a "ghestem box" - anyone who forgets has to put £1 in, and at the end of the day, all the tournament directors go out for a meal ...|pg||
nt|athene: with the money from the box :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, ok, we don't actually but it's a nice idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a great idea |pg||
nt|neobas: Might have to suggest that to my dad :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks and easy 4 @H here for e/w |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Well they got off to a very good lead and then made a fatal switch |pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|capercliff: that makes 8 tricks....|pg||

nt|sharkey: looks like an endplay possibility|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, if S opens, NS will play game and go down as well :)  :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: is that a transfer or multi-type defense|pg||

mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: no, not clear|pg||

nt|daman: nope  The Garve saved us from that|pg||
nt|lestergold: with garvey around you cant be sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: now the @H lead from E |pg||
nt|neobas: Who here believes North should pass 1@H to allow partner to X?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: No--but the Q@C seemed a very rapid play |pg||
nt|blum1956: not an easy decision for North spade lead probably made from J10|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: apparently david gold still contemplating the @SA|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view too fast to work out options |pg||
nt|lestergold: must show one of the majors or tyransfer?|pg||
nt|stc: indeed|pg||
nt|josj: the X should warn Chemla|pg||
nt|sybarra: the qj, and the kq  holding may also slow them down |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT here. Impressed?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card drury?|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think makeable with @H lead|pg||
nt|neobas: It is something every regular partnership should've discussed in my opinion|pg||
nt|stc: some play here XX showing support|pg||
nt|josj: I would XX here...|pg||
nt|stc: W endplayed on the lead !|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: a third in hand opening but 1nt looks bold at these colours and with a sketchy stop|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is the wildness of garvey at unfavouravle vul he makes a bid that many of us wouldnt even do at favourable|pg||
nt|neobas: Strong 2@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up being enough only to buy the TD each a pint |pg||
nt|neobas: Especially if West can bid 4@H with three card support, an Ace and out|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: 4 @S for n/s if they could get in |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: no :)|pg||
nt|josj: it depends: most of the participants here stayed in nearby-hotels overnight, I assume|pg||

nt|vugraphzqj: jst for remind : 1 match = 2 segments of13 boards|pg||
nt|stc: W will suffer at each card|pg||
nt|josj: and poor E never gets in with his established @C|pg||
nt|tomi2: finaly thats the 2nd time in my young life I see strong twos in action :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: kept n/s out completely |pg||
nt|athene: many people would open 1@C on that north hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|daman: once you have a reputation...it is difficult to deviate|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will get a plus score on this occasion for his efforts|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very tamely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h will go down after 4 rounds óf @c, otherwise makeable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you can if playing support XX |pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: You can't sit still with a 17 count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a quick one down?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push i expect|pg||
nt|ady: this should go ddown on the lay    3NT  may have mad with Q@D right though a an unlikely club lead would beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the weak No trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tosh backing in with a Q and a QJ i think very dangerous|pg||
nt|capercliff: hold up the @h twice and play 3 rounds of @c's, what does E pitch?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   no distribution for an action but 1 NT is possible  1 @s  would weak with dsitribution|pg||
nt|neobas: W on lead won't make a difference, I think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: no a quick 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: a passive lead mind you would let it thru but unlikely|pg||
nt|neobas: Same lead CR|pg||
nt|capercliff: double dummy can get out for -1 i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: pitch @D - limited communications after 4 times @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has to get the unblock in also |pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: work to do but the lead has created a trick and the spades are playabel for one loser|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: yes Roland - and I can make 6 on a non-@c-lead :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have been more impressed if you could have made 6@C on the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dangerous weak 2 with 6 solid tricks in ones hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|capercliff: declarer knows E is 4-3 in the majors now|pg||
nt|neobas: South in the CR ducked the lead twice, played a @C to hand and a @D to the K, after which defence could cash 3@Hs and 3@Ds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose it is not clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT asked East to choose a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Crouch knows that diamonds 5-0 now after the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will play the hand accordingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry what amn i talking about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Qx a particularly doubtful value|pg||
nt|capercliff: and after 4 rounds of @c's will have full outlay|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: hard for partner to read this|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can only make on a spade lead which is likely|pg||
nt|josj: Chemla not interested...|pg||
nt|sybarra: aceless wonder hand|pg||
nt|josj: 10 tricks seem far away but 9 should be there|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes and the side suit is @h!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a @d trick may be created  as they lie|pg||
nt|sharkey: actually East pitches after dummy so wont make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: two yes for one no :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch knows that Tosh has nothing. Otherwise North has no double|pg||
nt|sybarra: except with no @D lead, maybe shows S has none?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north cant be faulted but south will be ashamed|pg||
nt|othered1: Good pint, Shirley|pg||
nt|othered1: point|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is on the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pint sounds OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe the pint is better at this hour for us|pg||
nt|sybarra: 940 am here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may need a heart switch now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed someone eill need a blood transfusion after this|pg||
nt|stc: And quantin let W do the work for him|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: @S lead would have beaten this |pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooops  Gold did return a low @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: @D goes on a @C|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: I was wondering what their methods were over 1NT  ---tempting to bid if you get both suits in |pg||
pc|hK|nt|lebridgeur: most   declarer can get is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: that cant be right|pg||
nt|capercliff: E did not switch to a @c?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and declarer did not play a @h voluntarily?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be huge,  they are playing 4 @S at the other table I am told |pg||
nt|neobas: With 5@Ds and 4@Cs I would, but I wouldn't feel too good rebidding 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind 1@C - 1Major; 1NT|pg||
nt|neobas: On the other hand, this might not be your hand and if you want to get a lead-directing bid in now is your chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: even vul,  couldnt S have ventured 2 @S here?|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: that is a textbook error of course|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe a double psychology play :)|pg||
nt|athene: i trust my partner to supply a good stop in the other major|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes --almost certainly spades with @D toleranace |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: It is a n 11 match round robin on 3 week end so victory points are at stake|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's mad to open 1@C on this south hand and not on the previous north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: surely the dbl means more than "not penalty"!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they must have some more meaning than "not penalty"|pg||

nt|tomi2: having AKQJxxx@H I would not want to let my opps play 4@S vuln undoubled... either I think they are too high, then I try a double or I take insurance in 5@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: might just bid 6@C and hope for the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or jump to 4@C GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did North double over 2@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not double I mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another tough call for Michelle Brunner|pg||

nt|lestergold: tradegy too as its frigid|pg||
nt|daman: it is gin|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Does that not show both red suits?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe better cards|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: this is not plain sailing|pg||
nt|lestergold: here we see Towsned can bid aggressively when he wants to|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im trying to work out can this be made double dummy even?|pg||
nt|lestergold: answer is i dont think that makes ten tricks as cardsw lie here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult when the @S dont break|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i think tiownsend overbid herec partner didnt even have tio have 4 reasonable,hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bakhshi knows the @S dont break from the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 3@c expresses his values after the double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most would bid 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: why?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19 points? |pg||
nt|lestergold: west'shand is full of holes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 points opposie a pssoble yarborough maybe with a 3 card suit is not mandatory game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in either major|pg||
nt|neobas: According to kibs 2@D is GF, 3@D shows @DA and 3@Ss|pg||
nt|neobas: In which case I wonder what 4@D is|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 4-2 spade split gives this an excellent play    would Bakhshi except an invitation ?|pg||

nt|othered1: dicey is a very kind way to put it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: now they know nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Especially with the state of the match - harking back to the debate earlier about tactics|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not hard since North choose to bid 3@H--5NT will do it now |pg||
nt|blum1956: either exclusion Blackwood  (if NS use one) or just RKCB and hope for  the @dA with EW|pg||
nt|ady: disappointing|pg||
nt|josj: @S split very nicely here so np for declarer|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reached the par contract now, 6@DX|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not yet Roland |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very polite David |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: He surely is not contemplating 6NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is considering what to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: length is the paramountg consideration|pg||
nt|athene: and the hearts are better than @HA432|pg||
nt|neobas: @SQJx  makes it iffy|pg||
nt|sybarra: note that on previous hand, N opened |pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@D?  Puppet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so yes, Ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: Last year Cooke and Garvey were in the winning Camrose team which was I expect a culmination of their drwam for years|pg||
nt|daman: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh comes from the "Scots wha' hae wi' Wallace bled" school|pg||
nt|othered1: Your line here?  Cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: im askwed if 2@h is forcing here i would say it was forcing in most partnerships ithese days|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously must be in theirs|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they play 2@c multi and 2@d  Gf ace showing answers|pg||
nt|capercliff: flat board-next|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room |pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: North can likely infer that @S are 3-3 at most in EW  hands|pg||
nt|stc: 3@h makes, so 3@s is not bad, could make|pg||
nt|stc: probably not|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: 5 small @H and a bust and it has a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a moot point borderline my point is that Towsend sholuld have consulted|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: interesting lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Lucky that hearts are 3-3. He can test if @CJ10 doubleton first by cashing one of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has always believed that he was the world's number one not noted for his modesty but to be fair i have always felt that he had a great talent for then game but in sufficent ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: discipline to sustain a position at the top table|pg||
nt|neobas: To a junior like me that seems like a rather old-fashioned system. Obviously I don't know it in-depth but Ace-showing answers are something of the past in my book :)|pg||
nt|josj: @C is best now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: but would he get the right result with a 4-2 spade split  if just consulting|pg||
nt|neobas: It got them to the right spot though|pg||
nt|stc: A@s and @d was the double dummy defense|pg||
nt|josj: but not easy to find|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: trump next I imagine |pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CJ to indicate values in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: @cJ for @S|pg||
nt|garnetts: trump is best--the spade can wait |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter and I must have been partners|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite normal these days not to lead a singleton in partner's suit against notrumps|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: a double followed by a 3 level cue bid tells pard that he doesnt need much to bid game posession ofa 5 CARD SUIT WOULD THEN BE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT|pg||
nt|ady: I agree if east had just 3 small hearts and a bust then 4 hearts could cost a big number|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ssorry butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|daman: we have our share of those on this side of the pond as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry slight exaggeration but we are allowed to tease garvey|pg||
nt|neobas: Be right back|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: a club away on that spade wouldnt hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think selway should have played a club here a spade should have helped declarer|pg||
nt|daman: The Garve is not timid   he criticizes easily    lol|pg||
nt|athene: but still leading a diamond on this auction was quite a view|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the winner of the 3 weekends gets to represent England in the Camrose |pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: if clubs 3/3,  this rolls |pg||
nt|josj: decl. has no good way to come to his hand|pg||
nt|josj: but def. can do little harm as N can ruff @DA with his @SA...|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but now the A@d is a trick again|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: but oh well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is very good play|pg||
nt|stc: ruff, Q@H, trump|pg||
nt|josj: putting up the @DA also works :)|pg||
nt|josj: but does not seem a logical line|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he doesn't know|pg||
nt|josj: he did not know to put up @SJ either...|pg||
nt|stc: he already played S for AK@s|pg||
nt|josj: yes but the chinese finesse looked a bit odd|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blum1956: extremely strange bid for the player of Brunner's level|pg||
nt|lestergold: better not continue these!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: top diamond or even a trump by south would do|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think bakhshi can set up a long dim and enjoy without losing trump comntrol|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it matters  if Townsend pulls 1 trumpt    can discard a club on K@S   and has time to ruff a spade and a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: hovering over a @h|pg||
nt|stc: was good against AK alone in S|pg||
nt|josj: sure :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor South might be feeling a bit shell shocked after the start to this match---pressure gets to all of us |pg||
nt|lestergold: There are T shirts in circulation listing the world's top ten players Garvey at the top of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would never lead something else than @H playing with my father!|pg||
nt|athene: it usually works much better to lead a suit where declarer has length, than where dummy has length|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always worry when declarer bid the nt over pard, I am pickling pards entire holding  |pg||
nt|athene: he could have tried a spade but A10xx is a bit horrible|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Then he just needs either hearts or clubs to behave|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: yes this is not the same situation as 1D-1S-1N-2H|pg||

nt|capercliff: bit of a bidding test here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H CR|pg||
nt|sybarra: should never make 5 |pg||
nt|josj: I can see 3 top losers :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too |pg||
nt|josj: even without glasses on|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defense can get their act together|pg||
nt|stc: end a swing, EW did not enter at all in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 6@h is the top spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer has certainly been friendly to slams |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on  previous deal four @d  showed   @s acceptance with no other thing to cue|pg||
nt|josj: unlikely to disappear|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: first weekend of 3|pg||
nt|othered1: here south passedthe ugly 12-ount|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after clubs can use 2D as art 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@d makes as well of course|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contracts rely on @h being 3-2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope pard knows you use rock crusing 3 level bids|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha Shirley|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: part score hand    n/s  in spades best|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|lebridgeur: he is vulnberable  and only 6 cards  sensible in first position|pg||
nt|neobas: 6@D it is, it seems|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: 15 opp 15 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean slam for these boys?|pg||
nt|neobas: I wonder what 1@S is|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S t/o without spades; now west wants to compete to 3@C without actually saying he has any values|pg||
mb|3C|nt|haans: SZ coming|pg||
nt|garnetts: Tough hand for North --|pg||
nt|yo_yo: redouble is for blood i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double now look fine |pg||
nt|blum1956: EW probably catched up|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes xx was punitive|pg||
nt|sybarra: singleton honors worth ?  (zip)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike Bell also passed 3@D in the OR on 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  because after 1@c ... you have 2@d available as an artificial force|pg||
nt|othered1: Sounds reasonable, but I don't think I've seen that in action.  Don't get around much any more, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had probably played on establish the @d suit by winning the first @c by @cQ and played a @d to @dA and ruffed a @d another @c to K ruffed another @d and discarded @sJ on @cA and ...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that played @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  which you don't after 1@d and 3@c as an artificial force uses up a lot of room|pg||
nt|neobas: Second as well, in my opinion Meyer|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is vul,  so make can expect a "good" hand |pg||
nt|sharkey: W opened 1@D CR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Yes bas of course|pg||
nt|josj: now the NS @S tend to disappear|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like Gan's choice of 1NT in the closed room, rather than double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Anyone for 1NT on the West cards raher then dbl? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jxx often a nice holding|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to see the @H-stop in 3Nt - in CR West reopen 1NT - so......|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there something wrong with X byt N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that the absence of a 7th club does not deter the Garve from a vul 3 level pre=empt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not sure of their sys here but i assume 1C is some sort of artificial bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: Looks like 3N doesn'thave much play at all on @H lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S raising @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i understood this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam looks well below 59%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2¬@h doesnt mke|pg||
nt|ady: North decided to keep out of bidding     not unreasonable|pg||
nt|daman: I have an appointment in 10 minutes    so I will have to flee this match at that point|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 or 7? - as long as the suit is QJ109xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: however his cheeky opening has pushed e/w into  a pretty hpel;ess 3n|pg||
nt|pelu: woprked foine here - no chance in 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: matter of style/agreements|pg||
nt|athene: it's tricky if you are going to bid 3@C on that hand and on 15 counts as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: west considering 3@C   not an immediate success|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect lead!|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done|pg||
nt|stc: looking for trouble|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: only 2@D on 14 HCP???????????????|pg||
nt|sybarra: Simon Cope says:  no - relay shape ask I am pretty sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 60%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50% i mean|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S?|pg||
nt|neobas: I think I'd open 1@D and 3@D equally as frequent|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and stopped in 5    not satisfactory test :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: It may be difficult to get to slam unless W opens 3@D|pg||
nt|capercliff: the only downside to opening 3@d is that you are 3-3 in the majors|pg||
nt|stc: -2 even with friendly breaks in trump|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|neobas: I feel W has used the brakes too much in CR|pg||
nt|josj: yes E left the gate open but NS did not exploit it |pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: nicely done|pg||
nt|josj: the agreements are OK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: I agree, especially when you see where double leads to|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers unavoidable|pg||
nt|tomi2: but maybe he could speculate on his father having 6-4, he did not open any kind of weak two (I guess they play Multi) and overcalled 1@H vulnerable on not many points - so he ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: should have some shape|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I said it before and I will say it again. The EBU must require that all convention cards are submitted and then put on display on the website. It is unreasonable that commentators ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: must guess what certain bids mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll have a word with Max Bavin|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I agree with both of you  !|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather have passed the double than bid 2@D |pg||
nt|haans: original bid|pg||
nt|neobas: So then Doubling instead of 1@S would've been 4+@Ss?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: I have found that the cc's typically posted are only part of the story,  but would be nice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead for King|pg||
nt|henryb:  you only think that because he rebid 1N and not 2, Mike|pg||
nt|stc: first swing of the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 cards suits "up the line"  but with both,  I think X might be right |pg||
nt|josj: looks like playing mp|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: I must admit i would not have preotected with halberg's hand altho h ewas influnced by holding 9 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: close his eyes and play the top tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: hope for the best |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so I prefer to open 3 @d|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: (also in little tiny print) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that I have the EW card. I have because Crouch sent it to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Most don't get terribly deep into relay development|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took me 5 minutes to download the comprehensive version of the EW CC|pg||
nt|sybarra: the cc's hardly give the details for relays,  agree ED |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a shorter version I have on hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect Precision, with 2S inviting game in NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the1N rebid must show 18-1i9 points to explain the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2N looks safe enuf|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Couldn't see a card there|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it is reasonable to assume that  Henry |pg||
nt|lestergold: playing natural club south would rebid 2N|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes me too|pg||
nt|sharkey: W felt "guilty" due to his light opener in CR I think|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: i would have tried 3@D :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or even open 1@d maybe?|pg||
nt|capercliff: in 2nd seat|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blum1956: ruff out, play trumps and then a spade|pg||
pc|d5|nt|garnetts: Yes of course Haans :) rofl |pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have tried 2@H with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland explained to me that out operators are new to this and it is very tought job--in my view Darren is doing brilliantly so far --may not be able to note all alerts this first ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: time |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Cheers, I am new but Roger is an old hand, you'll have David and Ant later who are both experts!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: making 5|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland and I would have been in 3NT because we would have bid 1NT as west --so there |pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of going for a number would have detered me|pg||
nt|pelu: but some would pass the X - if pd strong then 500-800 |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 imps about to appear for the Teltscher team|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt favorite|pg||
nt|sybarra: take no finesses|pg||
nt|sybarra: at yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: *at least yet |pg||
nt|lestergold: every time garvey gets away with one of his wild bids he is encouraged to continue forgets any disasters|pg||
nt|lestergold: has led a charmed life rcently to|pg||
nt|reisig: Somehow - I get partners that remind me!!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|sharkey: Would you open 3@D if Non Vul?|pg||
nt|stc: sure, I don't think that N was really happy when bidding 2@s !|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: long dim takes care of one club loser but that is still 1 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: no devils coup available|pg||
nt|ady: this may be down 2    but definately 1  so nothing much lost for n/s being kept out of the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldnt be 2 off just needs to get the timing right for one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult for players of this calibre|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am askedf how old is garvey|pg||
nt|athene: as many specs have pointed out, lots of pairs would use 2nt by west over 2@H to show a weaker hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|stc: of course X in S should show @s|pg||
nt|josj: yes, only way to show them in this auction|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: to all spects: pl. a name in your profil - most commentators dont chat with "John Do's"|pg||
nt|neobas: He brought six tricks and three card support to the table, I'd say I have nothing to be guilty about|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@d doesn't tell pard anything about his hand really|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: looks like 800|pg||
nt|athene: of course there are textbooks which would frown on that 3@C opener, but having the texture in the suit is worth a lot|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i guess mid late forties but always looked about 25 to me|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@C is a real hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: taken the max --well done |pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: claim?|pg||
nt|athene: @CQJ109xx is going to be a 2-loser suit mostly even if partner hasn't got a fit|pg||
nt|athene: better than e.g. @CK97432 which might indeed get really killed|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes the average junior look like an old age pensioner|pg||
nt|neobas: @H pitch looks scary|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but a pair who play strong twos aren't going to go in for any funny business like that!|pg||
nt|tomi2: but playing this way you are not able to show a hand with 5+clubs and 4 dias, incase partners fit is in @D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blum1956: a swing for Hackett this time probably|pg||
nt|stc: But, on the bidding, EW may have even 4@h to play|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: I think 1NT is the most descriptive bid,as it does not promise a @H stop|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: best way to find 3nt  is not caring about stoppers|pg||
nt|ady: looks like the defence wont be able to get 2 club tricks    the 4th diamond will be a discard|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: now south can play club but selway must duck|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: discard A@S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|haans: beginners do that all the time|pg||
nt|othered1: this can pick up imps v. 3N down more|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|garnetts: I totally agree as I would also bid it with xxx|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|athene: if you want to play "optimally", one of the hardest areas is choosing when 2nt should be lebensohl and when a scramble|pg||

nt|garnetts: Triumph for the weak notrump  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: phew  some welcome imps for the Hackett team |pg||
nt|roswolf: this has scope for slaughter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N has now a hand more like a weak 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: and second club away on that diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N should fail if bid as S hand is squeezed before W hand is....E never gets a chance to make a mistake by discarding a D|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I like    3 @d in first or 2nd seat      |pg||
nt|sharkey: looking closer at CR bidding I think East was to blame for not getting to slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting question Carl, if I was green VS red I'm not sure what I would open|pg||
nt|josj: oh yes...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|athene: here, i would say, east should have support for both minors almost all the time so you are probably better-off using it as lebensohl - you don't need to bid 2nt with 4@D5@C because ...|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C should be ok most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: just for remind you : 1 match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: well to be fair the weak NT didnt help earlier|pg||
nt|ady: e/w need to keep out of game|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s frigidaire?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C or 1@D opening on last hand in anatural system is strictly a matter of style|pg||
nt|stc: part score battle now|pg||
nt|athene: but just change the auction even slightly and you might argue that scrambling is better, so it need a lot of discussion|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: The Complete Book of Balasncing Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: SZ rapidly approaching a target of 10 imps per board to win.|pg||
nt|sybarra: demonstrating on last bd, the power of the part scores  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: and not actually a bad contract|pg||
nt|pelu: ok slam - but I dont exp that NS will come even close to bid slam|pg||
nt|athene: south might just respond 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cooke is the perfect partner for garvey he is a thoughtful disciplined highly intelligent player around whom Garvey can dance his dance of death|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe 4@d in that case|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps 3 NT may be an option...|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to play them all as scramble unless specifically agreed otherwise|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  5+ hearts  9+ hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|neobas: 3@H by South?|pg||
nt|neobas: Four, even!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps again here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: unassuming cue bid not game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this may lead to game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surprised Bakhshi didnt double to show those @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may likem his diamond fit|pg||
nt|reisig: no alert for 2@h?|pg||
nt|pelu: I would hate to open 1@D on the N-hand :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Garvey deals out quite a lot of death against anyone but the toughest opposition|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: minor  openings at 3 level  should  be some how constructive if partner has not passed|pg||
nt|sybarra: pusilanimous bid of 3,  |pg||
nt|capercliff: i like the 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @H also |pg||
nt|stc: Top french pairs a very conservative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: systematic requirements i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H - let them guess|pg||
nt|neobas: Well, I would too, so that's why I expected South to bid 3 :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: @h lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: and may be it makes too|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's like 20/20 cricket, run rate required per over almost 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the category of "oh good"........|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: too strong  is South for 3@h|pg||
nt|capercliff: no problem now I think, only a @h lead would give declarer problems|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it makes on a cross-ruff?|pg||
nt|sybarra: its close to making,  sometimes pard has some clubs to add to mine |pg||
nt|capercliff: i think 4@h is pretty standard|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - just use @HA first trick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: at last a penalty double bid as penalty taken as penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: transfer weak twos --interesting |pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
nt|pelu: I know it the system - but still :)|pg||
nt|athene: they play strong club, 5-card majors, multi 2@D, so 1@D is very loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s wants to be played by south asltho here as A@h is right doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I'm sorry, we have to restart this room|pg||
nt|stc: see N in CR passing 3@c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||
nt|lestergold: why show hearts when they have alre4ady located spade fit|pg||
nt|stc: in fact in both rooms|pg||
nt|tomi2: if you open 1@D and are in the same situation later and bid 2NT as "good bad" then north can preempt one level higher, then responder does not know if opener has a shapely hand ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: with both minors or @D only. seen that often enough|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: dont worry Nicky anyoje takes on vugraph is very brave|pg||
nt|neobas: Hmm, on second thought maybe not|pg||
nt|capercliff: that might not be good enough, because declarer will eventually have to go out to a @d|pg||
nt|stc: Quantin-Bompis open very light and as a consequence do not X part scores - same as Meckwell|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has a simple bid to show a good raise in spade4s|pg||
nt|henryb:  West is close to too strong for a 2N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this decision to open 2N here is going to lead to game and i dont think can make|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is a pro-am bid, in my eyes.  Partner has no idea of trick potential in @D contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I think 2N would be fine if the hand were different:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: Holland 3@C  for major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see the point of a transfer weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Francis Hinden made 4@H  well done to her|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Frances|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s deny a @h cue?|pg||
nt|pelu: Sorry - I was weong they are "close" now|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluckly west's hand is better than some 20 counts but has hit an unfortunate misfit minimum opposite|pg||
nt|sybarra: East decided to just raise in the known 8 card fit,  not looking for anything more than game |pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: doesnt it just give opps an extra bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gained 12 imps for her team on 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt venture into this auction with that pile of festering horse manure with a gun to my head|pg||
nt|capercliff: and a second trump comes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: specs want to undertsand teh system|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone explain it|pg||
nt|lestergold: heavily artificial of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 21H must show spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n support 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d cue i assum|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key is the nebulous 1D opening and the 2@h response|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think most of would would bid the same even with constructive raises |pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there a reason they opened 1 @S in both rooms? not 1 @H?|pg||
nt|josj: yes, higher from 5-5 |pg||
nt|stc: other type of pairs will be in 3 or even 4@h which may be in on a sunny day|pg||
nt|josj: no matter how many they go down...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Roland, but in 20/20 10 per over is eminently achievable - especially if an inform Gilchrist is batting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah by South  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n good support im toldthe rest is fairly starightforward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually 2N is OK if pd is a passed hand. but facing an unlimited partner you are just begging to miss a slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that question |pg||
pc|s2|nt|capercliff: now he can afford to go out to a @d and retain trump control|pg||
nt|neobas: Only a @H will set it now|pg||
nt|sybarra: testing  E now|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think it can be beat now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S asking for @H-control?|pg||
nt|henryb:  mainly unlucky that the diamond suit doesn't run|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the point I was dancing around|pg||
nt|lestergold: Holland too good in the majors to pass 2N|pg||
nt|neobas: Well done|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|sybarra: old fashioned forcing nt might have solved this problem ending in 2 @D's or so |pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately i think with Towsned's minimum 12 count and awful spade suit his 3@d bid which is effectivbely a game try was an overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case 3NT is the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@H|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe im wrong|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the  @d   duck was fatal should have  cross ruffed|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: here comes another sp |pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT would have been 5-11  NF|pg||
pc|d8|nt|garnetts: also you do not really need to ask for ther Q@H as you know North is not queen high for his actions |pg||
nt|garnetts: He is almost certain to have the ace |pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed very unlucky not an unreasonable bidding sequence|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe I am wrong as well :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: it was agood auction |pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: This can go 2 down of Shi finds the diamond shift|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: east needs to count here --North has played it very well so far |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i know, Ed, but i felt more like kick-boxing than dancing:)|pg||
nt|josj: 3@D should go down as well...if def. take their 4 tops and play @C from E|pg||
nt|neobas: Declarer trying to set up @Ds in hand rather than @Hs in dummy for a lack of entries to the long suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Not easy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: coujld easily be duplicated |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: N had to lose a diamond at some point, so put the defense to test fast |pg||
pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont think team mates will be compeltely happy with some of e/ws actio9ns here|pg||
nt|capercliff: a @d at trick 2 would have been much better, but not if W had the K and Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for help Bas |pg||
mb|1S|nt|capercliff: the J@d could have been the 10th trick|pg||
nt|neobas: I think with @DKQ West would've split anyway|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sybarra: looks like a "big club"  2 @C,   6clubs and can have 4 card major |pg||
nt|lestergold: this 1@c opener is obviousoly not strong club so what is it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps something Polish or romanesque|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D now?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: unless I am wrong - a fair chance- by crossruffing  declarer  makes on a coup en passant |pg||
nt|stc: a heavy weak two|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is on, tough for Crouch to raise|pg||

nt|ady: 3NT  likely spot e/w|pg||

nt|sybarra: will e/w get the ht suit in?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: You don't have a club loser|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they will like board 3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S undoubled in OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  apparently N-S are playing some sort of two or hree-way 11c|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think maybe Polish so im advised by someone who should know!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multiple hand types covered under 1C umbrella, sometimes strong sometimes ordinary|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think you're correct|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: no the ace?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That goes away on a diamond after you have cashed 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: double is the winning action|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/wwill get a plus score in any case|pg||
nt|neobas: Kib suggesting a trump promotion is trick 10 (4@S 3@C 1@D 1@H + the promotion)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @S spots save n/s in 4 @S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: NS dont play support doubles  ( one of my favourite conventions)|pg||

nt|lestergold: soctsman and swede playingh polish |pg||
nt|lestergold: a very cosmopolitan world|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in honor of Malinowski?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course Malinowski used to partner Sandqvist|pg||
nt|lestergold: got world silver medal together in teams in bejing|pg||
nt|othered1: East looks to  have transferred, t hen retransferred over progressive 2N rebid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2008 Sandqvist's greatest achievement and no mean achievement|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/walready overbaord|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Long Pause.....|pg||
nt|sharkey: Also makes same manner on @H lead I think|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is all double dummy, if W had the KQ of @d's declarers line is correct|pg||
nt|capercliff: not unreasonable as W opened 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to have the same 8 tricks,  can not see a 9th|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H is cold as is 5 @C if e/w take the push |pg||
nt|athene: a good example of the power of a double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: some care is needed to make 4@H here--there are potential problems |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H can be made with open cards|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mcarroll: penalty doubles seem to be like buses, none for hours, and then 2 together :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N making 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee break hand|pg||
nt|neobas: This looks to be -1, barring defensive errors|pg||
nt|sharkey: cross ruff denedent on @HK being with W only I think - regarless of @DKQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: *dependent|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, but if W has the KQ@d the location of the K@h is irrelevent|pg||
nt|capercliff: as W cannot attack trump|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - then you're betting on two cards being "right" instead of only one|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: though methods prevented NS from finding their fit -- in fact par is 110 NS -- EW have voluntarily gotten too high. surely S would have reopened with a double, though, had the EW ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bidding subsided in 2H. 100% clear that he would have in light of his reopening X on the earlier hand with far less|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unlikely gross overcookment by this experienced partnership|pg||
nt|sybarra: East saying "you pick it pard" |pg||
nt|athene: east is very limited so there's no way 4nt can be misunderstood  - if partner shows how many aces he has here, you send him to kindergarten|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: only 50 again  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to the ace, one round of hearts and three rounds of diamonds pitching the club loser|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: true spoken|pg||
nt|ady: as the cards lay can make 12 tricks on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim part score their way so nothing very eciting|pg||
nt|sybarra: this might be the easier of the 2 games to play |pg||
nt|tomi2: if partner has 0, 2 or 3 aces you still end in a decent spot :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  or 3NX making 3|pg||
nt|garnetts: good morning Henry |pg||
nt|blum1956: not on that particular board, Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi; just thought I'd throw in an easy one|pg||
nt|garnetts: cash AK's and cross ruff looks best to me |pg||
nt|ady: can make on a sort of cross ruff|pg||
nt|garnetts: that always lets South make her small trumps ---|pg||
nt|garnetts: might go off if somehting gets ruffed but not likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be 100 here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not be surprised if the Hacketts bid it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: probably 11 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lose @H & @D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: coffee, good idea|pg||
nt|lestergold: and ice cream i was just served by my bridge widow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E playing W for a 19 count with two heart honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone giving me advice that 5 @H is not cold,  given ht K off and repeated spade leads,  and you still have to untangle the club suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Do you have any time limit in this tournament? 20 boards and 2 hours?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: agree,  not easy |pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: North deservedly got his wings clipped next door|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting lead choice by N|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: here best play would be  a @c finesse at trick 2 and South p lays two round of trump then a @h is played from East  defense must be very careful Il would back declarer|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|garnetts: Made a marginal TOD and then raised freely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: A@D ruff a @D then draw  till end in defeat|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: he can shuffle his cards and chuck a rabndom one in the air and the contract wont make|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - NS needs to get @S into play|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: lucky the @SJ coming down|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i see on the board where towsend and bakshi missed 6@d gold and forrester with a similar barrage were allowed to play in 4@s off 2 undoubnled for a gain of 11 imps!!!|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @cK would not be a good choice|pg||
nt|henryb:  but not enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true though it would still be one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: an original K@c doesnt even let it thru|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: only 8 tricks on that|pg||
nt|neobas: Cashout for -1 now|pg||
nt|josj: with the @H ruff gone, 3@S will make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: yes 3@H bid was desperate in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: better fly this ace |pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  11 tricks look fairly easy: @cAK, spade ruff, @dAK, diamond ruff, black suit ruff, diamond ruff with the trump K|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  in some order|pg||
nt|lestergold: the play is uninteresting what is interesting is how thye managed to overbid their hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nice card by tosh to make high diamond discards easy for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: may see ak of @C cashed |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|c8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: obviously the 1N call has a widish range, esp. at these colours. still 3N was a lot for John to bid, having siad that, he was hoping that if the hand makes exactly nine tricks it ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt matter if they played hearts or NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  The only good thing about this result is that the other table is not unlikely to reach 3@h and go down there also|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard @dA and @dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear...if the auction starts 1D-P-3D, who knows where the carousel will stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: no pressure here surely can dsicard 2 spades anda club|pg||
nt|neobas: This match seems to be tight|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|blum1956: it could be 12 if East had the @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  five trumps in hand, two in dummy and AKAK|pg||
nt|blum1956: if Brunner plays a trump now she restricts herself to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not play a small @d as E?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes a time limit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure how long|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: needed to play @H earlier|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has done so|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can discard high Ds also, as the cards played on the first round of D made clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes no probs at all|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SA and @D|pg||
nt|capercliff: I have to run, tx all enjoy the rest of the match|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it is a bit surprising that W began her campaign with a spade from dummy. best chance for down one would seem to be winning first trick in hand and leading a club. N failure to ...|pg||

nt|sharkey: how do you play 6@S after a @H lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: just for reminded : 1 match = 2 segment of 13 boards with a break of 10 min|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we have somme pairs    who plays forcing Nt    now in France    Ew are in their early 40's   |pg||

nt|roswolf: any 18+ |pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you im puzzled by Senior's doubnle she certainly does not want a club lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dJ is a keycard|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 6 @c  better   nine trumps better than 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: "on a partly self funding basis"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 hours 50 mins is standard for a 20 board match with screen  (thanks Max)|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh no!|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this really the auction?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Claiming now|pg||
nt|lestergold: even my dog claimed 6 already|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: must be an austerity measure due to the credit crunch|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that doesnt seem fair|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction would make sense if 2D had a particular meaning. but the oeprator already said some bids were omitted|pg||
nt|lestergold: partnership of this calbre should get to the slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: David isn;t playing in this match, but we do get to hear about Mike's dog:):)|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least try to get there |pg||
nt|lestergold: David will tell you that our dog is the best bridge player in the family|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a very clever dog|pg||
nt|lestergold: our dog even has his own face book|pg||
nt|lestergold: and manyh firends|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to find a trial bid on N, perhaps 2nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: like the aunts' cat in "Adventures in Card Play" :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: felix tyhe dog|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is tosh who must surely recognise the slammish nature of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: touch and go|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: the NS cards fit together beautifully. Only 24 HCP of flat distribution but 4@h absolutely on top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that 1@H rebid by opener is any 20+ hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i gather they play a polish kind of club but i was told at the start they were playing std!!!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More economical|pg||
nt|roswolf: another argument for publishing cc's|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But I know that Michael Clark is away for a good while and he is the one who takes care of most of it|pg||
nt|pelu: would u X in N - spec when pd is a passed hand? - if pd bid @H u are in trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Gui-Yang bid that deal as many beginners would|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice lead. Declarer has to win, and now a @c switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: club switch tho and has to guess hearts mayve dangerous to duck rgua spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: now co tract in danger|pg||
nt|lestergold: discard on spade ace useless|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a blind spot I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Cameron must find the @H now|pg||
nt|lestergold: up with ace of spades and establish those dims quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: in these situations people hardly ever lead away fromn unsupported k its the most dangerous of qall leads|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|othered1: 6@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: that should stop the @C lead against 6N|pg||
nt|roswolf: a prelude to disaster|pg||
nt|neobas: This was the expected auction I guess|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|neobas: I know a couple of people who say: "When RHO opens 1@C overcall 1@S first and see what you have second" :)|pg||
nt|josj: you might make 12 tricks but slam is pretty high (as always...)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: you have to be rich to play bridge nowadays|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S unluckily puts the @CKQ on lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: a wheel has come off i think if spades were the agreed trump suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N bid 6 nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East is  Hallberg     South is   Garvey|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please enter the names, Nicky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: if your pard style is to make light off shape doubles and uj knwop pard won't punish you I think its  risk versus reqward ratio just about acceptable|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Well, it does take a club lead to defeat slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Stabbing at the 6-level isn't a pleasant exercise|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|pelu: no Hans - many beginners dont have 2@H as forcing or even invitation|pg||

nt|lestergold: he did well but did he do it for the right reason- we are not result merchants here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Georgia Ray|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for a Michaels/Ghestem by North?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: More INFO: zhoufly: hu is the sponsor of his team|pg||
nt|garnetts: symetrical stiff kings here--Culbertson would be pleased |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: This is an excellent slam but I think impossible to bid |pg||
nt|othered1: is double meaningful?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but slam seems to be far away from north's point of view|pg||
nt|roswolf: and this caters for the big bal hand option|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe he realised he had done the wrong thing earlier so tried to redress it|pg||
nt|ady: easy heart game for n/s|pg||
nt|sharkey: Normal 2/1 W can Pass 2@C thus I suspect 2@C was forcing - kibs say NF...|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|georgia19: hello everyone, I love watching Martin:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: referring to your dog Mike:)|pg||
nt|neobas: All green with a passed P I might|pg||
nt|josj: at pairs for sure|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 5NT: pick a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: pick a slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@H cue?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but south wont be interested|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: i must admit i prefer to ocercall a spade and apolgise for mixing up a club with my spades!|pg||
nt|neobas: W faced with either underbidding with 2@S or overbidding with 3@S if they don't have fancy gadgets|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: over the top     5 a problem|pg||
nt|othered1: Will west double 6@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: he should i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: lightner X  for lead something interesting pard |pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Find my void"|pg||
nt|sybarra: (your longest suit) |pg||
nt|lestergold: i think i prefe double by N with 4 good spades|pg||
nt|stc: Part score swing on 9, N opened a light 1@s and EW entered the auction to play 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on an entertainment basis Garvey ism probably the most watchable player on the planet|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @c    was NF     that is why I am in favour of 1 @c opening   east had not enough for 3@c rebid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam CR - 6@H|pg||
nt|neobas: I think Slam is on...|pg||
nt|sybarra: in slam have to smohter the 10 of @H's |pg||
nt|neobas: 2NT "two places to play" I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: on 10 the twins avoided the slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not giving that as option for W |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Liggins-Whittaker did|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok same difference:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT bid to protect @SK but he does not have enough tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N doesn't have a play I can see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but double followed bye @D might not be forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however should be headed for the club game either way|pg||
nt|lestergold: selway should downvalue with so much in clubs opposite the splinter|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you splinter with the South hand?|pg||
nt|ady: north not really interested in more than game with such good club values opposite a shortage|pg||
nt|neobas: Now correcting to 3@D to show @H+@D|pg||
nt|josj: might end up in 3@HX|pg||
nt|josj: exclusion BW|pg||
nt|stc: yes, a very useful convention|pg||
nt|stc: when partner understands it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Of course my dog howled when he heard the bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: dbl defeats me as a bid--4@D seems logical --but dbl?   |pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@C in response is odd too--might get passed so 4@D maybe  |pg||
nt|blum1956: again that antiLaw board - 22 total trumps but far less total tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfect hand for it|pg||
nt|neobas: Aggressive Double by West here in my opinion|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: straight off the chest|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: north bidding a grand -surely a surplus of imagination|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" (e/w) dont double when we got them where we want them |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it might have made when we get a week with two Fridays|pg||
nt|lestergold: landed right spot|pg||
nt|ady: 5 level would have been dangerous |pg||
nt|josj: another oops coming up, Constantin? :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Culbertson put forward a theory of symetrical distributions--where there was a shapely hand with a singleton likely to be another similar hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a month of sundays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SA is perhaps a little insulting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't doubled, but west clearly would have doubled 7@D.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of why not? shortening some one some where|pg||
nt|roswolf: why - when opps bid this way insults are deserved|pg||
nt|othered1: Only very slightly nsulting.  This hasn't exactly been a confident auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch has no defence against 7@D or 7NT so he can't double 7@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: the imp score wont be too different even if doubled!|pg||
nt|josj: no, he does...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: no oups|pg||
pc|hK|nt|neobas: East will surely Double this|pg||
nt|neobas: I stand corrected :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: must play @dA now otherwise 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N has to show his good 5-card @h before S can act|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not keen on the heart lead. to me best chance of beating 3S on this auction would be to lead a minor king, try to get an ace out of dummy before hearts are set up|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think we saw the actual auction wasa problem with it operator wise o think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E very likely to have 6 hearts on this auction, not something like Axxxx.|pg||
nt|neobas: Effective 4@S bid here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: pesky taht @H's break badl |pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: No basis in this mathmatically though |pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@c was challenging as opposite to 6|pg||
nt|neobas: Though it didn't help in the CR|pg||
nt|sybarra: or play it this way,  this will work also|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: depends if you are sure East is short in @h on the bidding    probable|pg||
nt|sybarra: *badly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: 4 or 5 imps, possibly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A quiet 2 down it seems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can hear the groan over here|pg||
nt|lestergold: selway of course has so much mnore han a minimum response that he felt he had to cue and erichsen back pedalled to warn selway that he was minimum for his splinter i think a good ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: must play a spade now |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: sees would have to drop K@D  and then end play east with ace king and another spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: got it all accross without getting above 4 level|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe East was afraid to give away the @H position, but since the 5-card suit is placed on his right that shouldn't really be a consideration|pg||
pc|hT|mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Tosh does not say a word|pg||
nt|roswolf: the hyenas will be laughing loudly|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 10 the other room got a bit too enthusiastic |pg||

nt|josj: this one should be very easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @H on for e/w here |pg||
mb|1D|nt|garnetts: I think most of us would have tried 6@C with the south hand |pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many @H from E?|pg||
nt|pelu: pl check the scorecard, Nicki|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Yes,  think wrong discard there|pg||
nt|sybarra: really had lots of options other than smothering 10 of @H  thx all |pg||
nt|sharkey: So Doussot have a sizeable lead|pg||
nt|josj: one can imagine, however...|pg||
nt|stc: cards are good for NS, they should make a + score here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj:  2 boards left|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i expected a double by N|pg||
nt|stc: yes, normal BW enough|pg||
nt|josj: too strong to overcall @H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: most?|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time West protects his @h AJ2 by not oprning a weak two|pg||
nt|ady: no weak 2 from Townsend|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 i guess|pg||
nt|neobas: Am I alone in wanting to Double 3@H with the East cards there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdb: Contract did go down|pg||
nt|georgia19: But Cooke returned a @h and gave him the last 3 tricks?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: At the vulnerability that does suprise me |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the west hand looks a normal weak 2|pg||
nt|blum1956: just to find the opponents in the hearts game|pg||
nt|ady: now juming in at the 3 level   seems odd|pg||
nt|yo_yo: double now?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I see they follow Meyer's line of opening 1@S with weak 5-5 hands|pg||
nt|neobas: Heya Constantin|pg||
nt|sybarra: then a short break and back for final 13 bds |pg||
nt|sybarra: right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: yes :) too strong you are|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: but you are some time left (30 minutes ...) |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Senior has the space tov stick 2@h in here at these colours|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|yo_yo: Michelle bids a Jacoby 2NT agreeing @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like an old rubber bridge moan to me--you were not good enough to bid two but you could bid three  :) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: John might get the @H wrong now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C or @H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 1 hes vulnerable 2 he only has 3 hearts and 3 he is minimum point count |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well the light opening bid as against a "weak " 2 may prove dividende here|pg||
nt|sybarra: my typical trump support for pard (E hand) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: tempting for osbourne to bid on but he did his work with the preempt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has N denied 4@H i wonder|pg||
nt|ady: can make 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the play-record here was wrong and N has 4 @Hs in the end|pg||
nt|georgia19: I guess, never mind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: confess i would open the W hand at these colours|pg||
mb|4C|an| |nt|lestergold: and second round double expresses his hand now very well|pg||
nt|georgia19: 2@d showing one major|pg||
nt|othered1: open with?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless playing 2H = 9-12 or the like|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: in this case   not an advantage  because 3 @c could be stronger|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: folks I got crunched for time,  so must leave.....see you all later or tomorrow as the case may be @H@H@H  |pg||
nt|josj: tomorrow is later too, cu :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Thank you Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S some kind of force|pg||
nt|sybarra: no 3 nt,  the club bid may get them to it |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Garvey has looked at the vulnerbaility and respected it for once but as it happens i think 2@s rolls in|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Palau worked that it showed distribution and not strength with the adverse bidding|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pelu: after a @S to K in CR decl play for the double-finess in @d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: cross ruffs galore  coming|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 4@H on east's hand here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ady: 5 lekely to go down for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: Holland judged well to take what they can|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: 2 places to play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT is that "choose your minor"?|pg||
nt|lestergold: first round double abnd south would have easily gone overboard in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: good lead|pg||
mb|6H|nt|garnetts: has no other option here |pg||
nt|yo_yo: gtg now, bye everyone  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks Mike/Ralf|pg||
nt|yo_yo: David |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@h is makeable on a @s lead and a lucky @hKx in front|pg||
nt|othered1: double by south is one of the stranger bids I"ve seen|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, yes, but he has to be thinking there is something odd about the W auction, since she passed as dealer and does not have 4 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like 3@h on west's hand here|pg||
nt|josj: they have been playing quite fast, as the 13th board will come up after just 1hr. 10 min. of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in my opinion it is merely maximum for 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry N dbl|pg||
nt|othered1: Without complicated methods, 3@H looks OK to me.  If  you play weak jump shifts by passed  hand, 2@H may do.  But you have to keep major focus on @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is simply not a 3 level bid whenever partner has no heart fit likely to get into trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: as here and with a vengeance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you dont bid 3H on this hand, what passed hand WOULD bid it? it is already a borderline opener as it is|pg||
nt|othered1: And isn't 4@H a reasonable spot, whatdo you think is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: West checking system card|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its not so much that north denied 4 hearts that he didnt promise 4@h a first round doubole would have either promised 4@h or a very stgrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Brunner's pass was clearly forcing. Should she not have doubled herself?|pg||
nt|tomi2: would like to know the meanings of the bids|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: not sure about the 3 @S,  I am sure it involves the answer as to 3 nt, vs 4 @C etc |pg||
nt|tomi2: one spec suggests: 3@S asking for @S control|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: i think most double on that North hand and it doesnt promise 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: nice cheap trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: down 3   |pg||
nt|lestergold: a downside of tyhe artificial 2@d bid as 2@s would have bought the contract|pg||
nt|josj: 1nt by EW will duly give NS their + score|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like at least one heart loser prob 2 likely club loser and dim loser not a great contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: Now the @S switch required|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: one more "H please|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: better cash a club now |pg||
nt|sybarra: 11 imps for Crouch as the stopped in 3 nt on bd 11|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: strange to open 1Nt and then bid 2@H over a Multi by S|pg||
nt|lestergold: i expected it first its fave vulnerbaiklity and second Gravey is known to bid without much provocation|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey never paid hi trainfare to solihull to pass|pg||
nt|georgia19: alter that quick or it'll stick:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think Garvey has more than one pass card in his bidding box|pg||
nt|sybarra: another says,  3 @S asking for shortness (in spades) |pg||
nt|sybarra: folks these folks have system notes that number in the hundreds of pages |pg||
nt|sybarra: so they (usually) know what they are doing |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: He rarely has his bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: i wonder what 2D by W would have meant. could hardly be GF by passed hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: that is against a normal layout i mean|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|sharkey: Had to cash @CA first|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: I still cannot see the logic of failing to bid 2@S and then bidding 3@S on a queen high suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 21 imps lead  entering last hand of first half for Doussot Delfour are the title holders|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|othered1: Why, without looking at the actual hand, are 2@C losers likely?  don't your finesses ever win?|pg||
nt|neobas: Ah|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: if spades break normally there is no diamond loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: actuaolly rarely in my case Ed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would want to be in this game at IMPs. even NV|pg||
nt|lestergold: it doesnt change my view taht i would not bid 3@h with the west hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so what hand WOULD bid 3H as a PH?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least the JH to impriove th trick taking security of the heart suit for example|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I've done wrong discard by W |pg||
nt|othered1: At what point does your suggested hand become an opening, or at least a weak 2 or multi?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK but then it for sure is not a PH anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: will keep going...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: np Nicky:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: and flat|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: almost :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
mc|12|nt|marlowepi: even as it is, E had to be wondering what W could have for her sequence -- a one-suiter with enough to invite in that suit, but no opening or preempt despite not having four spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Q is normal, hoping for Jx, very unlikely on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe a 7th card in a suit otherwise like this, if they have standards for preempts that like either better suits to open or few outside controls.|pg||

mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|lestergold: i borrow a point and protect|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry not quite grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Laure,  great job |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: another possible slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: really?|pg||
nt|lestergold: biut 6 on ice|pg||
nt|georgia19: I think they'll get there, hopefully ony to 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think may pairs would bid 6 on these cards|pg||
nt|pelu: the last slam gave - as exp - 11 IMPs to Small|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a very ciommon british disease this love of the wak no  trump|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: the spades are very dodgy|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess west can justify 2@H because of the stiff @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c from W?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh overcall not so clear but not likely to get nailed even when it could, and may disrupt EW just enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i wouldnt play it with gun to my head but very widespread in uk|pg||
nt|josj: ty Laure and cu later, this afternoon|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: It looks as if Twonsend thinks this shows a hand that would have made a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play the double as penalty of a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could be in difficulty here if e/w keep doubling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play it shows @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a slam below par obviously when you must play that suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: :) ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx fellow commentators for you time |pg||
nt|josj: ty Constantin|pg||
nt|stc: bye|pg||
nt|josj: ty all kibz. :)|pg||
nt|josj: for watching us; we hope you enjoyed it|pg||
nt|josj: as I expected: a routine 3nt and a routine -1 (or more...)|pg||
nt|stc: many points but no play ! 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is out of reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if east can double showing values  west will surely pass|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is quite a lucky result in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: are we into relays?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like (again)|pg||
nt|lestergold: extra values but even 5@s is alittle precarious|pg||
nt|georgia19: got that wrong then|pg||
nt|lestergold: but above 12.855 Roland|pg||
nt|georgia19: Garvey not interested over weak NT|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup, well done Laure :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: I prefer the agreement that x is pens after a weak notrump and a suit after a strong/medium notrump |pg||
nt|yo_yo: oooops   true,  no agreement :)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s of the hook|pg||
nt|georgia19: Steve taking over, now you might get some intelligent comments from here....|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: bye    EW make 3@c|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Shirley, for your wit as well :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d  just forcing showing 5 @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back very shortly after comparison |pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: Small has a sign off now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small's diamond suit does not like like slam, material|pg||
nt|othered1: It looks like natural @C opening there motivated west to push with such a good fit for @C|pg||
nt|neobas: And to the kibs for keeping us alert and providing us with extra insights :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6:10 am Los Angeles, 9:10 am New York, 15.10 Paris, 2:10 pm London, 11:10 pm Sydney|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: Garvey is wild about getting into auctions early but doens rotuinely overbid in these situations|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pelu: where did N find that X???|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR|pg||
nt|blum1956: Against weak NT it is better to play "diamonds or strong, starting from a strong NT"|pg||
nt|josj: the 2nd segment of 13 boards shoujld start in about 20 mins. at 19.00 hrs. local|pg||
nt|stc: NS could take the first 8 tricks !!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: thank you everybody, i hope i will see you in 20 minutes ... for the 2ND segement of this match|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: Some decided to dbl 3NT next door--someone should have redoubled |pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks look a lot|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: This is truely poor bridge from EW--|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's not better about either, just depends which hand comes along|pg||
nt|ady: might well make on the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however I would have expected a pair of such quality as townsend Bakhshi to have discussed this one|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well time to put brakes on as cards lie 11 tricks ok |pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think the brakes are going on|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: I believe the technical term is Desperation Double :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Not sure I understand this auction|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW 3 NT CR|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Au revoir Laure :)|pg||
nt|stc: it will be seven|pg||
nt|josj: à demain, Laure :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the resul : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Laure, Constantin, Jos and Shirley :)|pg||
nt|neobas: And of course the kibs :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not forcing after east's initial pass 3@c would be forcing otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: i hope i will see you in few minues for the2nd segment off this match|pg||
nt|neobas: 3NT is down on a @S lead it seems|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stc: even 4@h may make (loosing 2@hs and 1@d)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well kin'sare on|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: Here east may get squeezed in the minors for 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h bid by the darimng Malinowski who probably adds on three points for his own card play|pg||
nt|lestergold: which im afraid isa  more reliable method of hand evaluation than some|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny, but if you play support doubles, allowing east to distinguish between 3 and 4-card support, you'll likely stay out.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|georgia19: or not!|pg||
nt|georgia19: hi all|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: it should be incumbent upon players wanting to represent their country to have sorted this out |pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are a newish partnership|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H favourable this should make|pg||
nt|blum1956: the strongest part of the weak NT - you make the opponents not to know their HCP's. They often land in 22-23 HCP 3NT. Still you nead to beat that.|pg||
nt|brgpro: E might think he needs W to have A109 bare...so he might play a small @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: hihihi|pg||
mc|7|nt|lestergold: King's were on but Small is still plunging headlong there|pg||
nt|lestergold: very un disciplined in my view|pg||
nt|tomi2: actually I doubt that Frech pairs have 100+ pages of system, they seem to play quite "natural" French style, I seldom see lots of artifical auftions that are mentioned in system ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: books|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @C might have been easier |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: thank you everybody see you in few minutes for the 2nd segment|pg||
nt|brgpro: hard to be there...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: (25 minutes ..)|pg||
nt|sybarra: see in less than half an hour |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Laure great job as always |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: bye bye bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: Thank shirley . thank too ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: thank all ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: have a drink and come back :)|pg||

mb|3D|mb|d|nt|mgchat: X en Nord|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mgchat: belle main avec 3@h|pg||
nt|mgchat: ca pourrait faire un gros coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzqk: joli 5@c , bien joué de la part de Roussel d'ouvrir d'1@c cette main sur cette donne|pg||
nt|mgchat: 13|pg||
nt|chmitty: Nord devrait dire 5 sans doute ... le singleton @d est à peu près clair et Sud a dit librement 1@h|pg||
nt|chmitty: d'un autre côté, Sud n'a pas dit 5 lui-même|pg||
nt|chmitty: En tout cas la discipline impose de ne pas dire 4@h|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzqk: un coup de 13 en + et une avance de 23 à la mi tps, bj|pg||
