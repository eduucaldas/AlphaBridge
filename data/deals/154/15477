nt|lestergold: hi Linda|pg||
nt|lestergold: chances to make |pg||
nt|lml: hi mike|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to finese clubs a couple of times|pg||
nt|lml: but it requires some guesses|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||

nt|lestergold: wel that may not be beyon him|pg||
nt|lml: well I suppose he doesnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: double finesse pretty good odds |pg||
nt|lestergold: altho needs break as well|pg||
nt|lml: but in practical terms he should finesse|pg||
nt|lml: when you are in an aggressive game you need a little help|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is aggressive but likely to be bid at this level|pg||
nt|lestergold: vul games have to be bid if they are sniffed|pg||

nt|lestergold: misere it seems to me|pg||
nt|lml: yes . I think it was the wrong play single dummy|pg||

mb|2H|nt|lml: and things have been working so badly so far|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a lot of percentage in 'saving' at these colours but i agree irt sometimes pushed them overboard|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: 6@h is cold double dummy at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: actuakkly single dummy as there is only one reqasonable line and it makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a very poor slam|pg||
nt|lml: can that score really be right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: absolutely buizarre that bidding in closed|pg||
nt|lml: they had some kind of convention confusion if its right|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: playing a poor slam in game is forgiveable playinbg it in a partscore is incredible|pg||

nt|lestergold: well they are committed|pg||
nt|lml: what is 5@S asking for?|pg||
nt|lestergold: it means that n.s will have words to say to their team mates|pg||
nt|lml: Greco doesnt need that much for the grand and obviously it is a try|pg||
nt|lestergold: to be fair west has a hand in which slam looks like on a finesse at worst|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|lml: oh for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: actually it needs two Ks favourably placed and both are!|pg||
nt|lml: I was just trying to understand ... maybe it is conventional|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well it looks like a grand slam try Linda|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: its a try but maybe it means something specific.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a grand is conceivable altho very unlikely with est's hand|pg||
nt|lml: 5NT perhaps denies anything else|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: well Linda the arithmetic here is pretty horrific|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 imps into the deficit|pg||
nt|lml: this lead is quite helpful|pg||
nt|lestergold: solves one problem suit|pg||
nt|lml: after that there really is only one way to play the hand|pg||
nt|lml: and it works|pg||
nt|lml: you try the top clubs and then take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: will draw trumps see iof the q@c drops doubnleton adn ten fall back on spade finesse|pg||

nt|lestergold: a palooka would have made it only an unlucky epert could have gone off|pg||
