nt|blum1956: not easy to stay short of high level|pg||

nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||

nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|lml: it could be made if declarer tried to set up hearts and used all entries to do so|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|stc: yes, no reason to finesse in NT and not much play in 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mamos: monster hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is a RR match in the Rosenblum Cup (open world champs)|pg||
nt|lml: good morning from Canada|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: sorry specs we do appear to have tech problems here|pg||

nt|Jacki: Herve is on his way to this match folks, he'll get it fixed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: herve's speaking  I will catch up bidding and play here|pg||
nt|mamos: and from England|pg||
nt|gulyas: also from Hungary|pg||
nt|mamos: yes this is Group F  (of 16)|pg||
nt|blum1956: weak NT?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
mb|2C|an|?|mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
mb|2N|an|?|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no 5 card suit in S, but 3S|pg||
nt|petepunt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: or 11, depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|blum1956: both 3NT and 4@s easy |pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: only one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: and even then...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vicky888:  difficult to go down, and Jitubhai is the Master :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: he might misguess diamonds to avoid the south hand I suppose|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: in a way its the sort of result  both sides can feel quite pleased with  -- no big minus score|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: or was .....  commentators curse|pg||
nt|gulyas: knowing S has 6@Hs, among others, makes it less likely he has @DQxx as well|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: wow I think that a@C was unwise after 5@C|pg||
nt|mamos: but ery difficult looking at two Clubs and six Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: specs talk to me :)|pg||
nt|mamos: at least let me know you are breathing - wierd talking to myself|pg||
nt|petepunt: presume pepsi is the polish player ?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|stc: BIG POINT NOW|pg||
nt|blum1956: This must go down as opposite to the 5@c but South has to find the diamond switch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is tough|pg||
nt|blum1956: I bet he will|pg||
nt|blum1956: East MUST have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Punch asked range 12 to 14explained|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sure, the logic seems ironclad...double dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: Q@D looks right yes|pg||
nt|stc: at MP much more tough, here he has to try @d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Jxxx @H, @DA is not impossible|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2NT and then 3NT by West - ton a kind of Jxxx bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a kind|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: no, true|pg||

nt|petepunt: thx all and well done to the scotts lady|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thinking again|pg||
nt|stc: they may cash up to 6 tricks|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now the defence is safe|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: double dummy, declarer could take 12 tricks, more likely to be satisfied with 10|pg||
nt|mamos: I stand corrected it is of course the USBF  not the ACBL who are the responsible body|pg||
nt|mamos: these two teams have fought a hard battle and are both still favourites to start the Round of 64|pg||
nt|mamos: and thanks for the help from you specs   keepng us right :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: one off  or two off or even three off|pg||
