nt|lestergold: actually i think 4@s probably 2 off in practice|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes only one entry to dummy spads need 2 lerads from dummy unless oppos lead trumps|pg||
nt|athene: well, that doesn't matter|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence just play club, club|pg||
nt|athene: east rises ace on the first trump, puts partner in, and gets a club ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: what amtters is will Malimnowski give himself the fourth hear/|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: hes not shy at the best of times|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: and being 16 imops down against the leading team is not the best of times|pg||
nt|athene: in theory he shouldn't? - if 3@D was saying "should we bid 4@H?" then he should respect east's decision|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: oh well i was wrong but passing is of course sound |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: of course Bill|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one off in 4@H next door - played by East on a club lead.   |pg||
nt|lestergold: but Malinowski is a very aggressive player |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where is your 10th trick in 4@H on a trump lead for example?|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is difficult to play because you are very scared of a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so you would like to pull trumps but then you run short of tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Three rounds of trumps and a club exit - defence took two diamonds and then East took the spade finesse  |pg||
nt|lestergold: you are scare but you have no  choice |pg||

nt|athene: it might all come down to the diamond spots|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room the defence attacked diamonds vigorously so declarer got an easy club pitch on dummy's fourth diamond|pg||
nt|athene: so lost just two spades, heart, diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h is presumably a mini-splinter|pg||
nt|athene: the problem for the defence is, if they don't attack diamonds at all, declarer can simply duck a club and run the clubs to throw his diamonds away|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H might be a 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|athene: that's a fairly common treatment|pg||
nt|athene: erichsen has a sixth spade but otherwise not a particularly offensively-oriented hand|pg||

nt|athene: west doesn't pass for penalties with poor diamond spots, and with a vulnerable game in sight|pg||
nt|lestergold: does she push for the vul game often right to do so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd that a jump overcall of a strong NT should be undiscussed|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: not now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Malinowski was not up to playing the Q becuase then he had a chanc to avoid a trump loser|pg||
nt|athene: north's lead options were heart and spade, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: the truimp lead made the otion of the double spade finesse against south a good option|pg||
nt|athene: declarer knows things aren't good here|pg||
nt|athene: north would be much more likely to lead a diamond without the ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: was the trump loser unavoidable in any case?|pg||
nt|athene: and it's asking a lot for @CKJ to be onside|pg||
nt|athene: yes there is always a trump loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: it may be a push for the reasons ive already given|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|athene: a kibitzer says that passing the double looks normal and indeed would be very much the right thing to do here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry all, some friends have dropped in. Going to have to disappear. Sorry about that |pg||
nt|lestergold: North is bond to come in tyhe bidding and then e/w will are more or less forced to bid game|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a sure 300 or 500 that's better than a borderline vul game which might be 620 or -100 (or worse sometimes)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if there was no imnterruption east probably passes an opening 15-17 no trump|pg||
nt|athene: and your safe "small" penalty here might be 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: wehn spade is taken up and u have to guess u tend to bid the vul game in teams|pg||
nt|lestergold: space i meant|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but the point is, your opps know that, so they take more liberties with their 3@D bids at these colours|pg||
nt|athene: which tends to balance that out|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but this 3@d wsnt a linerty he had an excellent hand for the action|pg||
nt|athene: the other factor worth a mention is that most people play some cunning defence to 1nt which stops them bidding 2@D naturally|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@D might be a hand which would have preferred to bid 2@D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|d2|pc|h9|pg||

nt|athene: there is a school of thought that says 1@D overcall should be either a good suit or a good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not at all certain that I want a diamond lead with that hand|pg||
nt|athene: some say it should always be a good hand actually and you bid 2@D with just a good suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: uncharecteristicly indisciplined bid by Erichsen who is normally a very disciplined player|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: N/S having a break, then back to board 5!|pg||
nt|athene: without the @S9, declarer would have had a harder decision whether to hook the heart|pg||
