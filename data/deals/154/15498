nt|lml: The Rayner team are all friends from Canada so it will be interesting to see how they meet this challenge|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|lml: All of these players have done very well over the years in Canadian team trials|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|oliverc: yes, horrible|pg||

nt|bobh1: sementa is not done|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: E did well to resist the temptation to o/c 2@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: surprised to see this|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well Sementa has to figure that his partner couldn't even bid 2@D in the first place|pg||
nt|lml: and he only gave preference.  He can't have anything|pg||

mb|4S|nt|panosk: true but how can u ask partner if he stops the rest suits to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: here with partner a passed hand the pre-empt has appeal|pg||
mb|p!|nt|oliverc: unbelievable|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: same auction in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: sementa is rather distributional for a negative double|pg||
nt|lml: With a vulnerable game it is hard for South to resist although you might say he already bid his hand|pg||

nt|lml: bidding the same hand twice is likely to get you in trouble.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: The good news is that he is not doubled, the bad news is he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: asking about leads and carding, but I cant hear the other side of the screen|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: i guess he will make only 3 the way he's playing it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: Lauria could have doubled.  Doubling games is not as risky and can be quite profitable|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mcphee: to have any shot of reaching 3N it seems you just need to try 2@D or 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|panosk: is S hand a clear opener?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: not for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think biddable|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has a huge hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner opened the bidding and then raised his suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sementa thought he should have worked it, I think. but I do not speak Italian.|pg||
nt|lml: if you following along this match is in GROUP C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|lml: Shenkin is not happy his partner passed his jump shift|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcphee: i am very much against opening marginal minor suited hands|pg||
nt|bobh1: and then accepted his game try|pg||
nt|lml: I never do that no matter how bad my hand.  I am too little to take the abuse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: I like cue bidding when I accept with the South hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: but perhaps should have cue-bid @cs instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|lml: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is probably kickback?|pg||
nt|lml: south has a very good hand for the auction so far|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|oliverc: swing here|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard to out bid the majors holding minors|pg||
nt|lml: can north count 13 tricks using Blackwood?  Probably not|pg||
nt|lml: he needs some more information... the stiff spade is key|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|lml: well then again just bidding it works|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt even take him back to diamonds his first suit.  This is very naughty because Shenkin does always have even four clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are playing way to fast for me to keep up.  Shenkin not happy about pard passing forceing bid.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|bobh1: he probably heard what you said about two pairs out of two missing it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|oliverc: much better|pg||
nt|panosk: he cant make 7 here though|pg||
nt|lml: Suit showed five spades and four hearts nicely|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|lml: I think this will work out okay though.  north south dont have all that much|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: North should make this.  He is going to guess spades on the auction|pg||
nt|lml: and East has no entries|pg||
nt|lml: he really can't make it without spades, he may as well go for it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: well now we have only 1 other pair bidding the grand and four missing it|pg||

nt|lml: he played spades at trick two|pg||
nt|lml: or three or whatever|pg||
mb|p|nt|itsgrim: another possible swing in for croatia here.  4 spades looks biddable and like it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last bord, next round 15:45|pg||
nt|lml: you see if you were playing this at your club everybody would have been that 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: west passed?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: here duboin thinks his hand is too good for a weak jump shift even after his partner passed|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: surely 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Thanks everyone. I have to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: cheers Oliver|pg||
nt|itsgrim: not sure what no-trump range north-south are playing, but i presume not 15-17u otherwise that's a very aggressive piece of upgrading|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think 2@S would be fine but I dont mind 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they play drury|pg||
pc|s7|nt|itsgrim: but it seems to have excited north, so maybe it was|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzsk: looks like we have winner, congrat Slovakia|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzsv: 3\5 leads|pg||
nt|bobh1: not that S would necessarily sit for 3N but i think N should have bid it|pg||
nt|lml: with the diamonds playing so nicely and hearts with no losers I think 4@H is fine|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobh1: turns out that 4@h is a better contract|pg||
nt|lml: a spade is a good lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|itsgrim: 4 spades by south presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: 1 NT =14-16|pg||
nt|itsgrim: looks like an easy make, losing 1 diamond and 2 hearts.  or +1 if south discards a heart on clubs and guesses the hearts successfully|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: yes it is|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|an|18 19 ballanced|nt|vugraphzsv: 15 to 17|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|?|mb|p|nt|bobh1: 4@h was down in the other room|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: without a diamond play from East on the previous board Sementa tried the double diamond hook and went down|pg||
nt|lml: the key play was the return by east when in on the spade ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lml: this hand does play well|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|oliverc: well the @H position means this will not play too bad, but it remains to be seen|pg||
nt|oliverc: whether it's a good result|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians play a space-age version of stayman apparently|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know what 2@D is sorry.  Let me find a convention card|pg||
mb|3S|an|5H 6D|mb|p|nt|oliverc: J@H a nice shot|pg||
nt|panosk: as cards ly same to finess or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: disagree|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry me too|pg||
nt|panosk: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D was 18019 BAL|pg||
nt|lml: no five card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2D i have, the 2S is a picture bid with 3 options. the 3S clarifies the option.  As far as I can tell,. |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: well guessed by McAvoy though|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: sorry I am told it was ferraro not sementa who played 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S sementa was asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Lorenzo showed 5+H and 4+D GF|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: I do have the WBF convention card open now|pg||
nt|lml: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|lml: this is actually a decent slam|pg||
nt|lml: all you need to do is bring home the hearts missing five to the jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it is my dylexia|pg||
nt|bobh1: needed a @d lead here|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lml: Lauria will try|pg||
nt|lml: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are not on the same page then. 6D was written|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: would like to know more about their auction to see if that would be reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: shenkin asked about key cards, V answered 3|pg||
nt|lml: the convention card suggest hearts and diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am going with your version, but I can see the hands :)|pg||
nt|lml: well they have got to the right spot and even if they confused the opponents it doesnt affect the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: pointed out N is on lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|lml: their methods made it easy to find the slam |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: so now Versace has to make it|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is now completely cold|pg||

nt|hedyg: for running scores: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|lml: he is trying not to just pull trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: shenkin shaking his head as he put the 3D down on the table. |pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what is in his head|pg||
nt|lml: Versace not Shenkin|pg||
nt|lml: Shenkin is shaking his head about previous boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no south led the 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|lml: and since Auken has lost imps on every board except one you can see why|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: I think a diamond lead would be tough|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobh1: this was not inspired defense|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: brb .. need a bathroom break|pg||
nt|bobh1: held to 2 at the other table|pg||
nt|bobh1: on the same lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: so some imps will go in the italian direction|pg||
mc|12|nt|lml: yes I know he is thinking about trump reduction but playing the @HK first instead of second seems better to me|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes we can see what Lauria was concerned about- entries to the established heart suit in 3N|pg||

nt|lml: This tournament is being played in Philadelphia USA|pg||

mb|2H|nt|hedyg: (1 lead too many )|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: let me look at the auction|pg||

nt|lml: 4@s|pg||

mb|2N|nt|bobh1: oh i c|pg||
nt|lml: if the bidding is accurate East pysched a club cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: there seems to have been a lead-director|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: so West had to lead a club really|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: sementa did not think of that|pg||
nt|lml: well north south may as well be there|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzsv: same lead though|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace not inventing anything here, just leading his longest suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: so the 3@c is a bit surprising|pg||
nt|lml: with Shenkin as declarer and given this deal is complex it will take away|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has been pretty quick so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as 3 and 5th leads|pg||
nt|lml: yes amazing|pg||
nt|lml: but this time I think it will be slower|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: he could duck this club seems right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might lead @d thinking pd cannot have soemthing like KQJ in @c to make it a good lead|pg||
nt|lml: we will see (eventually)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: so Bob what do you think?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: he found the @c lead without the lead-director|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lml: Lauria doesnt really have a clear club count|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3/5 could be from 873|pg||
nt|lml: anyway as the spades lie I am pretty confident this hand will be made|pg||

nt|phil: now he might get self-squoze on the clubs, but can still get it right|pg||

nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: now he needs to guess Zmud's pattern|pg||
nt|phil: which is really tough since Adam discarded an early sapde from 4 and not a heart from 6|pg||
nt|phil: as a matter of fact, a coke says he goes down|pg||

mb|2D|nt|lml: the score is now 25 VP for Rayner and only 3 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this Flannery?|pg||
nt|lml: do you like the weak 2 with four cards in the other major|pg||
nt|lml: and in second chair|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3H|an|fit for 1 major|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: not when the other major is this good|pg||
nt|lml: no it was a weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: pretty sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: well way too strong for a multi imo|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: now some people dont like bidding 1NT in that position as natural but I think it is just fine myself|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT as 15-17 bal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|lml: Van Cleeff was one of the authors of a book called the Mysterious Multi|pg||
nt|lml: apparently someone says they shows both majors 6-11.  He doesnt have that either really|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as multi.  |pg||
nt|lml: now if it show 6/4|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty April!|pg||
nt|lml: yes I thought it was that... he loves multi and Mudienberg 2's which came up earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: your welcome. |pg||
nt|lml: April is the best|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobh1: i prefer sandwich but most good players agree with you|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: well the lecture I had was it was too dangerous but on the other hand people bid on such air these days ///|pg||
nt|bobh1: when both of the opps have bid, if feel like a sitting duck bidding 1N with this hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: that she is!|pg||
nt|lml: we have a new leader|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: you all are awesome too!!!  |pg||
nt|lml: Auken has taken the lead|pg||
nt|lml: on the previous board they played in partscore and not 4@S at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: they had pretty well an identical auction except ..|pg||
nt|lml: here South accepted an invitation and in the OR declined|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: I dont think you have to bid 1NT on every bad 15 count but this is a big 17 |pg||
nt|lml: it was a think game true|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobh1: i'm not suggesting to pass|pg||
nt|lml: north south do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|bobh1: but even if you do, 1@h is forcing so you will have another chance|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: but you are vulnerable ... here RED means GO|pg||
nt|lml: I never though of that before|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 5@C encouraging|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: they need to take their club trick .. yep|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: I saw a match yesterday where one side was preempted out of the auction when they had 26 HCP|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|c2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lml: I see 8 tricks the ninth is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: might have tried for Kx in @s in E and a @s/@d squeeze on W?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: And you all thought watching the Phillies was exciting :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: yes that could work if the cards were different|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|lml: the @H9 is a big card|pg||
nt|lml: the throw-in does not work|pg||
nt|bobh1: not if they pitch correctly|pg||
nt|lml: East throws a club now and west will be in on hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thinking very hard about what to pitch|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see what other chance he might have|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|phil: of course, life would be much less stressful if he would have played the @s earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it would have been a dull board, no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: heh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now we got all the excitement in the endgame|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: 2@H is not game-forcing but 3@D is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: so Jon can safely bid 3@H|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a much better contract|pg||
nt|bg: If N can find a dia not good for Auken|pg||
nt|phil: 3N is a problem on a diamond lead since it removes the entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you raise hearts or bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace accepted hearts by cue-bidding 4@C!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|phil: well this causes no pain|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A little lucky as 4@H is significantly superior|pg||
nt|phil: still an awkward hand to play|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|phil: if you hook clubs right away and it loses, forget about a 2nd heart trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 5 mins left on the clock I am told|pg||
nt|bg: needs club K onside so just cotinue hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: And they have one more after this|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|phil: no time to duck a spade - else 3@d + 1@s + 1@h, so I agree you need the @cK on|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bobh1: an anemic overcall|pg||
nt|bobh1: trading on the colors i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Linda :) i love it and guess it shows..also fun with you!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bobh1: so this is a stolen bid situation|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes even good pairs play "stolen bid"|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lml: in the other room East (Baxter) didnt defend quite as well as Sementa.  he failed to keep an exit card|pg||
nt|lml: the British Lions are first in the E division|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT by W on a 9@d lead in OR last bd|pg||
nt|lml: I mention this because Paul Gipson blogs and he has been giving me a hard time about ignoing him|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: it is quite unexpected|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bobh1: S might have explored 3N as an alternate spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I hope he does well... I have my favorites|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: i guess he can make this too|pg||
nt|hedyg: dpnt we all?|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont*|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: about the last board specs have been pointing out that they acution was different in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: West didn't have a chance to support hearts and it made it hard for East to unblock|pg||
nt|lml: yes the LIONS have a bye this match but that is only 11.5 VP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H fixing trump, 4@c cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: VanCleeff comercial.  Check out www.bridgetopics.com |pg||
nt|hedyg: 11.5 is an usual score for a bye, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Lauria requested a restroom break...  id offer to fill in but...  :)|pg||
nt|lml: yes but some people suggested the LIONS were helped by it... don't really think so|pg||

nt|bobh1: zia calls it "last board-itis"|pg||
nt|lml: but the second last board is usually safe from my brain dead nature|pg||
nt|lml: and all entrants get a gift certificate.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Auken pulling away|pg||
nt|kittyc: full disclosure I work for BridgeWinners - they also have the swan games running scores embedded in|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am only saying that because Luise was asking me too... sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphzsv: N now sorry if there is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: Duboin illustrates the theory that the purpose of bidding is to figure out what not to lea|pg||
nt|bobh1: d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I like 1@S|pg||
nt|lml: if you are opening a four card major might as well make it the good one|pg||
nt|kittyc: also most play that 2H over 2C Drury for spades is nonforcing with 4Hs so you get to right fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: see there is an apolgy when you expect to make it|pg||
