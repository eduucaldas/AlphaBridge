nt|Walddk2: I think we are off|pg||
nt|petergill: the Daily Bulletins are at http://worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Bulletins.htm - the most recent one is  5 (Wednesday)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT by North has better chances than 4@S by North|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|petergill: If not playing Strong Club, 1@S - 2@S - 3NT - Pass is not totally impossible as a NS auction|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C strong, 1@D negative|pg||
nt|athene: you could make 4@S by setting up the hearts (three trump entries to the south hand_|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: Peter Weichsel's partner Mark Feldman plays quite slowly, usually|pg||
nt|athene: fortunately he will be able to exercise his cautious approach as dummy, this hand :)|pg||
nt|athene: so we won't be held up any longer|pg||
nt|athene: he might try 3@S here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S might well get a heart lead|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks like 1@C was strong, 1@S was 4+ spades, 1NT was about 4-7 points I guess |pg||
nt|athene: it looks the safest option from that east hand, leading into a strong club|pg||
nt|petergill: 6322's often play well in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem is, north has shown 16+ hcp and 6 spades - can he find any extras?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he has lots of aces - they are nice|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: With nice tenaces in North's doubletons for East to lead up to|pg||

nt|petergill: West took East's non vul bid seriously, but 2@H (--> 3@C by South) would have pushed EW to 3@d anyway|pg||

nt|athene: because even if one suit runs that's not enough tricks for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and if both suits run you can make a high-level suit contract anyway|pg||
nt|athene: for notrumps you want balanced hands or single-suiters|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|4H|nt|petergill: Lebel won the first heart because he did not think hearts were 6-2 - I think Weichsel would have found the club switch if Trick 1 was ducked |pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|athene: i would have thought double then 4@S shows about what he has|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so passing over 5@H was a better description|pg||
nt|petergill: Mark Feldman judged well |pg||
nt|athene: maybe he felt that passing 5@H showed less defence - maybe another spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Now Feldman taking a break|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: I think Pass of 5@h would not have been forcing, and North did have 3 aces plus a well placed @DAQ, so Dbl of 5@h was normal|pg||

mc|11|nt|athene: the main issue over the X of 5@H is that you don't want it to dissuade south from bidding 5@S - you want it to just show extras, not a definite desire to defend|pg||

pc|c2|nt|athene: west has a lot of nice cards facing an extreme major 2-suiter but a force on east would be annoying here|pg||
nt|athene: whenever you have a big 2-suiter your main worry is trump control|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But @SK compensates|pg||
nt|athene: still the club lead has given him a tempo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has the rest on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: 12 tricks easily now even on a diamond force and 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|athene: well he can set up the spades|pg||
nt|athene: only 11 on a crossruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: I'll take them|pg||
nt|athene: now his only concern is a very bad spade break i think|pg||
nt|athene: for example you could just win this, @SK, @CK, spade ruff high, draw trumps, and even if spades are 4-2 you just give up a spade and you still have a trump left |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 24: The 8 imp gain for 5S +450 was due to Nik Demirev's diabolically brilliant 5@h bid (immediately over 4@H) at the other table - which scared North out of the auction - an ...|pg||
nt|petergill: advance save before 4@s was bid by North - Nik could tell that North lacked @h's so must have a strong spade one suiter so he shoved 5@h in before 4@s was bid - well done |pg||
nt|petergill: Advance thinking like that is the hallmark of a true expert|pg||
nt|athene: yes, bidding just 4@H doesn't usually inconvenience an opponent with a spade suit and a backbone|pg||
nt|athene: but if you bid FIVE hearts, they stop with their 4@S bid half-way out the box, and then pause and look annoyed|pg||

nt|petergill: hand|pg||
nt|athene: still the cards lie badly for EW; it's hard to see how they would go positive under their own steam even without the overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: even if they stopped in a spade or club partscore they would be down on diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: South's overcall was a very poor bid, lucky to survive. |pg||
nt|athene: south has 16 beans if you just count beans, but it's not a strong club|pg||
nt|petergill: He downgraded the bare queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a 3@H raise now presumably|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, I assume 2NT says the same|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT can be some sort of good raise - in Precision|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2nt can have lots of clever meanings in a strong club system as you can't have a real 2nt bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: some play it as a 3@D rebid with three spades|pg||
nt|petergill: with 3 hearts, you mean |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|petergill: Thanks Gary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good news for declarer here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|athene: yes sorry 1@D - 1M; 2NT = good diamonds and 3 of M|pg||
nt|petergill: North will, after due study of the hand, duck @DQ|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DA singleton, hearts 3-2, and tou can't go wrong in spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzta: Feldman taking another break|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's main concern is that drawing three rounds of trumps leaves him without many trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He usually does that when bidding and playing :)|pg||
nt|petergill: @CA, club ruff, but entries to North hand are in short supply|pg||
nt|athene: but he hasn't got any option with the diamond ruff looming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mark Feldman is known as a slow player|pg||
nt|athene: when you have this sort of hand (4-4 fit, ruffing value, no long side suit) you often would prefer to crossruff and never touch trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 can be set up as the 10th trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Almost in the same league as a certain Peter Gill|pg||
nt|athene: but here it's a bit of a worry to have @DQ led through the king if west has a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that is the best line surely, only 2 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can he make it if West has 3 hearts? Everyone knows that @DA was stiff|pg||
nt|petergill: I think - best is - 3 rounds of trump ending up in NORTH hand - then low @D from North - is that too double dummy?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not only as the beer card as we see now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: He kept @HQ as an entry for the @D finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good night Peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores in all groups|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: i would have expected a double of 1@H rather than the overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weichsel decided against with only three spades|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he was intending to double if 2@H came round to him, showing this sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: now he must have game interest|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you like to be in 5@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing about that contract is that it can make|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: i would like to be in 4@S if partner has five, or 5@C if partner has five of those|pg||
nt|athene: and maybe in 4@S if partner has four of those|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With all cards exposed you can even make slam in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: now south has a maximum passed hand and shouldn't really pass|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: 6@C would be a terrible slam, some may call it a Roland slam I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C, however, is not that bad|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: when the diamond finesse fails declarer will be disappointed but perhaps not that surprised - you can't trust opening bids these days the way you could once!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Definitely not in 3rd, NV|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: another tricky hand with no obvious trick source and only a 4-4 fit - just like 4@H a moment ago|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: He needs a bit of luck now and will find it|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: as usual in this sort of contract, the main issue is the timing of drawing trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|c9|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|athene: and as usual declarer delays that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is much happier now|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now his side suits have behaved themselves he will try the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With clubs 3-2 he is home, so he is thinking about what he can do if they are 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: on a 3-2 trump break you could just bash out @CAK then run diamonds and crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking about 4-1 trumps, yes|pg||
nt|athene: probably thinking "i hope trumps aren't 4-1"|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason for taking a trump finesse on this sort of hand is that there might be Qxxx onside - if you cash AK and someone has Qx left that's very awkward|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: but double would work better here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me a little bit too strong for only 3@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s also without @hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: disagree|pg||
nt|lml: in the other room they bid only 2@H with the east hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: but Dbl on 2@h so why not on 3@s?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: the problem with double over 3@H is it suggests less than 4 spades at least to me|pg||
nt|lml: over 2@H you probably will have a chance to show spades later|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: and what do you do if partner bids 4@D|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: thats one of the problems of doubling over 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: almost a LAW hand :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2C|nt|athene: south pushes it a bit to double there|pg||
nt|athene: most strong clubbers play that as roughly takeout-ish, with about 5-7 points|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|athene: i guess he has about a five count with all those nice tens and things|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but add four 10's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And a very nice 'body'|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: i get the feeling this auction will end in 4@H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: hrmpff|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That will yield 300, so 4@H was the right bid after all|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: this is one advantage of bidding game - opps tend to sacrifice|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may even go for 500 because declarer needs clubs to be 3-1 if 4@H was to have a chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So he may finesse|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: but he might say, ok, i will play for clubs 2-2 because if they are 3-1 i am onto a winner anyway (4@H making)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: depends whether you want to go for a really good board or just minimize the damage if it's a bad board|pg||
nt|athene: ah, a spec points out he might just count north's HCP and decide he has the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: now that south has turned up with the @DK, it's not too hard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's unfair|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|athene: another spectator points out that north needs the @CQ for his 1@C, and south needs it, for his 5-7 hcp double|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
