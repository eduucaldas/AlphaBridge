mb|1S|nt|phil: good grab Kev; was hunting for it myself|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: looks like ew can make a lot of spades|pg||
nt|kfay: here 2@c by Zmudzinski is GF unless he rebids 3@c... which may have been his plan but 2@s does improve his hand somewhat.  although 3 small hearts is a very bad holding|pg||
nt|lml: its not all that bad to hold hearts partner often is short.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|phil: North will not go quietly with her 6-6|pg||
nt|lml: Balicki is at the top of his range here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: yes diamonds is a great save at this vul|pg||
mb|4H|nt|phil: at any level|pg||
nt|kfay: North had the opportunity to bid 2NT at her first turn to show the red suits, presumably, but this sequence must show even more in the red suits.|pg||
nt|phil: but I would think South is leading a heart always which allows 13 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: good point|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps some doubt in her mind about 2N; don't know|pg||
nt|lml: Balicki can push with a powerhouse given the limited nature of his hand|pg||
nt|phil: South has to engage now - partner is bidding like crazy in a strong auction|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5S|nt|lml: I think north has said his piece myself|pg||
nt|kfay: Probably pretty difficult for West to envision slam is on when he has no aces.  And East, with @dxx, won't be guessing at slam either.|pg||
nt|lml: he has bid v vs nv to the 4 level|pg||
nt|phil: 6@s is not cold - a lightner double should get the club lead|pg||
nt|kfay: 6@s can't be made, of course, because there's a @c ruff available|pg||
nt|phil: beat ya|pg||
nt|lml: how about 6@C|pg||
nt|phil: North is from San Diego, CA - which partially explains the team name that looks like a Ham radio ID|pg||
nt|lml: but they are more likely to end in spades|pg||
nt|lml: is 3PDX1 the postal code?|pg||
nt|phil: yes 6@c appears to be icy|pg||
nt|phil: not in the States :)|pg||
nt|kfay: A radio ID would seem appropriate since cell phones aren't allowed.|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|kfay: har har|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|lml: well they are now in the right slam if they end there|pg||
nt|lml: South has to know that North was thinking of bidding|pg||
nt|phil: the thing about hands like North's is that 6@d might be a good save against a game, much less a slam - even vul|pg||
nt|lml: the save in the CR was so good that they made it when the defense failed to take the right winners|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: pretty hard to let 6@d in|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: you have to figure out what black card to cash if you lead a trump|pg||
nt|lml: on the go|pg||
nt|phil: which is a good reason not to lead a trump in the first place|pg||
nt|kfay: I wonder what the agreements are for E/W here.  This must be a forcing pass situation, in which case I think East's pass is a little odd with no diamond control.|pg||
nt|phil: they led the @c, ruffed, won the @hA and tried to cash the 2nd club, and away went four spades|pg||
mb|6S|nt|phil: x? |pg||
nt|lml: now is a double clearly lead directing?|pg||
nt|lml: the vulnerable side is this clearly a save?|pg||
nt|phil: the club ruff should be easy to work out after the 6@c call|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|7C|nt|lml: that is a good point Phil|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: still need to lead right! |pg||
nt|lml: he can make it if they lead a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Pottenger and Balicki were writing notes during this slow auction.|pg||
nt|lml: whatver happens with the result in the CR this is a win|pg||
nt|lml: down 1 is 16 imps or so|pg||

nt|kfay: Hopefully they can just put it behind them (especially West, the parther :))|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|lml: I wonder if you can get to the slam|pg||
nt|phil: I wonder if the jump to 3N implied 15-17 (it would for me)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I agree that if North starts with 3@D instead of 3NT they have a shot |pg||

nt|kfay: The computer is really at it today.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|kfay: 1@c is the polish variety.  either a weak NT, or a big hand, or strong(ish) with @cs|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@c is a limited natural opening, so when they open 1@c and later show that they hold real clubs, it shows about 16+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|strong clubs|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lml: well the missed the slam in the other room .  I think they will get there here|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: why wouldnt you raise hearts with the S hand? |pg||
mb|4C|mb|4D|nt|lml: I suppose you could go for a number with such a flat hand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kfay: U.S. players playing against the polish club for the first time sometimes get a little stressed out, in my experience.  I just treat it as a normal @c opener for defensive ...|pg||
nt|kfay: purposes.  When you think about it it's not too different from a SA 1@c, which is basically @c or 12-14 balanced or 18-19 balanced, often bid on 2@c for many partnerships|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|phil: If North is allowed to make a NV/NV preempt with that trash, you are correct Linda|pg||

nt|lml: well it is pretty trashy isnt it?|pg||
nt|phil: the auction is out of sync but It does not matter|pg||
nt|kfay: I think there is another problem with the auction here. East bid 4@d and West 4@h... etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Balicki is deep in thought|pg||
nt|lml: I think he has a lot of stuff for this auction|pg||
nt|lml: bidding a grand is a big commitment.  I have found that the opps often miss slam as here and the grand buys little|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|phil: he knows about 16+, very long clubs, and a heart cue - but he might be worried about bad club splits|pg||

nt|lml: well done to get to 6 which is the right spot|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|phil: I ran the numbers once - if you think they are 50-50 to not bid 6, you need about 85% or so for the grand to be right, since you gain very little imp-wise over 6|pg||
