nt|jtr: Here it is more understandable|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ady: could have done well to pass the double   |pg||
nt|lml: wonder what put East off the penalty?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: well she has to lead something at trick 1 and any suit could give a trick away from her point of view|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|jtr: Hi Dike|pg||
nt|athene: notice modern competitive style - double is takeout even though partner bid notrumps, and east doesn't leave in the double with only a fairly threadbare 4-card holding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: odd way to play @ss for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: 2@HX would in fact have been fairly profitable i think|pg||
nt|jtr: Gets a monkey if he does|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David, you know I have the bragging right after our match the other day|pg||
nt|athene: but experts tend not to double 2 of a major at imps unless they can see two down pretty much guaranteed|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s6|nt|ady: on a spade lead declarer must only draw one trump though  drawing twice  will go down   so not clear cut|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe 3@h asked " have you got much defence against 4@h?" and 4@s said "no!"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, since he must ruff a diamond for his 10th trick the play is automatic|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4@h cant be defeated here even with a trump lead|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|athene: 3@H asking for a stopper i guess but north thinks it's michaels|pg||

nt|jtr: Some work to do here  until the @cQ coms down maybe|pg||

nt|athene: hand|pg||
nt|athene: in general, you should not be too eager to penalty double opps below the level of your own fit|pg||

pc|sT|nt|athene: whether to try to scramble tricks on a crossruff and give up trump control altogether|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|reisig: RIGHT|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@C - 1@D; 2NT on a balanced 19 suggests E-W are playing very old-fashioned precision with 13-15 nt opener|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Spades well placed, clubs are not, 10 tricks|pg||

pc|h5|nt|jtr: Hemlock this time i think|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|sharynr: hoping his partner had 4@H and that the tap was right|pg||
nt|reisig: Dcl ...did bid 4N ..right?|pg||
nt|jtr: If partner has Axxx@hs then he can force later|pg||
nt|jtr: And it makes the @d single more likely anyway|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|reisig: not "more likely" ...100%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he can't be 0625|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: i think its a normal game to bid a little against the odds as u say due tio duplication but makes today|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|jtr: There we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: and corrected, hence the sequence|pg||

nt|jtr: The play will be quicker than the lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: NS playing 5 card majors and 12/14 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: there was a critical play where north had to decide to ruff high or medium|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Thor Hoftaniska from Norway originally, another Scandinavian top player in London|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What would you do, guys?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT likely to be made n/s     5@D  down on a spade lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: Sorry, intermittent signal....ignore pauses :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jallerton: Yes, that makes sense Roland if bids are natural.|pg||
nt|lml: 5C from south probably makes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: But 3NT is the right place|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||

nt|sharynr: hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: or indeed Principia mathematica|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: when you open one of these bids and catch opps with so many in your suit neither can double, you need partner to have a really bad hand so opps do have a game on|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|rmb1: X is either T/O or "transfer" to S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rob Sheehan, one of the England all greats|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: NS playing weak NT 4 card majors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jtr: Yes, Doctor Sheehan as he prefers to be know|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Good save if this is passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 22-24 followed by comparsions from the other table when we circle back to board 13|pg||
nt|jtr: Have 5 trumps just bid 4 and let them work it out is a good motto|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: EW playing 5 card majors, strong NT (i think), short club|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: then the only problem is they might end up playing in your suit with a 5-0 break anyway at the other table|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: and in 2nd position the odds are against that which is why second position openers hsould be generally sound|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, if you play the system then you have a perfectly acceptable 2nd position opening|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision to use stayman, from north|pg||
nt|lestergold: are we sure that it was stayman?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: well it looks as though south thought it was|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sharynr: does anyone think that Sheehan should bid 4@S? or is that a bit much?|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow he might even make it now|pg||
nt|jtr: Too much IMO|pg||
nt|athene: north prepared to play the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|jtr: But maybe it was just a weak 2 judging by West's pass?|pg||
nt|athene: and if south bid 2@D denying a major he might have been going to look for 5minor|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: Cant partner have Jxxx@hs?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what do you bid with norths hand? kind of hand where 3n could be off with slam on in a minor|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharynr: super fit, but I think opposite a passed hand, it is a bit much|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jtr: I suppose East will cover the @d10 ok|pg||
nt|athene: i would bid 3@H showing both minors and short hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jtr: It is usual to have some methods to show North's hand|pg||
nt|athene: partner can always offer spades over that if he wants|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jtr: I do something similar but after 2NT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|athene: it just depends what flavour biscuits you have in your 1nt response biscuit barrel|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2@c seems a complety on tilt bid to me|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jtr: lol|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: using stayman suggests NS don't have any very exotic biscuits available|pg||
nt|lestergold: or a seriously stale biscuit|pg||
