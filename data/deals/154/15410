nt|blewah: this is the last round of team match|pg||
nt|haans: Points to Fantoni|pg||
nt|ady: sort of pushed to game|pg||
nt|bobholl: good signaling in @H may put them 1 down|pg||

nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all GL ant|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a slam missed, 3N misunderstood|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo pls|pg||

nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|riccho:  the@h are VERY open|pg||

nt|kastan88: hi all again|pg||
nt|sybarra: is is for recording the play |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead to break|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia is never afraid|pg||
nt|mamos: either one down or the whole lot?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double is the correct approach, 2@c would describe less|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over t/o x 1@s still fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but personally i expected 2@d by Boye|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for North was easy pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still wld pull to at least slam|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, mistake in bidding, now on trick 5|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this rates to make 8 or 9 tricks, depending on guesswork|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Mike Hi Steve|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning all   we have had a small problem here on Board 1 but hope to bring you the result shortly|pg||
nt|haans: Mackwell compare score with which European pair?|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers= "does 2@S show extras", answer= yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: heya Bob and Liliek, welkum aboard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: TV|pg||
nt|mcphee: 450 and no one wins this board|pg||
nt|westjava: so,the law now on this table,Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probalbly normal contract here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makes also 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: well not doubled     but Europe might win this one|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@s isnt everyones choice I would guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has brought a box of tissues to the table, blows his nose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because she knows 17 at hand, 12-13 at opener, and say 6-7 at east, so South 0-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Resume in 12 mins. Sorry lost play on 7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N off balanced, only points out values|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: US players sitting other way round - will change display shortly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: Point a board|pg||
nt|haans: Meckstroth started with good tactical bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: peculiar there wasnt a transfer first time. The tactics of point-a-board?|pg||
nt|mamos: aggressive start from Justin|pg||
nt|mamos: ahh  I see transfer|pg||

nt|haans: view as  played as BAM |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: are we correct here, operator?|pg||
nt|haans: Operator Playing against which piars (compare with?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: pls ignore profile|pg||
nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Liliek:)   welcome|pg||
nt|blewah: hi pak Liliek|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to make 5@d a complete guess because of two way @c finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then 5 minor/s good save|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: dummy may be a disappointment to declarer|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: good|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: the normal 4@H (down a million)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: where NS make game with their 18HCP :)|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S seems ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 5 losers off two, in case @cK pinned off one, without double still good while 4@h fine|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Among the soundtracks she has done are Forrest Gump, Good Will Hunting and the last five Woody Allen movies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW carding is UDCA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@h required|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes it was the board slam missed at both tables|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|haans: better lead than a diamond|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven tricks seems likely though|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant:)|pg||
nt|westjava: tourney website : http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|sybarra: Europe won the morning session 8-4. Aggregate score in the Buffett Cup: Europe 56 - USA 64|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D lead is hard to find :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: All my posts about the event provided by Roland Wald, VG coordinator on BBO. Thanks so much.|pg||
nt|riccho:  hello again !|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly making i think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or 0-3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems there's a problem abt captaincy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sQ also hard to locate|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: For Europe, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected Sabine Auken & Daniela von Arnim, Germany, Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness, Norway, Giorgio ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Duboin & Antonio Sementa, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes, Italy, and Jason & Justin Hackett, England.|pg||
nt|stc: should play small|pg||
nt|udo: can v.Arnim duck this ?|pg||
nt|stc: sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so all big and real professionals, anyways our operator Russell going very well, congratulations|pg||
nt|udo: was2 @H alerted,,( both majors) ?|pg||
nt|stc: with KJ N have take the finesse the 1st time|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: W thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|haans: rare to bid 5m if 3nt possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin studies this trick in depth|pg||
nt|ady: e/w would have comfortably won the board in the very safe game of 5@D    part score only in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: nine now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|rado: declarer will try to restrict losses since even 1 trick may score a win|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: UDCA for NS|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: will he be able to keep it to down 2 only? or the inevetable down 3....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that means entry problems in case 2@c allowed to play|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|blewah: the americans plays 2/1, while the germans strong club, 4 card major with canape possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the individual each team has to use a single system, even when playing in practised partnerships. |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we have "std. american" and "std. european" |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: although both are a 2/1GF system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would lead to play at hand and concede all picture cards to opps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: may end with just +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: connection down in other room will have to restart this one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: surprisingly @hQ falls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so 7 more winners at W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok |pg||
nt|h_karluk: US lost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably K now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|udo: good defence,,another @H now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe 1; US :0|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jan_jansma: down 4 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't know about all the @C in S so ?!|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems "we" play on |pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: @DT finesse and +1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far off four?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed.. and on a combined 17 HCP-count noboady would come any nera 5@D, 8 crd fit|pg||
nt|ady: hi   was in open room   but needed here    4@H  in OR    might make as cards lay|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rado: still endplay position after cashing all @C and @H|pg||
nt|mamos: or back to eleven|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nothing in the play|pg||
nt|bobholl: have to discard properly to let it make exactly but they will i guess|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: this will be a quick one down|pg||

nt|westjava: the battle of the year 2010!|pg||
nt|jeanhari: though Auken is trying|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H now lets it make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: forcing defence (@s lead and early ruff) another deterrent factor|pg||
nt|kastan88: must be good for Europe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice hook, 1N bid helped|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: steve may hook now|pg||

nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Geoff disagreed abt Klinger's 100 winning tips|pg||

nt|h_karluk: there Ron described overcall principles|pg||

nt|blewah: though @cq is dropped|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h x if all pass wld b an interesting scenario|pg||
nt|haans: Convention Cards: http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H 2@C(drury 2@H i predict|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad @D for 2nt|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|ady: may be a heart guess for 10 or 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: J of @H is a very fine card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good raise by Auken, but maybe 2@H would have won it too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant say somebody decides to start directly 41h|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be a negative double we would all make |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
nt|blewah: for 9 tricks if @s led|pg||
nt|sybarra: but Sabine Auken is quite agressive |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins play very aggressive 4 card majors  with 1NT 14-16 so open 1M on hands like this routinely|pg||
nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||
nt|stc: looks like a win for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey Ant, gl there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back, you'll watch Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde for Europe and Jill Levin & Jill Meyers for USA, www.buffettcup.com|pg||
nt|jeanhari: close call here, as would be the play in 4@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i have no sympathy to 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: K@D lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: >|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The convention cards have been slightly modified I believe, but I don't know where sadly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: even 10 points counts as a win so Justin trying for the NT bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3rd and 5th leads|pg||
nt|westjava: you know every thing,Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a nice slam @s there|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi jackson|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit 4@h|pg||
nt|ady: not certain to make 10 tricks in hearts    depends how club suit is handled|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "did you pass Gerber?" :)|pg||
nt|haans: small spade?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c more descritive than 2@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *descriptive|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think 1@H-3@C is inv with clubs though|pg||
nt|sybarra: and she as safe spot in @D's |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days your pard bids spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: the indy format is interestign |pg||
nt|sybarra: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compares. |pg||
nt|sybarra: That player will always be in the same seat at the corresponding table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: will put board 7 in later|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have opted for no-trumps in this scoring method   might have come unsuck on a club lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely would have|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa - "I might have passed a splinter"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe dbl over 4@s wld lead to 4@s disaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i read 3N-3 on myscreen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: OR Jeff and Eric lucky, they are regular partners|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 4+fit and some defense:)|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d maybe forced|pg||
nt|westjava: East will support, of course|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT for north south no problem|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|mcphee: I did not think a @C would be led after the splinter|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: they make all the tricks on the normal @DK lead|pg||
nt|haans: would have tried @DK lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no heart guess now |pg||
nt|blewah: this is a sequence of invitational @h supp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ant, i hope our boss did not read your words abt a convention:)|pg||
nt|ady: dont think europe will get anything from this hand |pg||
nt|mamos: NS only have on loser |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|westjava: I think East shd take an extra action|pg||
nt|westjava: might be 3@H better|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks better |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
nt|westjava: so do I|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't be staying bidding NT but 3NT is best manche|pg||
nt|sybarra2: difficult for you Ant, |pg||
mb|4N|nt|oliverc: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|stc: the good choice to play on @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: good he didn't lead the T of @C|pg||
nt|mamos: the cards mostly lie well for EW   probably made game if they had bid it |pg||
nt|mamos: one|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 12 tricks isn't easy|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everything on the right spot here, the fate of contract depends trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: might be keeping low because of the scoring I guess|pg||
nt|westjava: West down grade her stiff @DK|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh just as bad :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff sluff|pg||
mb|5S|nt|h_karluk: double dummy AK winning line|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard layout|pg||
nt|h_karluk: limitted enries to table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *entries|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Justin against Weinstein|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a difficult game to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Sabine Auken sometimes visits USA, a nice lady from my unit 160, district 7 <Miss Joyce Hampton> hires her for top events and they win&scratch in teams|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C denies @S control?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: then 5@D now? (@S control)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it shows a mixed @h raise and very nice help to opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I swear my P key is having an off day :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kiwi_joker: Am told 2@C is a mixed raise, 3 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S2 out of the hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: Sabine not comfortable with 3 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice one easily would employ a losing hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: DOUBLE and get the point|pg||
nt|haans: or support spades later|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even 1N is available by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: NS was vul|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have started very well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so hard to say a tie or anyone would win the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: giorgio helped|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|oliverc: No problems from here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: x not a must|pg||
nt|sybarra: just wants to give you a problem Ant |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: Fantoni Nunes in 3@C at the paired table   so Bob Hamman need to make to win the board|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer will attempt eleimination here|pg||
nt|jacksond: sememta/duboin have stopped in 4s in other room so this wiil be a swing |pg||
nt|jeanhari: tempting to balance with 2NT with north hand over 2@H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rado: DBL may give room for NS to find better place|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this puzzles me 100%. OK I am lost....|pg||
nt|rado: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably wld ruff at tb, @c pitch at hand wld better|pg||
nt|bobholl: this won't be good for europe most players will open E hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an endplay to North available|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jan_jansma: OK, 6@D was a try for 6NT|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 or 7 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: restricted choice in @C and no rpoblem|pg||
nt|bobholl: still searching for 12th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: Brogeland is in 6@S in OR  |pg||
nt|mamos: sorry it was  NUnes  Boye was South|pg||
nt|mamos: and made|pg||
nt|kastan88: in all matches, Europeans bid 6@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: good for europe (and tension in the matches)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Rodwell scratches his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: fans and refans his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has leaned back on his chair, one arm draped over it|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nunes did a nice hold-up with @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: I still only count 8|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi!|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry all esp shirley  business phonecall |pg||
nt|sybarra: enplayed at trick 2 |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Richard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Levin, wants to lead a @D but is likely pickling pards @D trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: Ant, is Bobby in a trance?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: well I guess not:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortness might be your partner's winner, why not to lead it before declarer dumps somewhere|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @c lead was best|pg||
nt|ady: would have had to duck if K@D led|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jan_jansma: with no clue|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: he will just bang down @HAK|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (slowly)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, much thought at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: may try the spade up now?|pg||
nt|westjava: or now a @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Closed room are in 3@H, so all a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play @H to the ace and a club up also |pg||
nt|westjava: she still count Levin's hand|pg||
nt|blewah: @h has to guess but @s will likely give in to N from the bid|pg||
nt|blewah: and if n continues, will create trump problem|pg||
nt|westjava: make decision, a @H drop or finesse |pg||
nt|blewah: yes, that would be my prediction too for W|pg||
nt|westjava: dont touch your @S, Arya:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is likely certain where the K of @H is,  question is layout |pg||
nt|h_karluk: forgot to cash @dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: BAM is Super MP Best pairs (team) close to always win :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes after @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considering @D8|pg||
nt|blewah: so Eur in this tm has won the match regardless what will happen to the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  93 EUR 81 ****   Europe ahead in all 3 matches Now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: blocked his way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but this way North positionally squeezed|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will be back with the @D |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or @S I mean|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|udo: 10 tricks now,,,,,good score|pg||
nt|haans: S will not pass this time but why start with 2nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt was certainly higher risk  but was successful in OR|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: close to sqz tempo|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: 11 or 12 tricks   no difference here|pg||
nt|ady: 660 wins the board|pg||

nt|udo: :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: so far Europe near to win it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: hi all|pg||

pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: yet we dont know|pg||
nt|jacksond: a swing but to who is yet to be determined|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say Jill levin solved her @hJ problem then the picture changes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far this deal is a potential candidate to the bulletin|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most probably with the title of "innocent appearance"|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: claim "If two diamonds cash"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: Jill found th way +1, presumably a win to US|pg||
pc|sT|nt|riccho:  In my opinion the E Hand is only an opener in a limited system. |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe 2 - US 0|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not a good start|pg||
pc|c5|nt|oliverc: -2 now|pg||
