nt|phil: and a big misfit for EW to start things off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here we go with the freaks|pg||
nt|phil: I would guess 5@d which probably depends on the lead or a trump suit guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt makes, everything else looks doubtful|pg||
nt|phil: 3N looks very dicey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safety finesse the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good evening Phil , Martin specs and all|pg||
nt|phil: why is that so safe - 6 tricks might not be enough? |pg||
nt|phil: hi Mike|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no but two for sure is not|pg||
nt|lestergold: why should anyone play in a 22 combined misfit 3N?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: canadians love 3nt :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well here is thepudding we wait for proof|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: not forcing i assume?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if it was not forcing thnen east should pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2/1 game force|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is one of those bizarre bids that no one truly understands until the post mortem|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but don is more interested in slam it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not a good advert for 2/1 this hand altho i play it myself|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fabsayc: to me is not a suit, would have bid 3c on my second turn|pg||
nt|phil: to me - 3@h does not show 4 since East rebid 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: its logically a stopper for 3N, or a hand that likes diamonds, but you can also play it as 'asking' in hearts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|phil: I guess N didn;t understand what 4@c was either|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: this helps but probably still down|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|phil: not my choice, but it helps get the spade continuation|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|phil: trump now|pg||
nt|lestergold: well may get the @d right because of the double of club bid|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you have to take first round finesse, probably too tough|pg||

nt|daman: gypsy|pg||
nt|bobh1: often 3N is the best place to go even lacking hcps|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|sybarra: back in Philadelphia |pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if 3 @D was trying to get out?|pg||

nt|bobh1: here it makes with only 22|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobh1: the @d suit is a source of tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: they are wise to play this in the cheapest suit game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: the occasional hand that makes 3N on fortunate lie of cards does make 3N a good bet :)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|c2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: yes, most hands like these should be passed as cheaply as possible, as soon as the massive misfit is known|pg||
nt|bobh1: the defense needed to stop the timely entries to dummy|pg||
nt|bobh1: very difficult|pg||
nt|bobh1: they had to lead @ds|pg||
