nt|mrt2000: as you observed, it's a 50% slam|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: there is a talk of conceding the match|pg||
nt|mrt2000: also, S overbid his hand a tad I think|pg||
nt|mcphee: not many boards remaining then|pg||
nt|mcphee: how many to go Asit?|pg||

nt|sunit: the only advantage of losing is you get to the bar faster than your opponents|pg||
nt|rv: 45 IMPs in 8 deals is not impossible though very difficult, equivalent to more than 2 runs per ball in a cricket match|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: here there is no bar .....10 mins walk..|pg||

nt|rv: is match over Mahesh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: waiting ..will keep u posted in 5 mins|pg||
nt|sunit: at least they dont bar you from going to the BAR|pg||
nt|sunit: i think they will concede, 45 imps in 8 is impossible, more or less|pg||
nt|rv: yes especially since I don't believe SS Jain thought they will win the match right from the outset|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: they are palying|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: playing|pg||
nt|rv: Manyawar does have psychological edge against most opponents in West Zone|pg||
nt|sunit: even if they started thinking they had a good shot at it, 8 boards is too less for a 45imp recovery|pg||
nt|sunit: true, i am one of them, rv|pg||
