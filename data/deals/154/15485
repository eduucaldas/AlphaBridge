nt|capercliff: ah by West|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|capercliff: noone at the table has the requirments for 1@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe 1@c-1@s-2N-3N?|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes Bawb:)|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|bobh1: perhaps S should have stuck with @hs?|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 8@H lead looks like it hurt n/s|pg||
nt|bobh1: S needs to play the @h Q next|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2nd from poor suits I guess which is kind of normal|pg||
nt|mcphee: right but the position is hard to read for feldman|pg||
nt|bobh1: he can see that is dummy's entry|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bobh1: at worst it could be a merrimac coup|pg||
nt|mcphee: and can also see he might give up a trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: still has a chance now however|pg||
nt|capercliff: these are good times for playing 4th best from 5 card suits|pg||
nt|capercliff: regardless of whether it is from an honor|pg||
nt|mcphee: it sure is on this hand:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 8 is kind of a strange lead from that holding|pg||
nt|capercliff: from 4 you play 2nd best and from 5 4th best, not sure how common that is|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would thing the 9 or 4th best would be more normal|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 8 suggests its from 4|pg||
nt|mcphee: i agree with 9 lead bawb:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 2nd and 4th is normal in Europe but not in the US|pg||
nt|bobh1: if it was 87xxx  i would agree with the 7 but the 9 could be an important card to not deny|pg||
pc|c5|nt|capercliff: S not wanting to give the contract away|pg||
nt|bobh1: which he did|pg||
pc|c6|nt|capercliff: but would soon find he was squeezed if W had 10x @h|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|capercliff: after the tank N knows his partner was unsure about the @h position:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: there will be no imp exchange to this one|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think he is a little heavy for 3@h but standard methods don't provide enu options|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|capercliff: for those that may not understand what I mean by that if you start with 5 low cards, you always return the highest you can afford|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bobh1: jon is hoping this is not passed|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mcphee: 3@C now then 3@S should lead to the same spot|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@c is forcing no?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: i doubt they play it as forcing|pg||
nt|mcphee: no|pg||
nt|bobh1: i prefer to play it as "almost forcing"|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@c has to be forcing, unless 1@s can be really mince|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1@s can certainly be really mince|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: of that i am sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3@s is surely forcing|pg||
nt|mcphee: the question here to me is do we try the 4-3 in @S or bounce to 5@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has an in-between hand which with the Europeans use gazzilli|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|capercliff: it is a common point that most experts will keep the auction open with almost any 4-card @s suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@H is a really big bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: so opener needs to be carefull not to jump around when partner responds 1@s|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is a playable spot|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|bobh1: this is a better contract than 5@c altho less so at imps than mps|pg||
nt|capercliff: so 2@c is almost 99% forcing, unless partner shouldnt have bid 1@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: shouldnt isn't quite the word i'd use|pg||
nt|bobh1: these two want their partners to respond on a lot of yarboroughs|pg||
nt|bobh1: especially when non-vul|pg||
nt|mcphee: i am going to have to leave you now|pg||
nt|capercliff: sure, but you must have a way to gauge how high to bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks for putting up with me|pg||
nt|bobh1: or when short in @ds...or when holding a nice major|pg||
nt|mcphee: cheers|pg||
nt|capercliff: as you mentioned, a lot on this side would use 2@c as Gazzilli type|pg||
nt|bobh1: S is not known for the quickness of his play|pg||
nt|capercliff: if the auction goes 1@d-1@h much different|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
