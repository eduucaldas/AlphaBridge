nt|rado: agressive DBL by N may produce @D lead|pg||
nt|blewah: this is the last round of team match|pg||
nt|haans: Points to Fantoni|pg||
nt|ady: sort of pushed to game|pg||
nt|bobholl: good signaling in @H may put them 1 down|pg||

nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all GL ant|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a slam missed, 3N misunderstood|pg||

nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|riccho:  the@h are VERY open|pg||
nt|riccho:  The defense should be able to cash their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|kastan88: hi all again|pg||
nt|sybarra: is is for recording the play |pg||
nt|bernix: i rather assume NS are using nf free bids|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: clubs lead to break|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia is never afraid|pg||
nt|mamos: either one down or the whole lot?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double is the correct approach, 2@c would describe less|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over t/o x 1@s still fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but personally i expected 2@d by Boye|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for North was easy pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still wld pull to at least slam|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, mistake in bidding, now on trick 5|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this rates to make 8 or 9 tricks, depending on guesswork|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Mike Hi Steve|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning all   we have had a small problem here on Board 1 but hope to bring you the result shortly|pg||
nt|haans: Mackwell compare score with which European pair?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry about this, 1st time|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers= "does 2@S show extras", answer= yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: heya Bob and Liliek, welkum aboard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: TV|pg||
nt|mcphee: 450 and no one wins this board|pg||
nt|westjava: so,the law now on this table,Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probalbly normal contract here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makes also 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: well not doubled     but Europe might win this one|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@s isnt everyones choice I would guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has brought a box of tissues to the table, blows his nose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because she knows 17 at hand, 12-13 at opener, and say 6-7 at east, so South 0-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Resume in 12 mins. Sorry lost play on 7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N off balanced, only points out values|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: US players sitting other way round - will change display shortly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Negoescu - Briciu is not a regular partnership, but let's hope that they'll do well today|pg||
nt|bobholl: if n @H lead may be even 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@s should be 8-10, so 3@h invitational with losers @h i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Point a board|pg||
nt|haans: Meckstroth started with good tactical bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: peculiar there wasnt a transfer first time. The tactics of point-a-board?|pg||
nt|mamos: aggressive start from Justin|pg||
nt|mamos: ahh  I see transfer|pg||

nt|haans: view as  played as BAM |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: are we correct here, operator?|pg||
nt|haans: Operator Playing against which piars (compare with?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: pls ignore profile|pg||
nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Liliek:)   welcome|pg||
nt|blewah: hi pak Liliek|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to make 5@d a complete guess because of two way @c finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then 5 minor/s good save|pg||
nt|tez: if dbl again pd could bid 5@c|pg||
nt|haans: 2@Cx make no game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: dummy may be a disappointment to declarer|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: good|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: the normal 4@H (down a million)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: where NS make game with their 18HCP :)|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S seems ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 5 losers off two, in case @cK pinned off one, without double still good while 4@h fine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Tez|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Among the soundtracks she has done are Forrest Gump, Good Will Hunting and the last five Woody Allen movies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW carding is UDCA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@h required|pg||
nt|haans: you for the kill |pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes it was the board slam missed at both tables|pg||
nt|haans: happy dummy :)|pg||
nt|bernix: difficult to reach 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: penalty doubles have died in IMPs|pg||
nt|milton_se: in any case, NS have given away a lot of information|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S @D @H 4 made |pg||
nt|edmunte1: the romanian team in Stara Zagora has only 3 members of the team that won the Romanian Teams Bridge Championship last year|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS are a strong pair, member of Greece national team that finished 29th this year in Ostende|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|haans: better lead than a diamond|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven tricks seems likely though|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant:)|pg||
nt|westjava: tourney website : http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|sybarra: Europe won the morning session 8-4. Aggregate score in the Buffett Cup: Europe 56 - USA 64|pg||

nt|stc: sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so all big and real professionals, anyways our operator Russell going very well, congratulations|pg||
nt|udo: was2 @H alerted,,( both majors) ?|pg||
nt|stc: with KJ N have take the finesse the 1st time|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: W thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|haans: rare to bid 5m if 3nt possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin studies this trick in depth|pg||
nt|ady: e/w would have comfortably won the board in the very safe game of 5@D    part score only in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: nine now|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rado: declarer will try to restrict losses since even 1 trick may score a win|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: UDCA for NS|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: will he be able to keep it to down 2 only? or the inevetable down 3....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that means entry problems in case 2@c allowed to play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|blewah: the americans plays 2/1, while the germans strong club, 4 card major with canape possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the individual each team has to use a single system, even when playing in practised partnerships. |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we have "std. american" and "std. european" |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: although both are a 2/1GF system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would lead to play at hand and concede all picture cards to opps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: may end with just +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: connection down in other room will have to restart this one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: surprisingly @hQ falls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so 7 more winners at W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok |pg||
nt|h_karluk: US lost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably K now|pg||
nt|haans: was not easy for Ozden |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|udo: good defence,,another @H now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe 1; US :0|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: down 4 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't know about all the @C in S so ?!|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems "we" play on |pg||
nt|haans: can not do worse|pg||
nt|tez: i prefer 2@h..not double|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: @DT finesse and +1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far off four?|pg||
nt|haans: prefer 4@H instead of double of 3@H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jeanhari: indeed.. and on a combined 17 HCP-count noboady would come any nera 5@D, 8 crd fit|pg||
nt|ady: hi   was in open room   but needed here    4@H  in OR    might make as cards lay|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rado: still endplay position after cashing all @C and @H|pg||
nt|mamos: or back to eleven|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nothing in the play|pg||
nt|bobholl: have to discard properly to let it make exactly but they will i guess|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a quick one down|pg||
nt|mamos: shall i give up now|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING RESULTS **** BUFFETT CUP ****  USA 48   EUR  36  ***** (First to 100 wins) *****|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: he needed to play on @S first|pg||
nt|westjava: the battle of the year 2010!|pg||
nt|jeanhari: though Auken is trying|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H now lets it make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: forcing defence (@s lead and early ruff) another deterrent factor|pg||
nt|kastan88: must be good for Europe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice hook, 1N bid helped|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: steve may hook now|pg||
nt|riccho:  the signalling is high=pos (at least thats what the play tells me)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: and now which minor by W|pg||
pc|h8|nt|udo: not important...|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to save when you have AK    and AK   and they might be going down|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|stc: doesn't matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Thanks everyone|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tez: looks like 2 or 3 down|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: and he did|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|bobholl: they did :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not @D K ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however just a guess, bcos declarer still have no idea abt @d values|pg||
nt|haans: worth full 6 tricks|pg||
nt|edmunte1: so Croatia draws first blood :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jan_jansma: @D now|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or will she cash the setting trick first?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no hurry there, I think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not easy for Justin|pg||
nt|tez: if he plays @h..he can put ace of @h i thk|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: as long as declarer has 2 trumps, yes|pg||
nt|udo: still -2 and a decent score,,maybe the board|pg||
nt|ady: I see 4@H did make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jan_jansma: surely a diamond. Good she takes het time now, though|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C clear enough :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: Israel in lead in group B|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jan_jansma: well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: A very loud bang from the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The director runs past|pg||
nt|westjava: really, Ant?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meanwhile, Sabine Auken continues to think, head resting on her hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what happened,  maybe table collapsed   |pg||

nt|edmunte1: Briciu, Filip and Ionita were also members of romanian team that finished 27th in Ostende|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the twins are comparing with Levin and weinstein  who are playing Helgemo and Helness who have scored +130 in  3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe won 16-8 this morning|pg||
nt|bobholl: they are always playing fast if you don't like it :)|pg||

nt|mamos: i wonder if the players like these little six board sets ?   seems very staccato |pg||
nt|edmunte1: lucky contract for Bulgaria in the OR|pg||
nt|haans: yes we may expect 10 imp to Bulgaria here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: very light 3rd pos 1@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: scoll down on the home page,  beautiful picture, looks like old castle |pg||
nt|westjava: classic!|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@h seems playable for EW |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it's a lovely playing room, big oil paintings,  exposed brickwork, and a stag's head on the wall|pg||
nt|edmunte1: hard to reach  for Croatia here|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2@d from Kalin is Multi|pg||
nt|haans: West  did some oberbidding in Ov|pg||
mb|2N|nt|stc: many guesses in @s contract|pg||
nt|rado: now E might bid some constructive fit raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cool Liliek, jill is a great personality, always humble and she doesn't even play a lot of bridge  world championships, trials. most of her close woman friends aren't even bridge ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Geoff disagreed abt Klinger's 100 winning tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: ah, this one was a "player's hand in the way of the card" issue :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there Ron described overcall principles|pg||
nt|haans: yes so CC say|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's not common to bid 3 doubles with 3 spades and club void|pg||
nt|tez: its my choise:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-0 Hampson here|pg||
nt|rado: 6@H makable now|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no clue about the rest of their bidding. Lets see if they finish in 4/5/6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||

nt|bobholl: 1@H 2@C(drury 2@H i predict|pg||

mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|ady: may be a heart guess for 10 or 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: J of @H is a very fine card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good raise by Auken, but maybe 2@H would have won it too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant say somebody decides to start directly 41h|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be a negative double we would all make |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
nt|blewah: for 9 tricks if @s led|pg||
nt|sybarra: but Sabine Auken is quite agressive |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins play very aggressive 4 card majors  with 1NT 14-16 so open 1M on hands like this routinely|pg||
nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||
nt|stc: looks like a win for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey Ant, gl there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back, you'll watch Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde for Europe and Jill Levin & Jill Meyers for USA, www.buffettcup.com|pg||
nt|jeanhari: close call here, as would be the play in 4@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i have no sympathy to 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: K@D lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: >|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The convention cards have been slightly modified I believe, but I don't know where sadly|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probst had a hard choice between 3@s and 3NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: bidding 3@s could have missed 3nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: NS won't reach @C now i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: even 10 points counts as a win so Justin trying for the NT bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3rd and 5th leads|pg||
nt|westjava: you know every thing,Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a nice slam @s there|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi jackson|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit 4@h|pg||
nt|ady: not certain to make 10 tricks in hearts    depends how club suit is handled|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "did you pass Gerber?" :)|pg||
nt|haans: small spade?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c more descritive than 2@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *descriptive|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think 1@H-3@C is inv with clubs though|pg||
nt|sybarra: and she as safe spot in @D's |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days your pard bids spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: the indy format is interestign |pg||
nt|sybarra: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compares. |pg||
nt|sybarra: That player will always be in the same seat at the corresponding table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: will put board 7 in later|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right for decl|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have opted for no-trumps in this scoring method   might have come unsuck on a club lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely would have|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa - "I might have passed a splinter"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe dbl over 4@s wld lead to 4@s disaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i read 3N-3 on myscreen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: OR Jeff and Eric lucky, they are regular partners|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 4+fit and some defense:)|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d maybe forced|pg||
nt|westjava: East will support, of course|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT for north south no problem|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcphee: I did not think a @C would be led after the splinter|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: they make all the tricks on the normal @DK lead|pg||
nt|haans: would have tried @DK lead|pg||
nt|haans: raising tend to overbiodding all the time|pg||
nt|tez: very lucky 4@s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: no heart guess now |pg||
nt|blewah: this is a sequence of invitational @h supp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ant, i hope our boss did not read your words abt a convention:)|pg||
nt|ady: dont think europe will get anything from this hand |pg||
nt|mamos: NS only have on loser |pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, 5-6 finesses and 4@s is there :)|pg||
nt|tez: %3:)|pg||
nt|rocketer: .|pg||
pc|hT|nt|westjava: I think East shd take an extra action|pg||
nt|westjava: might be 3@H better|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks better |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
nt|westjava: so do I|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't be staying bidding NT but 3NT is best manche|pg||
nt|sybarra2: difficult for you Ant, |pg||
nt|edmunte1: 3nt is not a maker here, so more IMP's for Bulgaria|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oliverc: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|stc: the good choice to play on @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: good he didn't lead the T of @C|pg||
nt|mamos: the cards mostly lie well for EW   probably made game if they had bid it |pg||
nt|mamos: one|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 12 tricks isn't easy|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everything on the right spot here, the fate of contract depends trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 too high  but NS can make @C contract|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: might be keeping low because of the scoring I guess|pg||
nt|westjava: West down grade her stiff @DK|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh just as bad :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff sluff|pg||
nt|haans: need 1 trick more|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: double dummy AK winning line|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: Justin against Weinstein|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a difficult game to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Sabine Auken sometimes visits USA, a nice lady from my unit 160, district 7 <Miss Joyce Hampton> hires her for top events and they win&scratch in teams|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C denies @S control?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: then 5@D now? (@S control)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it shows a mixed @h raise and very nice help to opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I swear my P key is having an off day :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwi_joker: Am told 2@C is a mixed raise, 3 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S2 out of the hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: Sabine not comfortable with 3 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice one easily would employ a losing hook|pg||
nt|haans: i counted 9 losers 9 p|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|haans: DOUBLE and get the point|pg||
nt|haans: or support spades later|pg||

nt|ady: hackets have started very well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so hard to say a tie or anyone would win the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: giorgio helped|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|oliverc: No problems from here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: x not a must|pg||
nt|sybarra: just wants to give you a problem Ant |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: Fantoni Nunes in 3@C at the paired table   so Bob Hamman need to make to win the board|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer will attempt eleimination here|pg||
nt|jacksond: sememta/duboin have stopped in 4s in other room so this wiil be a swing |pg||
nt|jeanhari: tempting to balance with 2NT with north hand over 2@H|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rado: DBL may give room for NS to find better place|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this puzzles me 100%. OK I am lost....|pg||
nt|rado: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably wld ruff at tb, @c pitch at hand wld better|pg||
nt|bobholl: this won't be good for europe most players will open E hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an endplay to North available|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jan_jansma: OK, 6@D was a try for 6NT|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 or 7 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: restricted choice in @C and no rpoblem|pg||
nt|bobholl: still searching for 12th trick|pg||

nt|mamos: sorry it was  NUnes  Boye was South|pg||
nt|mamos: and made|pg||

nt|riccho:  hi!|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Richard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Levin, wants to lead a @D but is likely pickling pards @D trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: Ant, is Bobby in a trance?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes Aggelopouls played with Koukuselis in Ostende|pg||
nt|bobholl: why anxious to be on lead other than @H play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcphee: well I guess not:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortness might be your partner's winner, why not to lead it before declarer dumps somewhere|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @c lead was best|pg||
nt|ady: would have had to duck if K@D led|pg||
nt|bobholl: did they play @H and let one grow ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: making??|pg||
nt|edmunte1: http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/ the official page, waiting for inputs|pg||
nt|milton_se: seems impossible|pg||
nt|edmunte1: +110 sems improbable|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: with no clue|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: he will just bang down @HAK|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (slowly)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, much thought at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: may try the spade up now?|pg||
nt|westjava: or now a @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Closed room are in 3@H, so all a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play @H to the ace and a club up also |pg||
nt|westjava: she still count Levin's hand|pg||
nt|blewah: @h has to guess but @s will likely give in to N from the bid|pg||
nt|blewah: and if n continues, will create trump problem|pg||
nt|westjava: make decision, a @H drop or finesse |pg||
nt|blewah: yes, that would be my prediction too for W|pg||
nt|westjava: dont touch your @S, Arya:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is likely certain where the K of @H is,  question is layout |pg||
nt|h_karluk: forgot to cash @dK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: BAM is Super MP Best pairs (team) close to always win :)|pg||

nt|oliverc: Can Fantunes keep low enough here?|pg||
nt|oliverc: excellent score|pg||
nt|udo: looks like 4 @S EW here|pg||
nt|rado: from E side if partner has singleton @H or @C and normal opening 4@S would be easy|pg||
nt|westjava: @S was my choice|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jon Sveindal|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: so a push at the end of the day |pg||
nt|sybarra: and re hi all |pg||
nt|ady: down 2   a didaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not much problems with @d hook|pg||
nt|haans: odds that Israel did win that board|pg||
nt|bernix: heart finesse secures 9 tricks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk7: This is quite funny. On the European CC we see negative doubles through 3@S, on the American through 7@H!|pg||
nt|haans: here we go :)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c..i bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: that 110 doesnt look too flash a score on  2..anyone in NT will surely amass at elast 120|pg||

nt|rado: now some 5 level battle:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: was afraid of over ruff may be|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needed very little at the table|pg||

nt|h_karluk: previous deal proved, timing is everything|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Thankfully this board is the correct way arround :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 losers for EW|pg||
nt|haans: leve opps with the two first @D|pg||
nt|bernix: let's see if the turcs manage to reach 5@d after 2-suited opener|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d lead but....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i prefer neg x level 4@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can make 5 of a minor    but may not get there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but was almost a yarborough there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this looks an everyday 3N by EW|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D easy found|pg||
nt|haans: 7@H?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: now 3@s for 5+ hcp and 5+@c|pg||
nt|tez: pass is good hand here..dbl bad hand..to 3@d|pg||
nt|gmarco24: dbl=5+hcp without fifth suit|pg||
nt|haans: Radisic How to i tell p I knowm what to do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|udo: what is the westhand worth?   for me straight 4@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-1|pg||
nt|ady: might get overboard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but slam for NS|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2@s is a 2 suiter with @s|pg||
nt|haans: good to dind hearts suit|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H then a good save|pg||
nt|bernix: a club lead would beat 5@d but difficult to find from south hand|pg||
nt|haans: most experts say NOT Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: thats a new one|pg||
nt|haans: 7NT a finesse away|pg||
mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O37j3G2SwgU           Zia Mahmood|pg||
nt|oliverc: NT's the only making game here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still safe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am ok to 3@d as East|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Jon, good to see you again|pg||
nt|ady: if they try 3NT   likely to fail|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however minors length problem|pg||
nt|haans: players getting older with every bid :)|pg||
nt|tez: now they have an idea where is king of @s|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this can be made with 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Retip: 7@c around 95%|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: berkowitz would definitely have hard times|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi jon|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1NT (F) to show a weak @S raise later|pg||
nt|bobholl: but do both players know each otheres habbits ?|pg||
nt|mamos: we can expect some excitement here|pg||
nt|bobholl: other rrom 5@H X|pg||
nt|bobholl: and made|pg||
nt|h_karluk: adventurous 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and mirror position in @d suit bad|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 4@c is a pass/corect bid|pg||
nt|edmunte1: showing fit for both minors|pg||
nt|haans: DBL = lead directing|pg||
nt|april7: N can't find the K of @S in 5@H, then only 1 down, but also 2 down is ok|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe he'll find @c lead after all|pg||
nt|bernix: part score penalty doubles en vogue in open room|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe they double more confidently because north didnt bid spades there|pg||
nt|haans: or 2@H being Ekrens|pg||
nt|bernix: what is ekrens|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||
nt|mcphee: because it only gets 1 trick at most and may pass timing to the offense|pg||
nt|haans: best 2@S raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fave= in USA we mean 'favorites' in internet explorer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make a bunch of nt here |pg||
nt|mamos: good slam here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: N is suppose to be "in charge"  |pg||
nt|haans: deutch at its best|pg||
nt|edmunte1: another part-score fight here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score  hand    looks like 10 tricks in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can also put your partner to an early hook|pg||
nt|westjava: cant find a @S lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead, helps to decl to pitch @d loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however transportation problem|pg||
nt|jacksond: in fact of course he has no diamond loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we see that, dK stiff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not be easy to get the 11 needed to half the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: stiil hard to make 11 tricks as i other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who would not try @cQ hook then @sK wehen hold pitch a @d at hand|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S has a little better chanses than 4@H|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: experts NEVER pass an opening bid from partner (at Teams) nonvul vs vul) !!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: NEVER|pg||
nt|westjava: yup, handle with carefully|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@d would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still a chance for 6@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable|pg||
nt|haans: right no support pass as soon as possible|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: 6 nt could roll |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5 @d decided by N, S ready to correct 6@d|pg||
nt|gmarco24: no rdbl, no trouble  :)|pg||
nt|haans: heading to 7nt?|pg||
nt|haans: assume this board will take some time at OR 2 :)|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 2nt invite because they have bad suppprt|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jan_jansma: (not to get to game themselves, but to prevent the oppo from reaching one)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3@C shows either 5+@Ss&4@H or @S and @C GF|pg||
nt|ady: showing their stoppers    but not enough for 3NT to make|pg||
nt|haans:  3-8 at leastb 4-4 in M|pg||
nt|bernix: will he find the killing lead ?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about leads; "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|haans: need 4@Sx to get points in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H4 out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *when|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: (in this case, both of course :))|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mamos: and there are plent of tricks  is slam out of the question?|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||
nt|haans: double: in case you want to pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to guess @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @S lead may make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some bidding by Sabine, not even sure of some kind of fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: till to here USA 79, Europe 65|pg||
nt|milton_se: and down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oliverc: will just claim 11, I guess|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play two times clubs towards hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S lead necessary to beat them|pg||
nt|haans: chicken :(|pg||
nt|tez: whats trump they have not an idea|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||
nt|haans: sqz possibilities|pg||
nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||
nt|ady: sensible auction  though if Meyers could have doubled 3@S for penalties that would win the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @CJ|pg||
nt|mamos: so Europw will win this board|pg||
nt|bobholl: on @C lead 5@H probably fails|pg||
nt|mamos: 12 tricks if either major finesse works|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sabine checks which responses to Keycard they are playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 0314  to me|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: @s lead and? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the answer is Brogeland:)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s not bad|pg||
nt|ady: West stepped in at wrong time|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry was fixed on S playing :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to play without regular partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is individual |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @dK|pg||
nt|tez: now show your suit:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oliverc: but only 10 available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clubs|pg||
nt|ady: J@D lead can get 300|pg||
nt|jeanhari: BAM-dbl :)|pg||
nt|ady: well done  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d may be unanimous in the field|pg||
nt|ady: only have to negotiate club position if east ducks twice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and two rounds hearts before west discards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sp A+ruff also needed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who knows a slip in defence - actually almost impossible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if the @c 9 would be at the table things would be easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while @sA not knocked out would just concede a @c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: lot of upgrading from meckstroth but in BAM all is well that ends well|pg||
nt|bobholl: lose 1 trick in each colour i fear|pg||
nt|april7: K of @C no good card, so the X is also a bad one|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oliverc: Can't afford the @D to hand, though as it exposes the K@D once North takes the A@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sing @H now looks normal|pg||
nt|mamos: only a small club as it happens|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so all "suffering" under same rules |pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: The norwegians have bid 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: I mean there is no net gain|pg||
nt|udo: u are rite,,,so the lead was the winner for USA|pg||
nt|udo: @D lead other room|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 135 is popular :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  good choice|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  96 EUR 78 ****   |pg||

nt|riccho:  are the players allowed to look into their own systemcard here?|pg||
nt|mamos: same contract in OR|pg||

nt|haans: and you are still alive :)|pg||
nt|tez: north will be sqz if @d lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: ahalim: W will be strip-squeezed ME agree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would be very clever to gove declarer the extra entry to finesse in clubs twice|pg||
nt|jeanhari: still must play hearts from the table too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth leans forward, elbows on the table, cards face down in a pile|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting individual format, still usa-europe camp. normally individual is an event all players make partnership.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no easy return|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff musing abt @s count and 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sK defence not much hard|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the longer it takes , the more I expect Sabine to make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H she can make if guessing rigth|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in general 3rd 5th leads widely accepted, the picture would appear |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S4@C3 towards the front of the hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h switch - table's weakness, follow the old book|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth apologies, and continues his thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: before long suit stopper knocked out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needs 3 more tricks to set|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dK, 2 hearts |pg||
nt|mamos: this is too ambitious as the cards lie  -- |pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they are |pg||
nt|riccho:  13 tricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: each team (USA and Euro) are playing a "standard" card |pg||

pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: clubs, but @h A favborablhy placed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : favorably|pg||
nt|udo: not to forget the 2@C bid of course|pg||
nt|mcphee: the next @H applies pressure on S hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H even|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: not clubs lead in 6nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 5NT looks like pick a slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 @h break then makeable one|pg||
nt|bobholl: !K not sure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer would obviously hook trumps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 10 tricks on accurate defense, which we can expect|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|stc: another chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i shut my eyes not to see @h hook|pg||
nt|udo: next door NS bid 1@H and 3 @H so @C and @D never mentionned|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|oliverc: The hand pretty much an open book now, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h? oh acolish|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,the brothers|pg||
nt|udo: acol|pg||
nt|oliverc: I think it has to be the @H hook now at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|oliverc: Can't afford NOT to make 11 tricks from here|pg||

nt|oliverc: :)|pg||

nt|mcphee: i suspect they win that one|pg||
nt|westjava: agree|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio Duboin (born September 30, 1959 in Turin, Italy) is an Italian bridge player. Duboin has won four World teams championships along with six consecutive European teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: championships and a seventh European in 2010. For many years his regular partner was Norberto Bocchi; now he plays primarily with Antonio Sementa.|pg||
nt|jbgood: no records of the play in the OR - Broge will not be happy to lose that board|pg||
nt|Walddk7:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d then maybe 2@h|pg||
nt|mamos: seems a normal result|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr yves |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops sorry,  wd Bobby :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries they r both fm th family|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is unique fomat |pg||
nt|edmunte1: probablyNS playing a strong club system, that's the only way i can understand pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: that was quick :)|pg||
nt|haans: plus for Radisic-Altman|pg||
nt|haans: more here :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be imp to Israel|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: he got an easy win prev hand, so they are even|pg||
nt|bobholl: show up is the rigth expression |pg||
nt|h_karluk: nah, i expect the field wld be in 5@d with same tricks, to me a tie|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and south may reopen, who knows|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jan_jansma: 10-14 again|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops 9-13|pg||
nt|rado: here 2NT 5+@s INv+ maybe|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: unfair.... You have their system in front of you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes this will happen often|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes checks the convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no doubt checking if 3@H or some such bid shows 5-5 Majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia laying in the bushes|pg||
nt|mamos: and it seems ok to consult your own card :)    a couple of times I think teams have been helping the oppo witheir system :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Should Zia just pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: strectched mini roman|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 4 carder|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks if 1NT is forcing|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H could be 4 cards when 4@s4@H(32)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: north surely looking for slam here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: now they may and are unlucky|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     1NT likely|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult choice for N 3Nt or 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: here EW win 5@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a friendly group |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Quite refreshing to see players being allowed to check their own cards imo|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.00 BST, in about 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho:  aggressive lead here by rodwell cost s costly trick|pg||
nt|haans: max 3@H|pg||
nt|tez: muranli/ozden playing first time i think at vugraph |pg||
nt|haans: double looming here|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes asks for the card - he hasn't brough one with him|pg||
nt|bobholl: is this in the system notes i doubt it :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hopefully that shows 55 majors  :)  on both sides of the table  East and West :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it seems EW don't have any European system cards with them|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes that is in notes 55 majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: than i would bid 4@H as W|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers suggests that they just tell each other :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: meanwhile the director brings them a copy of the system|pg||
nt|mamos: Its a sensible gadget |pg||
nt|riccho:  it is on the card 4@d =5+5+MAJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it is not clear if the 4@D bid is actually on the system!|pg||
nt|bobholl: but did nunes know it ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Note 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Ah, think Eric's found it now|pg||
nt|riccho:  He looked on the cc, didnt he?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i still believe a questionable decision|pg||
nt|h_karluk: let's wait Fulvio's result|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: the overtrick was critical  for a Eorope gain|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately an unmakable contract |pg||
nt|bernix: i would have opened south hand with 2@h|pg||
mb|r|nt|h_karluk: edit : stretched|pg||
nt|jbgood: voidshowing 4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: need to put some brakes on soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this one is THE VERY WILD contest. Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: von arnim and hamman picked double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe was dominant half of the round|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bobby decides to stay on defence in case they also reached 6@d things may change|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H I mean|pg||
nt|bobholl: NO strong @C now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: @S's? What @S's?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but maybe some east west (a minority) might decide to compete with ie 5@h <prev board>|pg||
nt|ady: interesting     win and play back 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia lent Rodwell his 3@H card two boards ago, and now has to ask for it back :)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: don't know, just guessing|pg||
nt|milton_se: don't think they play a strong C -- se board 1|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: Opening Bids get weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld ask Fulvio's idea in Facebook:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knew very good :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Claudio is pleased he remembered correctly :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: he cannot misclick as we, So Nunes knew|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He guessed that he remembered the bid correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 6@d pick a major suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Fulvio did not use any convention vs 15-17 1N blindly at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|haans: Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|edmunte1: identical bid as in OR|pg||
nt|edmunte1: ok, they play natural|pg||
nt|haans: Kib say that Ozden-Muranli may play vugrapgh for 1st time|pg||
nt|haans: and they are new players|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: in BAM you scores nothing for second best contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: normally 11-15 any 4441|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: and 3@S = 2@S and 6@H, Rado?|pg||
nt|rado: unfortunatelly don't remember LOL|pg||
nt|rado: with trumps 3-3 4@S will be ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: We seem to have a mild technical hitch, but hopefully the broadcast will continue|pg||
nt|westjava: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wld be happy to play this board 31c by N|pg||
nt|haans: 1 trick short|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c by North|pg||
nt|yvesj49: cheap defence in @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not found.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: was told the twins' NT is 14-16 ... but that doesnt look right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 3-2 is  68%  (not 28)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: "how light do you open"|pg||
nt|mcphee: gazilli in  action|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well bid by Jason|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken claimed 10 tricks, but Meckstroth was very honest and declared that the @DK falls, so 11|pg||
nt|ady: duck   or take and switch to a sspade    easier defence    duck|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably North enquires and South shows max with Heart feature|pg||
nt|mamos: so Rodwell goes for the magic NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both M aces favorably placed|pg||
nt|tez: results http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: J of @H and Q of @S my guess|pg||
nt|kastan88: all USA pairs went for 3NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS playing udca and 2/4 leads in standard bulgarian way |pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzrj: when we pass 1NTx we have a balnced and|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fulvio liked his @s Qtx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff preferred double with same hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which indicates there were also strong NT opening values|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now we are about to see which strategy would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bear in mind this is super matchpoints|pg||
nt|haans: Jacks of low value|pg||
nt|bernix: although my partner does not appreciate w2 bids with 2 outside tricks|pg||
nt|haans: well we have all done worse|pg||
nt|haans: Running score http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/  + klick on results|pg||
nt|tez: woow|pg||
nt|gmarco24: wasn't easy to push to 6 with xxx@d|pg||
nt|haans: no good preformance all around|pg||
nt|tez: will altman lead small @d for @s ruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: For Europe 4 Norwegians there : Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Brogeland- "you pulled out of slam again!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes's played cards are difficult to see from this vantage point, so please don't read too much into the pips etc :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't 5@D that already ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Hampson : "I just didn't want to get doubled :)"|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   mixing hands up|pg||
nt|kastan88: from europeans only Nunes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you want to win the board just trust your luck, place @c9 to righty |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and play a spade towards table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anyways after the opening lead quick tricks are : 1@s, 4@c and 2 @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer should produce extra 2 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|haans: for a spade ruff|pg||
nt|tez: i played 2 times  Balkan Bridge Championship|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: leads- 3/5th, small card encouraging|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ant, you know, groans and grimaces barred but scowling free|pg||
nt|mamos: ty all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say one is @h K|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: the italian slam on 3 gives a 2-1 lead to Europe|pg||
nt|oliverc: despite the 4-0 trump break, this looks like it should make|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 3-3 among 6 is 36|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gazilli - A complex method of rebidding after a major opening and forcing 1 no trump response, involving an artificial forcing rebid of 2 clubs by opener to handle awkward rebid ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hands. Similar in effect to the Bart Convention but handles more hand types.|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 2@S bid some sort of relay|pg||
nt|diumraid: BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46  ****|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

nt|ady: has a chance to make  surprisng Levin did not overtake K@D|pg||
nt|haans: you are not happy opening 1@H and p bid 3nt :(|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt after investigation of course|pg||
nt|ady: exceptif North wins   plays a 2nd club  and then gets diamonds right    difficult|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still one short|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: H H play normal count|pg||
nt|mamos: you do have a good suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: good defence by zia |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Time for Jason to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Puts down his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Now plays with the @SK, and puts his hand down again|pg||
nt|mamos: yep both NS are pretty flat but their hands combine well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: another spade|pg||

nt|ady: seemed some sort of weak 2 was a reasonable choise on east hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: EW do not agree on the 4@C meaning - Duboin though shortage|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry, i think i stuck, but ok now, interesting 4@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d pick a major suit, 6@d m void there|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: as bob pointed out wasted values|pg||

nt|h_karluk: for Von Arnim also|pg||

nt|mamos: Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|ady: declarer tht diamonds must be 3-3 on the play so went to set up long diamond for a club discard    reasonable|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: why did they reach 4@S?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what you need in any level indy is just luck, say you land 3N in prev board, still can make if that's yr good day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another 9 out of ten 1N votes and all pass <i hope>|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx  lots of inro|pg||
nt|sybarra: *info |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa thought he had lost that trick, but Bobby kindly tells him the Ace won it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me @D more likely |pg||
nt|h_karluk: but who knows could touch another card|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: Europe leading 3-0 here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably a dia after @c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: no clubs loser|pg||
nt|ady: contract on again  |pg||
nt|mamos: and now has a Spade  for the Club discard|pg||

nt|ady: board for Europe |pg||
nt|ady: sorry square    3@H  made in OR|pg||

nt|Walddk7: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that ended with a tie|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: probably 2@s caused to a misunderstanding, that's why Antonio might think goodish with short club|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if duboin thot 4@C was shortness i am surprised he did not move over 4@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Roland|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio could easily land to 4@h after 2@h -- just fast arrival principle|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer claims|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or may want to put him table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but no reason for that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a dia would work better|pg||
nt|edmunte1: going down now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: In Bam you sometimes score nothing for the best contract  all that matters is the score :)|pg||
nt|rado: because of vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: does vuln matter in this form of scoring much?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ant do you keep teams CC that i posted yday, way too long fave list here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the winners are already known : US|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a push|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still tied|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Now Duboin thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe only made nine tricks so a board to USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Your vugraph operator has been given a cup of coffee, so no excuses for missed cards now|pg||
nt|kastan88: Fantoni (South) played this hand 4@S 2 down after @H lead, tried double finesse in dias|pg||
pc|s2|nt|westjava: yes Bob,was rather strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: its on the website hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just underlead it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and let Nunes enjoy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when declarer's doubleton Q falls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far same way|pg||
pc|s6|nt|westjava: thats why I agree with you, a dime stopped|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 4@C was the hand W expected 4@D would be a last train sort of cue bid|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: FN are probably the best pair in the world, so strange to see them in a 5-2 fit here|pg||
nt|rado: true:) but habbits|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (sorry if I offended all the other world-class pairs here)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: but 7 is in from this hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwi_joker: again, here, they are playing in a ridiculous contract when they have a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes sir, worths to analyse, musing position|pg||
nt|oliverc: now can just exit with the Q@S|pg||

nt|westjava: Zia-Hamman also loose their match|pg||
nt|mcphee: that board is also a possible swing|pg||
nt|jacksond: no style points for norwegians there looking for slam missing three aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: re hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: You have missed two very exciting partscores and one less exciting slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: did we find out the bang?   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess that would be a flat result|pg||
nt|haans: did not need that |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N>2@h was brave enough, 1@d <2@h> easy|pg||
nt|passell: big swing on the discard|pg||

mb|1H|nt|westjava: I suspect it|pg||

nt|mcphee: a handy toy in fact|pg||
nt|westjava: can explain,Bob?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N might well be a choice here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: antonio sementa is 19th rank in world grandmasters list|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D open|pg||
nt|westjava: I am told 18-19 balance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to have a worldgrandmaster title you must be world champ and lotsa placing points|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D for strong 18-19 balanced hands, balanced, no 5 card suit I believe is how this pair use it|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 5 card suits alter a hand a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps we can "re enact" the boards at the end |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, I have the play written down, so I can enter after the players have played board 26|pg||
nt|sybarra: since we started, I am not sure the router has had an "on" day |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so good result for europe|pg||
nt|riccho:  the scoring is very easy today: the better score wins one point, the worse loses one; thats all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is not an easy board for both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: do assume 2@S som form or reverse Flannery |pg||
nt|mamos: ahggressive bidding as usual from NS  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s ok, depends @h guess - two way @h J hook|pg||

nt|haans: little to strong for 3@H non vul?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: not a standard 3@h opening for Probst|pg||
nt|april7: partscore of 1 @S onl, but N might overbid over 2@H by W|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: (the players are allowed to refer to the notes as they are all made to play a "standard system")|pg||

nt|westjava: re hi all|pg||
nt|bobholl: so a bad score is just one point :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  lead directing 3@c I like this|pg||
nt|mamos: is drury part of American system ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nv,  and stepping into the fray |pg||
nt|h_karluk: one may go subterfuge especially there were not any established partnership|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|bernix: they wont stop in 1@s, north is worth a raise|pg||
nt|haans: chats them now?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|h_karluk: ty Roland|pg||
nt|haans: rare 3rd hand opening in vul|pg||
nt|haans: good 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW leads are quite compex, and their explanation is rather hushed - sorry!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think low show even engouraging, or odd discouraging|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a psyche|pg||
nt|bobholl: thin drury but unlucky 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with all thses 10 and 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: and rodwell skips the spades |pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT gamble again|pg||
nt|sybarra: going for the NT again |pg||
nt|riccho:  3NT is not everyones choice I guess|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bad board for USA 4@s 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: happy to avoid @d lead|pg||
nt|mamos: ten in Spades nine in NT here|pg||
nt|sybarra: the other minor suit K and down it would go |pg||
nt|riccho:  It would have been worse after a @d lead...|pg||
nt|sybarra: this gamble will not pay off |pg||
nt|mamos: someone with time could check all the boards but i guess the NT gamblers are a long way ahead in this event|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: From what I have seen so far this weekend, 1NT-3NT with 6M322 seems to be winning so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does he duck the club K?|pg||
nt|sybarra: how to make +1 in nt,  I do not see a way |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@D making so Italians certainly needed to bid 5@S|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H made harder for EW|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd hand wins again|pg||
nt|mamos: in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: Duboin decided to enter the bidding in the OR - cost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they have many special gadgets but unfortunately yet not much hands occurred to show that skills|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d was another option for west players|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo - "never accept gifts from opps"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and as east even pass to 2@d would be available|pg||
nt|yvesj49: finesse @h lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo pls|pg||
nt|haans: many many raise with just a 4 carder minimum value|pg||
nt|bernix: i stick to the LTC. with 6 losers i am worth a raise|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: i thought walddk7 new at th town and not experienced like boss, but i m caught :) gr8|pg||
nt|rado: 8 or 9 tricks might produce this lead|pg||

nt|gmarco24: EW play 1D defence overcalls|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: and 6@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA.|pg||
nt|mamos: Helness  passed 2@S|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 2@H|pg||
nt|riccho:  its more like a pairs tourney than|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or maybe , oh ok now thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: again conservative approach rewarded|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wild slam, rather a novel problem|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, 2@d would be @d/@s|pg||

nt|ady: 6@C  on trump finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good bidding by norway here |pg||
nt|mamos: ta just looked at CC  -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: In fact in the match yesterday both US and Europe had to check they were playing Drury, and they both were|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quite dangerous......|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s super accept|pg||
nt|haans: may have a problem with ace asking|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: slightly odd position for West  p opens the bidding  oppo bid a slam and you need to save|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2 clubs losers|pg||
nt|haans: @D finesse |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia off for a comfort break|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He appears to be suffering from a cold|pg||
nt|mamos: certainly quite tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: wont finesse the @H :)|pg||
nt|mamos: likely to go down methinks|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth be even 2 down|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wd Bob|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6@h|pg||
nt|tez: not my style dbl with altman hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: most use WJS so 2@S could not be a minimum hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: as you have a lot of stress rebidding over a 2NT rebid from partners|pg||
nt|westjava: and 2nt is forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Italians try a new partnership : Augustin Madala  Antonio Sementa, i guess in five years that will give good results|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2/1 passed hands are nonforcing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can fail on the same position|pg||
nt|ady: possible to go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: so there!!  wd Bobby |pg||
nt|milton_se: very tough by Nego but the cards lie well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @S will make i guess thanks to fav @S position|pg||
nt|haans: best direct 4NT 4 aces|pg||
nt|haans: in my book raise now to 4NT is quant|pg||
mb|4D|nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d over x would give much chances, ie responder would raise to 4@c --  i know it tells 6/4 @h+@s|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h not easy to find|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a wrong input by operator, was not a psyche|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries, happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: thanks for spotting it though :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: spade guess for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4N rkcb 0314 - last asked suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: yeah,2nt opening is ghost for me!|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they may make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|blewah: nootice the low @s played by meyers, making sure her p have entry to her hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might suggest cashing a bunch of tricks |pg||
nt|blewah: *notice|pg||
nt|sybarra: typing same Arya,  very important |pg||
nt|bobholl: after @D K spades are guessable may be :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes lots of specs agree may be down two|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure Fred is saying "thx pard"   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still retains control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 controls + @h Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb|pg||
mb|4N|nt|h_karluk: i hope 1@c alerted|pg||
nt|udo: perfect fitting hands,,,,,@S 3-3|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would think everyone here was alerted :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hA+9 would be interesting|pg||
nt|jeanhari: @D K will make guess easier|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @H ruffs in S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c was drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, as soon as West looked for his notes everyone knew he was checking for Drury, so NS allowed them to agree it regardless of the convention card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: dbl very questionable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's ok Ant, so far so good|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double indicates clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead directing|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I get the impression the dbl was made partly for lead-direction and partly for comic value after the discussion :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hehe|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now migth beat it anyway|pg||
nt|ady: lucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont have sympathy to 2@s there, to me clear cut 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: everything|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true mf|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board I will re enter some of the play on the 3NT, then move to 12|pg||
nt|haans: thinking or no connect?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably Tony taking his time|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mamos: with 11 points|pg||
nt|mcphee: those 2N jump rebids also eat up room creating little issues|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: well played|pg||

nt|riccho:  He will finesse in @h I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably going to watch a few pitches on spades first |pg||
nt|mamos: partly it depends on if he thinks 3NT or 4@S is the likely contract at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Jumping to 2M = to weak to bid natural :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I can imagine that at some tables EW will be bidding minors|pg||
nt|haans: 1@d-1@S-2@d- do you have cards for 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they did it with a delay and different way, w passed, then after xx |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for non-americans Bob or Bobby are acronyms of Robert|pg||
nt|april7: I am pretty sure that they will be in 3@S in CR|pg||
nt|gmarco24: generally, it's better when you are defending, showing leads etc. but can be quite self-destructive as here was|pg||
nt|haans: ace aking with @DK as ace?|pg||

nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46****|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 5@d but a novel problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: well well 3N must be a bad minor pre-empt|pg||
nt|mcphee: bad suit that is what I mean|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N always cold|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you Bob|pg||
nt|h_karluk: friendly layout there|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: In about 25 mins|pg||
nt|bobholl: europe has won this match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: when Zoric played small on @CQ, Roussev could have maked it|pg||
nt|haans: cards form 5@H|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mamos: EW will surely bid and make 4@S here|pg||
nt|udo: same biding so far|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see what can go wrong if dec plays trump before @d (keeping the 10@h in dummy)|pg||
nt|udo: in the other room 2@H-4@H followed now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or @c lead and @h back|pg||
nt|westjava: what's wrong with 3@D opening?|pg||
nt|blewah: strong club|pg||
nt|yvesj49: without the jack ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken; "Oh lovely"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because that's last board|pg||
nt|haans: North double very rare today|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S looks like sucide|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: they were good enough : 1 Boye BROGELAND - Espen LINDQVIST Norway 0.82 2. 2 Claudio NUNES - Fulvio FANTONI Italy 0.71|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bloody result in OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Eric decided to a sacrifice|pg||
nt|bernix: north seems to like off-shape doubles|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|westjava: strong @C in action|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @S game force? |pg||
nt|bobholl: brogeland also in 4@H as predicted|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo: "the ususal stuff"|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell might have considerted double|pg||
nt|riccho:  double finesse in @h = 25%. Better than a sure -1 isnt it?|pg||

nt|april7: 4@S is agood save,except EW finds the @D ruffs by underleading twice the AK:):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S no make|pg||
nt|haans: will they land in 3nt?|pg||
nt|westjava: strong suit I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia now thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Taps his pass card|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure his "given" name is Robert,  but I have known him for more years than either of us will admit....always bobby |pg||
nt|h_karluk: East not a passed hand, over x supposedly sys on|pg||
nt|bernix: kib is pointing out that 1@s actually promises @s & @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C slam will be easier but that's pure luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: board being played with Sontag as N!!!|pg||
nt|oliverc: can they stop at 3@S?|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps they are playing transfer pre-empts|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html|pg||
nt|bobholl: escaped a @C lead  the guessers|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Weinstein apologieses, "I went for a little difference@@|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe.....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: b|pg||
nt|haans: 0GUCCI: 4h for EW  ME: right without clubs ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: honestly surprised to 1@s overcall, 2@s fine in many books, glad Ron Klinger did not see that overcall|pg||
nt|haans: odds for going wrong in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: heheh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i won't be here, instant matchpoints in USA, also wld b busy as a player and appeal committee, gl everybody|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must find @SQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: just three red tricks to lose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean direct wjo|pg||
nt|westjava: 7 cards fir 4@D??:)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H is transfer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a fast table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they bid and play very quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia: "hopefully not too much"|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C K OR J lead puts 6@S 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have,  but only has Ax in spades,  last thing he wants to hear is  4 @S |pg||
nt|h_karluk: which Nunes did not follow the same route like Eric|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around, congrats to both teams|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: pedjabre: 1@s from N would be @s+@c |pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: if so that wont work|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|haans: but tempting|pg||
nt|ady: might stop out of game|pg||
nt|westjava: *for|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in practice very hard to find @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, last board now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: restart in 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "She has a better takeout double than you :)"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and my homework wld b done, wow|pg||
nt|mamos: hard to show the North hand any other way|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i prefer double instead of 3@h if it's not played as penality, the suit is just too weak for 3@h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|riccho:  this scoring is named "board a match"|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  97 EUR 77 ****   after this round|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very nice organization|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: might be tempted to play this one in NT instead of spades, because of the allure of the higher score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems angels whisper to try 5@d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easier to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most players prefer to pick a M suit opening lead |pg||
nt|mcphee: how hard is it to find A@H lead against 3N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Boye Brogeland, still the world's top ranked Junior|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D, natural and @S support, do you play this, Shirley?|pg||
nt|haans: Have a good time Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks sir:)|pg||
nt|ady: not a great 3NT    but it makes|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C did say no game for me|pg||
nt|ady: gl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: many skilled operators and top players were there|pg||
nt|bernix: does not work out particularly well on the actual setup. 4@sx is a good save |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: diet coke with gree lime time, brb|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *green lime|pg||
nt|jacksond: its a long story hamdi but of course Boye is World champion and it was unfortunate that for whatever reason Norway didnt field their strongest team in the last ewuroean ...|pg||
nt|jacksond: Championships|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: a short suit game try at the 2 level. I never saw that before|pg||
nt|rado: will declarer find Q trumps:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|sybarra: I play 2/1 |pg||
nt|westjava: the same|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT is on but lucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: haha Ant, cool|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com |pg||
nt|edmunte1: best lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm.. didnt think it would die at the 2 level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@h cue not fit as obv seen, just stopper|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all pass expected here|pg||
nt|oliverc: Even 3@S may be too highNunes may go one more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i agree with all bids there except finall pass by Jill|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not a bridge book double, opener hand but 2 cards clubs, 3 wld be a bridge book double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: We are indebted to Roland Wald for such great provide|pg||
pc|c4|nt|westjava: I play precision|pg||
nt|ady: Europe home in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H2 being considered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two way @c hook there|pg||
nt|haans: only three spades do no agree with 3@S|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt minors 5/5..ozden says i have 10 card in minors..not important|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: Mackwell boys have played BAM before Sure they know |pg||
nt|mamos: it's difficult to imagine this auction at imp scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@d could be fatal|pg||
nt|haans: solid bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand  Im not sure shed quite expect this shape from South   but game reached :)|pg||
nt|ady: so far|pg||
nt|haans: question is could N pass 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: AJtx|pg||
nt|jbgood: club shift?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it is needed - 3@h will go down 1 on any defense (but one)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wasn't Norway's decision, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected twelve players from different countries of Europe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: agreed Oliver|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think wld bring +660 for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Thank you everyone, this is the last board of the set. We restart in around 30 mins.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's makeable|pg||
nt|april7: now 12 tricks available|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: oh Lisa there|pg||
nt|ady: only needed to share the hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c also, 3@h uh oh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gtg, bye guys, god bless|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: bye!|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´ve read that in USA they played this in the 60s a lot. They stopped it, because the winner of the events were always the same!|pg||
nt|bobholl: good play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: well done got to the right spot|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@s is par i think and decl must have a hard time figuring if all the missing aces are in S's hand|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  101 EUR 79 **** IN RUNNING ****  USA CANNOT BE CAUGHT NOW ***   CONGRATS TO USA   ****|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos: but 4@S may well make here so may turn out tob e the wrong deision  |pg||
nt|haans: shevek: Helgemo plays in 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: Helgemo Helness have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @C too even luckyer|pg||
nt|bernix: after trump lead west will  make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: rare to find a save on just 5-3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|blewah: 1 down 2 to go for guessing A/Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: S totally quiet with 3 aces may not be easy to see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board is finished I will load up 1 again and enter some of the play |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @c Q hook marked|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems straightforward eleven tricks|pg||
nt|ady: meyers mad a tight 1NT hand 16|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bernix: what's the point in ruffing a @d? i dont see it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17  the 460 looking good to maybe win the match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we are 6 tables all days|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hook obv|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 1N, 2@d dislike|pg||
nt|edmunte1: still worth only 1IMP|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: but could he he did not have cards to slam|pg||
nt|mamos: she|pg||
nt|haans: Well done all day Ant|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: This board will not be scored at this board :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will open 3N against you more often then:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant long minor|pg||
nt|westjava: fault no.1|pg||
nt|bobholl: 12 tricks on a double squeeze (rodwell found it) but in @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H made now|pg||
nt|haans: Most point out that @CT was what made this deal|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|westjava: for gambling 3nt, I lead a gambling honour at other (M) suit|pg||
nt|jacksond: 2NT in other romm was a grwat result for europe and was  likely to win board anyway.|pg||
nt|kastan88: B-A-M sounds as former known Soviet trans-Siberian BAM (Baical-Amur magistral)|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be that is reason to stop BAm counting|pg||
nt|riccho:  Bd 5 is a next-to-sure winner for europe (my prediction ary lousy... :))|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @H lead stops 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The europeans seem to have a stanglehold on this match  needing just half from the last two boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: and the good 3@S will bring them at least a 1/2|pg||
nt|bobholl: ouder als mijn dochter (1975)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: That was the last board, thanks all. We restart in 25 mins.|pg||
nt|bobholl: thanks ant your perfonce was as usual very good |pg||
nt|bobholl: performance sry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposedly +650 for NS|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: diet coke sweetened with splenda also good, however i prefer diet coke lime|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the American style of 1 point for a win, 0.5 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||

nt|mcphee: they have 4 tricks Hamdi|pg||
nt|gmarco24: let's try this one|pg||
pc|c5|nt|edmunte1: 4@h still a bridge too far|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: natural lead i think 1 p for each pair|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin: "what's 1@S-3@D" - answer: "inv"|pg||
nt|haans: finesse in hearts for 3 hearts|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Nunes scratching his head now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: certainly in thought :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: clearly he was hoping his @S were running|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: so South did well to win the first @S|pg||
nt|haans: artificial systems is like marriage  you must stay with you long time partner|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: my Gran would have approved of that lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *edit: then|pg||
nt|westjava: lovely @H4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: also Bob Hamman fans, i have the chance to watch their play here in USA,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeIw1XMZfeU   :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Now will take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Rich, welcome aboard, nice to see you joined us|pg||
nt|reisig: Hiya :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure Bob, they will get their winners to set it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 bridges :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@h=relay, 2@s=5@c, 3@c fit and RKC, 3NT=2+Q@c and probably spiral scan after it|pg||
nt|haans: spiral scan is Bid suit you do not have control in|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|westjava: and contract is 4nt:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we all see|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin is back, and North/South send out a kibitzer for some diet cokes|pg||
nt|haans: will end with @D finesse|pg||
nt|april7: two ways, either ruffing finesse in @D or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|haans: yep can try clubs first|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: edit: 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: before winning @SA Meyers checked 1@S showed 5|pg||
nt|gmarco24: not really, there are different ways|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwi_joker: my Gran is only in 2NT on the EW cards tho :)|pg||
nt|mamos: defence does best to get ruff now because otherwise declarer can cash two clubs discarding Hearts|pg||
nt|haans: yes often scan by steps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blewah: push board|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: spade needed|pg||
nt|haans: bright defense needed|pg||
nt|mamos: South would have made this hand much easier if she had allowed @DK to win|pg||
nt|haans: kib: NicJans: do you like this result of the bidding Me dont know yet 50% slam|pg||
nt|gmarco24: friendly lead, +1 now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|milton_se: isn't it a bit remarkable that East's hand isn't enough against an opener?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: :) i guess this is the same guy used "Pomo" nick, great|pg||
nt|oliverc: he can run but he can't hide :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's very true sir:) you nicely pointed out|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: cashing the @HA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C is best defence |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a heart to hand - ruff|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: common IMP play never to stop at 2nt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: still can get Heart ruff for -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess @h 9|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: will let south know|pg||
nt|edmunte1: if you went wrong you'll usually lose only 6 IMP's (vs 2nt=). If you're right you'll win 10 IMP's (vs 2nt+1)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|reisig: Sontag has been a GREAT player for many years|pg||
nt|oliverc: absolutely|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: easy defense|pg||
mc|9|nt|h_karluk: and then a @d towards table - ruff|pg||
nt|ady: heart then and it would have made if Justin plays the 6|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: west has 2@C|pg||
nt|rado: and if no Q@C would have open 2@S:)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: it was indeed a subtle line|pg||
nt|ady: all square same in OR|pg||
nt|westjava: a mathematical count problem solved by Dubuin:)|pg||
nt|haans: and also count in that you may stress opps and can get IMP at other board|pg||
nt|april7: N didn't even try, is 1 P worth nothing anymore???:):)|pg||

mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: unfortunately we were not able to watch all cards played|pg||
nt|jbgood: only one down?|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: Croatia scored 11 on board 14, so we have a close finish|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d best shoot|pg||
nt|haans: NS may bid 3nt (23 hcp) :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: what does 2@D show?|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|mamos: is this a  hand for science?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky day of Steve Weinstein|pg||
nt|stc: and a making line if E have had one more @h instead of the @d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easy make :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: :)   a two up transfer :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass is a sure thing|pg||
nt|oliverc: Auken perhaps not counting the hand right there. partner HAS to have either the K|pg||
nt|oliverc: or J of Spades to make up their 1@C Opening|pg||
nt|westjava: *Duboin|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4 or 5@D?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 I think|pg||
nt|haans: every time you ask you will allsways be told "random deals "|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: normally many people plays it xfer to spades|pg||
nt|stc: this is how you win 100 times the cavendish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt off one, whatever|pg||
nt|sybarra: a precision 2 @C  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6+ clubs |pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c 6+ 10-15 usually no 4M|pg||
nt|westjava: Arnim-Auken system, looks like close to precision I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I was only using precision as a generic description of the 2 @C bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and you are not sure about @c A, K|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: someone gets a text message loudly in the room - everyone looks|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 4@s normal spot|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: http://www.masterpointpress.com/general/bbum.html|pg||
nt|jacksond: looks impossible for declarer to get out for one down which would be a half|pg||
nt|blewah: closer to ultra canape, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: if you roll the dice and bid slam then in the newspapers, if goes down would feel worst, because the players there know their business very well|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: well  you'd want to be playing with a partner with whom you had very secure agreements on this auction ........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5@s misread|pg||
nt|oliverc: Do we know exactly what 4@H meant?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : tenace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no we do not know|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, no discussions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok, no worries|pg||
nt|april7: without @S stop I'd rather bid 2 @H than 1 NT|pg||
nt|haans: 1@Sx no game if make|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The USA players all suffering different degrees of jet lag|pg||
nt|edmunte1: kalin will upgrade due to 10 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: 1ntx no game if make|pg||
mb|d|nt|blewah: prec obligates 5 card M|pg||
nt|westjava: back to the Italy at '70 era, arya?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: that 4@D looks costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 2@D shows 9 cards either way|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding on a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: surprised they didnt double 4@D (at this form of scoring).|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass saves the day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: not the fastest auction in the world|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can make 11 tricks in hearts    but might settle for 10?|pg||
nt|westjava: helpfuly|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand to play |pg||
nt|blewah: maybe. i was not borned yet :)|pg||
nt|westjava: Roman and Neapolitan, a wonderful nostalgic...|pg||
nt|haans: i rather pass as soon as possible|pg||
nt|april7: to high already on !G leads!!!|pg||
nt|april7: @H leads|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: ask me , my jet lag lasted a month|pg||
nt|haans: well vul game|pg||
nt|bernix: and i cant see east leading anything else|pg||
nt|bobholl: good play |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: this could be a breakpoint, in case @dJ lead|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Claim was for -1, at the point when I claimed. Weird.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: seemed impossible from here too|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 58  EUR 50**** - Last set for today in progress|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I could well have misheard|pg||
nt|jacksond: unlucky in 3nt in other room. Must have guessed spades wrong on lead|pg||
nt|westjava: play @DK and cash @c..?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably he will make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: bloody|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: Zia knows what he has   we know what he has   |pg||
nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
nt|haans: Good make me get for @HT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
nt|oliverc: so ruffing high and exiting with the Q@S should have been a sensible line of defence|pg||
nt|haans: clubs finesse win or lose the board :)|pg||
nt|ady: lot of trumps coming now|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|gmarco24: i wonder what that 6@c was?|pg||
nt|tez: how many slam in this set?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
nt|haans: i think i know :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: "i have clubs"?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: or perhaps he did and risked 6NT   not inconceivable at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok declarer claims|pg||
nt|gmarco24: oh, well, seems like this table likes new suit on 6-th and 7-th level|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|h_karluk: footnote : it was hard enough to understand for a 12 years old kid, but today i got the great value |pg||
nt|oliverc: I have to go. thanks everyone.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeya buddy|pg||
nt|stc: A@h and @h will do|pg||
nt|westjava: she choose @S first|pg||
nt|sybarra: going for @s...probably doesnt matter |pg||
nt|blewah: 10 tricks and win the board|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: most are still playing IMP im sure|pg||
nt|haans: in their mind|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|oliverc: LOL. Fantoni had to start with 3 @s's to beat this|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, cash AH@C|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: medically referred to as "desynchronosis," is a physiological condition which is a consequence of alterations to circadian rhythms.|pg||
nt|westjava: did you open 1nt or 1 @H, Bob?|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  Jet lag results from rapid long-distance transmeridian (east-west or west-east) travel, as on a jet plane.|pg||
nt|mcphee: i open those hands 1N|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|westjava: 5332,right?|pg||
nt|mcphee: the bidding is easier when you open 1N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me simple 1@h, melih ozdil of new york also likes to begin with 1N since long years|pg||
nt|westjava: AK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: BAM in Super MP take your tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin asks about carding - "standard"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: this is ahand that shows this scoring methods difficulties  playing imps we would have bid Board 24 by now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: catchy board|pg||

nt|haans: Koksoy not happy :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzrj: @S3 being considered|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|mcphee: even 5-4-2-2 with certain provisions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't believe it|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't believe the TD should step in and announce one team can't win - any more than we do in the Spingold or Bermuda Bowl and a team is down 25 with one board to go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean @c9 got a trick 1st round|pg||

pc|c8|nt|jacksond: yes club play looks like it makes the hand|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: decl see an opening|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: its not a classic treatment Liliek|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mamos: West's problems of course are that too many Club discards will give the position of the King away|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||

nt|gmarco24: 7@h and 7NT weren't good contracts, this is not good too, but it's in. we'll have one more very lucky|pg||
nt|gmarco24: also, there was one 4@s on 5 finesses, all 5 were there|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|blewah: 3@d must have shown some sort of tolerance to @s and max. otherwise it didn't make sense as 2@s was transfer, could be very weak|pg||

nt|blewah: 2nT 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|haans: unusual rare pass by North|pg||
nt|april7: to strong for 1NT, E's hand!!|pg||
nt|tez: no slam here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: 3NT never quiet at BAM :)|pg||
nt|westjava: Levin think about 5@C...|pg||
nt|haans: well if you see it as 18 point taken|pg||
nt|haans: not even gards for game|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Do they change pair to compare with?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: that's a good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|mamos: No Haans I thin they compare throughout with same opponent|pg||
nt|bernix: rare but not unusual. rather normal|pg||
nt|haans: to pass nowdays is not normal :)|pg||
nt|bernix: he cant refrain from balancing now|pg||
nt|april7: but there are limits!!!|pg||
nt|bernix: i tell you i would have passed whenever it was my turn|pg||
nt|haans: fighting for nothing|pg||
nt|bernix: will go down in 2@h instead of collecting +50 in 1nt|pg||
nt|april7: 1 or 2 down in 2@H, depends on declarer- or defence play|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S+!@H+2@D|pg||
nt|gmarco24: easy to set this|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Boca Raton Florida players lucky, this year i was busy a lot, hope in 2011 will visit there to see some familiar faces, including Larry Mori, SC-FL not much distance|pg||
nt|westjava: aha:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: NS play upside-down count|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a trick taking game and i am not volunteer to fool my partner at any phase of the game|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant|pg||
nt|blewah: or 3nt?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: no we started at 15   so although session length has been changed 14  we have two to play after thisboards to 12 |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 12 boards a session|pg||
nt|haans: 10 board should be 14|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: declarer's hand is a little lacking ................:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 2@h and x as passed hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: Broge has a problem - will he go for the @d game (or slam)? or NT?|pg||
nt|jacksond: disadvange of the splinter is that it allowed north to indicate a lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes right :)|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFET CUP - USA  64  EUR  56  ****|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probably 3@h=5card|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1@s is like 1nt  forcing bid, Kaplan inversion|pg||
nt|haans: Well done Muranli|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: For many of us it has been a first seeing BAM in action|pg||
nt|reisig: I live in the same area|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i know|pg||
nt|jbgood: the former - it is only 420 against the overtrick for 430 in NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: 1nt  3nt MIGHT HAVE GOT A HEART LEAD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in the good old days Texas Aces were using a similar bid, Goldman's 3@h/3@s after NT described a mild slam interest in @c/@d, but with different shape |pg||
nt|jbgood: not to mention the bigger score for the @d slam bid and made in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match, in about 35 minutes, is Romania 1 vs Greece|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|westjava: I hear that they play 12 boards only, Ant?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, reduced from 14 after a request from both teams as I understand it|pg||
nt|mcphee: meyers might try a low @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the worst is to see ak10 spilit when u lead fm Qj9 etc :)|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty Ant|pg||
nt|mcphee: she can see future exit issues|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about Sementa's possible @D holdings - answer: 4+|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a carbon copy auction except 5/6@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: we seem to be beyong any makeable contract at  this table  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D should make sorry |pg||
nt|april7: 1NT makes, even after @H lead by setting up a second @C trick|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: more interesting 2@s decision|pg||
nt|haans: nice :)|pg||
nt|ady: ok thx|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@h seems disrespectfull to opps' bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no ... |pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s can get a @H ruff, |pg||
nt|haans: If decl have @SJ he still have it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: bid loss for Croatia|pg||
nt|bernix: i doubt whether they have finished round 2 by then|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbgood: Hapson took a good shot in the OR - direct 6 @d even after an original pass by prd|pg||
nt|haans: TD may speed things up a little|pg||
nt|april7: @S finesse now might save atrick , but wil S do it??|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|westjava: tourney website http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|mcphee: Sementa still in the dark where these major suit Q's are|pg||
nt|h_karluk: major suit guesses there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: missing queens, one should decide abt lesser evil|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will gain a discard on the J@C but it is not so helpful|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Geoff shoot the moon|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be the deciding trick :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: Spades first?|pg||
nt|ady: ak@S   low heart to queen?|pg||
nt|haans: at least 10|pg||

nt|edmunte1: good save|pg||

pc|cK|nt|vugraphzrj: J asking abt leading methods|pg||
nt|mamos: this could have been worse for declarer but defence seems in control|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: so headed for -1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sabine started to dance around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no still sitting quietly LOL:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: luckily got Ktx @c at the table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: woohoo, lol|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, 3@H is transfer to 4@D opps:)|pg||
nt|april7: to late|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|edmunte1: 5@d was lucky|pg||
nt|edmunte1: but again luck goes with the braves|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jacksond: Yes in the long run it is useful to be able to show a minor suited hand and a short major suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|reisig: Balancing is dangerous (although tempting) when Vul w 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: smile always smile, even it's bitter or sad, never reveal the color, just poker face cool :)|pg||
nt|stc: -1 and board for Europe ?|pg||
nt|haans: Do we have a running score?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: this looked more like an imps auction than Bam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : previous deal @d J was the only card to set it more|pg||
nt|mamos: no game making|pg||
nt|mcphee: guess  1 worked great:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i bet he watched Meyers playing tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: the low @H was smooth|pg||
nt|edmunte1: just the overtrick i presume|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: -2?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, you are right - if he finds a spade now|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|h_karluk: deception ended|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: Rodwell's underlead of @H suggested he wanted Meckstroth to start Spades from North|pg||
nt|ady: aI would bet on 11|pg||
nt|mamos: using the Club entry first might be safer|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFETT CUP - USA  72  EUR  60  ****|pg||

nt|oliverc: EW look to have 6 tricks against 2@S|pg||

nt|mamos: 6 tables Hans   do you expect them all to bid game?|pg||
nt|ady: even on a non heart lead  should go down|pg||
