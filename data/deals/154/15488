pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@c bidding out the shape - so a sing Spade is indicated|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: possible 3@C is a cue ... we'll see|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: there is the 3@s cue now N is off|pg||

mb|3H|nt|hedyg: suction bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they play suction over 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right, I think 2@H is supposed to be Suction  a) @S  b) @C & @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some mixed raise?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|wstuart: 2@S LR+ I would say.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Suction is a favorite treatment in New Zealand over strong 1@C/2@C and some use it over 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there any option that doesn't need @S finesse?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @CQ coming down and endplay in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...|pg||
nt|hedyg: or ruff out @ss and same hand has Kx in @D and Q@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: or Qx in @c and K@D on side.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hadn't thought about guessing @DKx|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: peeking at the hands confirms that :)|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|sybarra: still now sure I could say it even with pronounciaton |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wstuart: Someone suggested that 3NT was a non-serious 3NT, i.e., a mild slam try.  I don't think this is the case for two reasons:|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @DT gives him a @d finesse option|pg||
nt|wstuart: 1) South was willling to play in 3@H.  He can't possibly have even a mild try after that. and |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: still no claim, but suspect eliminate black suits and then @D  winning whenever North has @DK or South @DKx|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great result for EW|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|mc|10|nt|wstuart: 2) his @S holding suggests it was a natural offer of contracts.  So, I'm betting south just got confused.|pg||
