nt|kfay: This match is between the currenty 1st (Lavazaa) and 4th ranked teams in Group D.|pg||
nt|kfay: The top four teams from each pool will qualify for the 64-team knockout phase.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|phil: welcome back - Hi Kevin|pg||
nt|kfay: Hi Phil|pg||
mb|1S|nt|phil: Lavazza having an easy time so far winning its first four matches|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kfay: The Lavazza team is composed of some high-powered Italian names, while Rayner boasts many of Canada's present top players|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kfay: The North-South pair is indeed Bocchi-Berraro, a bit of a typo there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: haha|pg||
nt|kfay: Ferraro :)|pg||
nt|kfay: typos abound|pg||
nt|phil: as long as the bidding and play gets enetered correctly, we are fine :)|pg||

nt|bobh1: hi linda|pg||

nt|lml: The Rayner team are all friends from Canada so it will be interesting to see how they meet this challenge|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: All of these players have done very well over the years in Canadian team trials|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|oliverc: yes, horrible|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lml: I think I would bid 2@H now with the North hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: an exciting deal to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hi|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lml: hi April|pg||
nt|bobh1: sementa is not done|pg||
nt|lml: no but I think North should be|pg||
nt|lml: the points are very soft and he has shown about this much|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a lot of cards altho they may not be useful ones|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: quick note, I can only see one side of the table when screens are down so bids will be delayed until the board comes back.|pg||
nt|lml: thanks :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N will bid again because its imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hargreaves sementa|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: E did well to resist the temptation to o/c 2@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: surprised to see this|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: well Sementa has to figure that his partner couldn't even bid 2@D in the first place|pg||
nt|lml: and he only gave preference.  He can't have anything|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mcphee: as often happens in these cases when partner is broke, the 2 level is way too high|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: this contract is very tight.  |pg||
nt|lml: it might make if east can be enplayed somehow|pg||
nt|lml: cash the @HQ and lead a spade?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|oliverc: now ok|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panosk: 9 cl droping makes the contract safe|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|d5|pg||

nt|phil: you preempt the East hand? |pg||
nt|kfay: Although I should warn you that the service has been cutting out frequently due to high traffic volume|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kfay: I would preempt, Phil, just what level?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: the link is live again - the Swangames server was getting flooded and was done intermittently|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: 2@d allows you to show clubs later more easily, and doesn't overstate the hands value for a possible 3NT game|pg||
mb|d|nt|phil: agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: some play a 2N opening shows the minors and that wold be nice to have, since partner can bounce in clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kfay: This reminds me of a hand that was played in the 2nd round yesterday where South held @dAK10x over East's 2@d preempt, red against white.  there it was correct to bid the NT game|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|kfay: Here it appears that may also be the case|pg||
nt|kfay: oh OK, so it wasn't a preempt :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|phil: I remember that - the hand was Qx xx AKT7 KT9xx r/w and partner opened 1@s|pg||
nt|kfay: although it's hard to tell|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|phil: no but the diamonds were the same and you had to make the right competitive decision red / white|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|phil: playing for penalties looks right here|pg||
nt|phil: but even that isnt 100% with @sKTxx |pg||
nt|phil: I was looking at some outcomes of 4@h - that seems less certain and probably goes bait|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kfay: If West leads a @d (to keep partner happy) the defense will probably come to 4 tricks.  So we'll see what happens in the other room, this has the potential to swing 7 IMPs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kfay: I'm quite certain after looking at it that 9 tricks are available to N/S in 3NT, and usually 10|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h6|pc|sK|nt|kfay: Or 9 the other way, if game goes down.  I don't really imagine the other room will play in a partscore, doubled or undoubled.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|phil: defense just playing 'keep-away' now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pc|d8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|phil: Im sure that was ruffed|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|phil: hmm - trump endplay coming? |pg||
pc|c7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|phil: @sJ pitch, @hQ pitch, ruff spade, exit @d|pg||
nt|kfay: Well, commentator's curse.  Partscore in the other room and it appears on the play that they were in the right spot.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|sT|pg||

nt|oliverc: good 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|lml: at the moment I see that Lavassa is the leader and Rayner is not too far behind|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztf: players took this board upside down :(|pg||
mb|1S|nt|oliverc: I really dislike the 4@D bid at the other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: N bid a fast 4@D and that ended the party for 3N|pg||
nt|lml: well 11 VP/// Rayner is 4th with 87 and Lavazza has 98|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oliverc: silly to bypass 3NT when partner has opened|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|panosk: true but how can u ask partner if he stops the rest suits to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: here with partner a passed hand the pre-empt has appeal|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: unbelievable|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: same auction in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: sementa is rather distributional for a negative double|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobh1: and 3@h seems insufficient to me|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|phil: the spade shortness is very important|pg||
nt|kfay: Let's see if N/S employ any gadgetry here.|pg||
nt|phil: some sor of asking bid is useful here, but it has fallen out of vogue for many|pg||
nt|kfay: In grand the correct line is surely to crossruff the entire hand.|pg||
nt|phil: operator, please correct South's name to "Ferraro", thanks|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kfay: Ruffing the 3rd round of spades with the @h10.  |pg||
mb|5D|nt|phil: and "Bocchi"|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you have EW perfect however :)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|phil: 4@s RKCB I presume? |pg||
nt|kfay: 4@s is likely the 'kickback' convention, which asks for keycards.  5@d shows the @C+@d Aces, and no @hQ|pg||
nt|kfay: 5@s asking for kings|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: its the @sK or shortness that is important, perhaps 5N focuses on spades? |pg||
nt|kfay: 4@s asking for keys is useful because there are some situations where you'd like to ask for keycards, but if using 4NT you may not want to hear partner's 5@s response, which will ...|pg||
nt|kfay: propel you to slam if you're looking for 3 keycards rather than 2.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mcphee: to have any shot of reaching 3N it seems you just need to try 2@D or 3|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: not for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think biddable|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has a huge hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: sementa thought he should have worked it, I think. but I do not speak Italian.|pg||

nt|bobh1: and then accepted his game try|pg||

nt|bobh1: but perhaps should have cue-bid @cs instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|lml: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is probably kickback?|pg||
nt|lml: south has a very good hand for the auction so far|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|oliverc: swing here|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard to out bid the majors holding minors|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kfay: A typical lead against a grand slam is a trump, precisely because declarer can crossruff home many times.|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|kfay: But the contract went down 1 anyway, so Baxter probably got his @d ruff|pg||

nt|phil: I need a quick pick me up LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I'm not necessarily saying it's a great slam, just that I feel strongly that 4NT is the incorrect bid|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: agree - but its the 4th trump and @c xx that make it even playable|pg||
nt|kfay: From East's point of view there are several cards that can make slam more favorable aside from the @hA, but he left himself no chance to find them.|pg||
nt|kfay: Even over 5@c W could show the @hA with a 5@h cuebid, so you wouldn't lose the ability to find that card|pg||
nt|kfay: Keycard is a very valuable convention, but it is quite often overused.  |pg||
nt|phil: I strongly believe 4@s over 3@d should mean "I have a minimum, and I'm only accepting because you bid 3@d", otherwise, take it slower and see what partner is thinking|pg||
nt|kfay: You'll often see players leap to 4NT, eager to ask for keys, then when they find they're only missing one keycard they have no idea what to do|pg||
nt|kfay: Bids made after a keycard response should not be judgment calls, they should be either 'we have enough keycards or not enough'|pg||
nt|phil: totally agree - a good partnership shouldn't rely on RKCB exclusively for slam decisions - some auctions need to be more 'cooperative' |pg||

nt|phil: since there is an easy endplay|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  to have @c crossed|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  not easy, for sure|pg||
nt|kfay: I think that if W held only 3 hearts he'd pitch a high heart (count) to show that.  So perhaps the lack of a @h pitch indicates 4|pg||

nt|kfay: W can lead the @s9 when in with the @h|pg||
