nt|Walddk2: Is there a case for a trump lead there in order not to give anything away. Possibly @SA followed by a trump?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even after the helpful diamond lead the contract has as much chance as a snowball in the Sahara|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Likely down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: sure there's a case for trump lead, perhaps after @SA, but @H10 could be a key card and you could lose tempo if they have better @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: Really, NS have pushed two flat hands where the auction says things won't be splitting very well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can keep that as a macro, Gary, because Fantoni is always thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he is some player|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Gold medal World Mixed Pairs with Donna Compton of USA the other day|pg||
nt|othered1: And just won the Mixed Pairs the other day|pg||
nt|othered1: at 50 a trick, nothing calamatous and EW were going plus in 3@D|pg||

nt|othered1: System generates some funny weak NT openings, as 1 of a suit is usually 14 or 15+ HCP (and is forcing)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 12-14  6322  5422  and  even 4441 possible|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunit|pg||

nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north will be able to work out that he can ruff @S|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sunit: i am sure that if 4/4/4/1 is allowed for their 1nt opening, they will know how to find the exact shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A 4441 hand in the 12-14 range must be opened 1NT, no other option|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@H isn't a terrible spot, but far from assured|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D is a transfer but it does not promise hearts|pg||
nt|sunit: i am willing to put my money on a grand, even money!!!!|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C is the 4441 hand|pg||
nt|sunit: u Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must show specifically 1444 and now 4NT sets hearts. Remember that 2@D did not show them|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|nt|sunit: so now he has bought a one way ticket to the grand!!!!!!!!|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: unless 4nt is turbo, then maybe makes sense|pg||
