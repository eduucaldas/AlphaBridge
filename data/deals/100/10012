nt|brolucius: Hard to see who could have doubled, in practice.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They seem to specialise on 4-3 fits in both rooms|pg||
nt|brolucius: No-one even has an eight-card fit.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|henryb: If 3@c was a limit raise, the opponents are in a three level contract with fewer than half the high card points and probably not more than eight trumps. I think West might have|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a good moment for East to pass.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: ah, for the majors|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: 2@c=majors|pg||
nt|henryb: and South does not double|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Maybe you are one-suited with such a disparity between the two suits|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: depends how they play double here, could be t/o|pg||
nt|jstokes: normally, with 5-4, I like showing both, but here there is quite a difference in the two suits|pg||
nt|henryb: again I think when the opponents are playing at the two level with 7 trumps and less than half the high cards, doubles are indicated|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|brolucius: You certainly wouldn't bid 2@C (both majors) if the majors were reversed, because then partner would respond 2@H on 3-3 and you would be in the wrong suit.|pg||

nt|hedyg: however E has the option to bid 2@d with 3-2 asking W if he had a preference|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: I don't see why a double of 2@S would be for penalties. It's not normal to double for penalties at such a low level. True you could play 2NT as unusual, for take-out. |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: for me the 2@s bid should show a 2+ card difference in the suits in the E hand|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|dQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: I thought all doubles by responder were for take-out. Why does passing indicate that you are more likely to want to defend than play somewhere?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cK|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would take it as t/o|pg||
nt|henryb: I oftern pass 1N with 7-8 points; almost always in fact. that is why I can have a penalty double in this position|pg||

nt|henryb: either bid 2N or pass|pg||

mb|1N|nt|henryb: double with good defense mught have brought in about 5 more|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I think penalty doubles on 7 or 8 points should be only for matchpoints. Too expensive if they misfire at IMPs.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer points out to me that you can also pick up penalties when partner leaves in your take-out double. Yes, quite right. That tilts the odds in favour of take-out (as I see ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: it).|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|henryb: that requires that partner double with the 1N opener and shortness in their suit|pg||

nt|hedyg: by N only|pg||
nt|henryb: or 6@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: did they take a break?|pg||
nt|henryb: which makes from either hand on a heart lead and a diamond guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: true|pg||

nt|brolucius: Heart shortage and now North will bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has short @hs..|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Although North is brilliant for clubs, facing a singleton (or void) heart.|pg||
nt|hedyg: normally a 3 1 5 4 or 3 1 4 5 hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: And South has suggested that he has the playing strength for 11 tricks in a minor by bidding 3@H in the first place.|pg||
nt|henryb: he should be slamming in clubs imho|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North bids anything other than 3NT I will be ready to applaud.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: North is looking at 7 losers, not sure how a single raise is supposed to cover four of them|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: One of his losers has just vanished.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He has enough entries to go wrong in diamonds, finessiong the 8 at some point|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he can eliminate hearts and clubs and then play a diamond to the 10, then it will be OK. East will have to return the @D9, giving the position away.|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|3C|nt|henryb: 3@h = stayman, no stopper?|pg||

mb|3N|mb|4C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: a plus score might be good here for NS, with both major suit kings offside|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very unlucky that 5@D goes down. Really, N-S have not done well in the bidding (missing their 5-5 diamond fit) and will be fortunate to gain IMPs.|pg||

nt|jstokes: Yes, with doubletons in both of West's suits, North might have bid more delicately, perhaps with a cue bid at his second turn|pg||
