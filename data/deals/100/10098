pc|sK|nt|henryb: not in my book. With the 1N bid it is asking for a minus|pg||
nt|kareno: But not Steve Sanborn.  These matches so often devolve on whoever gets the better of the part-score hands.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: Some may be wondering why Beatty is playing with Ron Gerard as opposed to Bill Pollack. There was a last minute substitution needed, not sure of the reason.|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: 2@D 2@H and a @S|pg||

nt|kareno: No, because of the friendly nine of spades.  So a possible pickup for McKellar.|pg||

nt|kareno: I'm going to sneak into the other room to watch but yes, that would be great!!|pg||
