nt|roswolf: more big fits|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 4@S looks fine|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Good morning to Stan Schenker|pg||
nt|cicus: true, made it worth watching|pg||
mb|1C|an|11-13 or 17+|nt|sssvablue: Hello|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think 4@H can be made here for lack of entries to dummy|pg||
nt|cicus: needs opponents help|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphb1: but probably there wont be space to bid spades :) |pg||
nt|mowen: so in the closed e/w bid game with 20 points and no fit|pg||
nt|jwit: Great result for NS in closed room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jwit: Looks like 4H has to go down with best defense|pg||
nt|cicus: well, they have to lead something at the first trick and it solves a problem|pg||
mb|2S|an|inv+ with supp|nt|Walddk5: Hello everyone and welcome back to Sofia|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Welcome all|pg||
nt|snorris: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts will buy the contract i think|pg||
nt|Walddk6: and welcome back to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks routine to reach 4@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 2@D is MM|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: defence must have left the @cA intact|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little oomphhh here|pg||
mb|3H|an|Minimum|nt|milton_se: hi all, here we go -- I am Bertil Johnson of Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Hello Bertil|pg||
nt|mowen: so our e/w can gain points by making a contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: I'm told that both pairs play Precision|pg||
nt|mowen: but can they make this one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: WELCOME ALL|pg||
nt|snorris: easy start with no-problem 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: This is last one set of FINAL |pg||
nt|sssvablue: The layout is extremely friendly for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I dont think so|pg||
nt|charles_l: E here has a natural @cQ lead though|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S =?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: good day everyone. a routine 4@h to start off, unless they go to 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: wlc, Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Silvia|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: wlc, Charles|pg||
nt|snorris: can take 12 tricks ..but might not want to risk it|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: after Q@D there isn't risk|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: hello Charles|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|mowen: I think no chance|pg||
nt|cicus: finessing for the @D10 could create an extra entry for taking the club or heart finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: can he make it without club lead ?|pg||
nt|vlad9: precision with 1he  f1  and 1 sp  - waiting I presume|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphb1: Chelsea leads 2:1 against Everton|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I think he can|pg||
pc|sT|nt|charles_l: hi Vladimir and Silvia|pg||
nt|xenya: we kick off with a decent slam |pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly cold, but lots of chances|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: NS play 2/4 leads|pg||
nt|milton_se: This should be too much for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i think the answer is yes|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: on the other table @C lead was found|pg||
nt|vlad9: t/o  over  spades|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: noew diamonds are in the picture|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: 1st entry|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 1nt in this osition 14-16?|pg||
nt|vlad9: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: position|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|snorris: sure it is.. after h to ace ..more @ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps:)|pg||
nt|sssvablue: On accurate defense defenders will take one in each|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: this contract is not the most promising|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphb1: good switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but too late|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: true|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @H can be set up|pg||
nt|vlad9: will fail a few tricks for sure|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: and NS have duly arrived at it|pg||
nt|milton_se: In fact, 9 tricks seem easy for the defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not favorite|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|xenya: as the cards lie there's no problem|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|charles_l: good def|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Sry S has played Q@D on the 1st diamond|pg||

nt|cicus: np|pg||

nt|jwit: 4H should be real easy here|pg||
nt|charles_l: strong @c in 4th seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes an unusual one|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks more straightforward|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: S J Simon would not have approved of the double of 6@C on board 7 |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphb1: wlc, Kapi @H|pg||

nt|kapitanski: hello Silvia  Hello Roland|pg||
nt|snorris: nt ??|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: why mike ? :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: He always said is was a bad idea to double a suit slam just because you had two aces|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Good day|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Hi, Charles|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Charles|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphb1: These are 2 pairs from one of the most beautiful cities in Bulgaria, Stara Zagora|pg||
nt|vlad9: good result for boriana in closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: west trying for a penalty|pg||
nt|charles_l: i wouldn't pass with @sKJxx|pg||
mb|2H|nt|milton_se: Will N/S find the 3NT game?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: this looks like a makeable 3NT contract|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: if S invites now I think N will accept|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Another friendly layout, either 4@h or 3nt should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 2@H over 1@S which made the club lead a little easier|pg||
mb|4H|nt|milton_se: what range is 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if that is a weak jump response, it cannot be denied that it is weak |pg||
nt|mowen: nor would I but he might be right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: well wrong prediction (as usual)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@d must show 6 so W has an easy pass|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: S decided to bid game because of the vulnerability I suppose|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes, this is the kind of layout my opps usually have|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 2@H is 5@H and 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: well at least he has yhe king singelton|pg||
nt|milton_se: OK, there it is. Requires only a D finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: he should play the @D right I think|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I mean he should guess them right|pg||
nt|milton_se: that's the odds-on plat|pg||
nt|milton_se: play|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: that's true|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: yes it is|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kapitanski: will have the pleasure to watch the best pair-s and the best team-s  in  BUlgaria|pg||
nt|mowen: good one to make now|pg||
nt|charles_l: how would you describe X? hungry?|pg||
nt|mowen: north neds not to playn @DA when jack is led|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: NS should not play @H at any moment :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: that also|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Hi Gábor and Geoffrey|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mowen: or partners King will be ruffed out for a heart discard|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: but will there be a trump for the @H ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jwit: Nice system!|pg||
nt|charles_l: thats a useful agreement|pg||
nt|jwit: This hand should take about two seconds|pg||
nt|jwit: Once the opening lead is made of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D is on here as a spade can be developed for a heart discard|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|snorris: making things easy for declerer|pg||
nt|roswolf: if west is going to game why not enquire about a spade fit?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mowen: spade lead must be best for the defence|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kapitanski: Sisi  how  looks  the  players  there....someone  scared?  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: still not :)|pg||
nt|kapitanski: Aronov-stefanov  euro-pairs champ Antalia  before 2 years|pg||
nt|milton_se: and even more now...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|charles_l: -2 became -1|pg||
nt|charles_l: trump return?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|charles_l: except for them the @h109 would be doubleton|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sssvablue: The most challenging lead would be a spade by South, which is virtually impossible|pg||
nt|mowen: should be|pg||
nt|roswolf: cool bidding sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: he just needs to ruff 2@C in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: oh and spade to discard a @H yes|pg||
nt|cicus: hard to estimate but it seems an excellent slam|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphb1: at the other table E misplayed the diamond position|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|cicus: or at least decent :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kapitanski: marashev-conchev  bronze medals euro champ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|milton_se: oops -- Cs can't give 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mowen: defenders ould be endplayed here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: S was somewhat stuck for a lead, and the @SQ turns out to be very helpful for declarer|pg||
nt|charles_l: normal if unfortunate lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
mc|10|nt|kapitanski: karakolev-danailov   last yar   national team  Bg  and  champions  many times|pg||

nt|kapitanski: Bonev  winn the first championchip  in  1985  Batov  winn  many  championchip too|pg||
nt|kapitanski: all the players around  35-45  years  old|pg||
nt|mdgraham: His book "Why You Lose At Bridge" is a real classic|pg||
nt|roswolf: his book "why you lose at bridge"is still valid today|pg||
nt|roswolf: thin slam here|pg||
nt|roswolf: for e/w|pg||
nt|cicus: another, not particularly good slam|pg||
nt|cicus: needs hearts to break and the club hook|pg||
nt|roswolf: about my odds gabor!|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence must be ever watchful|pg||
nt|vlad9: dobrodolski was lucky puncheva had no other trump|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphb1: wlc, Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Youngsters.|pg||
nt|kapitanski: the  color  of  Bg nation in bridge  here...|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: this sounds like very pessimistic title ;) |pg||
nt|charles_l: so, X was... unsuccessful|pg||
nt|jwit: Should be another flat one here, though a diamond lead will give declarer some uneasiness|pg||
nt|cicus: :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|charles_l: seems that both pairs play precision|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|sssvablue: EW will get another chance at 4@h here|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: both pairs play precision|pg||
nt|mowen: so possible 12imps to Yambol became 5 to Beroe|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi Silvia.|pg||
nt|cicus: nice 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: they are the most aggressive pair in Bulgaria :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S is essentially semi psychic|pg||
nt|cicus: this might propel EW to slam|pg||
nt|cicus: if E bids 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: W must give his partner some leeway|pg||
mb|3H!|an|Pre|nt|snorris: 4 @s has chanses|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's preempt may give his pard a problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H LOOKS PRE-DESTINED|pg||
nt|mowen: hoe is opening 1@D on a singleton precise?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: btw Beroe is the name of one of the best football teams in Bulgaria in the near past :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: i'm told that took 36 secs|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would double|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they should easily get to the right suit notwithstanding the ugly system bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i prefer the CR response of 1@s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|milton_se: 2S should make|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1@d shows 1 @d, stephen|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now south has a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the opening chapter, he argues that one of the reasons is that you double a slam just because you hold two aces |pg||
nt|sssvablue: unless NS decided to save|pg||
nt|jwit: Nice diamond overcall.  Should hold it to 3 now.|pg||
nt|roswolf: short but sweet auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|kapitanski: they all  are  agressive  and  very  good players...|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: it is always good at least one of them to be the trump ace ;) |pg||
nt|roswolf: true:)|pg||
nt|jwit: Tough call for East now.  Knows partner has a stiff diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: this is a bit tougher|pg||
nt|milton_se: but Ns pass is understandable|pg||
nt|milton_se: with only 4 top tricks, S probably goes for the spades|pg||
nt|milton_se: but 4-2 will be an obstacle|pg||
nt|charles_l: but stranger things have happened, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|jwit: Good bid.  Should have no trouble taking 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jwit: Since spades are 4-3|pg||
nt|charles_l: 11?|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think they will be in 5@c|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes 11 in clubs.  Was thinking 10 in spades|pg||
nt|cicus: borderline, I think|pg||
pc|dT|nt|snorris: @c lead..raise @ds..|pg||
nt|snorris: looks like @c lead from east|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably can beat this, but defense has its problems, including opening lead.|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 4@H unreasonable!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: how much more precise can you be? :)|pg||
nt|cicus: between the two actions, I mean|pg||
nt|roswolf: trouble with double is really you give up on slam|pg||
pc|d5|nt|charles_l: interesting 1N|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many play that a 2@h response to a 1@s overcall is forcing even if other 2 level responses are not.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H with the king is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: it relies on 3-3 hearts or J10 doubleton|pg||
nt|mdgraham: alos, moot point as to whether 4@c should be forcing here |pg||
nt|charles_l: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: i hate having to open 2@C or 1@D on south's hand and that is why i gave up on strong club systems|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|snorris: best lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: here we are again, back from Cyperspace|pg||
nt|milton_se: this will create a restricted choice situation, but S can't afford a 4-2 break|pg||
nt|roswolf: since you dont promise a very big hand|pg||
nt|cicus: and you probably miss 3NT as well, which may be a good thing|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: this is the weakest part in precision|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: Still a non-trivial problem for east|pg||
nt|snorris: no more aces though|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i doubt passing 4@C will often be the right move|pg||
nt|mowen: I await a hand with 7@Ss then|pg||
nt|charles_l: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: has to find the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: now just has to make it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|snorris: best small @s|pg||
nt|jwit: 12 won't fetch however|pg||
nt|charles_l: This hand should take about two seconds also|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now they are too high and also in the wrong suit|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: they are already too high |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Stefan Skorchev, junior player in his early 20's, won the national pairs championship this year. Victor Aronov is reigning European pairs champion (with Stefanov)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that makes it easy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: I think anything but a trump will help declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: Now @S2-2 will make this easy, if declarer sees it that way|pg||
nt|snorris: will try to give pd ruff in @ds|pg||
nt|othered1: when push comes to shove, that's about what's left for east. |pg||
nt|othered1: If west has @CA, then declarer has @DK and @D would be right regardless|pg||
nt|snorris: the problem is it will not defeat the contract|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least they are playing in the right suit and may survive|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|snorris: sure if west has the ace|pg||
pc|cA|nt|charles_l: S not happy to see @DJ on table|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|charles_l: defence doing all the work|pg||
nt|mowen: good lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphb1: skorchev thought the bidding suggested not having a heart cue bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: well E has stoppers and 6 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|vugraphb1: @D was not a good move|pg||
nt|vlad9: yes showed the Q  of di  is not with the opener|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: although N could still have the Q|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I think NS play weak NT this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: so S could not have only 12|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: as the cards lie, no.  But west could have @SKX|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: good defence|pg||
pc|d7|nt|snorris: right|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mowen: the bad breaks in the minors could bring a big penalty here|pg||

nt|xenya: the small @S would have put declarer to a tough guess perhaps|pg||
nt|charles_l: @c continuation better maybe|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@s makes here|pg||
nt|snorris: a nice 6@hs|pg||
nt|othered1: NS has 3@S here, 4 if @D aren't cashed immediately|pg||
nt|snorris: and a save in 6@s|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on west's opening, lots of possibilities for action here|pg||
nt|snorris: 1nt :14-16 ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a partscore here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the too-far-long-ago days when I was new to the game, I once doubled a slam on two aces. This was OK, as my partner had the other two |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: ok|pg||
nt|sssvablue: If West opens a nt, ew will wind up in 2@s|pg||
nt|charles_l: i wonder if he tried @cs before @ds he might find S's shape|pg||
nt|mowen: could he do better?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: if he does not discard a @H I think it is 1 off|pg||
nt|jwit: Very good getting to 6S in closed room.  May be difficult to duplicate on these combined values.|pg||
nt|cicus: he decided w would have covered not knowing he has no clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is the flip side of opening |pg||
nt|vlad9: oto needs more imps to shorten the distance to the leaders|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1N - X (penalty?) - quite a hand for east to  hold|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north bid?|pg||
nt|cicus: in spite of CR result I think 3@D is makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Hello Henry|pg||
nt|cicus: oh no, crossruff available|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w missed out on a penalty in the other room|pg||
nt|cicus: played for the squeeze instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 1C opening will help, but still will need to be sharp to get there|pg||
mb|2D!|an|11-16 min 6 M|nt|santyclz: 4 card majors throughout? Or a 3rd seat adventure?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3@d showing @hs it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D was @H transfer?  Wonder why east didn't try to get suits in in natural order with such a good hand|pg||
nt|snorris: now north would like to have bid 3/4 @ss|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: will end up in 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt here is better than the heart game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: yes - 1@S +2@Hs + 3@Ds = 2@Cs = 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: EW are a newly formed pair|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Skorchev's partner went fishing :)|pg||
mb|3C|an|max w h|nt|mdgraham: I would think not, on that particualr hand - but what a result if he does|pg||
nt|charles_l: They fell into the trap of missing a slam on the second hand to compensate for the one they bidd on the first.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: having to b id 2@C on north's hand for system purposes is a severe minus to the method|pg||
nt|snorris: why is west timid?|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@s seems lazy to me|pg||
nt|jwit: Was just looking at the closed room auction, and West opened 1C and subsequently made two slam tries, which East did not accept, and West still keycarded and bid slam!!!!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|charles_l: the key to this is finding x facing xx in @d|pg||
nt|charles_l: and also if W doesn't open a NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Will be leaving you for England momentarily|pg||
nt|roswolf: east passing? or did thay show 5-7 hcp or something|pg||
nt|cicus: undisciplined 1NT took an undisciplined second bid|pg||
nt|cicus: thin game|pg||
nt|vlad9: 2di is what dean?    4441?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 4414|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: safe trip henry|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|mowen: I think south should bid 2NT over 2@H|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: or even 3NT|pg||
nt|charles_l: will show more than immediate 2N|pg||
nt|mowen: 2 down for 500 and a loss of 5imps|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe X would have been GF|pg||
nt|roswolf: well going for blood was the choice of the bold - now they just have to defend|pg||
nt|vlad9: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @Sxx|pg||
nt|snorris: a cuebid in @ds is ok|pg||
nt|cicus: defence should be very careful, W has to obtain a spade ruff|pg||
nt|cicus: a heart lead or a switch now is necessary to set this|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: still thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed, it's a 50% slam roughly, but hard to reach i think|pg||
nt|snorris: that was what east wanted to hear|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphb1: cant he make a lot of @Cs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mowen: with that good club suit he should try to play the hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6N is on the red suit squeeze after non-@d lead|pg||
nt|cicus: can N work it out?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|charles_l: all N needs is @SK @SHK?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: they are trying anyway|pg||
nt|charles_l: @SK @HK|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree on @D cue,  unless they have specialized agreements.  Like 5@D might have been "last train," and not specific to @D|pg||
nt|cicus: bravo|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes great defence|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kapitanski: in fact they play  precision|pg||
nt|kapitanski: 3d  position  open bid  here..|pg||
nt|roswolf: club back quickly|pg||
nt|sssvablue: a third trump will make declarer play carefully|pg||
nt|sssvablue: third heart|pg||
nt|charles_l: defence need some goood things to happen in @cs too|pg||
nt|roswolf: very tight but should be -1 i think|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: cant he make it if he quesses Ax in @S|pg||
nt|cicus: wrong time for second hand high|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|snorris: thats tru|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: N is a world class player. Many times national champion. Played in Bermuda Bowl twice|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: does N know S has 5 @Ss? This is important|pg||
nt|othered1: in which case bad trumps and @Sxx would be negatives|pg||
nt|snorris: or 5@cs denied @s cuebid?|pg||
nt|snorris: in wests eyes|pg||
nt|othered1: that's possible, too.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|charles_l: he thinks no|pg||
nt|sssvablue: The best thing to happen for the defense in clubs is not to play them|pg||
nt|cicus: this was not a great idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed declarer is home now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|charles_l: also @hJ is a huge card|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|snorris: anyway missed a good slam|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|othered1: It's difficult to diagnose where things went wrong without detailed system notes, which themselves may not cover auctions like this.  But east didn't seem to do much to  unwind his ...|pg||
nt|othered1: exciting hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: declarer has neglected to misguess @cs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c6|pc|h6|nt|charles_l: i just don't see how 4@s can be right|pg||
nt|cicus: ohhhh|pg||
nt|cicus: why did he cover?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not - ping pong hand this|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|sssvablue: A rather humdrum set so far|pg||
nt|roswolf: south was a hideous hog in the other room and got a deserved result|pg||
nt|vlad9: woke up a little bid late and missed the beginning of the shaw|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well more like a silly raise/sacrifice by west you mean|pg||

nt|charles_l: might change here|pg||

nt|charles_l: routine i would think|pg||
nt|mowen: My wife would:)|pg||
nt|charles_l: which improves the AKQ|pg||
nt|cicus: tough after a 2@C opening, to be honest|pg||
mb|2D!|an|relay|nt|roswolf: transfer?|pg||
nt|charles_l: 5@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 6@S now|pg||
nt|roswolf: i like that rather than 2@C as in the other room|pg||
nt|cicus: here they can stop at 2@S, probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: some opening by south|pg||
nt|vlad9: swing opportunity here for the trailing team|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: Precission ?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: N didnt alert|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C is a good shot|pg||
nt|jwit: I certainly like splintering after partner responds 1S, and the cue bid over 3S is fine, but with a dead minimum for a 1C opener, I would be done after 4S by partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt perhaps!?|pg||
nt|cicus: I was sure E would find a bid|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Min med D|nt|charles_l: calm 4@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: try finding that now|pg||
nt|sssvablue: pretty hard to get there over 5@d, unfortunately vulnerability is wrong for this action|pg||

nt|sssvablue: and in many parts of the world it is greater than 920|pg||

nt|charles_l: rehi|pg||
nt|sssvablue: a brief blip|pg||
nt|roswolf: is east still in the tank|pg||
nt|sssvablue: on board 4, they are also playing 2@s|pg||
nt|charles_l: BBO took offence at the 'trite and obvious' :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: but with honours to 8, i think 5@d is far from horrible|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 1@d doesn't actually cover hands with @ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|milton_se: this seems easy enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3rd in hand at red - even i would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 1@d shows @s apparantly|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: north taking a conservative view south the aggressive|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes just unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: west shows his strength|pg||
nt|roswolf: they must score here to have any chance of winning|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, that is discipline|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: actually if W didnt play the K of @H it could had been -1|pg||
nt|roswolf: east hasnt a bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s have missed the club fit|pg||
nt|vlad9: young players tend to bid often  - skorchev is about 20|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: he is 22|pg||
nt|vlad9: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: good time to pass;)|pg||
nt|charles_l: final contract 2@s i think|pg||
nt|charles_l: nope|pg||
nt|charles_l: perhaps 3@d over 3@c best|pg||
nt|cicus: hard to come in again after 2@H at the 3 level red|pg||
nt|vlad9: ok  ty  dean|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lady bids on|pg||
nt|vlad9: N even redoubled - everyone is feels very strong at the table|pg||
pc|hA|nt|charles_l: and the J10987 straight flush|pg||
nt|mowen: even better!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: @C systems are supposed to make hands like this easy |pg||
nt|snorris: 4@cs should be forcing but what about 4@cs after 2@ds settng the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s not on the same wavelength as to 3@H|pg||
nt|charles_l: now, here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup macho bridge|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: PROBABLY JUST THE 13 IMPS AWAY|pg||
nt|roswolf: as west i might have doubled again|pg||
nt|vlad9: but the lady conquered all the guys|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|charles_l: no invites over strong NT with 8 miltons and 4333|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks a push|pg||
nt|vlad9: not quite so  -  12 imps earned on 7   for oto|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: if this and deal No8 produce no swing Boriana will still lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|charles_l: its sometimes a good idea to play in 3N when you have lots of HCP|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: I like that, if it's within their system's allowances.  Perhaps it shows more extras than just a solid suit|pg||
nt|snorris: that might not be the meaning by e-w of course but I recommend it|pg||
nt|othered1: Now they'll get lucky by wrongsiding the contract in slam, if they get there.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shh, Geoffrey, you'll wake the children|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: they should find the spade ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: even better contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes gabor|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: Declarer is in a tough position.  He'd like to avoid losing an early trick to s, but ensuring at least 5 @c tricks is the priority.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|snorris: a slam reached anyway|pg||
nt|charles_l: ruff 3rd @d high?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: seems there is a squeeze against W here |pg||
pc|d9|nt|charles_l: yes quite simple now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|snorris: no 13 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris: this might give 3imp against feks 6nt in west|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: i should stop makig predictions :(|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mowen: well someone has to....|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: well declarer being kind to defence|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|cicus: a swing of 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|cicus: @D guess is routine|pg||
nt|vlad9: radkov had to ruff |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but difficult i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: west failed to give his pard a ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|nt|cicus: he should not lead another heart  as S ruffs in and nails him in dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: he showed the cards|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|xenya: W would have done better to duck @Cs twice but as the cards lie there is no escape|pg||

nt|cicus: yes, as in th eother room...|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: if they play 3@H for 140 they win 3 imps|pg||
mb|2D|an|2-3 spades says N|nt|charles_l: DBL from S shows @Ds as N has implied the suit|pg||
nt|snorris: dobl: lead your short major|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|snorris: ah..lead @s|pg||
nt|snorris: itworks very well here|pg||
nt|roswolf: south likes to bid|pg||
nt|charles_l: North 'knows' it's @cs|pg||
nt|sssvablue: How else are you going to preempt the opponents hearts ... especially the third opponent|pg||
nt|roswolf: well does south have to bid here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1@S may have created a forcing situation for NS, hence the X|pg||
nt|roswolf: now will n/s fall for the same lunacy|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will no doubt express an opinion|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north nid?|pg||
nt|vlad9: +200 is enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: bid|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 4@D -2 will gain them only 2 :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: with difficulty|pg||
nt|charles_l: CHO is usually the most dangerous one|pg||
nt|charles_l: your kibber is almost right|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: except the double :)|pg||
nt|mowen: can he avoid a loser in each suit?|pg||
nt|charles_l: @CA and another?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible not to double|pg||
nt|roswolf: cluck cluck |pg||
nt|vlad9: game missed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|milton_se: good result for NS|pg||
nt|charles_l: @H????????????????|pg||
nt|mowen: now.....could be in with a chance.....|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: charles stop making predictions :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: how much did S pay W to lead that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: no, they fall for another one|pg||
nt|roswolf: daft to bid though|pg||
nt|vlad9: yes  he doesnt know 2sp  was the best spot|pg||
nt|cicus: well, fellows, I have to fly to Egypt, bye, enjoy yourselves|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: this looks ok|pg||
nt|vlad9: bye  see you next time|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the red card|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: well if S reopens, I can't see why not with 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: presumably N's double followed by 2@S is intended to show a strong hand, but there is also room for misunderstanding in this kind of auction |pg||
nt|charles_l: what else can it be?|pg||
nt|snorris: 800 out of the blue|pg||
nt|mowen: hey, this is not football|pg||
nt|charles_l: you also have to knock out @HA|pg||
nt|jwit: Declarer will have to knock out heart before pulling all of trumps, and a fourth club could cause some consternation|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vlad9: big number is coming|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the moment of truth|pg||
pc|c4|nt|charles_l: oops|pg||
nt|xenya: you see..|pg||
nt|charles_l: another wrong prediction!|pg||
nt|charles_l: all that moot now|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Last deal. We'll be back in a few minutes|pg||
nt|roswolf: will still gain a bushel of imps|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good news in spades, if that is what declarer plays for|pg||
nt|charles_l: if in 4@s you use @h as replacement trumps|pg||
nt|jwit: However, not to worry, since they didn't get to game.  Not the best game in the world, and, perhaps correct to be a little conservative non vulnerable.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|vlad9: defance can prevail by ruffing a heart but not now|pg||
nt|vlad9: he wasted his entry for it|pg||
nt|vlad9: dobrodolski did very well to  double|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: The alternative (and winning) line was a @c to the ace and floating the @hj, ensuring 1312 with the possibility of picking up the @cs 2-2 for overtricks.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|xenya: perhpas they got their wires crossed, with all those doubles|pg||
nt|vlad9: 3nt is easy |pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|charles_l: if @c2 was 4th, W can continue. ah, he has.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: 3@S 3@h 1@d 2@C=nine tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: this is the last deal. We'll be back in a few minutes |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 11 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Deyan|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2 last boards 1-20 to 25-20!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: where was the trump lead|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|santyclz: The mp line.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i doubt e/w are aware of the likely trump position|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sssvablue: I think we missed it|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cicus: soon will be|pg||
nt|roswolf: :0|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mowen: this W doesn't save a lot in defense....|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|nt|xenya: N is not amused -- a small consolation is that they have missed a non-vulnerable game|pg||
nt|charles_l: N is trying hard to make only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: -1 coming up|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: he can endplay him|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Now this inelegant contract comes rolling home|pg||
nt|jwit: fourth club best now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|charles_l: 4th best leads. this means there are 3 suits better :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: no he can time the exit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cicus: in the meantime, this was the last hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: ? why not the heart?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mowen: claim|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jwit: not to be|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mowen: that is the worst defense I have seen since last Tuesday|pg||
nt|charles_l: what happened last tuesday?|pg||
nt|mowen: I played at a local club, with the wife...here in France|pg||
nt|mowen: looks like that's us done - Tx Charles & Kati|pg||
nt|charles_l: oh this was the last board|pg||
nt|charles_l: thanks all|pg||
nt|charles_l: esp Deyan|pg||

pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: North squeezed :(|pg||

nt|snorris: 1nt:south and what west ?|pg||
nt|charles_l: 5@d -1100 was indeed a 'routine push'|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Sry for the delay but there was an appeal|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|cicus: .|pg||
nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3@hs ?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Can NS find their 3nt here?|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@s?|pg||
nt|cicus: is this the match scheduled to 19:00?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jwit: 4S seems normal for NS on this one.  Will have to guess the heart to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@C should get them there|pg||
nt|charles_l: as Deyan knows, my predictions are usually inaccurate|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: yes it is.We are a bit ahead of scheduale but we have a party afterwards so ..|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphb1: still wondering |pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 5 of either minor looks good.|pg||
nt|snorris: 2@hs was 800|pg||
nt|snorris: with perfect defence|pg||
nt|milton_se: Ns pass a bit conservative|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: they are seniors |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D was wet imo|pg||
nt|charles_l: i prefer 3@H by S than 3@d|pg||
nt|sssvablue: why not just 3nt?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: :)|pg||
mb|4N|an|RKC|nt|charles_l: efficient bidding|pg||
nt|xenya: this should be easy|pg||
nt|charles_l: i might have tried stayman but same end contract|pg||
nt|xenya: a coffee hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: make mine irish :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 4-4@hs may still be in picture?|pg||
mb|5H!|an|2Aces no HQ|nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: X is mosern treatment, used to be for penalties in the old times|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Or 3nt.  Hard to believe s stayed out with 2 aces.|pg||
nt|charles_l: par achieved i think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Hi , Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this could be bloody|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: not the suit to raise..|pg||
nt|snorris: the @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: now might end in 9 tricks only with 11 from the start |pg||
nt|snorris: would be no problem if s started with 10 or 8 of @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: then just let it go,  now hehas raised the @cs for east|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: hi, geoffrey|pg||
nt|sssvablue: if partner had @h would (s)he not make a negative double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi deyan|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: lucky that north took a bullish view of the hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: depends on style i guess|pg||
nt|jwit: Should be down 1.  Not enough entries to set up hearts on this layout|pg||
pc|sK|nt|snorris: small @d now and let it go|pg||
nt|snorris: if not covered of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 2 ace slam|pg||
nt|charles_l: eg: xx Kxxx Q AKQxxx looks like 3@c to me|pg||
nt|charles_l: @c towards 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s settle for the game might have been better to defend|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: the standing before the last round is 1st:Boryana-182 2nd:Oto-175 3rd:Vito-174|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vlad9: this should fail|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: a real punt by east|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: N missed the spade lead which would have given chances for his side|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: only spade lead was for down 1 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: now it should be made|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: if @D led from dummy, east should play 10|pg||
nt|snorris: of course, but might not remember|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|sssvablue: However it is unlikely that partner will have AKQxxx of clubs when I hold the K :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|milton_se: surprising line -- why not Cs?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|nt|charles_l: details :)|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, if can do it if he leads a club to the10 and guesses hearts, not now though|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|snorris: remembered|pg||
pc|s5|nt|charles_l: playing to make i suppopse|pg||
nt|jwit: That seems like a bit of a long shot though.  After all, if the club K is on he is cold, and gives himself extra play here, if heart honors are split and guesses correctly|pg||
nt|charles_l: but making needs @hKx in S and a non-@d switch?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: this looks -1|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: good defense for down 1 |pg||
nt|vlad9: hi|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: declarer is doing all he can|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|snorris: some anxious moments by south but all is well|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: yup get in the way of a good comment|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: this might have its moments|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Momchil Aleksandrov. Great Job! Many thanks and our appreciation to the Bulgarian Bridge Federation ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for allowing us to broadcast from this event. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Stan and Charles for their wit and perceptive comments and to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|jwit: Didn't remember diamond was good|pg||
nt|charles_l: -200 was good, -500 ok, -800 bad|pg||
nt|jwit: This could be an interesting board|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: slam on finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 1st are Boriana :182  2nd are Oto: 175 3rd are Vito:174|pg||

mb|p|nt|mowen: Hi all - i am late again|pg||
nt|mowen: what have I missed?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 1NT is 8-11 |pg||
mb|1H|nt|snorris: 3 small @hs..in north|pg||
nt|othered1: double is normal but imperfect|pg||
nt|tweety1: a great 5 @c contract in OR |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt by south is cool|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: just a 500, stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: thin 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: I kind of like 4H with that distribution, but wouldn't be too good on this hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|snorris: south has 3@hs|pg||
nt|milton_se: the double seems to mean Cs|pg||
nt|roswolf: but nt likely to br played by north|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should join in now - double!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry the operator is deyan spasov|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Who has done a splendid job !|pg||
nt|roswolf: great job anyway:)|pg||
nt|vlad9: no idea - last year there were about 20 teams as far as I remember |pg||
nt|roswolf: ? what is that 8-10?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mowen: they plat tough in Bulgaria|pg||
nt|mowen: play|pg||
nt|cicus: a bit worse I think, could be 2 spade losers and hearts must behave|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3nt??|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes  |pg||
nt|milton_se: can W sit?|pg||
nt|tweety1: @c lead is the best here|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: @C lead will defeat 5@C I think ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorris: crazy..|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond partscore is ok too|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 10 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|sssvablue: getting awfully high here|pg||
nt|cicus: as it is , 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: but could also be 1 spade looser and hearts behaive|pg||
pc|d2|nt|charles_l: i think NS both overbid by a @s each|pg||
nt|roswolf: and will pay the penalty|pg||
nt|mowen: so a possible slam for e/w|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I dont thing they'll bid it|pg||
nt|mowen: west could have bid 3@H on the way to 3@S|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@h? hm.|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be difficult to stay out of salam here|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: this looks like 4@H +1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mowen: I guess you are correct Deyan|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: i mean by N|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder why S introduced his hearts at all, unless wants to invite slam|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: E knows he needs perfect cards |pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 1@D is 0-7 points|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|charles_l: another coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|tweety1: no |pg||
nt|tweety1: @s split friendly|pg||
nt|tweety1: can set up 2 @s|pg||
nt|tweety1: and discard 2 @d|pg||
nt|tweety1: and ruff 2 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: should play the 8 on first round|pg||
nt|milton_se: only one S trick?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I was just thinking of 3@S :)|pg||
nt|mowen: especially as they have stopped in 3@S|pg||
nt|mowen: very odd|pg||
nt|mowen: what was east thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I am just a VU operator I dont understand :0|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: :)|pg||
nt|jwit: This will not be easy|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: S is the better declarer probably|pg||
nt|cicus: for game purposes, spades are good enough|pg||
pc|h8|nt|charles_l: W worried about 5-1@c maybe as he wants to duck a @d|pg||
nt|charles_l: ok maybe not so coffee a hand|pg||
nt|snorris: -3|pg||
nt|snorris: or more..|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: last makeabe contract|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps he was thinking of 6@S and forgot they were not in game|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I doubt he was looking for slam after weak NT|pg||
nt|cicus: inferior game, could have been in jeopardy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: after mini NT actually|pg||
nt|cicus: then it makes no sense at all|pg||
nt|roswolf: fine aggressive game you play in bulgaria|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sssvablue: They did prevent EW from getting to 4@h ... that is the good news ... or is it?|pg||
nt|charles_l: so the vaunted double fit is not looking double-fit-ish|pg||
pc|hA|nt|charles_l: if trumps come in for 1 loser he does not need to ruff @ds (4@h 4@c A A)|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has remembered his initial pass|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think a @c ruff is needed?|pg||
nt|vlad9: so 19-11 is enough for oto to overtake boriana  -   is it 10 imps?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I think it is more than 10|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|charles_l: so use dummy entries to finesse @H|pg||
nt|xenya: best perhaps is to win in the dummy and take a @H finesse -- but there is no sure play it seems|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe he is trying to cater to @h4-1?|pg||
nt|xenya: W seems to be trying to find one though|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, he might also be concerned about @HKQ with N |pg||
nt|tweety1: if finess 8:)|pg||
nt|tweety1: double-dummy:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be definitely but 2 suiters are difficult to calulate exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 12-14 imps I am told|pg||
nt|vlad9: yes much testosteron in bidding in bulgaria:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|sssvablue: the spade fit is better on defense than offence|pg||
nt|jwit: Makeable, but declarer will have to be sharp|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|milton_se: problem is that N doesn't know anything about Ws hand|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: interesting slam in Open room Board 4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|roswolf: play should be quick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: sigh of relief -- and 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: now he can think about KQ9x with S :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: but everything is nice on this hand|pg||
nt|snorris: north must put up the ace of @ds right away when west plays @ds|pg||
nt|charles_l: don't think he can avoid losing a trump and diamond now|pg||
nt|jwit: You are right|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: @D lead would have caused more problems|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mowen: so south wins a trick which is more that the opening bidder will do|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cicus: he's got away with it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jwit: Looks like down 2 now|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|snorris: well..no matter now|pg||
nt|mowen: whilst 6@S was against the odds is was better than stopping in 3@S|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Interesting lead problem, I'd toy with both red suits before leading the @c.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Aronov and Trendafilov recently qualified for the national team which will take park in Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s8|nt|mowen: claim and look red|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes great slam|pg||
