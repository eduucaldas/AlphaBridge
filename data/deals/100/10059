mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  The Finns went down in five diamonds, hardly a gain for the Finnish team|pg||
nt|plateos: yes a risky deal, it should go down but defence may easily make mistake (eg. leading a @s)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: no endplaying either defender in spades unfortunately... 5@d isn't a bad spot|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|mtvesuvius: Close stop here though... I'd rather be in game here I think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|plateos: so the Norwegians will take a smaller buut surer plus than trying to make 5@d|pg||

mc|9|nt|mtvesuvius: or by claiming|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: thanks all :)|pg||
nt|plateos: Declarer's problem is that if long @c has @h A he would need to try 3-3 @s but then agains playing @s might give the 5th trick to defence (was)|pg||
