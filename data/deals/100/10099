nt|ahollan1: on the plus side [so to speak] Alan Sontag will go down Quickly|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can hope for K@H on side and J10 @c xx|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, folks, if you ever see Alan take time on a hand, call the cops.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and still go off|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: Sontag thinking!!|pg||

mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Push there, since Bates was down 2 in 4@h also|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: could see action here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: NS play Precision, so 1@H limited to about 15 HCP|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games make however we might be in one|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: so much for action :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: too early for Barnet maybe|pg||
mb|2D|an|2 way checkback|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: No, he is here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: probably a normal result in 4@H -- it's so much easier when you can see all the hands :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: if it is they're going to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: although if they can find NT...|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: couldn't see the explanation|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S was also off in Closed Room|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: NS are playing precision, 2@c shows 6+@c with 11-15|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: from the USBF site, you can not only access Sontag-Bates System Summary Form, but also copy of there WBF Convention Card from 2007|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Routine 4@h on the first, Trevor, can you get the NS names up here?|pg||
mb|d|an|alerted|nt|mariner1:  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=14   -  Convention|pg||
nt|mariner1: Cards (click on Players names to see system cards)|pg||
nt|mariner1: from there Al?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Walker is just blocking, and as it turns out, Rowntree may have opened up a can of worms|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: anyone for 3@H here?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: another relatively dull hand here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yep - click on the team name, then there is link to the WBF CC|pg||
nt|kareno: I would compete to 3@h with the south hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from the top page - the links only give you SSFs [System Summary Forms]|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|kareno: But now the double is confusing.  If 2@d shows spades and another, then what is double?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: the first was not so dull - a reasonable slam|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has a plat|pg||
nt|mariner1: play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Heart switch to beat it now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: at least the 2@C opener kept EW out of their spade fit -- not serious at IMPs, since they have the same 4 losers|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: unfav vul, partner 9+ cards in pointed [@S & @D] -  i'm not so sure|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mtvesuvius: Partner ducked the Club for a reason... Now Walker must give his partner the @h ruff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|buffytvs: over a standrad 1@C, East would get to bid spades I suspect|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least that's what i'll tell the directory after the hesitation|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: This lead may beat it, though.  Declarer needs just too much.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to hold this to 3@D and 1@C loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: scoring 3@S 4@C a @D and a @H|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mariner1: and indeed they made 3 in Closed Room however only in 1N|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @H back will cause an issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: however he can still make it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Bates immobile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem for Bates is that Prahin 3N screams double @H stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: and he could be off only 1 @c honor|pg||
nt|buffytvs: on this defense, 3@D is going down, while 3@S can still be made, so perhaps it all worked out for the best for NS|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S to j now and J@C|pg||

mb|1D|an|alert|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ BAL|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224 is the tournament website|pg||
nt|barnets: no sure the score is right here|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: will West act over 1NT?- is South too strong for 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And with a misfit they should stop in partscore.|pg||
nt|barnets: last board rcorded as slam making for e/w|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: can someone check|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so after South's pass, W wll probably play 1NT and not NS|pg||
nt|buffytvs: EW|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mtvesuvius: South is definitely too strong for a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do you like 1S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1st quarter scores still not available at http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2009/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious how other nations seem to have realtime scores but we can't get anything 4 boards into next set :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C shows the upper part of his 0 - 7 and usually 6+ @c and tolerance for @S|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice message for south.  unhappily if he bids on he won't be happy.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: south in a trance|pg||
nt|mariner1: think of this as 1N - transfer to 3@C from N's perspective|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@c probably won't fetch - n/s had a great result in the CR|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@C was a great stop|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course so would have been 1@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: things have stopped here too!|pg||
nt|kareno: Roger Bates not a speed demon.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: the only action is Sontag studying his watch|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mickey's big hand is on?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Sontag alert to danger of 1SX|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some pairs use 1@C-1@D;1@S-2@C as 3 card @S raise - so maybe 3@C just natural with no inference about @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Roger in tank to test Sonty|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hofstadter's Law in action|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: That sounds like the ad for Rolls Royce - 'the only sound you hear is the ticking of the clock'|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not one of the more robust 8-card fits, but it should work out ok|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Good pass but it will be hard for Alan to find nine tricks.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Who needs honors to play suits? :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: Prahin finds a winning lead.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: trump lead indicated|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: Oops.. Holtzman|pg||
nt|barnets: yes trump lead is standard here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I seem to be always saying this and it never happens|pg||

mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: East almost does best to blast 6@d|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: However I think this hand needs to be started with 2H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kareno: East bid 4@s to make.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this still beats 5@S - but i really didn't think it was top choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: It's not clear at this vulnerability whether 5@d was bid as a save or not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Nussbaum going minues at 5-level in both rooms -- which is biggest reason for Eddie's rule|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D was general insurance to 4@S I think|pg||
nt|kareno: But many, many expert pairs (not I by the way) at this vulnerabiilty play that after 4@s there is a force on the partnership at the five-level.|pg||
nt|kareno: 5/5 refers to when you push them, say, to 5@h and then you save AGAIN at 5@s.|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told by a spec that Dano's Italian notes make this a forcing pass situation.|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@d wasn't bid to make - he had already passed over 1@s.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Bates thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: Bates is always thinking :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rephrase - make the opponents make the last 5-level guess|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: No number of IMPs is ever enough :)|pg||
nt|barnets: almost no leads are entirely safe under about 70|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: no, then E would lead Q on first round, and when N showed up with king declarer would probably get it right on next round|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm told scores still not available on page where they belong, but ARE on home page http://usbf.org/|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2H probably a 2-way bid?|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: This is one of the losses of precision|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Federer is champion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H is a relay to 2S, after which opener clarifies hand type|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: same auction in the other room ---  quoting Grandma   "oy"|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, look at that result. |pg||
nt|kareno: I'm put in mind of Edgar Kaplan's GREAT advice:  You do better if you take out partner's takeout doubles and leave in his penalty doubles.|pg||
nt|kareno: Those hearts in east are NOT a surprise to the overcaller.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or -- just blame Al Roth for inventing Negative Doubles|pg||
nt|marlowepi: info courtesy of Joann Glasson|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the diamond dupoication is unlucky -- North's best card useless|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: probably 25-27 bal or Strong 2 w/@h|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if declarer guesses hearts he's ok|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: (according to Berkowitz's book)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very unlucky. N likely to make now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but he's more likely to try to get to hand with a club and finess ein hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont think so|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||

nt|odysseus69: are we sure that game is so desirable|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well, depending on your guesisng skills|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: You didn't double with ONLY the opponent's suit.|pg||
nt|mariner1: E played 6@H?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|mtvesuvius: then duck a heart into south|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: for an endplay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on heart shift, play ace then strip and lead toward heart queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but a different endplay, gaining when W has doubleton king|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can try to foil by ducking club king, but N should still prevail|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and if East plays the @HJ at the right moment?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E wins spade ace and plays heart immediately, basically do same thing. W can;t cash without yielding contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there can never be an advantage in playing heart queen early (not that i see, anyway)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Neil is thinking what to do if Ace.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: surprising he would win first round|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whatever the merits of this system--and there are many--i would be really annoyed about having to put the S hand down as dummy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, but it very rarely happens|pg||
nt|buffytvs: certainly makes the defense easier|pg||

mb|3H|nt|buffytvs: hard to reach now -- I persona;lly hate weka 2's with a 7-card suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kareno: If they play Drury it will come into play here.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is there another option besides 4@H at this point?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@d also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and thus obviously with you ,Ray :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I tend not to open a weak 2 with a 7 card suit... Especially since I like to open them with 5 card suits also :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Since east forced only to 3@h I think not.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are apparently multiple reasons to disdain the practice. i don't like it because i think 7-card suits should be opened at the 3-level if not good enough for 1. |pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: Is there a non-opener that gives play for slam?|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting|pg||

nt|kareno: Didn't he make an overtrick?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: no|pg||
nt|kareno: k|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so no swing, and still 6 IMPs in it with 4 boards to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the main purpose of the 3 level is for game exploration, and one flaw of forcing clubs is that the strong hands are already at a disadvantage because they spend the first round ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mainly showing strength, not shape. which means they are very likely to have choice-of-games issues, so the more space you can take up, the better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@S here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 11-15 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: make that 1@D=10-16 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone else a 3@s bidder here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: me Me ME|pg||
nt|mariner1: well if you bid 3 you might as well bid 4 :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: within reason, of course, and that is the gist of our disagreement--at what point is it outside reason|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|mariner1: Al is ambivalent :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I dunno.  Almost zero defense ... |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, but if they just stop worrying about getting to game, and double you, you often are in for a big number|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no problem, though--i am willing to be in the wrong. on some OTHER issue, of course :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yes i am - but soap and water will clear it up right away|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: I wouldn't have pulled 3NT with the South hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: really surprised at the initial pass. with stiff spade & 3 small hearts & no defense & colors favorable, 3D looks like a standout to me|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: I'd consider it, but it's very close for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: adam, it is OK to go for a number, you still get to keep your Bar Mitzvah presents|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Ruff 2@c in hand, and since the hand with 3@s also has 4@c, it can even make an overtrick I think|pg||

nt|kareno: I'm a 1@h bidder and on this hand it's a loser.|pg||
nt|mariner1: I even might Michaels :)  (yes the white coats are on the way)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with this shape, partner forced to bid, with 33 majors will choose @H so DBL has that going for it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe South makes some mild slam try instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nicely played, and an overtrick for an added bonus :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Potentially a big swing board here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|odysseus69: 1NT or 2H from West over 1S?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Board is placed incorrectly, Al.|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, the grand is not that bad, but not one you would normally want to be in|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|buffytvs: It's been suggested to me that EW should bid the grand since they are behind|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E did not bother with exclusion, as he can still find out about trump queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: however they don't know that necessarily|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think I would want to play 6@c here regardless|pg||

nt|odysseus69: still cant make|pg||
nt|barnets: dec had to play 3 rounds hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: then def could not stop the contract|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, that would help him|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I like the 2@H overcall, although it is a bit light at this Vul. btw|pg||
nt|barnets: they would have no communication for their clubs|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that is the key, and what would eventually allow it to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Roger is thinking long on this one.|pg||
nt|barnets: now they can beat dec different ways|pg||
nt|barnets: the h7 is a key card|pg||

nt|barnets: yes but if dec had the 7---|pg||
nt|barnets: cant really go wrong unless he plays a trump which he wont|pg||
