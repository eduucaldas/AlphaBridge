mb|1C|nt|geot: all about winning the bidding here. E/W may have chance in 3@C|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: Nothing is routine, Geoffrey. For instance, last night the Faroe Islands beat Denmark in the open series last night. It's like the Netherlands beating England at cricket|pg||
nt|roswolf: responsive double seems right here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Certainly not the best spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the cricket was truly disappointing - but vey well played by the Dutch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure a responsive double is right with 3-3 in the majors|pg||
nt|sommer: no, I like the 3@D better|pg||
nt|geot: Good bid from Thoresen, at least this time...  pushed them to the wrong partscore, it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D is her longest suit so why not bid it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: agree, but she believes pd has 4-4 I guess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sommer: S must expect at least 4-3 in MA in N|pg||
nt|geot: dont think it has to be 4-4, lots of hands you have to double (?), like this one|pg||
nt|geot: or should N pass?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|roswolf: missing a 5-4 fit imo is criminal|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||

nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||

nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||

nt|tjolpe:  most players use negative doubles here to day|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: i think looking at the compeitive bidding on this hand your singleton heart and dummy's  marked singleton diamond or much more relevant than how many points partner has for her ...|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: but why save if you think it might be going off|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kastan88: this 1@C= 16+ unbal or 15+= bal, thats why stopped in 2NT only|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N would be more comfortable here|pg||
nt|kastan88: their 1NT=12...14|pg||
nt|kastan88: and of course good afternoon Martin :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: good start for the Danes|pg||
nt|sommer: now the normal 3NT, EW may go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easily|pg||
nt|vugraphzqm: Klemmesen-Kirstan play natural 4+openings (@c can be 3 if bad 4@s333) variableNT (11-14 1st/2nd, 15-17 3rd/4th)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sommer: this is the time for a Moysian fit:).. the 4-3 @Sfit looks ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North may lead a club which is not so good. A heart is|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but unlikely to be bid i think|pg||
nt|sommer: ..well, down too with best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzqm: 2@c is weak2 in @d or 18-19 bal or acol @C/@H/@S or 25-27 bal|pg||

nt|geot: 4@S which is just theory has a chance, but would also go down if defenders are able to set up a club trick early enough, and also problems because spades are 4-2. Cant pull the ...|pg||

nt|mcphee: and the K@H is not worth a hill of beans|pg||
nt|lestergold: and east eosnt knwo what west has|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a W hand problem in my view|pg||
nt|mcphee: W has a WEAK hand with long @D|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back. Let's keep our fingers crossed. The operators have a very poor connection|pg||
nt|lestergold: you rarely find that people fins saves of 1100 against 143o vul slams|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Sandra 22, Emma 24|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again - can u defeat 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Anni and she is having a hard time. Please bear with her|pg||
nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are stuck again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|pelu: Vladimir - I take @D 10 discard 2@Cs ruff a @S and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes that's true -- you need to play a small @D early|pg||
nt|pelu: are we still waiting for the lead?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in mps there is a lot more to gain at imps you may save a few but what a disaster if you make a big sac and they cant make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom at this level |pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: NS will bid game here -- 3N or 4@H?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cenglund:  Not a very good decision|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another battle of communications and not helping declarer|pg||
