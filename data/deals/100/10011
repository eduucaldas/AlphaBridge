mb|2C|nt|kamras: transfer|pg||
nt|prof 1: hi all|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @hs north?|pg||
nt|xenya: a partial for starters|pg||
nt|xenya: is it a weak NT or strong?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 15-17 seems to fit the bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the @H fit found thix should propel  them to game |pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 14-16 maybe|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kamras: 11-13 NT med 2-3 spader|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: ska man inte bjuda 2 sp?|pg||
nt|bjurn: vad hade 1@S visat?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: för att undvika att fi kommer in i budgivningen på S kort|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C by S most likely |pg||
nt|hantveit: The bidding will probably stop very fast|pg||
nt|xenya: i think they will|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 15-17 I think|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly matters here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|snorris: well..|pg||
nt|xenya: but the uaction might be interesting with all those misfits|pg||

nt|Walddk2: bra kontrakt|pg||

nt|prof 1: critical 4@s contract|pg||
nt|snorris: can anyone double ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: S pass shows 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|hantveit: x from North to tell he has max would be painfull for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: *auction -- something is definitely wrong with my typing today|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H can make here .......|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C has an issue|pg||

nt|april7: if NS finds the @D ruff against 3@S EW goes 2 down|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|werge: Best spot here is 2 @H E/W - or 1 @H...|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @cs vs 3@d|pg||
nt|hantveit: close hands again, 21-19 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 20/20 -- some competition here? |pg||
nt|andyv:  2 way partials |pg||
nt|andyv:  but E/W should buy it for 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Not my cup of tee, such a suit-quality for a weak two - and now 2 @H will not be the contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hussein2: Would everyone consider wk 2 opening E hand? Looks light to me although it is on a favarobale vuln.|pg||
nt|prof 1: i think 3@d ppp|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but EW rate to win the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Why let the opponents go down, if you can manage to do it yourself...|pg||
nt|prof 1: i wonder who is thinking|pg||
nt|raghavan: Trend of boards in this set may be more part scores than games & slams|pg||
nt|snorris: a conservative pass in s|pg||
nt|xenya: not now maybe|pg||
nt|enachou: there 1sa is the contract on NS but impossible to play 1sa when you play 1sa forcing|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: hello again |pg||
nt|sybarra: and she made 6 @H well done |pg||
nt|werge: Nobody|pg||
nt|hussein2: Can this 3@d make? Doesn't look bad on 10@s lead. W might get endplayed |pg||
nt|sybarra: may need to play ace and a @D |pg||
nt|werge: In practice you are 1 down in 3 @D|pg||
nt|prof 1: -1 at least|pg||
nt|hussein2: If E did not exit with @h, her p will get endplayed!|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: I would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree Snorri, it seems like a minor fight, but 3spades NS is not a bad contract either|pg||
nt|andyv:  can it ever be right to balance with 1@d in these situations?|pg||
nt|xenya: a fairly routine 4@H for NS -- but also a fine save for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: north may come to regret her reponse here|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless she drops the auction right now|pg||
nt|april7: N should pass otherwise NS ends up in an unmakable game contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am surprised that with 19 south did not make a more robust /forcing rebid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjurn: 2@H är naturligt men med @C-håll skulle jag tro|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 2 hj alerteras antagligen för att det visar håll i kl|pg||
nt|minnie lee: lokks like 2@d. N has no bid because of the @h bid in W|pg||
nt|hantveit: Agree, think 1spade is an obvious bid for me also, too difficult to bid it later.|pg||
nt|snorris: would be otherwise if s bid @s first time|pg||
nt|xenya: yes it can it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't do justice to his hand|pg||
nt|xenya: well E is there...|pg||
nt|frankaus: that say 4@H by opps  is a transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: S's hand to strong for 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Cover...|pg||
nt|andyv:  how about a simple dbl over 1@d?|pg||
nt|frankaus: trafic light say green|pg||
nt|lestergold: south knew when to underbid her hand!!!|pg||
nt|april7: might be angry about teh pqass by NS but after seeing the dummy.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  Det stÃ¤mmer|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 Clubs for NS seems better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead will now make a extyar lub for a heart discard|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: 2 @D must must multi, including a big bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just guess I am afraid since I do not have their conv. cards |pg||
nt|xenya: the key feature here is the double fits for both sides |pg||
nt|lestergold: extra cklub|pg||
pc|h6|nt|arvidsson: intressant om man felaktigt spelar spader till Q och ruter|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Man kan gÃ¥ bet om man tar tvÃ¥ ronder trumf och misslyckas i sÃ¥vÃ¤l spader som ruter.|pg||
nt|xenya: but E opted to sarifice ven without knowing that|pg||
nt|frankaus: the light 1@S overcall has done the trick here|pg||
nt|xenya: *even|pg||
nt|enachou: strange lead from N|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  Roland, do you know what NT range E/W play?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hussein2: @h now is a must!|pg||
nt|prof 1: now it is easier|pg||
nt|xenya: but turns out to be quite effective|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Inte Moroten inte|pg||

nt|prof 1: @c ten|pg||
nt|hantveit: K108xx, x,xx,Axxx and I still think you should bid 1spade|pg||
nt|minnie lee: right but S passed with his @s|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|xenya: all woiuld have been easy for EW had E opened 1N -- but it looks like they are playing a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all. Sorry for being late.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashid|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Rashid|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can get 2 club ruffs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|enachou: @h and @c ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: E knows W is short @H and with a stiff @D  the save is quite clear after the @S overcall|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's 8 of spades will come into its own|pg||
pc|d5|nt|werge: Ils ont filé le coup, like the french say|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: sure club 10 because you can see cards |pg||
nt|minnie lee: agreed, I would have bid 1@s|pg||
nt|april7: helpful lead by W|pg||
nt|april7: now @C ofcourse|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hussein2: loll|pg||
nt|hussein2: Lucky Nessrine! |pg||
nt|sybarra: just any high card in dummy pls |pg||
nt|hussein2: She will play the Q|pg||
nt|prof 1: no it is the worst return but the only chance to avoid the end play|pg||
nt|werge: One good thing to be said abaout Easts defence - she did not use the information, Wests hesitation in secend round of @D had given!!!|pg||
nt|prof 1: she has the J  u dont see|pg||
nt|sybarra: are they playing with screens?   I would assume so |pg||
nt|werge: But screens do not eliminate hesitation during PLAY|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: she forgot to count her tricks - had to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello peter |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes needed one ruff in hand |pg||
nt|pelu: hi Sherley|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hussein2: WD Hussein :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
nt|andyv:  if playing a strong club, doesn't dbl show a 17-19 NT hand in this situation?|pg||
nt|enachou: S can't guess that K@c is a singleton|pg||
nt|enachou: it's not good to lead a K singleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: malani should get the credit for this swing should it not be replicated in the CR|pg||
nt|xenya: well actually you don't need any ruffs here to set it 2 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: but the @C's are foing to come home |pg||
nt|werge: East defence: TOO fast|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: no use ducking on generalprinciples|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: declarer can't control the hand |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|xenya: i think pass would show that|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: @C now to set up the suit -- fror 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: another club now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: well played bu south|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: nice defense|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: what does she think?  someone throwing away K of @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  i would think pass is 1 round force with no clear direction (i.e. no @d stopper)|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, E just might have upgraded his hand, playing a natural system|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: would earn all the match points for sure |pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: likely a nice result for South Africa|pg||

nt|andyv:  -200 or -300 very possible|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: mind you if south leads singleton diamond (a poor choice with qjx trumps) it could let the game thru|pg||
nt|april7: its close to a mirror hand and if EW reach 4 @S E can't make it .Depends on @D play whether 1 or 2 down|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: playing WJS (weak 2@S/2@H) over 1@C N would bid 2@S |pg||

pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: en straf om han gissar spadern, och det gör han. 6 IMP till Everfresh|pg||

nt|andyv:  spade shift by S would have been quick curtains|pg||
nt|frankaus: in not certain they forgot - many would pass 2@S to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|xenya: S meant 2@S as pass or correct: N has to pass with @Ss and bid his suit otherwise |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|timmy5: very dangerous contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: error|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: always run if Xed|pg||

nt|snorris: think his best chanse is cash @cs  and @hs and endplay east so he gets @s up to aq|pg||
nt|raghavan: PlayH and play 4th H - he gets 2 S|pg||

nt|bjurn: nja, än finns det väl möjligheter för Scania. |pg||
nt|timmy5: or 6d?|pg||
nt|minnie lee: or 6@d?|pg||
nt|raghavan: y|pg||
nt|snorris: 6@cs in north a possibility|pg||
nt|snorris: here|pg||
nt|xenya: -3?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S X would be quite expesive|pg||
nt|xenya: something starnge has happened in the play here -- why didn't N pitch the @S loser?|pg||
nt|april7: now we have a grand!|pg||
nt|daman: the grand salami|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will do well to bid it with confidence we can count 13 top tricks but they have to count them in the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have excellent save in 7h if they are allowed to play there|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S  3 or 4@D or only 2 and if NS finds their good fit in @C and the void in @H the grand is bidable|pg||
nt|lestergold: or 7d for that matter|pg||
nt|april7: 7@D might push NS to 7@S!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has all the potential for a brief but exciting auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has a difficult decision as to what to open|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 4s|pg||
nt|april7: without oponents bidding its easy:1@S 2@C 4@H and so on|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Avram but at this vulnerability east would be  in even over a 4s openere|pg||
nt|daman: this is a baby grand   not getting there would be cause to revamp your bidding system|pg||
nt|lestergold: a baby gfrand George with no interference yes|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S X is also possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the baby might grow into a stroppy teenager|pg||
nt|daman: with warts|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: He will open 1D|pg||
nt|hantveit: they did bid 1spade on board 2 in the open, gaining 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: teoretiskt, ja|pg||
nt|werge: That was what West ought to have played...|pg||
nt|werge: Here 140 is a cood score for E/W|pg||
nt|raghavan: so may be in D contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: 2d for majors|pg||
nt|snorris: 6@ds also ok|pg||
nt|hantveit: if 2 shows both major, I think I would prefer 4 spades here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d not enuf!!|pg||
nt|daman: will get there now   3@C by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 5d?|pg||
nt|daman: then 5NT|pg||
nt|daman: to make sure|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hantveit: But can be a bit hard to give up the 3nt so early|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: Scania behöver 21 IMP på 8 brickor samtidigt som antingen Everfresh eller Hans-Ove behöver tappa 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.egypt-bridge.org/Zone%2009.asp|pg||
nt|minnie lee: 6@d to play|pg||
nt|raghavan: will be pushed to 6D|pg||
nt|timmy5: i think yes|pg||
nt|xenya: things haven't been going too well for Egypt so far|pg||
nt|andyv:  played N for Jxx of hearts|pg||
nt|april7: 5NT now by N:Josephine|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u mean north'sname is Josephine or Josephine grand slam force|pg||
nt|april7: then 7@C and 7@D and then 7@S:):)|pg||
nt|daman: sfar's first name is Napoleon|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: nexi 12 IMP for Egypt from the 4@H misplayed - 3NT making in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: You are welcome to play with me - but please know, that I do NOT bid 2 @D...|pg||
nt|sybarra: website but they are not posting results that I can find |pg||
nt|hantveit: I prefer to give as much information I can to my partner, look how difficult it is now for North. |pg||
nt|hantveit: 4 hearts would make things very easy for North.|pg||
nt|timmy5: but 6sp is not bad at all|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 5spades now, and they might still find 6D|pg||
nt|minnie lee: 6@c would help alot|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, 6spades do not look too bad. -3 is it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have th eright idea but not taking up enough space|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: take a look at the venue! |pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S was weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 2 sp eller x?|pg||
nt|raghavan: How to enter Yousry hand in 5S|pg||
nt|hantveit: there is the pass...|pg||
nt|hantveit: With single heart, spade ace, and club ace and king there should be possible for north to bid 6d now|pg||
nt|minnie lee: last hand a pass on 3NT and now no help to play a grzat contract...either in @c or @d|pg||
nt|raghavan: Vul is a fear|pg||
nt|snorris: a  better bid in north was 5@cs instead of 5 @ds|pg||
nt|minnie lee: the best bid was 2@h|pg||
nt|snorris: then south would bid 6 |pg||
nt|timmy5: this delay might prevent east west from bidding 6spds|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would not reveal my hand  by bidding C|pg||
nt|timmy5: if N-S bid 6ds|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, only 6 losers and a good 5 card suit, so 5 clubs is a good bid. But the negative is a little bit weak trumph|pg||
nt|xenya: excellen slam here -- think they'll get there|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H slam here|pg||
nt|daman: has to bid 7 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north lost the plot in this auction|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT is so simple|pg||
nt|daman: my mother would bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east west may get awy with a save in 7h doubled if tghey do they will make a massive profit|pg||
nt|april7: whay 3 @S? if the @C are rigid then 13 tricks in @C so 5NT was best forN|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjurn: jag hade föredragit Dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: now @S X|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3S was an awful lost opportunity|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamras: Eftyer att ha förnekat 3-korts är väl Ax ok att bjuda 2Sp på|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 6@Cs but at @C-lead will make life hard for decl|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 3 trump-loosers and - at least - 1 @D|pg||
nt|raghavan: take a + score|pg||
nt|hantveit: This will most likely be a gain for East West|pg||
nt|snorris: a good board for e-w again|pg||
nt|timmy5: very good actually|pg||
nt|raghavan: Kope does not lead CK|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope|pg||
nt|timmy5: if they dont get heart ruff will be even better|pg||
nt|frankaus: will make 13 i expect|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is too powerful to stop short of 6@H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: 7 makes on a trump finesse -- so it shouldn't be bid |pg||
nt|daman: this is a joke really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes now what? n/s cannot guess their way to the grand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|arvidsson: nu skulle sivve sitta vid bordet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: x i 3hj och massor av imp in|pg||
nt|bjurn: jo, men visar inte dubbelt också acceptans för @Sn?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hade inte 2nt visat 4-6 i @d @c?|pg||
nt|bjurn: varför sälja ut @D-färgen när man kan hålla liv i alla färger med dubbelt?|pg||
nt|andyv:  sound contract|pg||
nt|daman: they did|pg||
nt|april7: very good bid by S!!!|pg||
nt|daman: comedy of errors|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they did oh my i preictedf an exciting auction but i could not have dreamt this one up for a hefty pay packet|pg||
nt|daman: EW will have a hard time explaining this to their team|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear the excellent save pushed them to the grand they couldnt find by normal bidding|pg||
nt|april7: S can't imagine a void in @H with N and only  15 HP,so must bid 7!!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|werge: After 4 boards, 31 IMP´s at stake|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S was a real reach imo  |pg||
nt|hussein2: One important fact here; this zonals is being played in Sharm El-Sheikh wich is extremly hot at the moment -- keeping in mind the wethear, I am sure ladies will tend to swing ...|pg||
nt|hussein2: seeking some cool air :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and a nice sequence|pg||
nt|rnmalik: reasonable contract and should make|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

pc|s3|nt|frankaus: they will know they miss a KC|pg||
nt|april7: remember N opened 2@C!!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: S should know they are missing a keycard now, so just small slam|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: good|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: are we headed to 6 @C or 5 @C?|pg||
nt|pelu: if u play '1430' u can bid 4NT now : 5@C = 1 A and u pass and 2@H = 2Acws and u bid 6@C|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kamras: Visst Björn, men kanske inte Hx. 2NT kanske överdriver rutern. Svår avvägning mellan dessa tre bud|pg||
nt|sybarra: the sequence of pulling to 4 @C should make @C slam easy to bid  |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|pelu: to make 6@C u need to set up the @S-suit or ruff 3 red cards in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a commentators curse comment |pg||
nt|pelu: ok 1 down in 4@S with a play for 6@C - Reunion have a bad start on this match|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|april7: its not over yet, @C must greak|pg||

nt|rnmalik: no CA+HK+AS|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @C is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it if they were not prepared to bid 7  in the first place what made them so confident to bid it given a second chance what was the new info?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D  p 1@H-p- 1@S -1NT |pg||

mb|3H|nt|kamras: Vid andra bordet Återbjöd Nord 2Sp i stället för 2Hj, som han kanske inte tyckte han hade kort till. Men då tycker jag man hellre passar på 2Ru|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the problem for West is that they play 2@D as GF opening - and then it is almost impossible to show a 2-suiter|pg||

mb|3S|nt|xenya: if penalty, W's double is very lazy i think|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|hantveit: Samjee led a spade vs 3nt on board 3 = 10 tricks. |pg||

nt|westjava: bad contract,your mom say...|pg||
nt|don_kapu: better wak westjava|pg||
nt|otoj: Dangerous hand for both...especially US to bid 4S..|pg||
nt|sssvablue: The correct way to play the heart suit is to finesse twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: P - P - ??|pg||

nt|raghavan: How is the distribution here? |pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: will lead C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chthonic: but the conract looks normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|otoj: rule of 20: If you hcp + ur card length over 20, then open the hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: ok Rule 21>|pg||
nt|motivasi: yes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|motivasi: not much in play and bidding,|pg||
nt|otoj: for example, with 5-5 and 10 hcp, total is 20.. then can open the hand|pg||
nt|don_kapu: rule 21, act no 1. the boss never do wrong and act no 2. if the boss do wrong, see act no 1|pg||

nt|motivasi: the fact trump split 5-0 make this contract not much different than 3NT|pg||
nt|chthonic: West's six of hearts seems suit preference?|pg||
nt|chthonic: so there should not be a club shift|pg||

nt|andyv:  5-5...2N asks other suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: asking for feature?|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 2@S is a bit too heavy here, if it denies normal opening values|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like a polish weak 2...2 spades shows 5 spades and 5 of other suit...5-10hcp or so|pg||

nt|enachou: that show 6@c 16 17pts|pg||
nt|santyclz: It was one which required "Least Lie" bidding.  I guess mixing a @c up in your @ss is probably the best thing you can do.|pg||

nt|don_kapu: fly to pluto @H@H|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Run away from partner who will ask why you bid 6@d |pg||
nt|chthonic: well bid hand both sides -- except maybe should get to 4S faster -- then maybe no double.|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: or maybe 5H|pg||
mb|1C|nt|westjava: hahaha|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: P - 1@H - P - 1@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 4S and all pass|pg||
nt|westjava: and no trouble|pg||
nt|motivasi: yes,might be better...and had a potential bid 5C too from E|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|chthonic: Did East really forget to unblock the diamond ace?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sssvablue: A practical bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: you wrong,don|pg||
nt|don_kapu: u right Raghavan|pg||
nt|motivasi: guess so|pg||
nt|westjava: just need 1 trick from @D i think|pg||
nt|chthonic: I was not seeing it, but failure to do so allowed the contract to be made.... ruff last club cash two hearts, exit diamond..... ruff sluff for contract.|pg||
nt|ptbambich: 6 pls...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: previous board|pg||
mb|6C|nt|raghavan: first time|pg||

nt|sybarra: easier from here|pg||
nt|pelu: Reunion on the scoreboard - the overtrick in 4@H, where N forgot to take the master @HQ|pg||
nt|werge: Game in a red suit here|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @D ?|pg||
nt|prof 1: i like the 1h openning|pg||
nt|hantveit: well done EW, this is looking terrible for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@C -- Dbl -- 1N -- all pass?|pg||
nt|xenya: E's pass looks a bit conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 1 @H Where?|pg||
nt|prof 1: by N, missclick|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: pass?????|pg||
nt|werge: Now 3 @D from West, pls|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bd 5 they went to 6SX-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  och den tredje rutern?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, if they're not playing a forcing @c.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: red and pard is unpassed hand yet,  you overcalling? |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Off we go...|pg||
nt|hantveit: god sacrifice vs 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|timmy5: 3nt now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Arne Larsson öppnade med 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: ÖV kommer inte in här|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: eller ....|pg||
nt|prof 1: where is the stopper??|pg||
nt|werge: Why not just bid 3 @H = show, what you have...|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry 4 @H, I mean|pg||
nt|prof 1: that would be NORMAL|pg||
nt|werge: BRIDGE, they call it|pg||
mb|p|nt|enachou: yes they play forcing@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: nu bjuder Öst och kommenterar "jag har inte kommit för att passa"? :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  3NT av VÃ¤st gÃ¥r vÃ¤l inte att beta|pg||
nt|pelu: I would have bid 3@D in S - they play 4 card @D opening - 2@D= 11+|pg||
nt|snorris: not the best contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: but almost normal|pg||
nt|hantveit: It is terrible to feel you are doing everything wrong, easy things are suddenly hard. I had the same feeling last sunday, for those of you who watched...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Finessing D 10 is need to make 3NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @hs had chanses|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahh, that explains some things.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if he's getting the ruff he needs to beat this.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: well hard to make this as cards lie|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: bid your hand first time - this could cost a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @D also,  maybe I can keep them out of the bidding |pg||
nt|xenya: should be a quick 1 off on this lead|pg||
nt|april7: this contract is goind as also 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: hjowever defence has to find the spade switch after the forced dim duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho what else can east play she cannot play passive with that club suit sitting in front of her eyes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Det tog lite längre tid att komma till samma kontrakt som i slutna rummet. Larsson gör allting snabbt|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: and then pd can decide if we have to go on to 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: kill point now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hA|nt|hantveit: better to duck the diamond q, but difficult|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|werge: Not EVEN in this hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Mens den spiller færdig, er det tid til at sige nogle afsluttende ord. Det bliver så på dansk ....|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north decided not to duck so it will go off easily|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|werge: What can East possibly have been thinking after partners bid - at 3-level and in a suit, where you have K D B 4 - the answer is not very polite...|pg||
nt|werge: And 3 NT is no winner, 8 tricks are not enough|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: @C to A and 3! @C-ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c seems pretty unilateral here...i guess the pass cards were missing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|timmy5: defenders can make things harder if S doesnt cover the first diamond declarer will have to guess|pg||
nt|raghavan: if D is ducked - will take 4 clubs - down 1|pg||
nt|timmy5: not ducked|pg||
nt|snorris: no..south shouldnt cover the queen|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Næstsidste spil i denne kamp og vores transmission fra Sverige. Mange tak til Ida, Mikael og Johan Grönkvist, vores fremragende operatører i Örebro. Virkeligt flot arbejde. Uden ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: jer ville der ikke have været noget at vise!|pg||
nt|timmy5: south had a better play to play small on the 1st diamond|pg||

nt|sssvablue: Didn't you hear about the 1 hour time difference between New York and Washington?|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|sybarra: must have missed the memo |pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|raghavan: missed memo|pg||
nt|motivasi: direct bid to show some value with E even with 4 cd|pg||
nt|chthonic: Looks like more than a 2H raise to me|pg||
mb|2S|nt|westjava: Memed Hendrawan,safety bidder...|pg||

nt|chthonic: Well, he apparently told of 3 card support and allowed partner to choose|pg||
nt|westjava: a very good bidding control by EW |pg||

nt|snorris: so e-w even lucky on the mis-bid boards|pg||

mb|1C|nt|arvidsson: hur ser kampen om silvret ut?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: tätt tätt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hantveit: East did not want to bid 2 clubs on 1nt because opps would get information. |pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  tied match as E took a rather unique approach to 4@s contract on board 7|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S by W on a @C lead or finding the @C Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: though 5 @D is a very good save|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|daman: they won't find 5@D|pg||
nt|april7: S not strong enpough for 2NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|snorris: 3nt or 5 @ds |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, not easy to see how that 4@S could go down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did s not have a natural 2@d available or did he choose not to make one?  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s should make because the hearts will show up 5/2 on discovery play trhus making it more likely that south has the club length|pg||
nt|april7: but E took the bid away|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: f.n. har Hans-Ove 151 och Everfresh 150 med två brickor kvar att scorea|pg||
nt|raghavan: 26 between them - land in 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|werge: 1 down|pg||
nt|hantveit: jump to 3nt = minimum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  d v s bÃ¥da lagen har tvÃ¥ givar kvar|pg||
nt|sybarra: safely in 2 @H  |pg||
nt|pelu: is it tiome now to bid 3@D? - easy for me - I can see the S-hand :)|pg||
nt|werge: If West covers the secend @C from hand, she will get a @D-ruff instead...|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT must be a form of Bergen|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card limit raise|pg||
nt|april7: as before|pg||
nt|lestergold: or it may be a raise to 3s or better|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hantveit: Do we know what 3 clubs is?|pg||
nt|snorris: natural it seems|pg||
nt|timmy5: fit|pg||
nt|april7: hand  3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have the ultimate discovery play at trcik 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W pulled 2 rounds of trump and then ruffed @d in dummy... was stranded with 2 heart losers|pg||
nt|daman: making 4|pg||
mb|5S|nt|timmy5: 4 clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and it was very well executed as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: what is 2C|pg||
nt|snorris: 4. suit|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||
nt|raghavan: then he says he has clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: the latter i think|pg||
nt|daman: next hand|pg||
mb|6N|nt|bjurn: 1@C är dubbeltydigt (11-13 NT eller 17+); 1@H är naturligt, 8+|pg||
nt|timmy5: not necessary|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  jag undrar vafÃ¶r inte Anders bjÃ¶d 3NT pÃ¥ 1NT och visade sin 17-19 hand med 5ko spader?|pg||
nt|bjurn: 1@S visar @S med starka handen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: han ansåg nog att sina 19 kunde vara för bra mot händer som passar på 3nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 tricks likly..maybe 12 ?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|timmy5: but East has a description he can make so why not|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: look at the movie,7 @S contracts!!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|timmy5: 11 only|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 tricks, but some communication issues|pg||
nt|hantveit: with dia 2-2 there are no dangers, but dec dos not know that|pg||
pc|h9|nt|arvidsson: och ville göra en mild invit  till högre höjder|pg||

nt|sybarra: this gets messy |pg||
nt|timmy5: but when he playes he will know|pg||
nt|hantveit: now it is over :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Definately an iffy one.  Standard in the jr's and midnight swiss.|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a great believer in leading singletons against suit contracts but i think here that north had  quite a lot of stroength to hope to fins south with a fast  entry to get a club ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: which hand,Andre?|pg||

nt|henryb: 13 in clubs by ruffing a spade!|pg||
nt|westjava: E or W?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Maybe both?|pg||
nt|motivasi: i've just thinking when Helgemo playing a grand slam hand with 4-3 fit.....but of course not in this hand :)|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@C jump shows 19 up|pg||
nt|chthonic: The risk is bidding unmakeable 7|pg||
nt|henryb: 7@c is a pretty good contract, but might go down on the @d lead|pg||
mb|4N|nt|westjava: back to Gorontalo|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: hi all welcome this is round 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: tks Githa|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 3nt is not as challenging as 4NT|pg||
nt|chthonic: so ask for the QH and settle in 6NT|pg||
nt|motivasi: but the possibility is open neither you can had all of your spade loser truff |pg||
mb|5H|nt|westjava: ur pd 19 and u have 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: final bid 6C|pg||
nt|westjava: slam in @C|pg||
nt|henryb: Tobing meant this as RKC in clubs; Bojoh responded in hearts|pg||
nt|chthonic: or clubs|pg||
nt|motivasi: even a grand slam in club is possible here|pg||
nt|westjava: I dont think so Henry,@C was ok|pg||
nt|chthonic: if partner has 19 for sure, the extra points are somewhere... diamonds most likely|pg||
nt|henryb: @d lead. No entry to draw trump after taking @s ruff|pg||
nt|motivasi: yes,you right henry....|pg||
nt|westjava: thinking abou 6 or 7|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|henryb: It is a good grand: needs no worse than 4-2 in both minors, about 70%|pg||
nt|motivasi: will u chase that 70% rather than afraid for something's 30|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|henryb: 70% is plenty when the other table is probably in slam on power|pg||

nt|henryb: in abstract, not just on this layout where 6@h will go two down|pg||

nt|prof 1: good action in this board|pg||
nt|april7: South Africa is trailing because  of the grand slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Välkommen till Jan Kamras|pg||
nt|vugraph814: Det är dock ingen i detta rum som gör :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  MÃ¶jligen junioren Berik sjÃ¤lv|pg||
nt|werge: A nice 5 @D here, difficult to bid|pg||
nt|snorris: 4@ss e-w|pg||
nt|hantveit: club ace and new club would be the best defence - with open cards :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
mb|p|nt|prof 1: 1@s - x - 2@s|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, 4sp is a fine contract|pg||
nt|minnie lee: I am a sceptic so when I see 2@c bid, I would lead A@c to see the dummy and when the Q falls small @c because I have 1-2 potential tricks to get back with the @c again|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C -- both majors?|pg||
nt|april7: it wasn't the best bidding sequence|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|werge: Trup-lead seems to kill 5 @D, otherwise it makes|pg||
nt|prof 1: p p x p ??|pg||
nt|werge: Trump|pg||
nt|hantveit: that would be a great lead :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2nt a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|minnie lee: that would have been my lead...eyes closed!|pg||
nt|xenya: if so, E must be pleased|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7 of either minor rolls, but even 6 may be tuff to bid.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|werge: pass|pg||
nt|prof 1: i aggree with S pass with bal hand|pg||
nt|snorris: 2nt showing the unbid suits..|pg||
nt|snorris: strange..|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am not sure I would make the club A lead. Even with my eyes open :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will bid 4 S - has enormous strength|pg||
nt|minnie lee: nothing to loose and everything to gain!|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS might have a very agressive style on the 2h bid, making south bidding a carefully pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: i wouldnt lead ace of clubs if anyone told me queen is singelton|pg||
nt|april7: first 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: who will take 7 tricks first? 7 in major for EW - 7 in minor for NS|pg||

nt|Walddk2: understand Swedish an advantage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you can always look at the pictures|pg||
nt|kamras: Hej|pg||
nt|werge: But West is bidding Easts cards also...|pg||
mb|p|nt|prof 1: lolll, the pass is strange|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i fear a doomed game on the way|pg||
nt|april7: do they play weak NT? or precision?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|timmy5: Invitational hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 3n has more prospects than 4h|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: what does 4N mean in this situation, i wonder -- do they know that?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: 1@D alltid obalanserat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11-16|pg||
nt|raghavan: and H A will be lead for a club discard|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess would be that 3h is a good raise with spade support|pg||
nt|hantveit: trumph out after these actions is to recommend...|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes possible|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Take the plunge!  You know you wanted to bid 6 over 4@ss.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: avoided going overboard-tricky hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: Pass showing 1st round control of @ss.|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's hand very suitable for no trumps very uncopmfortable for hearts|pg||
nt|daman: they landed on their feet|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid ladies|pg||
nt|lestergold: stil hard work tho|pg||
nt|daman: a lot easier than 4@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hantveit: 11 easy tricks, next pls|pg||
nt|daman: ouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a lot easier with this lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: absurd lead|pg||
nt|daman: totally|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|xenya: whatever NS do know, they win the board|pg||
nt|lestergold: qc lead looks sensible|pg||
nt|daman: not on the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: ity happens to give a trick and of course west cant return them but it looks, like the best shot|pg||
nt|april7: N will finesse the @H correctly,why not @C lead? needs very little from partner|pg||
nt|daman: @Cs were bid and supported|pg||
nt|daman: partner is like to be void    that's why|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok klead a second suit of the opps like spades not the first suit bid on ur left|pg||
nt|daman: you could give away the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a hand advertised as strongish|pg||
nt|daman: yes   a @S would be better than a @C imo|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: With the mirror minors, the sac is a little to expensive.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: now N can give up a @S and so making his necessary tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: or not -- they need to beat it by 5 -- perhaps they can't do that?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|timmy5: u have to tell the players that|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Only -4, you're right.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  declarer is making things a bit difficult for himself|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|santyclz: Oh well...|pg||
nt|xenya: @DA looks very starnge, with Kx in view|pg||
nt|daman: we are seeing things double dummy   think about putting yourself in East's seat and go from there    not every contract should be beat|pg||
nt|april7: communication problems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: nortyh houild be asking herself why did east lead a short heart?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hantveit: The 2H bid increased the possibility for south to hold 4 diamonds, but east has 10 trics even with dia 4-1|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c9|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  N should have ducked |pg||
nt|rnmalik: before playing 9@D he should cashed AK@H to make it easier for himself.|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well not the best line the sure spade trick should have been set up|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hantveit: I am in norway, I cannot shout that loud...|pg||
nt|enachou: yes very strange :(|pg||
nt|daman: not the worst declarer play    quite good in fact|pg||

nt|hantveit: By the way, we have beautifull sunshine here in Oslo today, very nice...|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5 clubs is a beautifull contract, but how to reach it?|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5d is even a better saving|pg||
nt|snorris: if north opens|pg||
nt|hantveit: Must open 1 clubs|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Dom kommer kanske i 4@H här, men den går att beta|pg||

nt|raghavan: they have 44 fit in S |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n also|pg||
nt|april7: what doesX mean now?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: 2 over 1|pg||
nt|april7: hoping that W has a 2@H opener|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tjolpe:  Den gÃ¥r i vart fall inte att spela hem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H normalt svagare än en 2@H öppning, i alla fall som jag spelar|pg||
nt|hantveit: ouch|pg||
nt|timmy5: ouch ?|pg||
nt|snorris: d: take out|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl over 4 clubs is showing secondary support in major and cards, east might pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes ofc|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Vul fear|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: if it shows major fit, then take out|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H has a play here, so 4@S looks like a good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Great sac.  The only problem is 4@h may not make.|pg||
nt|xenya: but 5@H is hopeless|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kamras: Deras är ca 4-8 hp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Inte N-S här |pg||
nt|timmy5: never pass|pg||
nt|xenya: as i see it that is|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: Hard work for North - he also bids his partners cards...|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d holding may persuade E to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks after this lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: if you x then pard bids freely over 1 nt  dont you bid again? maybe I am wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that EW is cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see a way, but that doesn't mean there isn't one.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes there is a way to make 5@H|pg||
nt|xenya: but it takes perfect reading |pg||
nt|enachou: no way i think|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|snorris: 4@hs: showing both majors|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hantveit: never say never :) We have seen it all, and done it all, havent we?|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5clb if anyone bids it will get doubled|pg||
nt|snorris: and now...|pg||
nt|snorris: undisiplined 5@cs?|pg||
nt|enachou: 1@s 1@h and 1@s|pg||
nt|enachou: @c|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see one, but I've seen many hands where top players make things single-dummy that I can't see dbl-dmy.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm willing to bet even papi couldn't make 6@cs.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: so maybe let them play here,  true |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt notice the 4 S possibilities|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl on 4 clubs is explained as TO, I think I would bid 5 clubs there|pg||
nt|xenya: for one thing, you can take a double finesse in @Ds, secondly, you can through W in with 3rd trump |pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: but I would support to 3@H|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't like 3@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not the right player to play 3NT-@D lead |pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like mp bid|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to get @Cs right too of course|pg||
nt|april7: ace and then Q of @S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: E made a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so...seems like E wasn't sure where he wanted to play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vassilis Virvidakis shows me the way to make 5@h.  Double finesse @ds and guess @cs.  Thanks.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hantveit: Finally, a good pickup for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|snorris: first good board for n-s |pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: but his pass over 3N looks ill-judged -- unless he is not sure about 6 @Hs in the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand certainly doesn't merit a slam try opposite a minimum 4-6 hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @H |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
