mb|p|nt|pef: pam was planning on making a three card limit raise of hearts.  perhaps at this vul in these match conditions she's thinking of  bidding 5?  |pg||

pc|h2|pg||

nt|tlc: the 4s bid achieved one of several positive results...|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|jcwla: Obviously with a 50+ imp lead she did not want to write down -620 on this hand.|pg||

nt|pef: Connie seems to be the most conservative member of the team|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|pef: she's 54 with an aqj10x suit, and has 15hcp.  I can't imagine more than a tiny fraction of experts passing over 1s with that hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree that the only reason for Goldberg's sequence is to keep partner from getting overexcited, but it comes at the expense of allowing the opponents to exchange a full round of ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: information.  I prefer Weinstein's choice.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tlc: i should think the delayed seq should show a reasonable suit but suspect values...|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|pef: well not only that, what makes you think it's their hand rather than yours or that you don't have a vul. game?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|tlc: the actual hand seems like a routine 2H overcall..|pg||
nt|pef: yes, I agree, but those values are hardly suspect|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|pef: and if you are worried about danger, it might be more dangerous to balance than to overcall directly since with that good a suit, hardly likely somebody is going to have a trap ...|pg||
nt|pef: pass sitting over you|pg||
nt|pef: what do you think about 3c on the north hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Before Wittes started putting her hand down, Quinn said "more!!" Wittes " I have a good hand" Quinn: "your hand's good enough that I might make it"|pg||
