mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: well turns out passing would have been the most "intelligent" thing to do, but awfully hard to do that with Pam's hand|pg||

nt|othered1: Few play it as other than 2-suited (Kaplan-Kay would have considered it too good to bid 3N, but that's an uncommon agreement.)|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@cX should (may) go for 300 or 500|pg||

nt|charles_l: what's he thinking about?|pg||
nt|charles_l: 5@s?|pg||

nt|westjava: hi Roland,Rag and Rashed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: 2NT are OK but 2@S at 4 -1. NOOOO|pg||
nt|charles_l: solid contract - 8 tops and more possible in the red suits|pg||
nt|motivasi: i would likely pass over two spades here|pg||
nt|westjava: sry late:)|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|westjava: as long as I know, Haitani pd is Dana Octavian, wthout Lubis:)|pg||

nt|pef: we can see 4s doesn't have much play at all|pg||
nt|jcwla: I consider the E hand just a hair light and W may have taken it a bit too seriously.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|pef: pam was planning on making a three card limit raise of hearts.  perhaps at this vul in these match conditions she's thinking of  bidding 5?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|pef: I don't think much of 5h there even under these conditions--she has quite good defense|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|pef: and 5h rates to be down 2 or so with partner passing on her second  round|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Wittes had a tough problem but doesn't feel like 5@H can be right.|pg||
nt|tlc: the 4s bid achieved one of several positive results...|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Obviously with a 50+ imp lead she did not want to write down -620 on this hand.|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: but game not to go any where|pg||
nt|westjava: x from E,penalty oriented??|pg||
nt|raghavan: shows values|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't but it's modern to get in there with almost anything that includes @S length.|pg||
nt|othered1: And that is a lot different than overcalling an openingh 1@H with 1@S.|pg||
nt|charles_l: i dont mind with @sKQJxx but this is a bit ragged for my tastes|pg||

nt|ahalim: Hi Craig|pg||
nt|chthonic: How to bid intelligently to the diamond slam?|pg||
nt|othered1: I won't come in there, even as a passed hand on that, since we play rigid suit requirements for weak 2-bids, so could have a hand others would have opened.   so there isn't room ...|pg||
nt|othered1: for a bid on this hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|raghavan: he has 9+|pg||
nt|motivasi: i guess they play for support double here|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@d from S seems sensible|pg||
nt|othered1: something forcing is right for south.  Wonder what that is?  Perhaps has to start wiht @S cue-bid (which I might be stuck with on similar auctions)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true, @s is the least likely to work there|pg||
nt|raghavan: W to revert to 5H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: May X or bid 2S|pg||
nt|raghavan: does not have 3 spades|pg||

nt|ptbambich: and now with 3@S....:)|pg||
nt|motivasi: Q doubleton plus a bunch of point|pg||
nt|othered1: I know west can't have game, but east's pass looks risky to me, perhaps because of the stiff @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: E hates to pass but........it is only  6 |pg||
nt|motivasi: it's just a 3+ cd's forcing|pg||

nt|charles_l: NS will find their @d ruffs|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: I think east's pass was fine, although on a good day I would raise to 3@c|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding 2@D on south's hand isn't impossible|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how they would play it,  but how would you play raise to 3 @c?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|motivasi: if he trump a diamond he will lose two more spade|pg||
nt|westjava: you loose 1@S,1@H and 1@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now this may be wrong- N getting a club ruff?|pg||
nt|othered1: You are allowed to judge hands well even without RKC or that ilk.|pg||

nt|charles_l: wonder why no dbl of 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: unfortunately therre are 3 quick and 1 slow losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok, can N X |pg||
mb|3N|nt|westjava: fight to part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|levix: this layout,4s always makeable,|pg||
nt|ptbambich: rite westy|pg||
nt|raghavan: S is now captain|pg||
nt|motivasi: it must be six down to take advantage over a vulnerable slam|pg||
nt|charles_l: X pls :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: to keep pard from bidding |pg||
nt|westjava: ohh|pg||
nt|raghavan: OHH|pg||
nt|westjava: wrong bid by S|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|imam2002: hello raghavan|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: - and West has no values for a game, facing a weak-2 |pg||
nt|manado_1: hi Raghavan..to hear you here..:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Welcome Murphy|pg||
nt|raghavan: Diamond finesse or try clubs for a trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should force now|pg||
nt|chthonic: Very forcing NT.|pg||
nt|othered1: Do EW play strong @C also?|pg||
nt|chthonic: The spade situation will please declarer|pg||
nt|ahalim: most indonesians do, Ed|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe this gives them better definition for their 2/1 to be 5cd|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and this will be -2 probably|pg||
nt|charles_l: -1|pg||
nt|charles_l: @s goes on @c and S is entryless|pg||
nt|raghavan: should make 5 if not 6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no words can not explain|pg||
nt|westjava: should be force by some thing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: @d lead might be best|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@d must show values for N to bid 3NT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|motivasi: after 2 board before seems NS made their playing mode Agressive ON now :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|charles_l: S has 4 more tricks to cash|pg||
nt|charles_l: he is thinking very loudly "black card"|pg||
nt|westjava: wow,raise with singleton..!|pg||
nt|motivasi: 3D make a vulnerable slam is on the line now|pg||
nt|motivasi: but.........|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@S in action|pg||
nt|othered1: yes.  And if the opening is limited, very little likelihood of going past game|pg||
nt|charles_l: the long @s is entryless so all is well|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|manado_1: on this situasion(vulnareble) im 100% agree whit 3nt by franky|pg||
nt|raghavan: with 26 points on declarer side, he should expect all other, honors with the opener E|pg||
nt|sybarra: but all roads lead to ....|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|motivasi: i willing to choose 3H bid here over 3D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Still makes 6 since E cannot play another D|pg||
nt|westjava: like 2@S or jump|pg||
pc|h3|nt|westjava: better pass i think|pg||
nt|othered1: The !Q play can work if declarer had @Dxxx and had to guess the suit.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|charles_l: but it is hard to know decl's @ss|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ptbambich: missed comm between NS perhaps... hiks...|pg||
nt|othered1: @DQ play|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mtvesuvius: @d now for -2... @c will set up the discard|pg||
pc|h5|nt|adi riyadi: 11 trick I think :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ptbambich: 4@c bid more clear to N|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now only 10|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: somebody needed to lead a @d early |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mtvesuvius: but it's tough for North, since he just wants to set it first|pg||
nt|sybarra: like at trick 1|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is an interesting deal - how to bid game by NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: after interference|pg||
nt|westjava: after opening 1@C,2@H over 1@S not more than 19|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Sr. I was of a moment. Friend at the mobile.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|charles_l: but N doesn't know @sQJxx in S|pg||
nt|imam2002: i think +2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|raghavan: South should  cue bid esp his AQ of clubs ets|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Able to drop a @H?|pg||
nt|levix: always c,should protect H,|pg||
nt|rnmalik: it appears to be a good pass|pg||
nt|raghavan: suppose X - what will N bid?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|levix: try H now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: there is no way for north to know that dummy's spades may not be running|pg||
nt|don paulus: ok now|pg||
nt|raghavan: repeat H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: At the start Y, but wats left?|pg||
nt|motivasi: anyway i don't see the way to make a slam here|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c4|nt|levix: only chance|pg||
nt|westjava: 1nt|pg||
pc|s4|nt|charles_l: good @sQ play|pg||
nt|raghavan: try D finesse now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|raghavan: +1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: and agree Adam,  "I doubled,  guess I should beat it"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: therefore I think that it's much easier to say that seeing all the hands... I probably would have done the same if I couldn't see all 52 cards|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s5|nt|othered1: waiting for the reentry (or dummy's claim)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|charles_l: KJxx|pg||

nt|daro1950:  ns will do well to play in sp part score|pg||
mb|1S|nt|charles_l: might then play @c at trick 3|pg||

nt|motivasi: on what lead?|pg||

nt|imam2002: 3 nt good contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|motivasi: and know a partscore deal|pg||

mb|1N|nt|levix: finally,we see a game now|pg||
nt|ptbambich: 2@d for a weak majors|pg||
nt|motivasi: 2D for weak any major's or mightbe a multi 2D|pg||
nt|westjava: @S lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: sorry makes|pg||
nt|chthonic: They stayed low on this board in other room after west contributed a double of 1D|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West will have to pass to put the breaks on for East|pg||
nt|motivasi: i don't know|pg||
nt|raghavan: Lailek, Malik - do u notice the lead by Guna|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: again,slam in @H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|raghavan: weak NT by W|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,3 nt cold:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC back Malik|pg||
nt|motivasi: a NT hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems like easy @H bid|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @H should be a winner here, if you get enough entries to finesse twice in @C|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,they play multi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|motivasi: i wonder to opening 2S with that suit |pg||
nt|raghavan: curtains  for 4H|pg||
nt|chthonic: Without that double, NS might get too high.  The double was a warning|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 2@C would have been a canape (longer @C) in their methods|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and now North can double and bid NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: may be in 2S by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|moen: must be a weak 1 suiter the rdbl|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|raghavan: Notice the 29 lead by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: bad|pg||
nt|motivasi: overcall i mean|pg||
nt|motivasi: I like this 4@H bid :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: wrong again....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@H is an interesting contract actually|pg||
nt|charles_l: doesn't a 4th seat 2N show about this hand?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, it should|pg||
nt|othered1: No, I think a 4th seat 2N initially is just a strong NT +|pg||
nt|raghavan: I think bad bid-What do u say Fakhri?|pg||
nt|imam2002: hmm ithink good try for 3 nt|pg||
nt|raghavan: If E leads H - will go down|pg||
nt|imam2002: they play precision |pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: uppsss,dont over the top...|pg||
nt|motivasi: and  a vulnerable condition|pg||
nt|motivasi: hanging around in a dangerous zone...and....|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S still ok,but enough|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C will a disaster|pg||
nt|motivasi: yes,but what this double mean from W?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: because of the @s blockage, I think 4@H may make?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|levix: 1nt and 2nt should be some agreements for them|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H here also,  lets see how defense does |pg||
nt|sybarra: played from opposite side |pg||
nt|westjava: a real @D,of course|pg||
nt|daro1950:  tough tough hand, should go down with correct def|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: Take your 500 NOW|pg||
nt|motivasi: if they play for a D double seem better pass,even with singleton A of D|pg||
nt|othered1: Limited opening bid system has worked in their favor, but that rebid doesn't have to work out well at all.|pg||
nt|charles_l: we will see in a moment|pg||
nt|charles_l: the @h8 may be promoted|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that is the only concern|pg||
nt|imam2002: go down not lucky :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|moen: hmm|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,agree Andre|pg||
nt|westjava: 3 @D may go home|pg||
nt|ptbambich: E must aware... that N maybe have another majors :( |pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C may go to some where|pg||
nt|motivasi: lol :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: in traditional precision 2@c rebid is 54 either way|pg||
nt|westjava: normally,AK lead A...except AK doubleton|pg||
nt|charles_l: too much to do and not enough entries to do it|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@s looks ok|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rodal f: 12 are flat by no @S lead but still to hard tobid 6|pg||
nt|levix: some people play 1c-1nt=8-10 and 16+ with even shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: If they do. They are lucky. KJ@C on|pg||
nt|levix: if have 5M,always bid suit if 8+,so think the 1nt is their agreement|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes|pg||
nt|manado_1: why E tke to much time with he hand ...??|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: if the 5 and 6@h were switched, I think it would always make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: 2/1 are Ok Mic. Can't be to many witch bid 1NT by 14|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Sr 12|pg||
nt|levix: still down with S lead if can find,even CKJ on side|pg||
nt|motivasi: let's see what N play on Q@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: Lillek - do u know any of these 4 players?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: 1 @S vulnerable - to me, West needs 1-2 aces more for that bid|pg||
nt|westjava: 21 you mean,Rag?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chthonic: Made just 2D in other room.  Surely sount can do better|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now declarer has a roadmap, but it may not be enough|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|charles_l: well done|pg||
nt|westjava: small|pg||
nt|motivasi: best for E now to steel a spade truff |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|moen: this should make now|pg||
nt|daro1950:  Duck K of Cl?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|motivasi: even I wonder to re open 2H with only 11 point|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 1N forcing|pg||
pc|h7|nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: needs the 9 @H |pg||
nt|raghavan: lead is 29|pg||
nt|charles_l: for -1|pg||
nt|charles_l: now -2|pg||
nt|charles_l: @sK, @s exit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|werge: More @S, pls|pg||
nt|werge: @C-shift - and 790|pg||
nt|sybarra: can this make?|pg||
nt|charles_l: not sure if the @s7 is readable for @cs|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: making on trump coup perhaps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: complicated hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: glad I am not playing it |pg||
nt|othered1: yes|pg||
nt|imam2002: AQ@S the same hand |pg||
nt|raghavan: D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ptbambich: hmmmm....|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: declarer probably is thinking about trumps 5-0|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @c return would really make this interesting|pg||
nt|motivasi: yes, i guess so....|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2@S probably 1 down, 2@H 1@D and 3@S going away, still depends how to handle hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|manado_1: i think bid 2@d is auto bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: at this point.  if only 4-1, hand is over|pg||
nt|imam2002: 2@S 3@H 1 down|pg||
nt|charles_l: oops|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|charles_l: which is why the @s7 was unreadable|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: Lilek is the non playing skipper:)|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|raghavan: no entry to get HK|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ruff the 5@s high, and draw trumps and play a @c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or not :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it might have been a bit misguided, but it was readable|pg||
nt|othered1: He had gone to 2@S solo.|pg||
