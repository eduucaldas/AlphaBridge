nt|granguru: bridge Club in chile:Club Snatiago)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Admitted, here north has implied some length in pointed suits|pg||

nt|granguru: If my memory does not fail me they were Roberto Asriel Jorge Guzman esteban Casian Roberto Kaufman and Eric Simons|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Kit!|pg||
nt|othered1: some pretty good play so far, including the defense here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade finesse for down 1|pg||
nt|duschek: Duck a diamond for a make, say several kibitzers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not much chance that will work|pg||
nt|duschek: Except West still has a heart, sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: requires hearts 5-2 and probably a prior error|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But it is indeed a legitimate chance|pg||
