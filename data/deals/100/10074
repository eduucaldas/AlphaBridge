nt|buffytvs: this looks like fun|pg||
mb|1S|nt|buffytvs: So the OPen Room has reached Bd 22, where we saw the %@D save at this table; we'll await the result with interest|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: the dealing computer having a field day today|pg||
nt|buffytvs: fasten your seat belts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4h e/w cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: colours may deter West a little|pg||
nt|lestergold: on combined 16 count inc only one ace|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they may never bid hearts|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s not far off either|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: west wants to bid dims first and thenm show this two suiter somehow later|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the spade isnt there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spacde |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H now will show it :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but later will never come on this deal...|pg||
nt|lestergold: space my typing bad today|pg||
pc|sT|nt|buffytvs: hmm... this may not work out well|pg||
pc|s5|nt|buffytvs: I prefer 2Nt to 2@D -- he has shape, not high cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this going off?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I confess I would have held my nose and bid 2@S as East|pg||
nt|buffytvs: don't think so|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 2 aces and 3 trumps at most i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h tricks two bullets makes 5 where is the setting trick|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless east can make all 4 hearts??|pg||
nt|buffytvs: unless there's a promotion, but I don't see one yet|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: i think i agree with u Ray|pg||
nt|chick: I know I agree with you Ray :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: espially when the weaker suit is the major the other way round id concenrarte on the hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: no if west has to make an auto reopening  double  then east's hearts are not suffricient to risk doubling into game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: dummy's H!7 is big enough to make the contract I think|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @H7|pg||
nt|lestergold: holding the ak of tru8mps not a nasty sur[prise for a declarer holding qjt9 for example is!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so East's H!6 won't score|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm sure the @H9 wieghed into the decision, but it's not enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he's going to take 3 trump tricks and still not beat it|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|buffytvs: the other way round I probably would just bid 4@H and forget the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep eggsactly|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Meanwhile on Bd 22, Mussbaum turned a potential gain into a 9-IMP loss by bidding on to 5@S over the 5@D save|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so the lead is back up to 26|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|buffytvs: and it looks like more to come for Meltzer on this deal|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||

pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: none at theYC|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if east hadnt south would have|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: my point :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: a bergen |pg||

nt|lestergold: cos thats a massive profit too|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: John is thinking about it!!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I guess North's pass and pull was stronger than bidding 7@D directly? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well tactically west can dream about beating this but we all know that against good players u neve rdo they make it when they bid it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a good reason for not bidding 6@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt like to be in west's hot seat now|pg||

nt|lestergold: after all they all know the qarithmetic here is horrendous|pg||

nt|buffytvs: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree with u Chick very good point indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: good way of puttinmg it too|pg||

nt|lestergold: many possibilities|pg||

nt|lestergold: right Chick|pg||

pc|d8|nt|buffytvs: that horrible feeling that whatever you decide will be wrong, and will cost bushels of IMPs|pg||

nt|lestergold: as is so often the case a preempt pushing players into a contract they wouldnt bid and shouldnt make but do|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: No fun here:(|pg||
nt|chick: part score hand|pg||
mb|2C!|an|alert|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes not much action so far|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead!|pg||
nt|jtr: Let's maybe see a nice defence though|pg||
nt|chick: can W be thinking of bidding?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just what West wanted to hear...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|buffytvs: these days everyone is trained not to pass them out in 1NT|pg||
nt|buffytvs: at IMPs, if they want to play 1NT, I say let 'em|pg||
nt|lestergold: well shortly north will be bidding what south doesnt want to hear|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: several specs are telling me that W bid 2C in the other room|pg||
nt|buffytvs: true :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: but it turns out to be ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and west maybe thinks he does but may be disappointed|pg||
pc|h9|nt|buffytvs: a straight flush, but not a very high one|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cold as ice|pg||
nt|lestergold: infrangible|pg||
nt|lestergold: even ace of dim lead not good enuf nothingh beats it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|buffytvs: effectively -- he doubled, presumably showing a 1-suiter, and East bid 2@C -- pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West actually doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: I must be behind the times, I wouldn't dream of balancing with that hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|buffytvs: nor I -- see above :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the bidding has made the diamond play much better than 50%, so declarer will only be worried about the trumps, and not for long|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d7|pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: -1!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|nt|jtr: North did his best to unblock the @ss|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|buffytvs: on BD 27 where NS stole the hand in 3@D, NS in the open room took a cheap save over 4@S, and Nussbaum gained only 5 IMPs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: with open cards - down 2|pg||
nt|jtr: But the 9 not good enough when you have the 8:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: but still chances for -2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so goodnight all -- I'm due in Australia in 2 min|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c8|nt|jtr: South needed that @c|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|buffytvs: tune in for the 3rd and 4th sets tomorrow|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: Now a guess|pg||
