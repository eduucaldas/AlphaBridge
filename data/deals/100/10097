mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d= i have a 5card minor|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but perhaps that is just a bit unsubtle :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: no need to cover this|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducked it, declarer had to play @DK then four rounds of hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: then dummy is good|pg||
nt|hedyg: and N did not have a 3rd @s..|pg||
nt|athene: the spades are blocked so north can only cash @H @S @S|pg||
nt|athene: now it still needs pretty much the same thing i suppose|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: you just cash @HAKQ and run diamonds|pg||

nt|hedyg: so no reason not to play in NT|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: people often seem to double with perfectly normal 1nt overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: even when they don't play 1nt as artificial|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: a hand too strong for direct 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes normally but west did jump|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps that changes things|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: strange lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: duck!|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly people bend over backwards not to lead their partner's clubs after a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: weird|pg||
nt|athene: but leading dummy's 5-card suit looks a little strange|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: looked to me like W showed 4 cards only in @H and maybe 5 @ds|pg||

pc|s5|nt|athene: to jump over the X|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: and he wld just bid 3NT over 2NT without thinking|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@D here has to be a probe for 5-3 harts|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had 3@c at his disposal for that|pg||

nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Yves Moulin, bon soir Yves !|pg||
nt|athene: rehi Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome back Bill :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: what a turnaround this match!|pg||
nt|hedyg: last segment Ribitas started with -30 and now with +15!|pg||
nt|hedyg: and not a dull moment! great show|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets hope it continues|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt for E-W here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 1@D 1@H 1@S 3N if east wants to keep it simple|pg||
nt|hedyg: as long as they try 6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: dont try, sry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: 6@D works well|pg||
nt|athene: but it's hard to diagnose the perfect mesh|pg||
nt|athene: with stiff @H facing a weak suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: J10@s drop..|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: can they get there?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: not like this|pg||
nt|athene: if east ever found out about singleton heart opposite, he might start thinking in terms of 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really dont like 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: i believe someone did a simulation|pg||
nt|hedyg: why bid 3NT with 4 @hs?|pg||
nt|athene: and found that you shouldn't pass a 3nt response if you have a singleton|pg||
nt|athene: but of course people always do|pg||
nt|athene: but supressing the hearts might work very well for East here|pg||
nt|hedyg: well here it should deny a 4 card major...|pg||
nt|athene: west might decide that with a singleton heart facing 3 at most (!) he doesn't want to play 3nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: but if W bids 4@d (forcing), E has no cuebid|pg||
nt|athene: but it's still hard to find out about that 3-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@H by west here shld be a singleton, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: because if you had 5@H 6@D you could happily play diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need veryyyyyyyyyyy good agreements for that, i doubt they play it|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt it too :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think west will eventually pass|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: E sounds more like 3 3 3 4 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: ok now they are on their way!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: id this not showing @ds or fit in @c and cue?|pg||
nt|hedyg: is*|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: well, no-one knows what 4@C means|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's a cue self-agreeing diamonds|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@c= 3 or 0|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well done anyway|pg||
nt|athene: of course east knows that @DAQ @CK are huge|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner did show club length|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..........W could have xx in @h and 2 2 5 4 strong?|pg||
nt|athene: well in that case what was 4@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, he bid 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: but what if he has AK@H and xx in @s?|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would think that E needs a @s stopper for bidding slam|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: if 4@C = agree @D|pg||
nt|athene: then perhaps 4@D = "ok, but i can't cue 4major"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: in which case west has to have control in both for 4@H perhaps|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 4@c was a choice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: is declarer going to try to reverse dummy?|pg||
nt|hedyg: W is not playing small @H from AQx|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|athene: ruff three hearts in hand?|pg||
nt|athene: rather than rely on happy spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like it|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps just trying to isolate the heart menace for a possible major-suit squeeze|pg||

nt|athene: this play of winning with an unnecessarily high honour to persuade declarer to misplace other key cards is quite common|pg||
