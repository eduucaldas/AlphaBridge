mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Good balancing "action" double -- "pd, do something intelligent"|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pef: well turns out passing would have been the most "intelligent" thing to do, but awfully hard to do that with Pam's hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|tlc: certainly a reasonable sequence..the winner was to pass the 2nd dbl, but not very likely to happen at IMPs|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ady: well done west   the only way to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|april7: but still good score for NS|pg||
nt|ady: will lessen a the potential loss  as 3@H making  should be a poor score for e/w|pg||
nt|april7: the 5 of @S was a positive signal for @S,thats why W defended as he did|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d5|nt|april7: the 5 showed the Q or sigleton|pg||

mb|3D|nt|pef: i was thinking 3s, but probalby the state of the match prompted 4s|pg||
nt|pef: we can see 4s doesn't have much play at all|pg||
nt|jcwla: I consider the E hand just a hair light and W may have taken it a bit too seriously.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: pam was planning on making a three card limit raise of hearts.  perhaps at this vul in these match conditions she's thinking of  bidding 5?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|pef: I don't think much of 5h there even under these conditions--she has quite good defense|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|pef: and 5h rates to be down 2 or so with partner passing on her second  round|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: Wittes had a tough problem but doesn't feel like 5@H can be right.|pg||
nt|tlc: the 4s bid achieved one of several positive results...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Obviously with a 50+ imp lead she did not want to write down -620 on this hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Quinn asks about the 2@h bid and Weinstein says Michaels - 5-5|pg||

nt|jbgood: Eamon - you are great!|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by S and 2@S by E|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|ady: this may well go down 3|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|d3|pg||

nt|eamongall: Carl thats almost  what I meant ... maybe only one ...almost  = may make .. |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2D|nt|tlc: a chance for glasson to pick up a game swing if they can get to 3NT here..|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Pass does not feel right with Pam's hand but 5@H just feels worse - pd said nothing over 2@H, you were planning on showing a 3-card limit raise, now you're letting them make you ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: bid 5?  Double seems like least of evils although an argument for pass given the match situation.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: your were right, think e/w can make 9 tricks in @D's |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|eamongall: I think best for EW was to play 3@Cs ..|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|alert|nt|eamongall: those 2@DX and 2@CX often have enough to escape |pg||
nt|sharkey: showing 4@H and longer minor?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should not doubt you |pg||
nt|ady: duplicating sing diamond for e/w    3NT   best spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: you should have a very good reason to pass a take-out double, not sure E in the CR had that|pg||
nt|sharkey: More IMPs to Narvik...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: 3NT but also 5 @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|eamongall: in Ireland its called anti ...in USA suction ... (although I don't know rest of system)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe @d and one higher Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes .. like @DKQT9 maybe |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: and you are still wrong side of declarer|pg||
nt|eamongall: multi landy I am told .... thats a fine defence to NT |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs confirm 2@H shows 4@H and longer minor...|pg||
nt|jbgood: I passed 2@c doubled five 5 good trumps after my prd had neg doubled in a European Chship once - was an uptrick:(, |pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - I thought you referred to the bidding in the CR Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: I know folk who reuse their multi stuff as defence to NT ...also folk who play 2@Cs for majors only ....but very few in Ireland are sophisticated enough for both at same time |pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - no|pg||
nt|jbgood: this 3@h is the modern way of playing multilandy - a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h|pg||
nt|eamongall: JB ... I can beat that ... I held @HKQ8754 and them trumps and a bidding partner ..and a lady by the name of Irene Robinson cruises into 4@Hs ...well what should I do |pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have come out smoking this half and really put the pressure on Topbridge.  Although they're ahead at halftime they may sense the tide's turning here...|pg||
nt|jbgood: you should ask her out for dinner:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: the lady made it ... (no uptrick) and the Deep finesse indicates 10 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: oh yeah I doubled |pg||
nt|sharkey: if she was good looking your defence may have suffered....|pg||
nt|sharkey: Reistand's in the tank....|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 down, and as a kib said, 1-0 in favour of Dont over Multilandy|pg||
nt|jbgood: not - one of the players left for the bathroom..|pg||

pc|s5|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|eamongall: well both Don't and multi landy win ... as 3@Cs is safe haven for EW |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

mb|d|nt|pef: but there are two schools of thought|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Is everyone for 1@C with the E hand?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pef: yes, definitely|pg||
nt|pef: i have opening 1d on hands like that |pg||
nt|tlc: i'm a 1D opebner with this shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: two rounds of insuffcieint bids -- something is amiss|pg||
nt|othered1: I like to open my long suit|pg||
nt|pef: "hate" I mean|pg||

nt|tlc: i raise 1S as well..|pg||
nt|pef: much less of a distortion|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tlc: if i open 1C and have to rebid 2C i have only shown 5 of my cards, opening 1D and rebidding 2C i have described 8...|pg||
nt|othered1: didn't know the system accepted insufficient bids|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'm usually 100% with Jim but those @D's look closer to 3 than 4.|pg||
nt|pef: who said you should rebid 2c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: more room to describe you hand when you get to hear 1c twice in the auction :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Very strange - it seemed to have removed all of the bids after the opening Pass, so I put them in and then it accepted them later in the auction|pg||
nt|pef: Well I'll point out two things.  1.  1c got 100  2.  in that case the diamonds were akxx|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Well done to restore it, Jan.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|othered1: 3N looks right, it's 2N that I'd wonder about|pg||
nt|pef: doesn't look like it will make, but pam erred in not covering the 10 of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I have to confess I don't KNOW she bid 3 - it was when I was confused about what had happened to the auction. I'll make sure when they're done|pg||
nt|jcwla: They're pushing here.|pg||
nt|pef: need to play the 10 of hearts right now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, I've completely lost the play|pg||

nt|pef: Connie seems to be the most conservative member of the team|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pef: she's 54 with an aqj10x suit, and has 15hcp.  I can't imagine more than a tiny fraction of experts passing over 1s with that hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree that the only reason for Goldberg's sequence is to keep partner from getting overexcited, but it comes at the expense of allowing the opponents to exchange a full round of ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: information.  I prefer Weinstein's choice.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tlc: i should think the delayed seq should show a reasonable suit but suspect values...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pef: well not only that, what makes you think it's their hand rather than yours or that you don't have a vul. game?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tlc: the actual hand seems like a routine 2H overcall..|pg||
nt|pef: yes, I agree, but those values are hardly suspect|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|pef: and if you are worried about danger, it might be more dangerous to balance than to overcall directly since with that good a suit, hardly likely somebody is going to have a trap ...|pg||
nt|pef: pass sitting over you|pg||
nt|pef: what do you think about 3c on the north hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Before Wittes started putting her hand down, Quinn said "more!!" Wittes " I have a good hand" Quinn: "your hand's good enough that I might make it"|pg||

nt|sybarra: another chance for n/s |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: this looks bad for Topbridge.. but Studentene will have to win by a margin to overtake them|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|eamongall: mini splinter ..thats a cool bid |pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pef: what do you do over 3n now by partner?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jcwla: Wittes has one of those hands where she's thinking, "Oh, you want in?  Come on in, the water's fine."|pg||
