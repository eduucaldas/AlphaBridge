nt|lestergold: dosnt know that his partner has his double as it were|pg||
nt|cenglund:  High-level competitive bidding is a critical area deciding the outcome of many matches|pg||

nt|lestergold: card in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention his 4 dims to the J not looking too great in offence|pg||
nt|diaoff: Usually best to leave the 5-level to the opponents, but there is always exceptions like this one|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|hQ|nt|cenglund:  Players tend to double too often instead of passing and encouraging partner to bid on|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Jens wanted his partner to become declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: ive no doubt that this was an expert auction and who wouldnt ant to be in 4h played by east looking at their cards|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This should be beatable on a club lead|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  There might be possibilities for an end-play|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has nothing better than playing another club|pg||
nt|diaoff: DD it can eventually be made, but now its too late I think|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: spade not the play|pg||
nt|diaoff: that was a kind play!|pg||
nt|lestergold: beauty of club is that south can ditch a dim |pg||
nt|diaoff: Now its an easy end play|pg||
nt|lestergold: east must run this but probably believes ks is wrong for north to make this play|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no choice he has to un it or hes giving up|pg||
nt|lestergold: not doubled not vul so he wont give up|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Axdorph would have disposed of one of his diamonds on a club|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: no names up?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: liboth sides have biddable major suit game but e/w makes sadly n/s its off|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Dan|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 double fits|pg||
nt|diaoff: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: so par here is 4s doubled off one by n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite hard for south to evaluate his hand at unfavourable vulnerability in this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: it doesnt look at all good!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as expected he has passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will surely bid the game|pg||
nt|lestergold: as a two way bid |pg||
nt|lestergold: wont want tio givwe north any cheap re-entries into the auction|pg||

mb|d!|mb|p|nt|diaoff: That was quite a brave D|pg||
