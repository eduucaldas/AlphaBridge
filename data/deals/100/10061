nt|dburn: a heart lead might work, but that's pretty unlikely once South bids the suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Aggressive raise by North but he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|sssvablue: And what do you lead from that West hand?|pg||
nt|jtr: Enjoy your break Roland|pg||
nt|jtr: The green suit looks attractive:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I refuse to lead with that hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Mind you, @cs were green for a while|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sssvablue: Often the best ploy, excuse yourself to go to the rest room and don't come back|pg||
nt|jtr: The @h trick will be too slow now|pg||
nt|jtr: Only chance is for declarer to play @cs and misguess|pg||

nt|dburn: for a start, East might have the singleton queen|pg||
nt|sssvablue: lacking anything imaginative, club to 9 looks best here|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh i agree But declarer may play low to the J using that principle|pg||
nt|jtr: @ds looks about equal to @cs anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: But there are entry problems potentially|pg||
nt|sssvablue: The usual problems with a marginal NT game|pg||
