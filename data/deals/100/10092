mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|daman: they are in 7 in the other room|pg||
