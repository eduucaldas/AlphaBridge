nt|jcwla: Good balancing "action" double -- "pd, do something intelligent"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphu1: Quinn, as she puts down the dummy: "I apologize, but I didn't know what to bid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|pef: well turns out passing would have been the most "intelligent" thing to do, but awfully hard to do that with Pam's hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tlc: certainly a reasonable sequence..the winner was to pass the 2nd dbl, but not very likely to happen at IMPs|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sharkey: well - by now you're on our schedule Eamon - afternoon :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if Live Updates is back - go to http://nmlag.com/LIVE-oppdatering and continue from there. Worked for me!|pg||
nt|april7: S has 3 Kings and N a 6card @H suit most probably.It doesn't need much to make 10 tricks|pg||

nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||

nt|sharkey: North's preempt "forces" EW into the best contract - would they get there without help?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: well done west   the only way to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|april7: but still good score for NS|pg||
nt|ady: will lessen a the potential loss  as 3@H making  should be a poor score for e/w|pg||
nt|april7: the 5 of @S was a positive signal for @S,thats why W defended as he did|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|april7: the 5 showed the Q or sigleton|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: probably playing forcing NT and 2@H shows 6 that is it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: 2-3 doubled undertricks in 3@c might have been an alternative|pg||
nt|eamongall: hopefully when next board comes I can say something bridge related|pg||

nt|jcwla: Glasson's nebulous 1@D opening in the CR carried her and Berkowitz to 3NT that seems to be on its way down.  |pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: i was thinking 3s, but probalby the state of the match prompted 4s|pg||
nt|pef: we can see 4s doesn't have much play at all|pg||
nt|jcwla: I consider the E hand just a hair light and W may have taken it a bit too seriously.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pef: pam was planning on making a three card limit raise of hearts.  perhaps at this vul in these match conditions she's thinking of  bidding 5?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: I don't think much of 5h there even under these conditions--she has quite good defense|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|pef: and 5h rates to be down 2 or so with partner passing on her second  round|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wittes had a tough problem but doesn't feel like 5@H can be right.|pg||
nt|tlc: the 4s bid achieved one of several positive results...|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|jcwla: Obviously with a 50+ imp lead she did not want to write down -620 on this hand.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: I understood ..jb|pg||
nt|jbgood: Eamon - you are great!|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by S and 2@S by E|pg||
nt|sybarra: in fact on bd 1,  the "only 50" bought n/s 3 imps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand 4@S or 3NT|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@h?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ady: this may well go down 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: there was a guy watching the rugby outside  in smoking shelter of a bar and everytime there was a score he ran in to cheer with those inside the bar .. |pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: East has very little respect for the colors here...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: where to begin |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: not easy to play and S will go at least 2 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to play everything our of his hand |pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: but have forced NS too hight looks like|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead helps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hands of highly disparate strength often play better in the weak hand's suit.  Not this time, though.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to set up @S for @c pitches|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is makeable|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to hold to 2@H and a @S loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe needs help from W too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed I still think 3NT was a better playable contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: well I see 8 in NT, the 9th would be an issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: and only one entry to S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW will provide the 9th|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: a vital point - if you pass opps play a peaceful 1 NT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sharkey: and Narvik need IMPs!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|eamongall: No respect ...but he was buying a good dummy ... how many does 2@S go for ... maybe only 1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: may make - |pg||
nt|sybarra: that 8 of clubs is huge card for e/w |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - might make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  could make 9 tricks in diamond   so no great damage losing 100   or 150|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|mariner1: I think to have any chance he had to work on @S 1st and that was slim|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back dooms this|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|eamongall: Carl thats almost  what I meant ... maybe only one ...almost  = may make .. |pg||
nt|eamongall: :):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 or 9 tricks david in !'s?  E only had one @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: *in diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, the good news is no game is likely to make.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@D pitch a @S and @D ruff and @C but no way|pg||
nt|mariner1: E can wait on his 2@H|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|ady: still can make 9 tricks |pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: exactly |pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|sybarra: but in the final analysis, not a huge win/loss either way |pg||
pc|d9|pc|sQ|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: good for W not squeezing pard with cah of @D's |pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: he needed to set up @S so he could shorten himself in @D and use @S as trumps|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: through E..... and even then he needed help from E|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h8|mc|9|nt|santyclz: To have any chance, n needed to ruff @ds at every opportunity to shorten his trumps.|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3@H Ogust? showing good suit good hand?|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|nt|eamongall: in Ireland its called anti ...in USA suction ... (although I don't know rest of system)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe @d and one higher Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes .. like @DKQT9 maybe |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 7@H is a save at 1400 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And since people who x for a lead seldom lead it themselves...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: though it could go for 1700|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: nah, 1400 seems its max|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: and you are still wrong side of declarer|pg||
nt|eamongall: multi landy I am told .... thats a fine defence to NT |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs confirm 2@H shows 4@H and longer minor...|pg||
nt|jbgood: I passed 2@c doubled five 5 good trumps after my prd had neg doubled in a European Chship once - was an uptrick:(, |pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - I thought you referred to the bidding in the CR Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: I know folk who reuse their multi stuff as defence to NT ...also folk who play 2@Cs for majors only ....but very few in Ireland are sophisticated enough for both at same time |pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - no|pg||
nt|jbgood: this 3@h is the modern way of playing multilandy - a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h|pg||
nt|eamongall: JB ... I can beat that ... I held @HKQ8754 and them trumps and a bidding partner ..and a lady by the name of Irene Robinson cruises into 4@Hs ...well what should I do |pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have come out smoking this half and really put the pressure on Topbridge.  Although they're ahead at halftime they may sense the tide's turning here...|pg||
nt|jbgood: you should ask her out for dinner:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: the lady made it ... (no uptrick) and the Deep finesse indicates 10 tricks available |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so there will be lots of bidding|pg||

mb|1H|nt|athene: if you're going to play a partscore, 3@D looks safer than 2NT|pg||

mb|d|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: other room played 3 more bds than we have |pg||

mb|3S|nt|athene: 2nt loses two aces and three spades - but you are lucky spades are 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be very unlucky to lose more than one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D now?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: I thought they were at lightening speed|pg||
nt|ady: this is not so easy to bid   and anyway on a finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: would beat an aggressive 5@S though|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: need to avoid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and lucky that diamonds split favourably|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the finesses is k stiff |pg||
nt|ady: west might bid 3@S now|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: boards dont come from open table ....but from another match|pg||
mb|5H|nt|april7: 6 @H would be a good save if EW should reach a slam|pg||
nt|ady: now 5@C   from east|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, that as well |pg||

nt|ady: all said and doned 5@C  not an unreasonable spot    |pg||
nt|sybarra: something to show the @S holding |pg||
nt|mariner1: no clear action is pass to me....... S is a passed hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Kind of depends on whether you're in a forcing pass situation and I'm not sure.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless pass/dbl inverted, yes, a la Meckwell - pass would ask partner to double |pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: maybe time for a tea|pg||
nt|ady: this should bed quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: N holding all the ourside Aces is not worried about a quick pitch so leads a trump|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: I think it has the same origin as this club - not 100 % sure though|pg||

nt|sybarra: @d lead not picnic either is it |pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  has a play     the J@D  is well palced|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but north goes with the standard modern expert practice of leading an unexpected suit and hoping to strike gold|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes DBL looked right here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: may play South to have both aces|pg||
nt|mariner1: ok now see how he does trick 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 2@S bid might led E to think A@D is in S since there is little else for him to hold|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in that case S would have bid 2@S on 1NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: play the 9 JIC|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: he did strike gold, but it wasn't his side's gold|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: no info about the other matches - just half time results|pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have played very well this half and exerted a lot of pressure on Top Bridge|pg||
nt|april7: I am back. 3 @S is probably for the minors and 5@C was a good decision because 3NT fails as we can see. If you bid well you are also lucky, K of @C is finessable|pg||

nt|pef: Connie seems to be the most conservative member of the team|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: she's 54 with an aqj10x suit, and has 15hcp.  I can't imagine more than a tiny fraction of experts passing over 1s with that hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree that the only reason for Goldberg's sequence is to keep partner from getting overexcited, but it comes at the expense of allowing the opponents to exchange a full round of ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: information.  I prefer Weinstein's choice.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: i should think the delayed seq should show a reasonable suit but suspect values...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|pef: well not only that, what makes you think it's their hand rather than yours or that you don't have a vul. game?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|tlc: the actual hand seems like a routine 2H overcall..|pg||
nt|pef: yes, I agree, but those values are hardly suspect|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: and if you are worried about danger, it might be more dangerous to balance than to overcall directly since with that good a suit, hardly likely somebody is going to have a trap ...|pg||

nt|pef: what do you think about 3c on the north hand?|pg||
