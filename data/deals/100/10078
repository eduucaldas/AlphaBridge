nt|jcwla: Open Room starting with Board 13.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hmm|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hold up|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 8, North's big @S one suiter that played 4@S-1 here, was 3@S+5 (or 3@S+2 if you prefer) in the OR, so 5 more to Noble.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ok, back on track|pg||
nt|allanr44: Once more with feeling?   :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: I think the skill is in assessing the worth of your cards in a real sense, rather than point count|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ok, we're onto our last board of the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|allanr44: maybe you should Patrick.  It hurts more when you lose   lol|pg||
nt|patricck: very true allan :)  i quite agree with wanting to downgrade the hand, just don't think I could bring myself to stay out of game|pg||
mb|2D|an|art, (5/4)+ majors, weak|nt|allanr44: Life in the fast lane my friend  :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|patricck: Klinger now 2 imps in front....1 board to play|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|allanr44: An unequivocal bid with a 'two suiter'|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: N had assumed the auction has finished and has led the @DJ|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Thompson mentions that he hasn't passed yet|pg||
nt|allanr44: fair enough too.  He wants to go home|pg||
nt|patricck: Thompson must have had trouble not falling off his chair when partner opened with 2@D for the majors|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Director has been called|pg||
nt|allanr44: lol|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Director says something about @DJ becomes a penalty card, and something about south has to pass|pg||
mb|5S|nt|allanr44: the specifics may be important|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: Hi all, sorry about the late start|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcom e|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: these things happen  (been an operator I know)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: They've already played through like 4-5 boards, so im going to whiz through them|pg||
nt|patricck: thompson probably wants to run to 5@S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|jcwla: A quiet 1NT here.  West has scattered defensive values but no reason to suggest declaring.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|s6|pc|h6|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mariner1: hi Shirley and all|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: *welcome,  we will be dashing thru about 4 of 5 bds |pg||
