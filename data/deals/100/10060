pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|cenglund:  Seems overoptimistic after partner's sign-off|pg||
nt|kastan88: GE Christer, you are far South from us :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough boards to analyze, not sure the best defense here|pg||
nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||

nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|kastan88: still i don't like such advantages, too much pressure to partner, and i am with you Mike, i would bid 2@H not passing, partner could have  6S3-1D3|pg||

mb|p|nt|asig: It looks as if 9 tricks is the limit in hearts|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Now it's only about fighting for overtricks|pg||
nt|talion: now ahonen has double stopper in hearts. if danielsdot had lead high heart, then ahonen could have taken only one heart trick|pg||
nt|talion: but with no side entry, low heart lead seems reasonable|pg||
nt|asig: One loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence may put pressure when aqce and another club is played if north ducks|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: a small without hesitation...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well requires cool courage|pg||
nt|asig: maybe Christiansen should have tested spades first|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not muck to loose compared with the win|pg||
nt|asig: then he would know that N had the @cK for his opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: much....|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is that east must ensure that there are enough spades to take care of the clubs should any mishaps aoccur |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Or @sK!|pg||
nt|asig: He would know, had he played spades first|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: is this a tank or a tech hitch?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: however in 6 maybe west would double for the spade lead- admittedly risky pso probably would roll in|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|xenya: now decalraer has time to set up a @H for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: excatly the reason why roland would want to be in it well above his 12.85 recurring pwerent requitrement|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mcphee: not so clear to dble for @S lead, I know I would not|pg||

nt|lestergold: still all very academical|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|kastan88: IMO nothing problem with strong pass systems on high-level tournaments, problems on club level only. Every restriction only stopping development of bidding|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||

pc|d7|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|cenglund:  If they lead 3rd and 5th best Q would have been a better card|pg||

nt|dburn: East didn't lead one, so probably does not have @sAK - although that is not completely guaranteed|pg||
nt|jtr: But that leaves the KJ @d wrong in theory|pg||
nt|sssvablue: but the qj @c right|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mcphee: I think this has a lot to do with the neg dble showing 4@H for them|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pelu: ok last board :) - I hope that the connections will be better in next round|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They missed a cold game in hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: although 3@H is aggressive, if the S hands values are outside of @S it is not so bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but sometimes opps preempt you or if south expectsb pard to show 4 hts however minimum she is then she did not have here 4h raise you cant have it both ways|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcphee: and to reach a close game vul at imps is good|pg||
nt|lestergold: desperation pushin i suppose|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: S should not pass 2@S out in any case, and will dble again and now N should be considering 4@H anyway|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: on th elead this will not pose an unsurmountable problem|pg||

nt|lestergold: well i know east is a passed hand but west is surely too good to only bid 2h|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: S has to play a @D back now -- breaking communications -- difficult|pg||
nt|xenya: she has to read the situation perfectly well to do so|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: even with the wasted Ks as a value this 4h is a much better contract thatn the last one for n/s|pg||

nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
