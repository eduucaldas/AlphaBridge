mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: now do we hear 7h????|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos thats a massive profit too|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: John is thinking about it!!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I guess North's pass and pull was stronger than bidding 7@D directly? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well tactically west can dream about beating this but we all know that against good players u neve rdo they make it when they bid it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a good reason for not bidding 6@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt like to be in west's hot seat now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: even he bids 7@H they can bid 7NT -- not that they will|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: John looks preplexed.|pg||
nt|lestergold: they may well bid 7n|pg||
nt|lestergold: after all they all know the qarithmetic here is horrendous|pg||
nt|lestergold: well after this hand they will all be boring|pg||
nt|chick: they almost have to bid 7N over 7H, if they think they can make 7@D|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree with u Chick very good point indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: good way of puttinmg it too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Counting on S to have the S!K or a sixth diamond for the 13th trick|pg||
nt|chick: or the @HK|pg||
nt|lestergold: counting on all the clubs standing up maybe|pg||
nt|lestergold: many possibilities|pg||
nt|buffytvs: NS need to be thinking about what to do over 7@H as they wait here|pg||
nt|chick: S made a 4@D bid, showing SOMETHING|pg||
nt|lestergold: however west still in the tank|pg||
nt|lestergold: right Chick|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thinkWest must be frozen|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: that horrible feeling that whatever you decide will be wrong, and will cost bushels of IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: west knows that if they are making 7, that the sac will be cheap|pg||

pc|sK|nt|lestergold: the spade suit is his insurance for that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
