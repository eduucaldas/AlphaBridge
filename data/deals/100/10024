pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|pef: well turns out passing would have been the most "intelligent" thing to do, but awfully hard to do that with Pam's hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Hi all and welcome to the Indonesia Interclub championships. This is round 6 of 6 in the semi-finals, top 8 teams qualifying for tomorrow's RR ...|pg||
nt|charles_l: some play precision|pg||
nt|daro1950:  evening here for me, good day to all of you though|pg||
nt|westjava: the famous pair,live legend, Henky Lasut - Eddy Manoppo|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS have often come to our nationals|pg||

mb|1S|nt|raghavan: Welcome Andre and spectators|pg||
nt|motivasi: finally,welcome every one:)|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: will be chopped|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n likely to be bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: Friends > Going for 3NT? |pg||
nt|frankaus: it appear that a somewhat fortunate @S layout allows 3NT to make here|pg||
nt|westjava: they stay in Menado,North Sulawesi,200 km north-east from Gorontalo|pg||
mb|3N|nt|motivasi: hi Dr.Raghavan thank you|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Hope E passes|pg||
nt|othered1: Few play it as other than 2-suited (Kaplan-Kay would have considered it too good to bid 3N, but that's an uncommon agreement.)|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@cX should (may) go for 300 or 500|pg||
nt|daro1950:  3sp a bit thin for my taste|pg||
nt|charles_l: what's he thinking about?|pg||
nt|charles_l: 5@s?|pg||
nt|henryb: bidding 5@s|pg||
nt|henryb: he has a great hand for a partner who bid 3@s over 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: true|pg||
nt|charles_l: but he should envisage this auction and thought earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzru: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: texas transfer|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Peter|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi lillek|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho e/w cannot unravel the sapde suit, it appears that declarer only has 8 tricks available  but there may be some pressure play double squeeze of some kind|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzru: kamu siapa|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 club and a Heart loser|pg||
nt|raghavan: Where is the 9th trick? 2C+4D+2H =8 |pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|lestergold: however west has to keep all fou hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|motivasi: he did pass|pg||
nt|westjava: nice lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now got it|pg||
nt|frankaus: it will appear in @C or @H IMO|pg||
nt|kastan88: now 9th trick is coming|pg||
pc|c8|nt|raghavan: yes 4 S But goes down only if S is lead |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|werge: 4 @H looks like a winner, 4 @S UN-doubled is cheap|pg||
nt|haitani: selamat pagi semua @H@H|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|raghavan: S could not lead any other suit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|charles_l: i'm wondering if N should (can) dbl 4N to show @s|pg||
nt|henryb: I don't know what double of 4N should show|pg||
nt|charles_l: Hi all and welcome to the Indonesia Interclub championships. The Vugraph operator is Desmon. This is round 2 of 7 in the 8 team round robin finals.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh club loser gone|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|westjava: good morning,afternoon,evening...|pg||
nt|raghavan: good ducking|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise i think it comes in any case because west is probably forced to come down to jc stiff|pg||
pc|h4|nt|raghavan: communication cut|pg||
nt|raghavan: stopped correctly make only 2|pg||
nt|raghavan: now he will finesse H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|raghavan: claim|pg||
nt|henryb: It is not an auction I have discussed with anyone|pg||
nt|charles_l: right - its meaningless so use it to show a fit?|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rashid Nabi Malik|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hi lilleek|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: wc|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb: or use it to show good defense against minors? say a stiff spade and a minor suit honor?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not think he will take any heart finesse|pg||
nt|raghavan: W should throw H|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has nine tricks without it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|westjava: no need|pg||
nt|lestergold: why risk contract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|westjava: ty|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|haitani: we have 48 teams now in this qualification|pg||

nt|charles_l: you can dbl 5min when it comes back to you?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|westjava: Intercity match,pool C (pool A - pool H)|pg||
nt|motivasi: don't a quite good opening here for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC to lillek|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: thank you Roland and Dr.Radhavan|pg||
nt|raghavan: pity down 1|pg||
pc|cT|nt|daro1950:  Seems that it could be used either way or as some sort of lead indicator, perhaps similar to Rosencrantz? But has to be discussed|pg||
nt|henryb: It might not come back. pass should indicate a willingness to hear partner bid|pg||
nt|charles_l: i'lll put it as  36245 on the list then :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: obscure auctions to discuss with a pick up partner|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: can duck and make|pg||
nt|frankaus: no sweat here|pg||
nt|westjava: well inform by @C lead|pg||

nt|kastan88: Lasut Manoppo CC here: http://bridge.ecats.co.uk/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Senior/Indonesia/Lasut-Manoppo.pdf|pg||
nt|frankaus: Dummy bid @S so @S lead would require a peek or close srutiny of hand record|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mike is correct |pg||
nt|kastan88: I hope they still play according to this|pg||
pc|s2|nt|motivasi: wc again Liliek...|pg||
nt|raghavan: D A gone to wilderness|pg||
pc|s7|nt|motivasi: not|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west qwould be squeezed into setting up a long heart for declarer or baring the club setting up a position against the qc when dummy's high club is cashed|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pef: 4s on all of 19hcp is an awfully good contract, they will probably get pushed there|pg||

nt|raghavan: Yes I also|pg||
nt|charles_l: N has enough to raise now|pg||
nt|daro1950:  west has to be ready to bid 7 if he goes to 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can be made too|pg||
nt|frankaus: lead from Jxxx is very low in my list of options|pg||
mb|3C|nt|raghavan: let us see whether defense collects its 4 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: I dont see him before:)|pg||
nt|westjava: agressive bid from E|pg||
nt|Walddk5: after 5 sessions 1. Mustang Semarang 102; 2. Mandobo Bodi Papua 99; 3. Gunadarma 93; 4. Geologi Timah 92; 5. Minsel 2 90;  6. Maesa Palu 89; 7. Senayan1 86; 8. Samarinda 86; 9. ...|pg||

nt|charles_l: @c lead sinks this quickly|pg||
nt|westjava: how is Medan to day,don?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Redbl from West = SOS and East must bid 2@C, whatever West bid, East must pass|pg||
nt|westjava: agree frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If u decide to bid 2@C. Why bid 2@S?|pg||

nt|don_kapu: Medan fine westjava|pg||
nt|pelu: prob excape i 1 suit|pg||
nt|raghavan: bid 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and now it will be bid 3n that is|pg||
nt|raghavan: a X by S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's 3d bid very optimistic effort|pg||
mb|3H|nt|motivasi: but the 4H bid really took their room for bidding|pg||
nt|motivasi: not even a small slam :(|pg||
nt|ptbambich: OMG...|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Roland,Rag and Rashed|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|frankaus: when N shows 4@S and S did not support lead from @SKQ tight not that unreasonable|pg||
nt|westjava: Franky Karwur (East other room), 12th rank on the Individual WMSG Champship, Beijing 2008|pg||
nt|lestergold: why doesnt west want to play 3n with his massive spade holding over the interference|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2NT are OK but 2@S at 4 -1. NOOOO|pg||
nt|charles_l: solid contract - 8 tops and more possible in the red suits|pg||
nt|motivasi: i would likely pass over two spades here|pg||
nt|westjava: sry late:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Helps N to get OT - this D lead|pg||
nt|westjava: while Henky Lasut was at rank 19th|pg||
mb|3S|nt|westjava: as long as I know, Haitani pd is Dana Octavian, wthout Lubis:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: with both doubletons, he should revrt back to first bid suit|pg||
nt|raghavan: is it not|pg||
nt|charles_l: is Boven one of the favourites?|pg||
nt|charles_l: looks like -1|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes every team with Lasut-Manoppo will be favourite :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh east has punted ti in any case|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: solves D problem|pg||
mb|3N|nt|werge: Easy play here about 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: now easy 12 tricks - u can go for cafee :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh no east has asked|pg||
nt|raghavan: a D lead is indicated|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think weast has overbid this hand very nicely but owing to the qx club in south's hand this may well roll in|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S lead will not assist the defence|pg||
nt|raghavan: E  asked for D control and W denied|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead wont defeat it as we can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely east was showing second suit not asking west for dim control|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes agreed but creates a fear with W|pg||
nt|frankaus: back declarer to make this |pg||
nt|westjava: 9 tricks or more|pg||
nt|sybarra: could he misguess clubs with opening bid on his left? |pg||
nt|lestergold: well east with his misfit hand and two bullets has rolled out the bidding boat into very deep waters but will get lucky probably|pg||
pc|s9|nt|motivasi: yes it is|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|westjava: but its ok|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,agree Rag|pg||
nt|westjava: than S make a decision...|pg||
nt|motivasi: but this problem is arise absolutely with the 1NT bid bye N|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|motivasi: by|pg||
nt|westjava: nice lead,for declarer:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 6|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|westjava: maybe I am wrong|pg||
nt|westjava: better 2@D respond i think|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 D has a chance|pg||
nt|don paulus: they put quite some pressure on the bidding - found 2 spades too easy|pg||
nt|frankaus: needs to play for @CQX but does not have much in the way of alternatives|pg||
nt|westjava: now 10|pg||
nt|lestergold: now he may find losing option of running qh|pg||
nt|frankaus: or 11 even|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy 11 but other lines off!|pg||
nt|frankaus: play on @H seems most likely now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|rodal f: New @H will be a killer|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should playheart to ace and play on clubs as no other line is likely to work|pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: Thanks Andre|pg||
nt|raghavan: E is entitled for one H trick - he will get now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

mb|3S|nt|pef: pam was planning on making a three card limit raise of hearts.  perhaps at this vul in these match conditions she's thinking of  bidding 5?  |pg||

nt|westjava: 14-15,3nt is ok|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1D can be with 12 points|pg||
nt|motivasi: yes, i think so|pg||
nt|westjava: 11 in precision:)|pg||
nt|motivasi: W had 16 pts here|pg||
nt|raghavan: still worse to jump to 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told that most expert players here play Precision type systems.  Looks like it here.|pg||
nt|westjava: on the way|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3NT shows agreeing to D support|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@c=@c+@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is putting a lot of pressure on his partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised N did not bid 3 @S   but maybe that would help e/w too much |pg||
nt|lestergold: west must bid 4s telling east to pick a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Looks like a 6er. Though EW have 3@S, but total normal bidding.|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@h is a good spot - should E bid more?|pg||

mb|p|nt|motivasi: at least just can tell that E is an agresive one :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: some have a toy to show the East hand over 1minor: 2@h=5@s4@h weak; 2@s=5@s4@h invite (reverse f****ery) (some use 2@d/@h over 1@c)|pg||
nt|frankaus: this mat be the end of auction|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh Oh|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h does not do justice to this monster again much too much pressure on his pard|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|charles_l: 800 worth of blood|pg||

nt|raghavan: 4D 2 down|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 H i mean|pg||
nt|motivasi: i think redouble seems promosing for N here to show 4cd's support + HCp|pg||
nt|westjava: ok Peter|pg||
nt|raghavan: Partner has shown values with his X|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: Unlucky for Declarer, dummy's @D holding and declarer's play at trick 1 will tell south all he needs to know.|pg||

pc|h2|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Shirley and Ed :)|pg||
nt|westjava: W hold @S and E hold @H,no squeeze|pg||
nt|raghavan: One can hold on to C, other to H then Spades - will it become winner to make 7|pg||
nt|westjava: with a good communication,of course:)|pg||

mc|12|nt|westjava: to set-up 2 tricks of @H for def|pg||
nt|othered1: -300 results on innocent hands lose matches|pg||
nt|raghavan: claim|pg||
nt|frankaus: quite a murky auction 3@H X can be desire to penalise 3@H if that is openers suit, then 3NT shows @S values - that are wasted in W's eyes|pg||

mb|2S|nt|westjava: but game not to go any where|pg||

nt|othered1: And that is a lot different than overcalling an openingh 1@H with 1@S.|pg||
nt|charles_l: i dont mind with @sKQJxx but this is a bit ragged for my tastes|pg||

nt|chthonic: How to bid intelligently to the diamond slam?|pg||

nt|othered1: for a bid on this hand|pg||

nt|othered1: something forcing is right for south.  Wonder what that is?  Perhaps has to start wiht @S cue-bid (which I might be stuck with on similar auctions)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true, @s is the least likely to work there|pg||
nt|raghavan: W to revert to 5H|pg||

nt|ptbambich: and now with 3@S....:)|pg||
nt|motivasi: Q doubleton plus a bunch of point|pg||
nt|othered1: I know west can't have game, but east's pass looks risky to me, perhaps because of the stiff @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: E hates to pass but........it is only  6 |pg||

nt|charles_l: NS will find their @d ruffs|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: South wasn't going to  miss game and north knew what was right.|pg||
nt|don paulus: passive NS|pg||
nt|westjava: EW playing srandard|pg||
nt|daro1950:  sp ruff?|pg||
nt|westjava: then,4@S in your pocket|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yesterdayu told me 2 national players - Are these NS part of the national team? Mr Lillek|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: W might have given thought to 3rd position opening|pg||
nt|raghavan: thinking|pg||
nt|westjava: standard|pg||
nt|westjava: transfer is complete now..!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i think they will take it thre eoff but not that costly and a bit unlucky|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haitani: battle of weak nt , and basic system standard|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club loser cannot go anywhere apart from Spade loser|pg||
nt|westjava: so,2@C was enough|pg||
nt|frankaus: back they find defence for -3|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 Aces and 2 ruffs+ DK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|manado_1: ZIRRU on action now... :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Murphy|pg||
nt|westjava: Boeven Digoel is city at Papua|pg||
nt|motivasi: where is the 10th trick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think east's pass was fine, although on a good day I would raise to 3@c|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding 2@D on south's hand isn't impossible|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how they would play it,  but how would you play raise to 3 @c?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|motivasi: if he trump a diamond he will lose two more spade|pg||
nt|westjava: you loose 1@S,1@H and 1@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now this may be wrong- N getting a club ruff?|pg||
nt|othered1: You are allowed to judge hands well even without RKC or that ilk.|pg||
nt|charles_l: N hand has EXTRAS in a 1@c system context|pg||
nt|chthonic: Just a few...|pg||
nt|othered1: Absolutely.|pg||
nt|othered1: I like this auction.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am with u Frank any takers?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|motivasi: difficult for N to get into the bidding over NT opening|pg||
nt|westjava: hope lose 2@S and 2@C|pg||
nt|daro1950:  no|pg||
pc|hK|nt|raghavan: long thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzru: sr..|pg||
nt|westjava: npp|pg||
nt|vugraphzru: sorry|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh NS gets a ruff too|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht now low club and dim should be found for second ruff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|raghavan: H A is entry|pg||
nt|othered1: but it could be very wrong if EW are just scurrying for a spot|pg||
nt|othered1: constructive|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: just values, not Invitational in nature for me, but that varies from nation to nation and by partnership agreement|pg||
nt|charles_l: @dJ asks @h|pg||
nt|westjava: EW Rag|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|levix: usually,someitmes lead doubleton is a good idea|pg||
nt|motivasi: the Ace gave him the tenth trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|raghavan: will play D 10 now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzru: ok thks|pg||
nt|don paulus: but 4 H not made - see 2 D - 1 S and 1 C loser|pg||
nt|charles_l: @h10 asks @d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: will E play D?|pg||
nt|othered1: now claim|pg||
nt|frankaus: 800  -5 quite a significant swing, if not replicated in the OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: overtake |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 down now|pg||
nt|lestergold: we lose bet Frank|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive that N will go fore the safest 7 trick|pg||
nt|westjava: 4 NT from N still make i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: misere|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: Defens never - bedause of the 1 @S bid - attacked @D-suit|pg||
nt|werge: because|pg||
nt|charles_l: great judgement rather than a system straitjacket...|pg||
nt|motivasi: if they retour spade after cashing @D winner the contract will doom|pg||
nt|raghavan: Vul going down- |pg||
nt|motivasi: otherwise they can throw their loser on @C|pg||
nt|raghavan: D to K, ruff C, D to A throw loser |pg||
nt|adi riyadi: hi all :)|pg||
nt|motivasi: hello adi :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra2: you all ok overthere?|pg||

nt|raghavan: WC adi|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 down 200 possible|pg||
pc|sK|nt|westjava: Jimmy Bojoh - Leslie Gontha|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: how can club be anything other than stiff|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club 2 may indicate D shift|pg||
nt|lestergold: west bid two suits and led dummy's long side suit|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: the cat should have grabbed the mouse quickly|pg||
pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: south opened a weak nt, and after two passes, east down in the match and with 55 in spades and diamonds passed so south played 1nt making 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|jcwla: It's a perpetual question, most recently Problem C of last month's Bridge World Master Solvers Panel.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: but there are two schools of thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jcwla: Is everyone for 1@C with the E hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pef: yes, definitely|pg||
nt|pef: i have opening 1d on hands like that |pg||
nt|tlc: i'm a 1D opebner with this shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: two rounds of insuffcieint bids -- something is amiss|pg||
nt|othered1: I like to open my long suit|pg||
nt|pef: "hate" I mean|pg||
nt|pef: I rebid 1nt after partner bids 1h|pg||
nt|pef: if partner bid 1s I bid 2s|pg||
nt|tlc: i raise 1S as well..|pg||
nt|pef: much less of a distortion|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: if i open 1C and have to rebid 2C i have only shown 5 of my cards, opening 1D and rebidding 2C i have described 8...|pg||
nt|othered1: didn't know the system accepted insufficient bids|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'm usually 100% with Jim but those @D's look closer to 3 than 4.|pg||
nt|pef: who said you should rebid 2c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: more room to describe you hand when you get to hear 1c twice in the auction :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Very strange - it seemed to have removed all of the bids after the opening Pass, so I put them in and then it accepted them later in the auction|pg||
nt|pef: Well I'll point out two things.  1.  1c got 100  2.  in that case the diamonds were akxx|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|jcwla: Well done to restore it, Jan.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N looks right, it's 2N that I'd wonder about|pg||
nt|pef: doesn't look like it will make, but pam erred in not covering the 10 of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I have to confess I don't KNOW she bid 3 - it was when I was confused about what had happened to the auction. I'll make sure when they're done|pg||
nt|jcwla: They're pushing here.|pg||
nt|pef: need to play the 10 of hearts right now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, I've completely lost the play|pg||
nt|pef: guess she only has 8 tricks so doesn't have to lead the 10 of hearts to beat it, but it's the right play, anyway|pg||

nt|motivasi: for recent board|pg||
nt|raghavan: Don will it be 4S or part score of S?|pg||
nt|don paulus: yes ops had to go to 3 level to come into the auction|pg||
nt|adi riyadi: I think 4@s|pg||
nt|motivasi: cold 4@S with this layout|pg||
nt|don paulus: N has the length - S the strength|pg||
nt|raghavan: He may bid 3S|pg||
nt|don paulus: open 3 S or 1 ?|pg||
nt|motivasi: but NS really has take good care here|pg||
nt|raghavan: should be 4S to EW|pg||
nt|raghavan: WD EW|pg||

nt|lestergold: one off very good bridge indeed|pg||
nt|raghavan: poor score for EW|pg||
nt|westjava: my mom said|pg||
nt|raghavan: Lillek - what did mom say?|pg||
nt|lestergold: blame west should have led lowes ht confirming desire for fuff not left his pard with any choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: that might help a little :)|pg||

nt|charles_l: precision|pg||
nt|charles_l: your fav system, adam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks... I thought so :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: My absolute favorite is forcing pass, but that's not allowed in too many places :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: did we miss a pass?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: My next favorite is Precision... which is luckily even allowed in ACBL|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: seems we are missing a pass, operator?|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps S did not bid at all |pg||
nt|charles_l: at uni i had a fun system - pass = 0-7 or 16+, in response 1@c=16+ or 0-7|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is this a frisky jr bid?  |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm... I don't see any way South could be bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good,  charle you and Adam!!  how fun |pg||
nt|sybarra: we also maybe losing connex?|pg||
nt|westjava: I am member of Geology,Rag...:)|pg||

nt|motivasi: too good for 3@S|pg||
nt|adi riyadi: see .. :)|pg||
nt|motivasi: 4@S seem nice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT might create problems with @D lead|pg||
nt|westjava: NS play precision|pg||
nt|daro1950:  my thoughts as well|pg||
nt|kastan88: Lot of misfitting hands  at start|pg||
nt|charles_l: nothing's made so far|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but you are not a geologist west aren't you ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: W will bid - 17 points good 6Cd S + NV|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,I am a bridger,don...|pg||

nt|westjava: I dont think so,don|pg||
nt|raghavan: may go to 5S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|westjava: official web site : http://kejurnas-bridge-2009.comxa.com/index.htm|pg||

nt|ptbambich: nooo... penalty :)|pg||
nt|westjava: he will get it|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes 5|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pass shows less than 5 points|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2NT|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@h=takeout|pg||
nt|kastan88: now 3NT on NS-line|pg||
nt|don_kapu: if Gontha bid 5@C, they will reach in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s in any case were clearly sacrificing north should have jumped on firwt round of bidding to 3 or maybe 4 spades immediately|pg||
mb|d|nt|mtvesuvius: or West :)|pg||
nt|daro1950:  not sure of their structure here|pg||
nt|charles_l: wonder why no dbl of 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: unfortunately therre are 3 quick and 1 slow losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok, can N X |pg||
nt|westjava: and might be stop|pg||
nt|raghavan: will stop|pg||
nt|westjava: 7 imps gain for Minsel   18,3nt here and 3@C there|pg||
nt|lestergold: expeienced tuff school bidders put max pressure on immediately on these hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: fight to part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|levix: this layout,4s always makeable,|pg||
nt|ptbambich: rite westy|pg||
nt|raghavan: S is now captain|pg||
nt|motivasi: it must be six down to take advantage over a vulnerable slam|pg||
nt|charles_l: X pls :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: to keep pard from bidding |pg||
nt|westjava: ohh|pg||
nt|raghavan: OHH|pg||
nt|westjava: wrong bid by S|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not flaff about |pg||
nt|westjava: Minsel = Minahasa Selatan (South), a districk near Menado|pg||
nt|raghavan: a penalty|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it a penalty X?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|imam2002: hello raghavan|pg||
nt|westjava: very weak hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has nothing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|werge: - and West has no values for a game, facing a weak-2 |pg||
nt|manado_1: hi Raghavan..to hear you here..:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Welcome Murphy|pg||
nt|raghavan: Diamond finesse or try clubs for a trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should force now|pg||
nt|chthonic: Very forcing NT.|pg||
nt|othered1: Do EW play strong @C also?|pg||
nt|chthonic: The spade situation will please declarer|pg||
nt|ahalim: most indonesians do, Ed|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe this gives them better definition for their 2/1 to be 5cd|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and this will be -2 probably|pg||
nt|charles_l: -1|pg||
nt|charles_l: @s goes on @c and S is entryless|pg||
nt|raghavan: should make 5 if not 6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no words can not explain|pg||
nt|westjava: should be force by some thing|pg||
nt|lestergold: no its an appaling penalty pass|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: @d lead might be best|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@d must show values for N to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|westjava: dbl,uppsss|pg||
nt|westjava: extra bounus|pg||
nt|raghavan: N must be worried|pg||
nt|westjava: entry with ruffing @H|pg||
nt|raghavan: that Clubs may be set up|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hmmm, a little hard |pg||
nt|don_kapu: must work hard|pg||
nt|westjava: like in your life don,ugh...|pg||
nt|raghavan: How will W play Don|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|motivasi: after 2 board before seems NS made their playing mode Agressive ON now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: by north|pg||
pc|h9|nt|charles_l: S has 4 more tricks to cash|pg||
nt|charles_l: he is thinking very loudly "black card"|pg||
nt|westjava: wow,raise with singleton..!|pg||
nt|motivasi: 3D make a vulnerable slam is on the line now|pg||
nt|motivasi: but.........|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@S in action|pg||
nt|othered1: yes.  And if the opening is limited, very little likelihood of going past game|pg||
nt|charles_l: the long @s is entryless so all is well|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe will play - 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|manado_1: on this situasion(vulnareble) im 100% agree whit 3nt by franky|pg||
nt|raghavan: with 26 points on declarer side, he should expect all other, honors with the opener E|pg||
nt|sybarra: but all roads lead to ....|pg||
nt|raghavan: must Ruff H and also develop C|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|motivasi: i willing to choose 3H bid here over 3D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Still makes 6 since E cannot play another D|pg||
nt|westjava: like 2@S or jump|pg||
nt|frankaus: surely this a "brave" decision|pg||
nt|lestergold: foolhardy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|westjava: better pass i think|pg||
nt|othered1: The !Q play can work if declarer had @Dxxx and had to guess the suit.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Ruff @C, @H Ace and @H ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: Boven Digoel city at Papua|pg||
pc|c4|nt|charles_l: but it is hard to know decl's @ss|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohhh nooo, want a break in @S 2-2|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh,what play??|pg||
nt|raghavan: play back S|pg||
nt|westjava: I dont understant Jemmy's plan|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|ptbambich: missed comm between NS perhaps... hiks...|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @d now for -2... @c will set up the discard|pg||
nt|westjava: must ne now|pg||
nt|raghavan: with slender values with N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like my four truimps to be headed by something a tad higher than the 6 spot to float this at the 2 level|pg||
pc|d7|nt|adi riyadi: 11 trick I think :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ptbambich: 4@c bid more clear to N|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now only 10|pg||
nt|westjava: 2nd ohh...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: somebody needed to lead a @d early |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but it's tough for North, since he just wants to set it first|pg||
nt|sybarra: like at trick 1|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is an interesting deal - how to bid game by NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: after interference|pg||
nt|westjava: after opening 1@C,2@H over 1@S not more than 19|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Sr. I was of a moment. Friend at the mobile.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|charles_l: but N doesn't know @sQJxx in S|pg||
nt|imam2002: i think +2|pg||
nt|raghavan: cashing out winners and then get C ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|raghavan: South should  cue bid esp his AQ of clubs ets|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Able to drop a @H?|pg||
nt|levix: always c,should protect H,|pg||
nt|rnmalik: it appears to be a good pass|pg||
nt|raghavan: suppose X - what will N bid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: great east will have no choice but to ul;timately drop one of those stiff honours|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|levix: try H now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: there is no way for north to know that dummy's spades may not be running|pg||
nt|don paulus: ok now|pg||
nt|raghavan: repeat H|pg||
nt|don_kapu: do you ve a reason why Gontha bid 5@C mr westjava|pg||
nt|raghavan: now may be 2 down-|pg||
nt|westjava: he dint believe his pd play..:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ah Ah|pg||

nt|westjava: so,I always serves...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: south is marked with something in spades for his double|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|levix: only chance|pg||
nt|westjava: 1nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: still -1 or more|pg||
pc|d2|nt|charles_l: good @sQ play|pg||
nt|raghavan: try D finesse now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|raghavan: +1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: and agree Adam,  "I doubled,  guess I should beat it"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: therefore I think that it's much easier to say that seeing all the hands... I probably would have done the same if I couldn't see all 52 cards|pg||
nt|don_kapu: so you are a member of HAOW|pg||
nt|westjava: Jemmy play not in his class...|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Quinn has been announcing how many tricks remain - now 39|pg||

nt|pef: shawn quinn probably thought back to the second last board of the first finals where she made a very tired defensive play allowing a vul. game to make.  here she had LOTS of leeway|pg||
nt|pef: Jan is going to tell us about the hand where the balancing double of 2h by the 1nt overcaller was converted (wrongly) for penallties--apparently some director issues|pg||

nt|jcwla: JoAnn Sprung, Connie Goldberg, Shawn Quinn and Pam Wittes.  Call Varig, they've punched their ticket for Sao Paulo.|pg||
nt|pef: I think 4s is a tired bid.  what do you guys think?  she only has 10 hcp, but a really great 10|pg||
nt|tlc: i agree..but i think the operative word for everyone involved is "tired" :) it's been a *long* week!|pg||
nt|pef: not hard to visualize a hand partner can have like the actual one and 4c is below 4s so doesn't really risk anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: On board 90, I believe that what happened in the other room was that the auction went 1@h-1NT-2@h-P; P-P-DBL and the partner of the DBLer did not see the DBL and thought the hand ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: had been passed out in 2@h - they knew DBL was Takeout, but just missed the bid|pg||
