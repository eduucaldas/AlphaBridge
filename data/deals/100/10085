pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||

nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||

nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I was thinking they might find the A@C lead to beat 4....... no chance though on 83|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
