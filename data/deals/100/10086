nt|xenya: 10-12 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|pelu: 1.2.3 seat nv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9½ - 11½|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit annoying for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still was in principle right to lead trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: and E's @D8 could have suddenly become a big card, had he exited witha small @D at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Bekkouche must hope that the double is negative; it usually is|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 2@HX will not be pretty|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so strong 1@c, 5 card majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: south makes a responsive double?|pg||
nt|pelu: a responsiv D sh show 4-3 in major|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: not this time Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she can escape for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ralf Willquist and Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D would work|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: fairly normal part score competitive auction|pg||
nt|asig: Ready for the football match tonight, Ralf?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: 3@D or 3@S by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but a difficult hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW plays precision, 1@d can be void, 1NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another plus score for the Icelanders|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Seems overoptimistic after partner's sign-off|pg||
nt|kastan88: GE Christer, you are far South from us :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough boards to analyze, not sure the best defense here|pg||
nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: results so far: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is too optimistic by n/s imo|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: close, yes -- but not quite maybe -- i think EW can get 2 trumps, 2@Ds, 2@Cs and a @S|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 3NT ?|pg||
nt|xenya: they should do that quickly however|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: diff to bid - and stop - after 3@C by East|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tjolpe:  can u bid it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 4c has play in any case|pg||
nt|asig: This hand should be over in a second - 10 easy tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@d= 5+M+5+m, weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: a combined 22hcp and no long suit - i think it is clear that someone overbid|pg||
nt|pelu: @C to K and @HQ will give S an chance|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N thought S has Ms|pg||
nt|pelu: and a responsiv X sh show major|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but really this sort of bidding is not suitable for a high level tournament|pg||
nt|pelu: the 3@H bid from S is - as I see it - the problem - that is FG on 10 HCP|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@d goes down too, 3@s is not fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but south paased originally - therefore north knows the values for game are not present|pg||
nt|m_niemi: with strong hand N can bid 4@c|pg||
nt|pelu: so N sh pass to 3@H - no|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so 3@d isn't that strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed peter but he should play bridge rather than slaveishly follow system|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: but pard (W) said she had zilch with the rais |pg||
nt|haans: gustavsson won swedish championships three years running. claimed he was lucky|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cenglund:  Heart lead would have been different story|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not really, I am staying in Finland for the moment|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: declarer is obliging -- back to 2 ruffs now|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he could have made it by playing a high @D|pg||
nt|pelu: just what I told him .)|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should really find it easy to take at least 5 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|pelu: easy for us|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kastan88: wow, I thought you in South Africa :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Shirley this is a bidders game |pg||
nt|lestergold: east knows pard is shor in  dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: so as long as there is good club support she can push|pg||
nt|sybarra: true but I also do not like going for 300/500 agst zip |pg||
nt|lestergold: you dont have to make everything u bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c can lose one club one spade and one heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: its actually a good point Mike |pg||
nt|lestergold: it wont be doubled into game on this sort of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: o vont to win or u want to sit there and let opps roll in easy contracts|pg||
nt|haans: would be interesting to know why they have left swedish clubs ( = weak/strong1@C) for pure Big Clubs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: but of course there is still room for a defensive error|pg||
pc|h3|nt|m_niemi: duck|pg||
nt|pelu: dont take @HJ - wait for a signal from pd!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but high level bridge is doing sensible things and avoiding mistakes|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S passed, so E has @sA|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N seems a make on a @S finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont know any players who dont makes mistakes .)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|m_niemi: or @dA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: @D discart or @C10|pg||
pc|h9|nt|m_niemi: ew uses Roman discard|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but maing the fewest wins matches|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so odd = pos, even is lavinthal|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 of spades would be cool|pg||
nt|pelu: so now West know that S has @DA + @CK + @HD = pd has @SA - sh Holmes!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @d9 is pos in @d|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  It's surprising that West coul ddouble 2@H|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  most players use negative doubles here to day|pg||
nt|roswolf: pprecisely Dr Watson|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|nt|m_niemi: NS: 1@c= 12-16 unbal or 15-17 bal, 1@d = 17+, 1@h@s/2@c/@d=8-11 nat, 1NT = 12-14|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: i think looking at the compeitive bidding on this hand your singleton heart and dummy's  marked singleton diamond or much more relevant than how many points partner has for her ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak raise|pg||

nt|cenglund:  I thought it was Lebensohl, but I was wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|lestergold: with so many points what did she expect south to balance with- on a multi auction the [passout seat is not a balancing seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hi Bob@H@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|kastan88: still i don't like such advantages, too much pressure to partner, and i am with you Mike, i would bid 2@H not passing, partner could have  6S3-1D3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the theory becomes different- in the pass out seat you are  in the trap in effect weven though east hasnt spoken|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H or 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: or pass|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h and 5@d were easy, or 3NT by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yp|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: hmm I thought that was Lebensohl too|pg||
nt|talion: 1@c = 15+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes my vote 2 (just)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South has the option to sit for it or to escape by showing both majors|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Precision or some other strong club opening, I presume|pg||
nt|talion: skuladotti is tempted to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Bob|pg||
nt|haans: must be transfer|pg||
mb|1C|nt|xenya: 2@H by N might even make?|pg||
nt|xenya: or W might run?|pg||
nt|pelu: if S wont to run - the West can just sit and wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 boards compared now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the tables are not linked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: flat  3 and 5  to Sweden|pg||
nt|pelu: so 1-1 now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room Finns have 12-14 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Auken perhaps hoping pard is strong enuf to double again|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might end up in a thin slam but very anti - odds|pg||
mb|1D|nt|m_niemi: so still 0-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @s-lead was nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  3NT is piece of cake|pg||
nt|lestergold: but doesnt want to push south out of spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: the no science route|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so ½-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a good day n/s would bid 6@S and it would roll home but today best keep low|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kastan88: Hi Bob, |pg||
nt|mcphee: just getting an idea whats being played|pg||
nt|haans: no double = good bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D = negavtiv, 1@H = nat or 20+|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: should make plenty |pg||
nt|mcphee: these sort of hands really offer little play choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant agree with the 3nt call - why cant 6@D be frigid |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|talion: yes it is, but it could have been very poor contract if nurmi has minimum 15 points for her opening|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: declarer may get home if she plays on the black suits however playing on dims looks doomed|pg||
nt|mcphee: why|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D Q is ok|pg||
nt|haans: may make|pg||
nt|haans: @HK a joker|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this would be in jeopardy if spade queen not falling|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: It looks as if 9 tricks is the limit in hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that diamonds don't break 3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you play strong club then use your system tools to investigate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have to rebid 1@H forcing, if available|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lestergold: because defence can come to 3heqrts a dim and two bullets|pg||
nt|mcphee: although still needs to develop other tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: this line is going to work even better|pg||
nt|pelu: and for rest of the bidding I need help :(:(:(|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think east perhaps with her two doubles had bid here values and that the fourth heart was optinmistic|pg||
nt|haans: yes worsed for sweden|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 4-7+@s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: south covers dims set up hearts set up no  fast ntry six tricks for defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: club up would be good now |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes bjut south needed to cover altho not obvious |pg||
nt|asig: maybe not|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@c= 20+ ASK|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 4-7 bal or @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: S ASKs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cenglund:  11 tricks should be made:test first hearts and then spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Hans Göthe from Sweden, co-inventor of the Magic Diamond as played by N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and continue with 2@D over a semi-forced 1@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|m_niemi: i@h = nat or bal|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N prob. has told his shape and strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|asig: Covering the @cQ was a mistake, I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorroh wrong sex|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Also this @s return!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph return is better |pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this is likely to make, decalrer losing 2@Cs, a @S and 2 trumps |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Noe Jens has his chance|pg||
nt|asig: Now its making|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: With a  trumph return W had no chance to cover his 2 losers|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT and 2@c, tx to kibs|pg||
nt|pelu: In board 1 (33) the danes sold out to 2@S - with play for 4@H and a lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: a lot of bidding to a safe spot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cenglund:  9 tricks are always cold even if the majors did not break|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|cenglund:  Now it's only about fighting for overtricks|pg||
nt|talion: now ahonen has double stopper in hearts. if danielsdot had lead high heart, then ahonen could have taken only one heart trick|pg||
nt|talion: but with no side entry, low heart lead seems reasonable|pg||
nt|asig: One loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence may put pressure when aqce and another club is played if north ducks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps E has a guess in @c|pg||

pc|s8|nt|lestergold: roland very dissapoined about no slam here|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: a part score here not too high for either side|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3h by n/s isnt guaranteed either|pg||
nt|asig: No|pg||
nt|asig: 5 apparent losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence  a spade a heart  2 clubs and a dim to lose|pg||
nt|haans: invite spade support|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 35 the danish west didnt find the spade lead and therefore declarer had no problem|pg||

nt|haans: for weak to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 30 imps in 3 boards so far|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is another example of inadequate fighting ofr the part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: sensible idea to me also Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i can see how this made|pg||
nt|asig: Win the ace, to rounds of trumps an another diamond|pg||

nt|lestergold: as we see ace setting tricks not always cashed today|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6-12 what option do they have but to raise?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: the teoretically correct way to play that suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S or 3@H????????|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  They must strike it out|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: from "wrong" hand - 6NT making|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: he did, at some point|pg||
nt|jakow: Avery tricky 3NT to bid!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 37 Finns made 4@h in open room, +11|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: well perhaps she was right to go up: it was the setting trick |pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 5 level many play that A denies K|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so declarer missguessed the @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H seems damp too surely a clear pass assuming double was penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  This board is no good for a strong club opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably would fail in practice buut not a bad contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: here lebensohl is often used|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n the safe and obvious spot|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard now for the N hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another straightforward and therefore relatively boring hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: can EW find 6NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: I just bid 3N as N rather than dble|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandably north has made tyhesafest sensible bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, very awkward bidding problem for N |pg||
nt|haans: suprise passing???????|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = 0-7, 1@h = @h or bal?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cenglund:  Slam depends on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: hand is too good to bid only 2n partner would pass with two many hads where 3n was laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happesn this isnt one of them |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mcphee: best is to now cash @D A and see what takes place|pg||
mb|3N|nt|asig: No problems here making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: this should make on the dim position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: but what else here to open, if 1@C means  all hands 15+? you can't open other way|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Slam is slightly over 50%, since Q singelton off-side makes as well|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h = 20+, 2NT = raise with single, 3@c = ask, 3@d = single @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT = 4441, with black single|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|pelu: from the West-hand 6NT sh be as good as 6@Cs (also in CR)|pg||

nt|asig: A push at down 1|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Veikko Jokinen, one of the old-time Finnish internationals said that it's always right to bid a slam when the finesse is working|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 3NT|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kastan88: 2NT = Preempt in minors or majors|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3@H = forcing|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3NT= majors|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 1@c= 16+, 1@d= 0-7|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: i am not a lover of this sort of opening bid|pg||

nt|fabsayc: out of control auction|pg||
nt|jakow: Somethin strange with th double of 1H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs partner to cover 3 losers, surely then north would bid more than 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: instead its the greaqt danes in a little trouble 3n easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: however weight of cards is a factor here |pg||
nt|asig: I think this should make, though|pg||
nt|asig: Not many losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims favourable so u lose 2 or 3 tump tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: just not the most elegant looking contract|pg||

nt|roswolf: chicken|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: fortunately for NS, it's just another -50 against a makeable 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: and here another 5 card suit too|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kastan88: yes, from S hand down with @S lead|pg||
nt|talion: i gues the 5@h asked about quality of openers hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Beautiful contract and good bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: But E must be careful. No @c to the Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: no losers now outside trumps|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Safe contract; investigating slam without getting overboard. Excellent technique|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4 rounds @h to make this|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcphee: you count it  as 12 points all you like, to me it's a pail of poor values|pg||
nt|mcphee: K@H and Qx@C not exactly features I am anxious to rave about|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bob you are right to view the hand with circumspection but i promise you that not an expert this side of the antarctic would agree with a pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fast 4 hearts for the make|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think it may be the correct way even single dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: a long travel from Copenhagen to Turku to play 3@H|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: but so what  |pg||

pc|h5|nt|kastan88: if double showed 5...7 points, i can't see reason to bid 6@C over partner sign off, or what was double?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kastan88: then I am some Antarctic person too, I open this hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: by the way i forgot to comment that north should have given simple pref to 2s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bid 2n|pg||
nt|kastan88: but as I said i would personally bidding 2@S after partners 2@D and waiting, may be she can do someting with her 15-pointer|pg||

nt|mcphee: normally 1NT response indicates a better hand than this poor 6 count|pg||

nt|mcphee: I would not dble as N either|pg||
nt|kastan88: in this part of Earth (East europa) we play that mostly 6..10, so I can't see reason to raise|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@S now might prevent that|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|m_niemi: so tie is the best Fin can score|pg||

nt|roswolf: i would have matti|pg||

nt|m_niemi: on @d lead 4@s makes|pg||
nt|pelu: but is the pause by S who or West |pg||
nt|pelu: for sure W will lead his singleton @C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: move @dK to @sK, how many tricks in @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume screens are in use - in which case west may be considering bidding over 3@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|xenya: S plays a @H, if W discards a@D, S cashes @DK and plays another @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel 6d looks v good|pg||
nt|pelu: both!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah both thinking!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@C must have been transfer 4@C natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: wow aggressive!! both of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lucky no double|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a hopeless spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: may even make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course every finesse in sight works|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: will require a defence worthy of that aginst the israelie raid on entebbe|pg||
nt|lestergold: and yes it may happen|pg||
nt|pelu: ok -100 against 140 :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D is just too undisciplined for me pard did bid 1nt and so has defence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: 2@S is a super accept but W is not interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: but plenty of play even on a less favouravle layout|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As the cards lie  - yes, but 2 of 3 finesses is needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: its better than that Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: because played bu south with the spade protected the fourth heart will take care of possibloe spade loser so whenever club finesse is right its a very good contract and has chances ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when clubs finess is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland mandatory and porbably in the region of upwards of 50% in any case|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 16+, 1@d = 0-7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: clubs ruff beat it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: her 2N was just a further transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: S need to take the @C-trick in on @HA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: plus all the possible helpful leads too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @d in on N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 is makeable, though maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: the standing it 30-0 + board 20 where Denmark can loose many IMPs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cenglund:  3NT would have been cold, but this is more difficult, but should make on good play|pg||

nt|m_niemi: I don't think that S needs N's count in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a suit preference situation|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 43 Finns in 3Nt in the other room as I predicted|pg||
nt|pelu: so another 6 IMPs for Finland|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not made yet|pg||

nt|lestergold: i do against weak defender|pg||

pc|d5|nt|lestergold: but its absoutely a dreadful contract|pg||

nt|lestergold: and still work to do|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||

pc|sK|nt|lestergold: well i know east is a passed hand but west is surely too good to only bid 2h|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|m_niemi: 2@s would have been very minimum raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h showed some values|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another good board for the Finns|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dQ|nt|xenya: S has to play a @D back now -- breaking communications -- difficult|pg||
nt|xenya: she has to read the situation perfectly well to do so|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: decl will have to fight for it|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E should have bid once more with 4th trump|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: even with the wasted Ks as a value this 4h is a much better contract thatn the last one for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: has his sisth tricvk only needs to find a 7th may even find an eight|pg||
nt|pelu: I was too slow - as always :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cenglund:  In my book opening 1NT with this hand is out of question |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes their conservative approach has scored a few goals in this match|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: indeed it is, I think personally W should have made a t/o dbl;e|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly e/w do not need to bid out of desperation but cant afford to miss good games- leads get reversed this way|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjöberg are still juniors I believe. Early 20's? Someone in the audience may be able to message me|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sandra 22, Emma 24|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and rather few IMPs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: again - can u defeat 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Anni and she is having a hard time. Please bear with her|pg||
nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are stuck again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|pelu: Vladimir - I take @D 10 discard 2@Cs ruff a @S and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes that's true -- you need to play a small @D early|pg||
nt|pelu: are we still waiting for the lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: makes a lot more sense over artificial 1@C than natural 1@S to preempt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  After all that fruitful chickening Koistinen had to break the line|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2+2+3+2=9, any problems?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not really, but declarer doesn't know the location of the K|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Furthermore, diamonds may be 4-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 36 imps = 23-7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finns have played very well in both tables|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if 16 boards...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 15 boards/match now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 more to Fin, Salomaa run 4 rounds of @h to make 4@s with 6-1 fit|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The only snag on Finnish scoreboard is 3NT -1 on this board|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room was @s lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: has declarer gone to sleep here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed 3nt was makeable even after spade lead|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer ducked 2nd @d, so spades were cleared, -1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: dec played S to have @dQJxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same potential problem here|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I wonder how they managed to go down in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still he cant make till he plays to trick 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade, spade, diamond, diamond to jack, and spade|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: in mps there is a lot more to gain at imps you may save a few but what a disaster if you make a big sac and they cant make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom at this level |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: NS will bid game here -- 3N or 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Not a very good decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: 17 imps is 19-11 to Finland|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: another battle of communications and not helping declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@H looks hopeless, but this has a practical chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i cant see a defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a push|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: restart scheduled in 58 mins time|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: so no second club trick and no way to make|pg||
nt|m_niemi: board 46 probably 6 imps to Den.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but there it seems overtaking for spade lead is best for defense|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@d the contract in open room|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: unlucky 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: but flat|pg||
nt|kastan88: this is last brd, ty all and cu evening again|pg||
