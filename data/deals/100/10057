nt|othered1: Few play it as other than 2-suited (Kaplan-Kay would have considered it too good to bid 3N, but that's an uncommon agreement.)|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@cX should (may) go for 300 or 500|pg||

nt|charles_l: what's he thinking about?|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|daro1950:  Seems that it could be used either way or as some sort of lead indicator, perhaps similar to Rosencrantz? But has to be discussed|pg||
nt|henryb: It might not come back. pass should indicate a willingness to hear partner bid|pg||
nt|charles_l: i'lll put it as  36245 on the list then :)|pg||
