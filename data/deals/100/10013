mb|p|nt|kamras: transfer|pg||
nt|prof 1: hi all|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @hs north?|pg||
nt|xenya: a partial for starters|pg||
nt|xenya: is it a weak NT or strong?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 15-17 seems to fit the bill|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: the @H fit found thix should propel  them to game |pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 14-16 maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamras: 11-13 NT med 2-3 spader|pg||
mb|4N|nt|arvidsson: ska man inte bjuda 2 sp?|pg||
nt|bjurn: vad hade 1@S visat?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: för att undvika att fi kommer in i budgivningen på S kort|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C by S most likely |pg||
nt|hantveit: The bidding will probably stop very fast|pg||
nt|xenya: i think they will|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 15-17 I think|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly matters here|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: well..|pg||
nt|xenya: but the uaction might be interesting with all those misfits|pg||
nt|april7: NS might compete to 3@C making even 4|pg||
nt|xenya: oh it does|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kamras: 2S! lovar 4-stöd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: bra kontrakt|pg||

nt|prof 1: critical 4@s contract|pg||
nt|snorris: can anyone double ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: S pass shows 3rd hand opening|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2@H can make here .......|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C has an issue|pg||

nt|prof 1: does this show 15\16|pg||
nt|snorris: hi|pg||
nt|hantveit: I do not like the 2nt bid here, it is ignoring partners signal|pg||
nt|hantveit: Hi|pg||
nt|april7: if NS finds the @D ruff against 3@S EW goes 2 down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dble take out or values i wonder?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: as we say  "may need her rabbi"  Rabbi rule= play A when K is single offside|pg||

pc|h6|nt|werge: OK - one reason = North has the King|pg||
nt|prof 1: def must cash @cA + 2@D VERY FAST|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 club tricks, 3 spade tricks - need 2 more|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: some kind of puppet squence quickly got them there|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Makni|pg||
nt|enachou: 1SA is forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spirited part score battle with e/w buying it but too high|pg||
pc|hT|nt|arvidsson: ser ut att bli 8 stick|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|tjolpe:  Vi har det so PMS|pg||
nt|snorris: well..e-w are endplayed all the time more or less|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer must be careful here -- the one thing he shouldn't do is draw trumps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|enachou: with @h sure :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes, a @c would have been a better lead|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hantveit: Difficult for EW to get 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|werge: UPS...|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer would have been in trouble if trumps were 4-1  |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he is trying to find a line that would cater for the bad break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|snorris: guessing -1|pg||
nt|hantveit: now they can get 3 diamond tricks, 2 heart tricks and club ace, good def to play the diamonds from Vest|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|arvidsson: alltså efter 1 sp, för att undvika att fi kommer in|pg||
nt|raghavan: good D Q entry for enjoying H|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|werge: Best spot here is 2 @H E/W - or 1 @H...|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @cs vs 3@d|pg||
nt|hantveit: close hands again, 21-19 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 20/20 -- some competition here? |pg||
nt|andyv:  2 way partials |pg||
nt|andyv:  but E/W should buy it for 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Not my cup of tee, such a suit-quality for a weak two - and now 2 @H will not be the contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hussein2: Would everyone consider wk 2 opening E hand? Looks light to me although it is on a favarobale vuln.|pg||
nt|prof 1: i think 3@d ppp|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but EW rate to win the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 1N here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Why let the opponents go down, if you can manage to do it yourself...|pg||
nt|prof 1: i wonder who is thinking|pg||
nt|raghavan: Trend of boards in this set may be more part scores than games & slams|pg||
nt|snorris: a conservative pass in s|pg||
nt|xenya: not now maybe|pg||
nt|enachou: there 1sa is the contract on NS but impossible to play 1sa when you play 1sa forcing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rnmalik: max:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: looking for trick 7|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: hello again |pg||
nt|sybarra: and she made 6 @H well done |pg||
nt|werge: Nobody|pg||
nt|hussein2: Can this 3@d make? Doesn't look bad on 10@s lead. W might get endplayed |pg||
nt|sybarra: may need to play ace and a @D |pg||
nt|werge: In practice you are 1 down in 3 @D|pg||
nt|prof 1: -1 at least|pg||
nt|hussein2: If E did not exit with @h, her p will get endplayed!|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: I would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree Snorri, it seems like a minor fight, but 3spades NS is not a bad contract either|pg||
nt|andyv:  can it ever be right to balance with 1@d in these situations?|pg||
nt|xenya: a fairly routine 4@H for NS -- but also a fine save for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: north may come to regret her reponse here|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless she drops the auction right now|pg||
nt|april7: N should pass otherwise NS ends up in an unmakable game contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am surprised that with 19 south did not make a more robust /forcing rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the K @S sets up J @S for 7th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: 2@H är naturligt men med @C-håll skulle jag tro|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 2 hj alerteras antagligen för att det visar håll i kl|pg||
nt|minnie lee: lokks like 2@d. N has no bid because of the @h bid in W|pg||
nt|hantveit: Agree, think 1spade is an obvious bid for me also, too difficult to bid it later.|pg||
nt|snorris: would be otherwise if s bid @s first time|pg||
nt|xenya: yes it can it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't do justice to his hand|pg||
nt|xenya: well E is there...|pg||
nt|frankaus: that say 4@H by opps  is a transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: S's hand to strong for 1@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@S and back @S 7th trick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|werge: Cover...|pg||
nt|andyv:  how about a simple dbl over 1@d?|pg||
nt|frankaus: trafic light say green|pg||
nt|lestergold: south knew when to underbid her hand!!!|pg||
nt|april7: might be angry about teh pqass by NS but after seeing the dummy.....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tjolpe:  Det stÃ¤mmer|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 Clubs for NS seems better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead will now make a extyar lub for a heart discard|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: you make a most natural lead from KQ10x and, of course, it costs a trick -- always happens to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: E exiting a @D hoping NS do something else to help|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D must must multi, including a big bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just guess I am afraid since I do not have their conv. cards |pg||
nt|xenya: the key feature here is the double fits for both sides |pg||
nt|lestergold: extra cklub|pg||
pc|h4|nt|arvidsson: intressant om man felaktigt spelar spader till Q och ruter|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Man kan gÃ¥ bet om man tar tvÃ¥ ronder trumf och misslyckas i sÃ¥vÃ¤l spader som ruter.|pg||
nt|xenya: but E opted to sarifice ven without knowing that|pg||
nt|frankaus: the light 1@S overcall has done the trick here|pg||
nt|xenya: *even|pg||
nt|enachou: strange lead from N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and once y lead 4th best y play in to AJ doubleton:) tough|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: do they lead low from a doubleton?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  Roland, do you know what NT range E/W play?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hussein2: @h now is a must!|pg||
nt|prof 1: now it is easier|pg||
nt|xenya: but turns out to be quite effective|pg||

nt|hussein2: Will make now|pg||
nt|prof 1: @c ten|pg||
nt|hantveit: K108xx, x,xx,Axxx and I still think you should bid 1spade|pg||
nt|minnie lee: right but S passed with his @s|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|xenya: all woiuld have been easy for EW had E opened 1N -- but it looks like they are playing a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all. Sorry for being late.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashid|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Rashid|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can get 2 club ruffs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|enachou: @h and @c ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: E knows W is short @H and with a stiff @D  the save is quite clear after the @S overcall|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: east's 8 of spades will come into its own|pg||
pc|c5|nt|werge: Ils ont filé le coup, like the french say|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure club 10 because you can see cards |pg||
nt|minnie lee: agreed, I would have bid 1@s|pg||
nt|april7: helpful lead by W|pg||
nt|april7: now @C ofcourse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hussein2: loll|pg||
nt|hussein2: Lucky Nessrine! |pg||
nt|sybarra: just any high card in dummy pls |pg||
nt|hussein2: She will play the Q|pg||
nt|prof 1: no it is the worst return but the only chance to avoid the end play|pg||
nt|werge: One good thing to be said abaout Easts defence - she did not use the information, Wests hesitation in secend round of @D had given!!!|pg||
nt|prof 1: she has the J  u dont see|pg||
nt|sybarra: are they playing with screens?   I would assume so |pg||
nt|werge: But screens do not eliminate hesitation during PLAY|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c9|nt|pelu: she forgot to count her tricks - had to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello peter |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes needed one ruff in hand |pg||
nt|pelu: hi Sherley|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hussein2: WD Hussein :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
nt|andyv:  if playing a strong club, doesn't dbl show a 17-19 NT hand in this situation?|pg||
nt|enachou: S can't guess that K@c is a singleton|pg||
nt|enachou: it's not good to lead a K singleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: malani should get the credit for this swing should it not be replicated in the CR|pg||
nt|xenya: well actually you don't need any ruffs here to set it 2 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: south would have been better sticking to @S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: but the @C's are foing to come home |pg||
nt|werge: East defence: TOO fast|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@D or gone|pg||
nt|xenya: S knows everything by know and should cash @DK|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|april7: no use ducking on generalprinciples|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: declarer can't control the hand |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: yes should be easy to see K@D... was not though|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|xenya: i think pass would show that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: @C now to set up the suit -- fror 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: another club now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well played bu south|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: nice defense|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: what does she think?  someone throwing away K of @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  i would think pass is 1 round force with no clear direction (i.e. no @d stopper)|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, E just might have upgraded his hand, playing a natural system|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: would earn all the match points for sure |pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: likely a nice result for South Africa|pg||
mc|8|nt|hantveit: I do not understand why they do not claim. |pg||

nt|rnmalik: part score available here|pg||
nt|frankaus: openings not what they used to be either will N open ?|pg||
nt|enachou: i think N think opening 2 or 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w combined 25 but the duplication adn unkind layout looks like any game bid is doomed|pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone gets too aggressive here is in the soup|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score hand more of Gulash type-can be swing board|pg||

mb|1S|nt|tjolpe:  Anders, vet jag inte, kanske 10-11|pg||
nt|xenya: of course 1@C was natural|pg||
nt|frankaus: if N opens will E X for T/O and will W leave it in? |pg||
nt|enachou: 2@h there is bicolor @h and minor 54+ weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s being the obvious candidate|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N more likely i think -- but we shall see|pg||

nt|andyv:  very borderline 4th seat opener|pg||
nt|xenya: to say the least|pg||
nt|frankaus: now on the way to 3@C then ?|pg||
nt|xenya: naturally S tries to find N's other suit|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 3@S!|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sybarra: but my pard may still bid 2 @S with 6 of them |pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt I say "wait and see"|pg||
nt|sybarra: W knows where the high cards are |pg||
nt|andyv:  -200 or -300 very possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: can N pass now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you if south leads singleton diamond (a poor choice with qjx trumps) it could let the game thru|pg||
nt|april7: its close to a mirror hand and if EW reach 4 @S E can't make it .Depends on @D play whether 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT must have been a 3 card @S raise it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: S had a DBL to me|pg||
nt|xenya: both 4@H and pass by S are somewhat mysterious |pg||
nt|yo_yo: if only to shut north up|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: but NS have not been on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|daman: whatever happened to drury?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont see point as i said|pg||
nt|april7: better than @D singleton, no spare trump|pg||
nt|xenya: ah there comes 4N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to save worst result S should have DBL..ED.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: playing WJS (weak 2@S/2@H) over 1@C N would bid 2@S |pg||
nt|lestergold: only when you find pard with two quick entries and get two ruffs would this work|pg||
nt|xenya: they have no red cards?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: en straf om han gissar spadern, och det gör han. 6 IMP till Everfresh|pg||
nt|minnie lee: well, I'm wrong|pg||

nt|frankaus: i guess N happy for 50's even quite a few of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: why not|pg||
nt|hantveit: If heart is not breaking you are gone, you have more tricks in 4H|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 tricks in NT, 5 tricks in H|pg||
nt|timmy5: his partner told him i have a good holding in diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: also i'm puzzled by W's 1N (instead of 1@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hardly N has found the best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: oh W has got one|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the phantom save|pg||

nt|snorris: north ha sto be careful|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  spade shift by S would have been quick curtains|pg||
nt|frankaus: in not certain they forgot - many would pass 2@S to muddy the waters|pg||

nt|lestergold: error|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frankaus: always run if Xed|pg||

pc|cT|nt|arvidsson: nu behövs ingen spader giss längre|pg||
nt|hantveit: Has winning chances, but need to guess hearts og clubs right. Mabye he can get an endplay in spades|pg||

nt|april7: only though if W gives E the @D ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: I like 2 clubs first, then 3diamonds later, showing 5 clubs and 4 diamonds. No need to rush the bidding with a strong hand where you can bid NT at any time|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/r3f2gp  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|bjurn: nja, än finns det väl möjligheter för Scania. |pg||
nt|timmy5: or 6d?|pg||
nt|minnie lee: or 6@d?|pg||
nt|raghavan: y|pg||
nt|snorris: 6@cs in north a possibility|pg||
nt|snorris: here|pg||
nt|xenya: -3?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S X would be quite expesive|pg||
nt|xenya: something starnge has happened in the play here -- why didn't N pitch the @S loser?|pg||
nt|april7: now we have a grand!|pg||
nt|daman: the grand salami|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will do well to bid it with confidence we can count 13 top tricks but they have to count them in the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have excellent save in 7h if they are allowed to play there|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S  3 or 4@D or only 2 and if NS finds their good fit in @C and the void in @H the grand is bidable|pg||
nt|lestergold: or 7d for that matter|pg||
nt|april7: 7@D might push NS to 7@S!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has all the potential for a brief but exciting auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has a difficult decision as to what to open|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 4s|pg||
nt|april7: without oponents bidding its easy:1@S 2@C 4@H and so on|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Avram but at this vulnerability east would be  in even over a 4s openere|pg||
nt|daman: this is a baby grand   not getting there would be cause to revamp your bidding system|pg||
nt|lestergold: a baby gfrand George with no interference yes|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S X is also possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the baby might grow into a stroppy teenager|pg||
nt|daman: with warts|pg||
nt|xenya: very well done by EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S here EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west didnt bid his full value imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: He will open 1D|pg||
nt|hantveit: they did bid 1spade on board 2 in the open, gaining 6 imps|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: teoretiskt, ja|pg||
nt|werge: That was what West ought to have played...|pg||
nt|werge: Here 140 is a cood score for E/W|pg||
nt|raghavan: so may be in D contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: 2d for majors|pg||
nt|snorris: 6@ds also ok|pg||
nt|hantveit: if 2 shows both major, I think I would prefer 4 spades here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d not enuf!!|pg||
nt|daman: will get there now   3@C by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 5d?|pg||
nt|daman: then 5NT|pg||
nt|daman: to make sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: But can be a bit hard to give up the 3nt so early|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bjurn: Scania behöver 21 IMP på 8 brickor samtidigt som antingen Everfresh eller Hans-Ove behöver tappa 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.egypt-bridge.org/Zone%2009.asp|pg||
nt|minnie lee: 6@d to play|pg||
nt|raghavan: will be pushed to 6D|pg||
nt|timmy5: i think yes|pg||
nt|xenya: things haven't been going too well for Egypt so far|pg||
nt|andyv:  played N for Jxx of hearts|pg||
nt|april7: 5NT now by N:Josephine|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u mean north'sname is Josephine or Josephine grand slam force|pg||
nt|april7: then 7@C and 7@D and then 7@S:):)|pg||
nt|daman: sfar's first name is Napoleon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Egypt playing extremely well and getting some help also|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: nexi 12 IMP for Egypt from the 4@H misplayed - 3NT making in Open|pg||
mb|2S|nt|werge: You are welcome to play with me - but please know, that I do NOT bid 2 @D...|pg||
nt|sybarra: website but they are not posting results that I can find |pg||
nt|hantveit: I prefer to give as much information I can to my partner, look how difficult it is now for North. |pg||
nt|hantveit: 4 hearts would make things very easy for North.|pg||
nt|timmy5: but 6sp is not bad at all|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 5spades now, and they might still find 6D|pg||
nt|minnie lee: 6@c would help alot|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, 6spades do not look too bad. -3 is it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have th eright idea but not taking up enough space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S from Nabil?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1NT by S the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 for me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely not, vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: take a look at the venue! |pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S was weak|pg||
nt|mariner1: E can't hold what I need for slam and I want to be in game|pg||
mb|3N|nt|arvidsson: 2 sp eller x?|pg||
nt|raghavan: How to enter Yousry hand in 5S|pg||
nt|hantveit: there is the pass...|pg||
nt|hantveit: With single heart, spade ace, and club ace and king there should be possible for north to bid 6d now|pg||
nt|minnie lee: last hand a pass on 3NT and now no help to play a grzat contract...either in @c or @d|pg||
nt|raghavan: Vul is a fear|pg||
nt|snorris: a  better bid in north was 5@cs instead of 5 @ds|pg||
nt|minnie lee: the best bid was 2@h|pg||
nt|snorris: then south would bid 6 |pg||
nt|timmy5: this delay might prevent east west from bidding 6spds|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would not reveal my hand  by bidding C|pg||
nt|timmy5: if N-S bid 6ds|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, only 6 losers and a good 5 card suit, so 5 clubs is a good bid. But the negative is a little bit weak trumph|pg||
nt|xenya: excellen slam here -- think they'll get there|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H slam here|pg||
nt|daman: has to bid 7 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north lost the plot in this auction|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT is so simple|pg||
nt|daman: my mother would bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east west may get awy with a save in 7h doubled if tghey do they will make a massive profit|pg||
nt|april7: whay 3 @S? if the @C are rigid then 13 tricks in @C so 5NT was best forN|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N is brave|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice call by W here|pg||
nt|xenya: also purposeless i think|pg||
nt|xenya: i meant brave and purposeless|pg||
nt|yo_yo: samjee will probably bid now, after what we saw previously|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he might be trying to generate a swing,,,,,,, being behind|pg||
nt|mariner1: is N thinkin or E|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: jag hade föredragit Dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: now @S X|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3S was an awful lost opportunity|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamras: Eftyer att ha förnekat 3-korts är väl Ax ok att bjuda 2Sp på|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 6@Cs but at @C-lead will make life hard for decl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in case of some values with this is a ploy for a scrafice against 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: all you achieve is show declarer your distribution, because you can't seriously hope to win the auction here |pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: 3 trump-loosers and - at least - 1 @D|pg||
nt|raghavan: take a + score|pg||
nt|hantveit: This will most likely be a gain for East West|pg||
nt|snorris: a good board for e-w again|pg||
nt|timmy5: very good actually|pg||
nt|raghavan: Kope does not lead CK|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope|pg||
nt|timmy5: if they dont get heart ruff will be even better|pg||
nt|frankaus: will make 13 i expect|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is too powerful to stop short of 6@H|pg||
nt|xenya: not at these colours|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: 7 makes on a trump finesse -- so it shouldn't be bid |pg||
nt|daman: this is a joke really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes now what? n/s cannot guess their way to the grand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|arvidsson: nu skulle sivve sitta vid bordet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: x i 3hj och massor av imp in|pg||
nt|bjurn: jo, men visar inte dubbelt också acceptans för @Sn?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hade inte 2nt visat 4-6 i @d @c?|pg||
nt|bjurn: varför sälja ut @D-färgen när man kan hålla liv i alla färger med dubbelt?|pg||
nt|andyv:  sound contract|pg||
nt|daman: they did|pg||
nt|april7: very good bid by S!!!|pg||
nt|daman: comedy of errors|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they did oh my i preictedf an exciting auction but i could not have dreamt this one up for a hefty pay packet|pg||
nt|daman: EW will have a hard time explaining this to their team|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear the excellent save pushed them to the grand they couldnt find by normal bidding|pg||
nt|april7: S can't imagine a void in @H with N and only  15 HP,so must bid 7!!|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|werge: After 4 boards, 31 IMP´s at stake|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S was a real reach imo  |pg||
nt|hussein2: One important fact here; this zonals is being played in Sharm El-Sheikh wich is extremly hot at the moment -- keeping in mind the wethear, I am sure ladies will tend to swing ...|pg||
nt|hussein2: seeking some cool air :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and a nice sequence|pg||
nt|rnmalik: reasonable contract and should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the trouble with bidding 4@H, partner gets carried away|pg||
pc|d2|nt|arvidsson: tror x är det mest flexibla budet, när rutern är så dålig|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: they will know they miss a KC|pg||
nt|april7: remember N opened 2@C!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@H here has no purpose either,,,,,,,, E can't have what W needs as a|pg||
nt|mariner1: passed hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: S should know they are missing a keycard now, so just small slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all is well that ends well|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|raghavan: good|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|sybarra: are we headed to 6 @C or 5 @C?|pg||
nt|pelu: if u play '1430' u can bid 4NT now : 5@C = 1 A and u pass and 2@H = 2Acws and u bid 6@C|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: he needs AQ @S A@C and K@D  from a passed hand... A@H would not help|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kamras: Visst Björn, men kanske inte Hx. 2NT kanske överdriver rutern. Svår avvägning mellan dessa tre bud|pg||
nt|sybarra: the sequence of pulling to 4 @C should make @C slam easy to bid  |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|pelu: to make 6@C u need to set up the @S-suit or ruff 3 red cards in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a commentators curse comment |pg||
nt|pelu: ok 1 down in 4@S with a play for 6@C - Reunion have a bad start on this match|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: its not over yet, @C must greak|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h6|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: well this is not the first time ive seen a 2c opener well short on high card points but the hand is so powerful anything  else is an underbid and who has systems to cater for these ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: its hard for east to know they can make 7 i sympathise but i think east should have done a bit more jumping in the bidding|pg||
mb|1S|nt|arvidsson: 3hj verkar obetbart|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 4 hj har väldigt goda chanser|pg||

nt|timmy5: west is Ahmed Youssry and East is sherief Noshy both played in several juniors world championships|pg||
nt|minnie lee: an example of bad communication here...afetr 2@d I would bid 2@h in S or alternatively after 4@s, I would bid 5@c in N|pg||
nt|xenya: another slam hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make4 @H I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they get there|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 2@D?|pg||
nt|bjurn: kort @D med öppningsstyrka kanske|pg||
nt|arvidsson: öppningshand med 0-1 ruter|pg||
nt|bjurn: trefärgshand|pg||
nt|werge: Nort should raise to 4 @H - now and then the opponents want to play 4 @S...|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 4 they made the 3 @D in the other room |pg||
nt|rnmalik: no CA+HK+AS|pg||
nt|xenya: easy -- 2@H  -- pass -- 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I raise to 2@H with W here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with Q@H lead some play will be required |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @C is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it if they were not prepared to bid 7  in the first place what made them so confident to bid it given a second chance what was the new info?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D  p 1@H-p- 1@S -1NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: E might be leary of @S problem with DBL on Left|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: not many safe contracts on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: tobbe börjar med AK i spader om kontraktet står kvar?|pg||
nt|bjurn: nu hamnade @Sn på hel hand|pg||
nt|bjurn: fel hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S suit may come into play now|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1s is ugly and dangerous|pg||
nt|daman: the 7@H bid on the last only cost EW 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: or 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 5@C good save here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kamras: Vid andra bordet Återbjöd Nord 2Sp i stället för 2Hj, som han kanske inte tyckte han hade kort till. Men då tycker jag man hellre passar på 2Ru|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the problem for West is that they play 2@D as GF opening - and then it is almost impossible to show a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|timmy5: very intresting hands N-S are having|pg||
nt|xenya: N taking a save|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: if penalty, W's double is very lazy i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  3@S var ett mÃ¤rkligt bud, givet att parntern kan ha 3415|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 4 kl blir inte billigt det heller|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kommer Åhlén att dubbla är frågan|pg||

nt|sybarra: unfortunately I have to leave,  so sorry to miss the end of this  |pg||
nt|snorris: dont think they will find their @d fit|pg||
nt|raghavan: why not open 1D and bid 2c,...3c|pg||
nt|xenya: but it may be a go-on double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: Samjee led a spade vs 3nt on board 3 = 10 tricks. |pg||
nt|timmy5: the bidding was a bit different|pg||
nt|snorris: 4nt looks like a quantum bid|pg||
nt|timmy5: can't be|pg||
nt|snorris: but south answers his aces|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ace asking - I thinl|pg||
nt|timmy5: seems Like rkcb|pg||
nt|hantveit: this is the second time Zindel is not showing is second minor suit - it will probably be his second loss...|pg||
nt|raghavan: trump is not agreed|pg||
nt|hantveit: Anyone opens 1dia here, and rebid 2 clubs 3 clubs?|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- it is a poor game -- just happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what is going on?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: i mean the previous hand|pg||

nt|timmy5: 2spds would have been better in my opinion|pg||

nt|rnmalik: even 4@H was difficult to make|pg||

nt|mariner1: no reason to stick neck out with a p that can only bid 2@H|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Didn't occur to me.  It has the advantage of being right.  This time...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough hand to bid.|pg||
nt|xenya: EW stopped in 3@C in OR -- no doubt as a result of some misunderstanding|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|timmy5: sometimes with this holding i prefer not to be in 4spds:)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|arvidsson: han inte med EW kort men korrekt Björn|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  just det!|pg||
nt|xenya: opposite a passed partner|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|arvidsson: tur att man spelar med RKC, annars är det lätt att komma i denna slamm|pg||

nt|hantveit: Board 4 nor reached the diamond contract...|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true but has to be bid|pg||
nt|xenya: but yes, it was not an easy hand to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: Championship Bermuda , Venice & Seniors Qualifications|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  this should get them there|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D has a play, though can be beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: har man till 2hj på E|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know the convention, but can't imagine how 3@cs could be anything but an escape.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@Cs would be better contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 @D tougher played in S,,, in N  a @H lead would give it a chance|pg||
mb|3C|nt|werge: Now it´s 36 degrees...|pg||
nt|raghavan: with this jump sure slam bid|pg||
nt|timmy5: brd no 5 went ideal in open room|pg||
nt|snorris: now nothing can hold east back..after 3@ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  polish 2S bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5-5...2N asks other suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: asking for feature?|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 2@S is a bit too heavy here, if it denies normal opening values|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like a polish weak 2...2 spades shows 5 spades and 5 of other suit...5-10hcp or so|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow S didn't pass, so all will be well for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  judging by length N is taking to bid, i'm guessing this may not be polish:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: What would 3 NY from East have shown???|pg||
nt|werge: NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: full power!|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pushy but a good bid - only 6 losers and good trumph|pg||
nt|raghavan: RKC 2 without Trump Q|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D on 5 brought Morocco 9 imps when NS in OR reached 3N, going 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: 3NT går nog bet med @S ut (Öst har inte nog med ingångar för två @Cmaskar)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: har N tillräckligt med ingångar att få spadersticken?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get too high here |pg||
nt|enachou: i think 3@c is not forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead beats it|pg||
nt|xenya: S must have been thinking how to steer th eauction into a minor-suit game -- he took a simple road|pg||
nt|xenya: seems dubious to me though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he does have a @D play IF he plays K@D from hand 1st, which is counter|pg||
nt|mariner1: intuitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: man duckar andra spadern?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there are many variations after weak 2 and 2NT-some partnerships play singleton-some honour in a side suit etc|pg||
nt|enachou: that show 6@c 16 17pts|pg||
nt|santyclz: It was one which required "Least Lie" bidding.  I guess mixing a @c up in your @ss is probably the best thing you can do.|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have done well to bid 4s which i think is infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: needs careful management tho|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H is a very good save against the 4@S contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h excellent save and should find it really|pg||
nt|lestergold: east'shand enormous in offence useless in defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: too bad the @S fall as they do |pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might, East has shown both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
nt|mariner1: he also has the failing @c hook|pg||
nt|yo_yo: restricted choice when East plays J@D?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: good stop |pg||
nt|pelu: now N has to pull the breakes - she has done her duty (or more) by bidding 4@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are they playing a forcing @c?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: can we scream LOW?|pg||
nt|andyv:  again, i don't think this is a normal weak 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear overboard|pg||
nt|mariner1: good play :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: try:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I knew he would do that :) )|pg||

nt|yo_yo: come one!|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|hantveit: East West seems much more solid and confident.  What do you think guys?|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N followed by 3S was invitational...N was certainly at top of his range|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eoff on tis obvious lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: oh dear|pg||
nt|mariner1: commentator's curse,,,,,, :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: i this case, Makni, there was no misunderstaing -- but i'm surprised W didn't try to probe for more|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not lets not draw trumps |pg||
nt|xenya: i agree, Andy -- many would just open 1@S with the N, getting to the same spot|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|april7: but it was in teams a necessary bid, because it might make and 5@H goes only 1 or 2 off|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|bjurn: nu bjuder Öst och kommenterar "jag har inte kommit för att passa"? :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  3NT av VÃ¤st gÃ¥r vÃ¤l inte att beta|pg||
nt|pelu: I would have bid 3@D in S - they play 4 card @D opening - 2@D= 11+|pg||
nt|snorris: not the best contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: but almost normal|pg||
nt|hantveit: It is terrible to feel you are doing everything wrong, easy things are suddenly hard. I had the same feeling last sunday, for those of you who watched...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Finessing D 10 is need to make 3NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @hs had chanses|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahh, that explains some things.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if he's getting the ruff he needs to beat this.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|lestergold: well hard to make this as cards lie|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pelu: bid your hand first time - this could cost a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @D also,  maybe I can keep them out of the bidding |pg||
nt|xenya: should be a quick 1 off on this lead|pg||
nt|april7: this contract is goind as also 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: hjowever defence has to find the spade switch after the forced dim duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho what else can east play she cannot play passive with that club suit sitting in front of her eyes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS will get a plus at last|pg||
nt|mariner1: this looks flat though|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Det tog lite längre tid att komma till samma kontrakt som i slutna rummet. Larsson gör allting snabbt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: and then pd can decide if we have to go on to 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: kill point now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hantveit: better to duck the diamond q, but difficult|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: Not EVEN in this hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: making 5|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mens den spiller færdig, er det tid til at sige nogle afsluttende ord. Det bliver så på dansk ....|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north decided not to duck so it will go off easily|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|werge: What can East possibly have been thinking after partners bid - at 3-level and in a suit, where you have K D B 4 - the answer is not very polite...|pg||
nt|werge: And 3 NT is no winner, 8 tricks are not enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @D he makes 5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: @C to A and 3! @C-ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c seems pretty unilateral here...i guess the pass cards were missing|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|timmy5: defenders can make things harder if S doesnt cover the first diamond declarer will have to guess|pg||
nt|raghavan: if D is ducked - will take 4 clubs - down 1|pg||
nt|timmy5: not ducked|pg||
nt|snorris: no..south shouldnt cover the queen|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Næstsidste spil i denne kamp og vores transmission fra Sverige. Mange tak til Ida, Mikael og Johan Grönkvist, vores fremragende operatører i Örebro. Virkeligt flot arbejde. Uden ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: jer ville der ikke have været noget at vise!|pg||
nt|timmy5: south had a better play to play small on the 1st diamond|pg||
nt|xenya: clever pitch, @CQ -- but N was not taken in|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Også tak til alle vore kommentatorer hele helgen. Glimrende analyser krydret med an pæn portion humor. Tak fordi I har givet timer og ekspertise til glæde for vore mange tilskuere. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Vi har brugt 22 svenske kommentatorer siden i torsdags|pg||
nt|bjurn: (och nu känns vi förbrukade)|pg||
nt|snorris: then west has toguess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think north should duck because she has the contract made if the clubs come in and if they dont east has to find the spade switch|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|werge: CLAIM|pg||
nt|raghavan: done|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Endelig siger vi tak til FSB (Förbundet Svensk Bridge) for at man valgte BBO til disse transmissioner. Carina Westlin og Carl Ragnarsson har udført et stort arbejde for at få det ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: til at fungere optimalt, og det lykkedes!|pg||
nt|hantveit: if you do not cover, dec will likely play J next time, now he runs the 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: taking the dim was therefore a panic play in my opinion|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Tak allesammen|pg||

nt|snorris: so e-w even lucky on the mis-bid boards|pg||
nt|hantveit: lucky and good|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: hur ser kampen om silvret ut?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H EW this time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bjurn: tätt tätt|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: East did not want to bid 2 clubs on 1nt because opps would get information. |pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  tied match as E took a rather unique approach to 4@s contract on board 7|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S by W on a @C lead or finding the @C Q|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: though 5 @D is a very good save|pg||
nt|yo_yo: drury ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: drury works for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|daman: they won't find 5@D|pg||
nt|april7: S not strong enpough for 2NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: drury is very unpopular here in UK|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3nt or 5 @ds |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, not easy to see how that 4@S could go down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did s not have a natural 2@d available or did he choose not to make one?  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s should make because the hearts will show up 5/2 on discovery play trhus making it more likely that south has the club length|pg||
nt|april7: but E took the bid away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it used to be banned in fact|pg||
nt|mariner1: that's because of 4 card majors?|pg||
nt|mariner1: why was it banned?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lots used to use it as a psyche|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: f.n. har Hans-Ove 151 och Everfresh 150 med två brickor kvar att scorea|pg||
nt|raghavan: 26 between them - land in 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: weak 3rd in hand opener, then pass 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 1 down|pg||
nt|hantveit: jump to 3nt = minimum hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tjolpe:  d v s bÃ¥da lagen har tvÃ¥ givar kvar|pg||
nt|sybarra: safely in 2 @H  |pg||
nt|pelu: is it tiome now to bid 3@D? - easy for me - I can see the S-hand :)|pg||
nt|werge: If West covers the secend @C from hand, she will get a @D-ruff instead...|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT must be a form of Bergen|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card limit raise|pg||
nt|april7: as before|pg||
nt|lestergold: or it may be a raise to 3s or better|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes agreed, pysche'ing it should be discourages|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's allowed again now though|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hantveit: Do we know what 3 clubs is?|pg||
nt|snorris: natural it seems|pg||
nt|timmy5: fit|pg||
nt|april7: hand  3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have the ultimate discovery play at trcik 1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  W pulled 2 rounds of trump and then ruffed @d in dummy... was stranded with 2 heart losers|pg||
nt|daman: making 4|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|timmy5: 4 clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and it was very well executed as well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|raghavan: what is 2C|pg||
nt|snorris: 4. suit|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||
nt|raghavan: then he says he has clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: the latter i think|pg||
nt|daman: next hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope they dont land in @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is the suit 2@D supported|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H is a worry|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjurn: 1@C är dubbeltydigt (11-13 NT eller 17+); 1@H är naturligt, 8+|pg||
nt|timmy5: not necessary|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  jag undrar vafÃ¶r inte Anders bjÃ¶d 3NT pÃ¥ 1NT och visade sin 17-19 hand med 5ko spader?|pg||
nt|bjurn: 1@S visar @S med starka handen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: han ansåg nog att sina 19 kunde vara för bra mot händer som passar på 3nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 tricks likly..maybe 12 ?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: though again W should realize that it is unlikely a passed hand has what he|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a difference in bidding close slams and looking for magic fits|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the alert says 4 card support, am I seeing things?|pg||
nt|xenya: very true, Rob|pg||
pc|h2|nt|timmy5: but East has a description he can make so why not|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: look at the movie,7 @S contracts!!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|timmy5: 11 only|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 tricks, but some communication issues|pg||
nt|hantveit: with dia 2-2 there are no dangers, but dec dos not know that|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@S K@H A@D can he have more? and with those slam is???|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose unlucky that each has 2@C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|arvidsson: och ville göra en mild invit  till högre höjder|pg||
nt|kamras: 1@S kan fortfarande vara svaga handen|pg||
nt|mariner1: and those cards are at best.......|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has 6 looser hand a passed hand can only provide 3 covering cards-sorry but bad bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: another warning is the 3@S call, W should realize that he might have 1 or more|pg||
nt|mariner1: losers in @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: it also says E does not hold long @D or @c|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and taps now |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: this gets messy |pg||
nt|timmy5: but when he playes he will know|pg||
nt|hantveit: now it is over :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Definately an iffy one.  Standard in the jr's and midnight swiss.|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a great believer in leading singletons against suit contracts but i think here that north had  quite a lot of stroength to hope to fins south with a fast  entry to get a club ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: ruff|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: oh i don't know Rob -- in my view 3@S is just a cuebid |pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: not ideal defence|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tjolpe:  parntern har max 12 pinnar, men kanske han kan ha en intressantare fÃ¶rdelning, typ x Exxx K10xxx Exx?|pg||
nt|daman: in this match, every time a singleton was led the opps profited|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|april7: @DK a much better lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: no 3@S is fit showing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|werge: Now West is endplayed...|pg||
nt|xenya: showing an honour|pg||
nt|mariner1: only fit|pg||
nt|xenya: but they have agreed @Hs already|pg||

nt|werge: A nice 5 @D here, difficult to bid|pg||
nt|snorris: 4@ss e-w|pg||
nt|hantveit: club ace and new club would be the best defence - with open cards :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
mb|p|nt|prof 1: 1@s - x - 2@s|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, 4sp is a fine contract|pg||
nt|minnie lee: I am a sceptic so when I see 2@c bid, I would lead A@c to see the dummy and when the Q falls small @c because I have 1-2 potential tricks to get back with the @c again|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C -- both majors?|pg||
nt|april7: it wasn't the best bidding sequence|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 2 or 3 @H here|pg||

nt|werge: Trump|pg||
nt|hantveit: that would be a great lead :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2nt a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|minnie lee: that would have been my lead...eyes closed!|pg||
nt|xenya: if so, E must be pleased|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7 of either minor rolls, but even 6 may be tuff to bid.|pg||
nt|mariner1: even though Kjx @H are in W there is an entry issue to S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|werge: pass|pg||
nt|prof 1: i aggree with S pass with bal hand|pg||
nt|snorris: 2nt showing the unbid suits..|pg||

nt|raghavan: E will bid 4 S - has enormous strength|pg||
nt|minnie lee: nothing to loose and everything to gain!|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS might have a very agressive style on the 2h bid, making south bidding a carefully pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: i wouldnt lead ace of clubs if anyone told me queen is singelton|pg||
nt|april7: first 1NT opening|pg||

nt|april7: do they play weak NT? or precision?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should be max|pg||
pc|hA|nt|timmy5: Invitational hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 3n has more prospects than 4h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: what does 4N mean in this situation, i wonder -- do they know that?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: 1@D alltid obalanserat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11-16|pg||
nt|raghavan: and H A will be lead for a club discard|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess would be that 3h is a good raise with spade support|pg||
nt|hantveit: trumph out after these actions is to recommend...|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes possible|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|santyclz: Take the plunge!  You know you wanted to bid 6 over 4@ss.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: avoided going overboard-tricky hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@C and another|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand however he may get help|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: Pass showing 1st round control of @ss.|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's hand very suitable for no trumps very uncopmfortable for hearts|pg||
nt|daman: they landed on their feet|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid ladies|pg||
nt|lestergold: stil hard work tho|pg||
nt|daman: a lot easier than 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hantveit: 11 easy tricks, next pls|pg||
nt|daman: ouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a lot easier with this lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: absurd lead|pg||
nt|daman: totally|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|xenya: whatever NS do know, they win the board|pg||
nt|lestergold: qc lead looks sensible|pg||
nt|daman: not on the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: ity happens to give a trick and of course west cant return them but it looks, like the best shot|pg||
nt|april7: N will finesse the @H correctly,why not @C lead? needs very little from partner|pg||
nt|daman: @Cs were bid and supported|pg||
nt|daman: partner is like to be void    that's why|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok klead a second suit of the opps like spades not the first suit bid on ur left|pg||
nt|daman: you could give away the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a hand advertised as strongish|pg||
nt|daman: yes   a @S would be better than a @C imo|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: With the mirror minors, the sac is a little to expensive.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|april7: now N can give up a @S and so making his necessary tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: or not -- they need to beat it by 5 -- perhaps they can't do that?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H lead pretty much does him in|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|timmy5: u have to tell the players that|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to be care in pitching|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|santyclz: Only -4, you're right.|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Oh well...|pg||
nt|xenya: @DA looks very starnge, with Kx in view|pg||
nt|daman: we are seeing things double dummy   think about putting yourself in East's seat and go from there    not every contract should be beat|pg||
nt|april7: communication problems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: nortyh houild be asking herself why did east lead a short heart?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hantveit: The 2H bid increased the possibility for south to hold 4 diamonds, but east has 10 trics even with dia 4-1|pg||

nt|rnmalik: before playing 9@D he should cashed AK@H to make it easier for himself.|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well not the best line the sure spade trick should have been set up|pg||

nt|timmy5: iam in the adjacent room so ill do that 4 u|pg||
nt|hantveit: Thank you! :)|pg||
nt|xenya: for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score battle here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|raghavan: may reach 5C|pg||
nt|hantveit: By the way, we have beautifull sunshine here in Oslo today, very nice...|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5 clubs is a beautifull contract, but how to reach it?|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5d is even a better saving|pg||
nt|snorris: if north opens|pg||
nt|hantveit: Must open 1 clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, EW have got 11 cards in @Ss... |pg||
nt|xenya: can they do better now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: They did *very* well last hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s by n/s cold as cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: weak 2 by W and 4 @S by S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Dom kommer kanske i 4@H här, men den går att beta|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers, so the hand is worth an opening bid, but the danger is that partner starts to dbl...|pg||
nt|raghavan: they have 44 fit in S |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n also|pg||
nt|april7: what doesX mean now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S i suppose, no ruffing values|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score board-but E can be end played for making 41S|pg||
nt|xenya: NS are in danger of getting too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2 over 1|pg||
nt|april7: hoping that W has a 2@H opener|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tjolpe:  Den gÃ¥r i vart fall inte att spela hem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H normalt svagare än en 2@H öppning, i alla fall som jag spelar|pg||
nt|hantveit: ouch|pg||
nt|timmy5: ouch ?|pg||
nt|snorris: d: take out|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl over 4 clubs is showing secondary support in major and cards, east might pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes ofc|pg||
pc|c2|nt|raghavan: Vul fear|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hantveit: if it shows major fit, then take out|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H has a play here, so 4@S looks like a good save|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|santyclz: Great sac.  The only problem is 4@h may not make.|pg||
nt|xenya: but 5@H is hopeless|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kamras: Deras är ca 4-8 hp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Inte N-S här |pg||
nt|timmy5: never pass|pg||
nt|xenya: as i see it that is|pg||
pc|d6|nt|werge: Hard work for North - he also bids his partners cards...|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d holding may persuade E to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks after this lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: if you x then pard bids freely over 1 nt  dont you bid again? maybe I am wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that EW is cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see a way, but that doesn't mean there isn't one.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes there is a way to make 5@H|pg||
nt|xenya: but it takes perfect reading |pg||
nt|enachou: no way i think|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|snorris: 4@hs: showing both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored minor cards make this difficult|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hantveit: never say never :) We have seen it all, and done it all, havent we?|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5clb if anyone bids it will get doubled|pg||
nt|snorris: and now...|pg||
nt|snorris: undisiplined 5@cs?|pg||
nt|enachou: 1@s 1@h and 1@s|pg||
nt|enachou: @c|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see one, but I've seen many hands where top players make things single-dummy that I can't see dbl-dmy.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm willing to bet even papi couldn't make 6@cs.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: so maybe let them play here,  true |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt notice the 4 S possibilities|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl on 4 clubs is explained as TO, I think I would bid 5 clubs there|pg||
nt|xenya: for one thing, you can take a double finesse in @Ds, secondly, you can through W in with 3rd trump |pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: but I would support to 3@H|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't like 3@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not the right player to play 3NT-@D lead |pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like mp bid|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to get @Cs right too of course|pg||
nt|april7: ace and then Q of @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: E made a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so...seems like E wasn't sure where he wanted to play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vassilis Virvidakis shows me the way to make 5@h.  Double finesse @ds and guess @cs.  Thanks.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hantveit: Finally, a good pickup for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|snorris: first good board for n-s |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: but his pass over 3N looks ill-judged -- unless he is not sure about 6 @Hs in the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand certainly doesn't merit a slam try opposite a minimum 4-6 hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @H |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  W painted a picture of exactly what he held... not much to misinterpret.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: 1100 - just a flat board ?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps this has a play after all|pg||
pc|cA|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hantveit: Open room now has reached board 8, the East Wests slam|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: I do not like the 3@S raise as S has nothing to cover outside losers,,,,, and is RED|pg||
nt|mariner1: vs WHITE|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see a way to make |pg||
nt|mariner1: has a play only if E makes a mistake|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|timmy5: yep|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now he has|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|pelu: in Open East bid 1@S (naturel bid) and 3@D from S - but later N - on her falt hand - bid 5@D|pg||
