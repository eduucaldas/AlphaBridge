nt|snorris: 3 nt in north looks healthy|pg||
nt|timmy5: hi Roland|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wc Taymour|pg||
nt|hantveit: 17+10, hearts not breaking, but J is onside. Can make 4H|pg||
nt|andyv:  whaterever the case, good result for N/S.|pg||
nt|frankaus: overcalls not what they used to be :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|werge: 620 both tables here - better wait and see...|pg||

nt|snorris: hi |pg||
nt|hantveit: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: please ignore all that rubbish about strong club i said|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score available here|pg||
nt|frankaus: openings not what they used to be either will N open ?|pg||
nt|enachou: i think N think opening 2 or 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w combined 25 but the duplication adn unkind layout looks like any game bid is doomed|pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone gets too aggressive here is in the soup|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score hand more of Gulash type-can be swing board|pg||
mb|2H|nt|arvidsson: 1 bricka som kan skapa lite imp NS har en bra zon offring i 5kl mot 4hj|pg||
nt|werge: A grown-up NT!|pg||
nt|hussein2: Prof likes 1nt?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could be pushed too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  Anders, vet jag inte, kanske 10-11|pg||
nt|xenya: of course 1@C was natural|pg||
nt|frankaus: if N opens will E X for T/O and will W leave it in? |pg||
nt|enachou: 2@h there is bicolor @h and minor 54+ weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s being the obvious candidate|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: N more likely i think -- but we shall see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it might not be so bad for EW, North might lead his partner's suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: N will push|pg||
nt|enachou: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Tommmys 12:e, Morats 11:e Bjerregårds 6:e Axdorphs 3:e och Berik o Östbergs 2:a  ... tack Carina Westlin|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Man or mouse?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: och i 4 hj måste man spela spadern på rätt sätt|pg||
nt|pelu: N dont like her hand, but she is forced to bid 1@S|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2@S now|pg||
nt|raghavan: will bid 4 H|pg||
nt|andyv:  very borderline 4th seat opener|pg||
nt|xenya: to say the least|pg||
nt|frankaus: now on the way to 3@C then ?|pg||
nt|xenya: naturally S tries to find N's other suit|pg||
nt|enachou: 2@s is asking for the 2e color|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@D P,P, P ???|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S!|pg||
nt|xenya: i expect to see something like 4N from N at some point|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@S by W and 2NT by N would it not show both minors|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W might push himself too high|pg||
nt|abdoucha: 5 @c|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tjolpe:  Man|pg||
nt|andyv:  must have been lead directing:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and goes down |pg||
nt|pelu: dont even think of bidding now Catherine :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D opener on the S hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: then I have a rebid (2 @C) |pg||
nt|minnie lee: S won't hold 3NT with his @d position|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am not a fan of this treatment|pg||
mb|4H|nt|arvidsson: kanske eframsson bjuder 5 hj?|pg||
nt|timmy5: doesnt need heart split actually to win 4h|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's is ok for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but my pard may still bid 2 @S with 6 of them |pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt I say "wait and see"|pg||
nt|sybarra: W knows where the high cards are |pg||
nt|andyv:  -200 or -300 very possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: can N pass now?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: mind you if south leads singleton diamond (a poor choice with qjx trumps) it could let the game thru|pg||
nt|april7: its close to a mirror hand and if EW reach 4 @S E can't make it .Depends on @D play whether 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT must have been a 3 card @S raise it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: S had a DBL to me|pg||
nt|xenya: both 4@H and pass by S are somewhat mysterious |pg||
nt|yo_yo: if only to shut north up|pg||
nt|enachou: nice lead from Kchaou|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but NS have not been on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|daman: whatever happened to drury?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont see point as i said|pg||
nt|april7: better than @D singleton, no spare trump|pg||
nt|xenya: ah there comes 4N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to save worst result S should have DBL..ED.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: playing WJS (weak 2@S/2@H) over 1@C N would bid 2@S |pg||
nt|lestergold: only when you find pard with two quick entries and get two ruffs would this work|pg||
nt|xenya: they have no red cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: en straf om han gissar spadern, och det gör han. 6 IMP till Everfresh|pg||
nt|minnie lee: well, I'm wrong|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not pass 3nt with souths hand. |pg||
nt|frankaus: i guess N happy for 50's even quite a few of them|pg||
nt|enachou: but i think Noshy have not problem to make his contrat|pg||
pc|c8|nt|timmy5: why not|pg||
nt|hantveit: If heart is not breaking you are gone, you have more tricks in 4H|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 tricks in NT, 5 tricks in H|pg||
nt|timmy5: his partner told him i have a good holding in diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: also i'm puzzled by W's 1N (instead of 1@S)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: hardly N has found the best lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: oh W has got one|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the phantom save|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|arvidsson: efter att fått in kl A på E är gissning ganska enkel|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get messy |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|minnie lee: I wouldn't either, but that's what makes bridge: you've got to trust youor partner|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe, but the fact remains that one of them has forgotten the system|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tjolpe:  Vid ett borde till spelades 5 klÃ¶ver, som gick hem efter spadersex ut!|pg||
nt|arvidsson: då 3hj är av spärrande karaktär|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/r3f2gp  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  sÃ¥ det var rÃ¤tt att inge dubbla dÃ¤r|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, but your partner cannot se you have 6 nearly running hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Eftersom det var Hans-Ove, var det dÃ¥ligt fÃ¶r NS hÃ¤r|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ska man ta ruter A?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ifall nu E har singel ruter|pg||
nt|bjurn: hade han då inte spelat ut den?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: med kl A som ingång, troligt|pg||
nt|sybarra: cash k of @H,  @D next  etc |pg||
nt|timmy5: u never know if pd holds jack of hearts|pg||
nt|hantveit: no, you do not know :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think 1N showed spades|pg||
nt|frankaus:  2 yealded 8 imps when tunisia did not overcall 1@S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tjolpe:  Givetvis, men det Ã¤r fjÃ¤rde dagen|pg||
nt|lestergold: now declarer should puick up the dims|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: may be more of a preempt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lead a small @D make 4@H tricks and 2 @Ds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: oh oh,  defense didnt find all of their tricks I think |pg||
nt|snorris: north ha sto be careful|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  spade shift by S would have been quick curtains|pg||
nt|frankaus: in not certain they forgot - many would pass 2@S to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|xenya: S meant 2@S as pass or correct: N has to pass with @Ss and bid his suit otherwise |pg||
nt|xenya: the word "save" doesn't even seem to apply here, Rob |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|abdoucha: http://pagesperso-orange.fr/bridge-reunion/egypt2009.htm|pg||
pc|dK|nt|timmy5: very dangerous contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: error|pg||
nt|enachou: very good defense there|pg||
pc|d9|nt|frankaus: always run if Xed|pg||
nt|lestergold: now cant make|pg||
nt|april7: the lead makes the contract makable because of double finesse in @D, what by itself E couldn't find it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|werge: Wests hand seems perfect for 1 NT AFTER javing doubled 1 @C!|pg||
nt|werge: having|pg||
nt|xenya: why should N be so anxious about EW making game?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nu behövs ingen spader giss längre|pg||
nt|hantveit: Has winning chances, but need to guess hearts og clubs right. Mabye he can get an endplay in spades|pg||
nt|snorris: think his best chanse is cash @cs  and @hs and endplay east so he gets @s up to aq|pg||
nt|raghavan: PlayH and play 4th H - he gets 2 S|pg||
nt|minnie lee: or he could be very bold and play @h to the 10|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: oh dear if north didnt cover she was off|pg||
pc|h4|nt|werge: Claim|pg||
nt|lestergold: couldnt gwet back to dummy to repeat the finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hantveit: When east is showing out in clubs, the chance for finessing the hearts is increasing|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like 1N may have been alerted at table|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|arvidsson: utan stöld reser bara klövern|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|werge: Not many flat boards up to now|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5 clubs on his right shows hearts with East|pg||
nt|hantveit: to topplay the hearts is with the odds, 52,4% as you have 7 cards and are missing a critical card|pg||
nt|snorris: should see it now.. or who has @d eight?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pc|hQ|nt|timmy5: now he went down|pg||

nt|andyv:  N cashed out too quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh she does with 9s its true|pg||
nt|april7: 9 of @S is in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: still why play second heart|pg||
nt|xenya: S MUST double even if only to stop partner from bbidding on|pg||
nt|mariner1: BTW if S wanted to compete over 4@S instead of DBL he could bid 4N for|pg||
nt|mariner1: takeout, so a DBL to me would be 100% penalty|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: may hear a larger @D bid from W however |pg||

nt|april7: 2@S 3@C 3 or even 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D looks OK if available|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: PASS|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S here showing forcing @D fit,,,,,,|pg||
mb|2S|nt|arvidsson: man kommer troligen inte få koll på vilka resurser partnen har ändå?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Det är väl praktiskt, man vill ju dit hur som helst|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H and we may play it there |pg||
nt|hantveit: 3d now...|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a non makeable 3 or more clubs for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|prof 1: i think this shud be conventional|pg||
nt|andyv:  better than 8x|pg||
nt|xenya: but what can W bid?|pg||
nt|enachou: good decision from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: partnen har väll 7 hp om nu fi har 10 var|pg||
nt|pelu: I see NS playing 1NT forcing for 1 round - a syem I hate :) (and love to play against):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this seems a kicked up version,  like a transfer now? |pg||
nt|timmy5: ihad a feeling 3nt was coming|pg||
nt|hantveit: he went for the practical bid, not the rush with a good partner. You bid 3di and partner bids 3spades with no spade stopper.|pg||
nt|minnie lee: when you have a bi-colour hand, bid it! I think N should have bid 2@d|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes 2D|pg||
nt|raghavan: even now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C shows a feature and is encouraging|pg||
nt|enachou: a switch for tunisia now they are playing 4@h on board2 on the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: south thinks there are no @ds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjurn: tror ni att FI kommer offra sig mot 4@H? Vad är ni rädda för?|pg||
nt|pelu: but N is not sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would bid 2 @H but not sure what 2 @D is |pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S sh show extra values and fit for @H???|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue |pg||
nt|sybarra: jx doesnt look like a fit |pg||
nt|raghavan: 4D|pg||
nt|april7: @C @C and @D return, 1 off|pg||
nt|april7: only though if W gives E the @D ruff|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hantveit: I like 2 clubs first, then 3diamonds later, showing 5 clubs and 4 diamonds. No need to rush the bidding with a strong hand where you can bid NT at any time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh|pg||
nt|timmy5: it really feels bad to play 3nt -1 when u have a slam that makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W was stuck... probably should have bid 1@s and hope pd had five|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w need totake their 5 tricks quickly or they wont get em|pg||
nt|april7: sorry, N is declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Detta|pg||
nt|werge: East has a clear-cut PASS to 2 @D - as I see it!|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree hans |pg||
nt|sybarra: pass and hope for the best |pg||
nt|werge: Would we bid 1 @H instead of 2 @C?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 4nt var nog ett alltför optimistiskt bud|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C  1-4|pg||
nt|kamras: Känns tveksamt att gå vidare när man redan visat sin renons|pg||
nt|minnie lee: not even good bips in @s for that kind of bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well bid by West|pg||
nt|mariner1: E should note that W did not NEG DBL 1@S so he can't have long @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Est|pg||
nt|yo_yo: east even|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E did indeed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjurn: Det är ju Syd själv som bjuder tokigt. Om partnern går ner efter 4@C ska man inte till slam|pg||
nt|arvidsson: en förhandspassaf N bjuder nog kontroll med rätt honnörer|pg||
nt|frankaus: just 2 aces to lose here|pg||
nt|mariner1: play should be quick|pg||
nt|abdoucha: lakhdhar very agressive with 4@h|pg||
pc|s7|nt|arvidsson: efter kl ut är det en enkel match|pg||
nt|hantveit: Vest has to be awake and put up his club K if south plays low clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@H and a@C for NS|pg||
pc|sK|nt|werge: It´s more flexible|pg||
nt|sybarra: true it is |pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|s5|nt|bjurn: även med @SA @DA ist.f. kungarna är det tveksamt att gå vidare mot slam|pg||
nt|enachou: yes he is a very agressive player|pg||
pc|s3|nt|arvidsson: framförallt då det är morath som dubblar, kan man räkna in AQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: however....you do have 6  @C|pg||
nt|raghavan: D J|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|snorris: better to play king of @d|pg||
nt|hantveit: good, club t in return...|pg||
nt|april7: should play small @C on ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: now this is a suit pref situation- surely east should confirm she want a dim continuation|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever they play st or udca or whatever it should be clear|pg||
nt|april7: to late to beat it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 clubs looked like an encouraging card to me|pg||
nt|daman: can't be done|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: but in argument FOR 1 ht,   is how raggy the suits are|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, but partner can describe the hand better this way |pg||
nt|snorris: takes a singel queen|pg||
nt|hantveit: nice|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: http://www.egypt-bridge.org/Zone%2009.asp|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand for E/W not to get a minus score.|pg||

nt|lestergold: and that has to be a bad error|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|werge: Anyway - should be one down for 100|pg||

nt|snorris: 6@cs in north a possibility|pg||
nt|snorris: here|pg||
nt|xenya: -3?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S X would be quite expesive|pg||
nt|xenya: something starnge has happened in the play here -- why didn't N pitch the @S loser?|pg||
nt|april7: now we have a grand!|pg||
nt|daman: the grand salami|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will do well to bid it with confidence we can count 13 top tricks but they have to count them in the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have excellent save in 7h if they are allowed to play there|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S  3 or 4@D or only 2 and if NS finds their good fit in @C and the void in @H the grand is bidable|pg||
nt|lestergold: or 7d for that matter|pg||
nt|april7: 7@D might push NS to 7@S!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has all the potential for a brief but exciting auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has a difficult decision as to what to open|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 4s|pg||
nt|april7: without oponents bidding its easy:1@S 2@C 4@H and so on|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Avram but at this vulnerability east would be  in even over a 4s openere|pg||
nt|daman: this is a baby grand   not getting there would be cause to revamp your bidding system|pg||
nt|lestergold: a baby gfrand George with no interference yes|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S X is also possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the baby might grow into a stroppy teenager|pg||
nt|daman: with warts|pg||
nt|xenya: very well done by EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S here EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west didnt bid his full value imo|pg||
mb|1C|nt|raghavan: He will open 1D|pg||
nt|hantveit: they did bid 1spade on board 2 in the open, gaining 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: teoretiskt, ja|pg||
nt|werge: That was what West ought to have played...|pg||
nt|werge: Here 140 is a cood score for E/W|pg||
nt|raghavan: so may be in D contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: 2d for majors|pg||
nt|snorris: 6@ds also ok|pg||
nt|hantveit: if 2 shows both major, I think I would prefer 4 spades here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d not enuf!!|pg||
nt|daman: will get there now   3@C by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 5d?|pg||
nt|daman: then 5NT|pg||
nt|daman: to make sure|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hantveit: But can be a bit hard to give up the 3nt so early|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: Scania behöver 21 IMP på 8 brickor samtidigt som antingen Everfresh eller Hans-Ove behöver tappa 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.egypt-bridge.org/Zone%2009.asp|pg||
nt|minnie lee: 6@d to play|pg||
nt|raghavan: will be pushed to 6D|pg||
nt|timmy5: i think yes|pg||
nt|xenya: things haven't been going too well for Egypt so far|pg||
nt|andyv:  played N for Jxx of hearts|pg||
nt|april7: 5NT now by N:Josephine|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u mean north'sname is Josephine or Josephine grand slam force|pg||
nt|april7: then 7@C and 7@D and then 7@S:):)|pg||
nt|daman: sfar's first name is Napoleon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Egypt playing extremely well and getting some help also|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5@d looks like a possible sac against 4@h, since there is no entry to South, which would be needed for 4 down.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: nexi 12 IMP for Egypt from the 4@H misplayed - 3NT making in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: You are welcome to play with me - but please know, that I do NOT bid 2 @D...|pg||
nt|sybarra: website but they are not posting results that I can find |pg||
nt|hantveit: I prefer to give as much information I can to my partner, look how difficult it is now for North. |pg||
nt|hantveit: 4 hearts would make things very easy for North.|pg||
nt|timmy5: but 6sp is not bad at all|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 5spades now, and they might still find 6D|pg||
nt|minnie lee: 6@c would help alot|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, 6spades do not look too bad. -3 is it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have th eright idea but not taking up enough space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S from Nabil?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1NT by S the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 for me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely not, vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: take a look at the venue! |pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S was weak|pg||
nt|mariner1: E can't hold what I need for slam and I want to be in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 2 sp eller x?|pg||
nt|raghavan: How to enter Yousry hand in 5S|pg||
nt|hantveit: there is the pass...|pg||
nt|hantveit: With single heart, spade ace, and club ace and king there should be possible for north to bid 6d now|pg||
nt|minnie lee: last hand a pass on 3NT and now no help to play a grzat contract...either in @c or @d|pg||
nt|raghavan: Vul is a fear|pg||
nt|snorris: a  better bid in north was 5@cs instead of 5 @ds|pg||
nt|minnie lee: the best bid was 2@h|pg||
nt|snorris: then south would bid 6 |pg||
nt|timmy5: this delay might prevent east west from bidding 6spds|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would not reveal my hand  by bidding C|pg||
nt|timmy5: if N-S bid 6ds|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, only 6 losers and a good 5 card suit, so 5 clubs is a good bid. But the negative is a little bit weak trumph|pg||
nt|xenya: excellen slam here -- think they'll get there|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H slam here|pg||
nt|daman: has to bid 7 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north lost the plot in this auction|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT is so simple|pg||
nt|daman: my mother would bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east west may get awy with a save in 7h doubled if tghey do they will make a massive profit|pg||
nt|april7: whay 3 @S? if the @C are rigid then 13 tricks in @C so 5NT was best forN|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N is brave|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice call by W here|pg||
nt|xenya: also purposeless i think|pg||
nt|xenya: i meant brave and purposeless|pg||
nt|yo_yo: samjee will probably bid now, after what we saw previously|pg||

pc|c7|nt|kamras: Eftyer att ha förnekat 3-korts är väl Ax ok att bjuda 2Sp på|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 6@Cs but at @C-lead will make life hard for decl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in case of some values with this is a ploy for a scrafice against 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: all you achieve is show declarer your distribution, because you can't seriously hope to win the auction here |pg||
nt|enachou: 2@d there is forcing game with @d|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|werge: 3 trump-loosers and - at least - 1 @D|pg||
nt|raghavan: take a + score|pg||
nt|hantveit: This will most likely be a gain for East West|pg||
nt|snorris: a good board for e-w again|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hope|pg||

nt|xenya: S's hand is too powerful to stop short of 6@H|pg||
nt|xenya: not at these colours|pg||

nt|daman: comedy of errors|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they did oh my i preictedf an exciting auction but i could not have dreamt this one up for a hefty pay packet|pg||
nt|daman: EW will have a hard time explaining this to their team|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear the excellent save pushed them to the grand they couldnt find by normal bidding|pg||
nt|april7: S can't imagine a void in @H with N and only  15 HP,so must bid 7!!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: After 4 boards, 31 IMP´s at stake|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S was a real reach imo  |pg||
nt|hussein2: One important fact here; this zonals is being played in Sharm El-Sheikh wich is extremly hot at the moment -- keeping in mind the wethear, I am sure ladies will tend to swing ...|pg||
nt|hussein2: seeking some cool air :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and a nice sequence|pg||
nt|rnmalik: reasonable contract and should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the trouble with bidding 4@H, partner gets carried away|pg||

pc|s7|nt|sybarra: are we headed to 6 @C or 5 @C?|pg||

nt|pelu: 5@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: he needs AQ @S A@C and K@D  from a passed hand... A@H would not help|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kamras: Visst Björn, men kanske inte Hx. 2NT kanske överdriver rutern. Svår avvägning mellan dessa tre bud|pg||
nt|sybarra: the sequence of pulling to 4 @C should make @C slam easy to bid  |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|pelu: to make 6@C u need to set up the @S-suit or ruff 3 red cards in dummy|pg||

nt|hantveit: Thank you Timmy|pg||
nt|snorris: more 6@ds|pg||
nt|april7: E shouldn't bid 7@H and might escape with a @S contract only|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S contract|pg||
nt|april7: we ll never know|pg||
nt|lestergold: its hard for east to know they can make 7 i sympathise but i think east should have done a bit more jumping in the bidding|pg||
nt|baldjean: Nice 6@h here. Ultrastrong West hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 3hj verkar obetbart|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 4 hj har väldigt goda chanser|pg||
nt|bjurn: liksom 3@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes|pg||
nt|timmy5: west is Ahmed Youssry and East is sherief Noshy both played in several juniors world championships|pg||
nt|minnie lee: an example of bad communication here...afetr 2@d I would bid 2@h in S or alternatively after 4@s, I would bid 5@c in N|pg||
nt|xenya: another slam hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make4 @H I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D?|pg||
nt|bjurn: kort @D med öppningsstyrka kanske|pg||
nt|arvidsson: öppningshand med 0-1 ruter|pg||
nt|bjurn: trefärgshand|pg||
nt|werge: Nort should raise to 4 @H - now and then the opponents want to play 4 @S...|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 4 they made the 3 @D in the other room |pg||
nt|rnmalik: no CA+HK+AS|pg||
nt|xenya: easy -- 2@H  -- pass -- 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I raise to 2@H with W here|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Eddy Munteanu|pg||
mb|2C!|an|GF|nt|frankaus: @C is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it if they were not prepared to bid 7  in the first place what made them so confident to bid it given a second chance what was the new info?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D  p 1@H-p- 1@S -1NT |pg||

nt|sybarra: @S suit may come into play now|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1s is ugly and dangerous|pg||
nt|daman: the 7@H bid on the last only cost EW 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: or 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 5@C good save here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamras: Vid andra bordet Återbjöd Nord 2Sp i stället för 2Hj, som han kanske inte tyckte han hade kort till. Men då tycker jag man hellre passar på 2Ru|pg||
nt|baldjean: This 6@h should be reached.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: seems easy after 2@c now|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|pelu: the problem for West is that they play 2@D as GF opening - and then it is almost impossible to show a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|timmy5: very intresting hands N-S are having|pg||
nt|xenya: N taking a save|pg||

nt|sybarra: unfortunately I have to leave,  so sorry to miss the end of this  |pg||
nt|snorris: dont think they will find their @d fit|pg||
nt|raghavan: why not open 1D and bid 2c,...3c|pg||
nt|xenya: but it may be a go-on double|pg||
mb|p|nt|abdoucha: very difficult hand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hantveit: Samjee led a spade vs 3nt on board 3 = 10 tricks. |pg||
nt|timmy5: the bidding was a bit different|pg||
nt|snorris: 4nt looks like a quantum bid|pg||
nt|timmy5: can't be|pg||
nt|snorris: but south answers his aces|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ace asking - I thinl|pg||
nt|timmy5: seems Like rkcb|pg||
nt|hantveit: this is the second time Zindel is not showing is second minor suit - it will probably be his second loss...|pg||
nt|raghavan: trump is not agreed|pg||
nt|hantveit: Anyone opens 1dia here, and rebid 2 clubs 3 clubs?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Oh, misclick|pg||
nt|baldjean: I must confess I don't like 2@d waiting. I call it 2@d wasting. It is the opener who needs information, not the responder.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|snorris: I would|pg||
nt|timmy5: 2d would have been a reverse|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would|pg||
nt|hantveit: me too :)|pg||

nt|timmy5: so lots of pairs jump to level 3 showing frekish 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: i wouldn't:)|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, this is a situation you need to discuss with your regular partner|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes definetly|pg||

nt|tsadek: it is better to Cue bid|pg||
nt|edmunte1: agree with Tarek here, but it could work 2 out of 3, especially when lacking methods|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: decl problem is to find an entry to dummy to play @C up to the king - S can duck 2 times in @D|pg||
nt|hussein2: We have an avarage of 6 imps/board|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: He will make 4@S, but he won't be happy|pg||

nt|snorris: 4nt looked more like quantum..no @c support..no good @hs..|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  ja, han har det fÃ¶r en bet|pg||
nt|kamras: När Nord kunde dubbla 3Sp trots att Syd bara klivit kan väl 4Kl aldrig gå hem ur Syds synvinkel|pg||
nt|timmy5: 2spds would have been better in my opinion|pg||
nt|hantveit: club to ace, club to ruff, last trumph, and home because east is out of clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Didn't occur to me.  It has the advantage of being right.  This time...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough hand to bid.|pg||
nt|xenya: EW stopped in 3@C in OR -- no doubt as a result of some misunderstanding|pg||
nt|lestergold: and have fair chances to make with the favoutrable dim position |pg||
nt|hantveit: 3nt and 4H are makeable.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|timmy5: sometimes with this holding i prefer not to be in 4spds:)|pg||
nt|xenya: E took a practical approach by bidding 4@S directly|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1nt shows 4+, so Soliman should decide between 1nt and 2@s|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1@s i meant|pg||
pc|d3|nt|arvidsson: han inte med EW kort men korrekt Björn|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  just det!|pg||
nt|xenya: opposite a passed partner|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks off 1 here, however 4@D makes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjurn: om @Hn sitter trevligt hade det nog kunnat ordna sig även med @Cn 5-0|pg||
nt|tsadek: South 1@S 4+ , North choose to bid 2@S with 3 card , instead of the normal 1NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|arvidsson: tur att man spelar med RKC, annars är det lätt att komma i denna slamm|pg||
nt|mariner1: or at least 3@D would|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but good sign off in 3@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: you need a club finesse in both. In 4H you also need the diamonds to break 3-2|pg||
nt|hantveit: or stiff T|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|edmunte1: still, a maker|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: E probably thinking S has q of @H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hantveit: Spades 2-2 * dia K onside = 20%|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: hts will help declarer a trump by east better|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|april7: this helps .why not trump?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|raghavan: should not try finesse S 10|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: defence not too inspired hee|pg||
nt|hantveit: Must play the club q and di Ace and new diamonds. 4H needs to be played carefully as trumphs are not breaking.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: It looks as if they had a toy and w decided not to play a major.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: maybe -- in their system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: must cash that dim first|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|baldjean: I actually like the step ladder points system after 2@c opening, but with a twist. After responder has shown the points a waiting bid by opener is ace question (provided responder ...|pg||
nt|baldjean: can have aces with his points). Another waiting bid is king question then. Suit can be found later :).|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  A@s a bit risky...better low @s to hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hantveit: can go down now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: yes, always a bad sign|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh dear discard the dim west!!|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|daman: feeble|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hantveit: + single spade ace and jack by West and single spade J by east = 19%|pg||

mb|1D|nt|pelu: u remember the posible 61C hand - only cost 5IMPs - Egypt stopped in 3@S (140)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|timmy5: now some intresting hands for EW|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes will reach 6S|pg||
nt|snorris: should be bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: Board 4 nor reached the diamond contract...|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true but has to be bid|pg||
nt|xenya: but yes, it was not an easy hand to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: Championship Bermuda , Venice & Seniors Qualifications|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|andyv:  this should get them there|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D has a play, though can be beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: har man till 2hj på E|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know the convention, but can't imagine how 3@cs could be anything but an escape.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@Cs would be better contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 @D tougher played in S,,, in N  a @H lead would give it a chance|pg||
mb|2N|nt|werge: Now it´s 36 degrees...|pg||
nt|raghavan: with this jump sure slam bid|pg||
nt|timmy5: brd no 5 went ideal in open room|pg||
nt|snorris: now nothing can hold east back..after 3@ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  polish 2S bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5-5...2N asks other suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: asking for feature?|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 2@S is a bit too heavy here, if it denies normal opening values|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like a polish weak 2...2 spades shows 5 spades and 5 of other suit...5-10hcp or so|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow S didn't pass, so all will be well for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  judging by length N is taking to bid, i'm guessing this may not be polish:)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: slam possible here|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably a normal 3nt will be the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: What would 3 NY from East have shown???|pg||
nt|werge: NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: difficult to see dec ninth trick.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: full power!|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pushy but a good bid - only 6 losers and good trumph|pg||
nt|raghavan: RKC 2 without Trump Q|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D on 5 brought Morocco 9 imps when NS in OR reached 3N, going 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: 3NT går nog bet med @S ut (Öst har inte nog med ingångar för två @Cmaskar)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: har N tillräckligt med ingångar att få spadersticken?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get too high here |pg||
nt|enachou: i think 3@c is not forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead beats it|pg||
nt|xenya: S must have been thinking how to steer th eauction into a minor-suit game -- he took a simple road|pg||
nt|xenya: seems dubious to me though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he does have a @D play IF he plays K@D from hand 1st, which is counter|pg||
nt|mariner1: intuitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: man duckar andra spadern?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there are many variations after weak 2 and 2NT-some partnerships play singleton-some honour in a side suit etc|pg||
nt|enachou: that show 6@c 16 17pts|pg||
nt|santyclz: It was one which required "Least Lie" bidding.  I guess mixing a @c up in your @ss is probably the best thing you can do.|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have done well to bid 4s which i think is infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: needs careful management tho|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H is a very good save against the 4@S contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h excellent save and should find it really|pg||
nt|lestergold: east'shand enormous in offence useless in defence|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: too bad the @S fall as they do |pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might, East has shown both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
nt|mariner1: he also has the failing @c hook|pg||
nt|yo_yo: restricted choice when East plays J@D?|pg||
nt|hantveit: more spade can actually help dec here, to set up the spade suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|sybarra: good stop |pg||
nt|pelu: now N has to pull the breakes - she has done her duty (or more) by bidding 4@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are they playing a forcing @c?|pg||
nt|hantveit: more club from east at any time will give south the 9th trick. |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: can we scream LOW?|pg||
nt|andyv:  again, i don't think this is a normal weak 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear overboard|pg||
nt|mariner1: good play :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: try:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I knew he would do that :) )|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjurn: nej, men ÖV måste ge sig på @Dn och odlar upp försvarets bet|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|hantveit: East West seems much more solid and confident.  What do you think guys?|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N followed by 3S was invitational...N was certainly at top of his range|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eoff on tis obvious lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: oh dear|pg||
nt|mariner1: commentator's curse,,,,,, :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: ÖV kommer inte in här|pg||

nt|werge: BRIDGE, they call it|pg||

nt|edmunte1: she , will be very quiet i presume|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1@s final contract|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|enachou: yes they play forcing@c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjurn: nu bjuder Öst och kommenterar "jag har inte kommit för att passa"? :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  3NT av VÃ¤st gÃ¥r vÃ¤l inte att beta|pg||
nt|pelu: I would have bid 3@D in S - they play 4 card @D opening - 2@D= 11+|pg||
nt|snorris: not the best contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: but almost normal|pg||
nt|hantveit: It is terrible to feel you are doing everything wrong, easy things are suddenly hard. I had the same feeling last sunday, for those of you who watched...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Finessing D 10 is need to make 3NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @hs had chanses|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahh, that explains some things.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if he's getting the ruff he needs to beat this.|pg||
nt|hantveit: 4D is a dangerous bid unless they have strong agreements. Might go pass round, but here East will correct regardless to 4sp.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: well hard to make this as cards lie|pg||
nt|edmunte1: not an easy task for Trabelsi|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: bid your hand first time - this could cost a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @D also,  maybe I can keep them out of the bidding |pg||
nt|xenya: should be a quick 1 off on this lead|pg||
nt|april7: this contract is goind as also 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: hjowever defence has to find the spade switch after the forced dim duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho what else can east play she cannot play passive with that club suit sitting in front of her eyes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS will get a plus at last|pg||
nt|mariner1: this looks flat though|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Det tog lite längre tid att komma till samma kontrakt som i slutna rummet. Larsson gör allting snabbt|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: and then pd can decide if we have to go on to 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|hantveit: I do not see how West could bid 6 spades? Kxx in hearts are not good, nor is his void in partners suit.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: kill point now|pg||
nt|hantveit: Maybe they have agreed sound overcalls on 2 levels, as most of us have in teams. Especially in red vs white.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|hantveit: better to duck the diamond q, but difficult|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|werge: Not EVEN in this hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: What a lead - Good start for East West! Heart K will be his 12th trick.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: making 5|pg||
nt|hantveit: Dec now has 6 spade tricks, one heart trick, one club trick, 3 diamond tricks and a ruff in hearts for 12|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Mens den spiller færdig, er det tid til at sige nogle afsluttende ord. Det bliver så på dansk ....|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north decided not to duck so it will go off easily|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|werge: What can East possibly have been thinking after partners bid - at 3-level and in a suit, where you have K D B 4 - the answer is not very polite...|pg||
nt|werge: And 3 NT is no winner, 8 tricks are not enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @D he makes 5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: @C to A and 3! @C-ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c seems pretty unilateral here...i guess the pass cards were missing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|timmy5: defenders can make things harder if S doesnt cover the first diamond declarer will have to guess|pg||
nt|raghavan: if D is ducked - will take 4 clubs - down 1|pg||

nt|bjurn: (och nu känns vi förbrukade)|pg||
nt|snorris: then west has toguess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think north should duck because she has the contract made if the clubs come in and if they dont east has to find the spade switch|pg||
nt|hantveit: To start with an ace vs a slam from AJ will very often give you a bad result + your partner will be frustrated.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|werge: CLAIM|pg||
nt|raghavan: done|pg||

nt|santyclz: Did s not have a natural 2@d available or did he choose not to make one?  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s should make because the hearts will show up 5/2 on discovery play trhus making it more likely that south has the club length|pg||
nt|april7: but E took the bid away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it used to be banned in fact|pg||
nt|mariner1: that's because of 4 card majors?|pg||
nt|mariner1: why was it banned?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lots used to use it as a psyche|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: f.n. har Hans-Ove 151 och Everfresh 150 med två brickor kvar att scorea|pg||
nt|raghavan: 26 between them - land in 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: weak 3rd in hand opener, then pass 2@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|werge: 1 down|pg||
nt|hantveit: jump to 3nt = minimum hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|tjolpe:  d v s bÃ¥da lagen har tvÃ¥ givar kvar|pg||
nt|sybarra: safely in 2 @H  |pg||
nt|pelu: is it tiome now to bid 3@D? - easy for me - I can see the S-hand :)|pg||
nt|werge: If West covers the secend @C from hand, she will get a @D-ruff instead...|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT must be a form of Bergen|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card limit raise|pg||
nt|april7: as before|pg||
nt|lestergold: or it may be a raise to 3s or better|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes agreed, pysche'ing it should be discourages|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's allowed again now though|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: Do we know what 3 clubs is?|pg||
nt|snorris: natural it seems|pg||
nt|timmy5: fit|pg||
nt|april7: hand  3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have the ultimate discovery play at trcik 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W pulled 2 rounds of trump and then ruffed @d in dummy... was stranded with 2 heart losers|pg||
nt|daman: making 4|pg||
nt|hantveit: West has self confidence after the last hand and jumps to 4 spades. I guess they cannot have single spade H in their system...|pg||
nt|edmunte1: how can be set?|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: 4 clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and it was very well executed as well|pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: what is 2C|pg||
nt|snorris: 4. suit|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||
nt|raghavan: then he says he has clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: the latter i think|pg||
nt|daman: next hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope they dont land in @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is the suit 2@D supported|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H is a worry|pg||
nt|edmunte1: after rufiing @c with @s10 play @Sa+@s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjurn: 1@C är dubbeltydigt (11-13 NT eller 17+); 1@H är naturligt, 8+|pg||
nt|timmy5: not necessary|pg||
nt|baldjean: If North leads a trump?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  jag undrar vafÃ¶r inte Anders bjÃ¶d 3NT pÃ¥ 1NT och visade sin 17-19 hand med 5ko spader?|pg||
nt|bjurn: 1@S visar @S med starka handen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: han ansåg nog att sina 19 kunde vara för bra mot händer som passar på 3nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 tricks likly..maybe 12 ?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: though again W should realize that it is unlikely a passed hand has what he|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a difference in bidding close slams and looking for magic fits|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the alert says 4 card support, am I seeing things?|pg||
nt|xenya: very true, Rob|pg||
pc|d2|nt|timmy5: but East has a description he can make so why not|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: look at the movie,7 @S contracts!!|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 spade losers, 2 heart losers in addition the the club loser. -2 and a possible loss of 310 if 2spade is reached at the other table|pg||
pc|dK|nt|timmy5: 11 only|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 tricks, but some communication issues|pg||
nt|hantveit: with dia 2-2 there are no dangers, but dec dos not know that|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@S K@H A@D can he have more? and with those slam is???|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose unlucky that each has 2@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|arvidsson: och ville göra en mild invit  till högre höjder|pg||
nt|kamras: 1@S kan fortfarande vara svaga handen|pg||
nt|mariner1: and those cards are at best.......|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has 6 looser hand a passed hand can only provide 3 covering cards-sorry but bad bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: another warning is the 3@S call, W should realize that he might have 1 or more|pg||
nt|mariner1: losers in @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: it also says E does not hold long @D or @c|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: and taps now |pg||
nt|edmunte1: East is declarer|pg||
nt|baldjean: But now it makes.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: this gets messy |pg||
nt|timmy5: but when he playes he will know|pg||
nt|hantveit: now it is over :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Definately an iffy one.  Standard in the jr's and midnight swiss.|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a great believer in leading singletons against suit contracts but i think here that north had  quite a lot of stroength to hope to fins south with a fast  entry to get a club ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: correcting=-1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: oh i don't know Rob -- in my view 3@S is just a cuebid |pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: not ideal defence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tjolpe:  parntern har max 12 pinnar, men kanske han kan ha en intressantare fÃ¶rdelning, typ x Exxx K10xxx Exx?|pg||
nt|daman: in this match, every time a singleton was led the opps profited|pg||
nt|hantveit: Sorry for that, did miss trick 1.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|april7: @DK a much better lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: no 3@S is fit showing|pg||
pc|hT|nt|werge: Now West is endplayed...|pg||
nt|xenya: showing an honour|pg||
nt|mariner1: only fit|pg||
nt|xenya: but they have agreed @Hs already|pg||

nt|prof 1: good action in this board|pg||
nt|april7: South Africa is trailing because  of the grand slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: so door open here but Egypt has a big lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: 4 spades is a hard bid, but with only 7 losers it is acceptable if East never has a single honor in spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Välkommen till Jan Kamras|pg||
nt|vugraph814: Det är dock ingen i detta rum som gör :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  MÃ¶jligen junioren Berik sjÃ¤lv|pg||
nt|werge: A nice 5 @D here, difficult to bid|pg||
nt|snorris: 4@ss e-w|pg||
nt|hantveit: club ace and new club would be the best defence - with open cards :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
nt|hantveit: the open room have reached the slam hand now, will they be able to find the slam also?|pg||
mb|p|nt|prof 1: 1@s - x - 2@s|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, 4sp is a fine contract|pg||
nt|minnie lee: I am a sceptic so when I see 2@c bid, I would lead A@c to see the dummy and when the Q falls small @c because I have 1-2 potential tricks to get back with the @c again|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C -- both majors?|pg||
nt|april7: it wasn't the best bidding sequence|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 2 or 3 @H here|pg||
nt|edmunte1: an easy 3nt here for Egypt|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Tunisia , sry :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|werge: Trup-lead seems to kill 5 @D, otherwise it makes|pg||
nt|prof 1: p p x p ??|pg||
nt|werge: Trump|pg||
nt|hantveit: that would be a great lead :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2nt a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|minnie lee: that would have been my lead...eyes closed!|pg||
nt|xenya: if so, E must be pleased|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7 of either minor rolls, but even 6 may be tuff to bid.|pg||
nt|mariner1: even though Kjx @H are in W there is an entry issue to S|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: pass|pg||
nt|prof 1: i aggree with S pass with bal hand|pg||
nt|snorris: 2nt showing the unbid suits..|pg||
nt|snorris: strange..|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am not sure I would make the club A lead. Even with my eyes open :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: E will bid 4 S - has enormous strength|pg||
nt|minnie lee: nothing to loose and everything to gain!|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS might have a very agressive style on the 2h bid, making south bidding a carefully pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: i wouldnt lead ace of clubs if anyone told me queen is singelton|pg||
nt|april7: first 1NT opening|pg||
nt|hantveit: 20+20 here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: understand Swedish an advantage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you can always look at the pictures|pg||
nt|kamras: Hej|pg||
nt|werge: But West is bidding Easts cards also...|pg||
nt|edmunte1: they really like opening 2 clubs :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: Is there no possibilty to make 6@h for E/W?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|prof 1: lolll, the pass is strange|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i fear a doomed game on the way|pg||
nt|april7: do they play weak NT? or precision?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should be max|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: Invitational hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 3n has more prospects than 4h|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2 finesses :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: what does 4N mean in this situation, i wonder -- do they know that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D alltid obalanserat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11-16|pg||
nt|raghavan: and H A will be lead for a club discard|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess would be that 3h is a good raise with spade support|pg||
nt|hantveit: trumph out after these actions is to recommend...|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes possible|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: Take the plunge!  You know you wanted to bid 6 over 4@ss.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: avoided going overboard-tricky hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@C and another|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand however he may get help|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 nt will probably go several down with the right defence|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Pass showing 1st round control of @ss.|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's hand very suitable for no trumps very uncopmfortable for hearts|pg||
nt|daman: they landed on their feet|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid ladies|pg||
nt|lestergold: stil hard work tho|pg||
nt|daman: a lot easier than 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: 11 easy tricks, next pls|pg||
nt|daman: ouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a lot easier with this lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: absurd lead|pg||
nt|daman: totally|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good lead from East|pg||
nt|baldjean: But I don't think they will get there|pg||
nt|edmunte1: they're in the steaming phase :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|xenya: whatever NS do know, they win the board|pg||
nt|lestergold: qc lead looks sensible|pg||
nt|daman: not on the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: ity happens to give a trick and of course west cant return them but it looks, like the best shot|pg||
nt|april7: N will finesse the @H correctly,why not @C lead? needs very little from partner|pg||
nt|daman: @Cs were bid and supported|pg||
nt|daman: partner is like to be void    that's why|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok klead a second suit of the opps like spades not the first suit bid on ur left|pg||
nt|daman: you could give away the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a hand advertised as strongish|pg||
nt|daman: yes   a @S would be better than a @C imo|pg||
nt|baldjean: They could actually land in 6@s with this bidding|pg||
nt|baldjean: But no...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: With the mirror minors, the sac is a little to expensive.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|april7: now N can give up a @S and so making his necessary tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: or not -- they need to beat it by 5 -- perhaps they can't do that?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H lead pretty much does him in|pg||
pc|d5|nt|timmy5: u have to tell the players that|pg||
nt|hantveit: Looks like -3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: N has to be care in pitching|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|santyclz: Only -4, you're right.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  declarer is making things a bit difficult for himself|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz: Oh well...|pg||
nt|xenya: @DA looks very starnge, with Kx in view|pg||
nt|daman: we are seeing things double dummy   think about putting yourself in East's seat and go from there    not every contract should be beat|pg||
nt|april7: communication problems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: nortyh houild be asking herself why did east lead a short heart?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hantveit: The 2H bid increased the possibility for south to hold 4 diamonds, but east has 10 trics even with dia 4-1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|tsadek: H.Sellami , bid 3@S which probably misbid , he mean 3NT , but he decide to pass 4@S correctly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|mariner1: K@S|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should have ducked |pg||
nt|rnmalik: before playing 9@D he should cashed AK@H to make it easier for himself.|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well not the best line the sure spade trick should have been set up|pg||
nt|mariner1:  S A only bid 4@H and scored 13 imps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hantveit: I am in norway, I cannot shout that loud...|pg||
nt|enachou: yes very strange :(|pg||

nt|timmy5: 5d is even a better saving|pg||
nt|snorris: if north opens|pg||
nt|hantveit: Must open 1 clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, EW have got 11 cards in @Ss... |pg||
nt|xenya: can they do better now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: They did *very* well last hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s by n/s cold as cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: weak 2 by W and 4 @S by S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Dom kommer kanske i 4@H här, men den går att beta|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers, so the hand is worth an opening bid, but the danger is that partner starts to dbl...|pg||
nt|raghavan: they have 44 fit in S |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n also|pg||
nt|april7: what doesX mean now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S i suppose, no ruffing values|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score board-but E can be end played for making 41S|pg||
nt|xenya: NS are in danger of getting too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2 over 1|pg||
nt|april7: hoping that W has a 2@H opener|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tjolpe:  Den gÃ¥r i vart fall inte att spela hem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H normalt svagare än en 2@H öppning, i alla fall som jag spelar|pg||
nt|hantveit: ouch|pg||
nt|timmy5: ouch ?|pg||
nt|snorris: d: take out|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl over 4 clubs is showing secondary support in major and cards, east might pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes ofc|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Vul fear|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hantveit: if it shows major fit, then take out|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H has a play here, so 4@S looks like a good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Great sac.  The only problem is 4@h may not make.|pg||
nt|xenya: but 5@H is hopeless|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kamras: Deras är ca 4-8 hp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Inte N-S här |pg||
nt|timmy5: never pass|pg||
nt|xenya: as i see it that is|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good decision by Yousey|pg||
nt|hantveit: I cannot see how 4H would go more then 3 down for 500.|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Hard work for North - he also bids his partners cards...|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d holding may persuade E to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks after this lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: if you x then pard bids freely over 1 nt  dont you bid again? maybe I am wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that EW is cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see a way, but that doesn't mean there isn't one.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes there is a way to make 5@H|pg||
nt|xenya: but it takes perfect reading |pg||
nt|enachou: no way i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 4@hs: showing both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored minor cards make this difficult|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Sellami should forget previous board|pg||
nt|edmunte1: and concentrate now on this tough 3nt|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hantveit: never say never :) We have seen it all, and done it all, havent we?|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5clb if anyone bids it will get doubled|pg||
nt|snorris: and now...|pg||
nt|snorris: undisiplined 5@cs?|pg||
nt|enachou: 1@s 1@h and 1@s|pg||
nt|enachou: @c|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see one, but I've seen many hands where top players make things single-dummy that I can't see dbl-dmy.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm willing to bet even papi couldn't make 6@cs.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: so maybe let them play here,  true |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt notice the 4 S possibilities|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl on 4 clubs is explained as TO, I think I would bid 5 clubs there|pg||
nt|xenya: for one thing, you can take a double finesse in @Ds, secondly, you can through W in with 3rd trump |pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: but I would support to 3@H|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't like 3@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not the right player to play 3NT-@D lead |pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like mp bid|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to get @Cs right too of course|pg||
nt|april7: ace and then Q of @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: E made a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so...seems like E wasn't sure where he wanted to play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vassilis Virvidakis shows me the way to make 5@h.  Double finesse @ds and guess @cs.  Thanks.|pg||
nt|hantveit: Noshy is pushing on with a 3 loser hand. Understandable, but 6 spades is a huge error.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hantveit: Finally, a good pickup for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|snorris: first good board for n-s |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: but his pass over 3N looks ill-judged -- unless he is not sure about 6 @Hs in the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand certainly doesn't merit a slam try opposite a minimum 4-6 hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hantveit: overtake + more hearts|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @H |pg||
nt|edmunte1: it would have been better for Soliman to play small|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  W painted a picture of exactly what he held... not much to misinterpret.|pg||
nt|baldjean: This defense is quite helpful|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: 1100 - just a flat board ?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps this has a play after all|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|hantveit: Open room now has reached board 8, the East Wests slam|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: I do not like the 3@S raise as S has nothing to cover outside losers,,,,, and is RED|pg||
nt|mariner1: vs WHITE|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see a way to make |pg||
nt|mariner1: has a play only if E makes a mistake|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|timmy5: yep|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now he has|pg||
nt|hantveit: More hearts now will shorten table|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|edmunte1: taking the only entry to declarer's hand earliy|pg||
nt|edmunte1: but it's easy for us , we see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|pelu: in Open East bid 1@S (naturel bid) and 3@D from S - but later N - on her falt hand - bid 5@D|pg||

pc|c2|nt|andyv:  all's well that ends well|pg||

nt|sybarra: yikes |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 9 |pg||
nt|snorris: more slams|pg||
nt|hantveit: I never pass first and bid 5 clubs later like this, but here it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|raghavan: slam in NT?|pg||
nt|timmy5: all auctions are totaly different in the open room|pg||
nt|hantveit: 17 + 14|pg||
nt|snorris: will be hard if north shows 12-14 nt range|pg||
nt|hantveit: Hard to find the slam on this hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: will they reach 6 C or 6NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: Chemaly might feel stronger after last hand, maybe 1nt in opening? if 15-17?|pg||
nt|timmy5: why with 14|pg||
nt|hantveit: he knows they are down much, so when you need to make swings - make then when you are in the floating zone|pg||
nt|hantveit: make them|pg||
nt|snorris: 14hp and 3 nines..|pg||
nt|hantveit: 14 hp + a good feeling + urgent need lol|pg||
nt|hantveit: seems like a break?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Probably a break/|pg||
nt|timmy5: i dont know|pg||
nt|timmy5: i have to go out and see|pg||
nt|andyv:  @S partial?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: close-|pg||
nt|xenya: i must confess i would be happy to pass with the N hand here|pg||
nt|xenya: we can't complain about a lack of exciting hands|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7@ds again.  Again 6 is the target.|pg||
nt|april7: S didn't want to make 11 tricks,playing for 12|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats an unusua phrase roared back - are they lions?|pg||
nt|lestergold: lionesses?|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he would have made it by cashing all yrumps -- what does E discard?|pg||
nt|xenya: *trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@C nd AQ@H?|pg||
nt|hantveit: I do not understand the defence. knows he has 4 spades, and I do not understand why he is not continuing in hearts in trick 2. |pg||
nt|baldjean: It was still tricky, even towards the end|pg||
nt|edmunte1: last three boards were a nightmare for Sellami|pg||
nt|tsadek: Egyptian Ladies Team played great in this tounment , with huge Lead , Dr.Azzam their captin has done great job to prepare this team|pg||
nt|baldjean: Operator says there wil be a short break in broadcast|pg||
nt|baldjean: will*|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|timmy5: may be ill have a smoke break too|pg||
nt|snorris: if they play 14-16hp then six will be bid|pg||
nt|minnie lee: ok...a good start|pg||
nt|xenya: all that double dummy of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: sorry - have to go - back in 10 min|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 spades was not reached in open, so it was a 13 imps loss.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: but 1@C is perfectly normal of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  i would too... first seat... very soft values and no quick tricks or 5 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: might be tough to reach 6 here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh the @H10 comes into play|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: most of all ace less 12|pg||
mb|3D|nt|raghavan: may pass|pg||
nt|minnie lee: no|pg||
nt|hantveit: how strong is the 1nt, do we know?|pg||
nt|xenya: mass missed?|pg||
nt|andyv:  he must have liked his spot cards|pg||
nt|hantveit: difficult to find the club q lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|minnie lee: quantum bids are rarley good, even without a 4 card major, this hand deserves develpement|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe 14-16 and a carefull south?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: *pass|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps those two mysterious bids might help?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|mariner1: he has no way to use 10@H fast enough|pg||
nt|edmunte1: this should be easy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|april7: weak 2 by N and a save of 4@H against makeble 4@S,but will go down because of bad break in @S and not finding K of @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I am wrong|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: at least they have located their @D fit -- first step to slam|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: 4@S from E looks like an overbid to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s makes partners not want to balance as often:)|pg||
nt|xenya: a slight one, admittedly|pg||
nt|andyv:  simply 3@s would have been sufficient|pg||
nt|rnmalik: balanced hand could bid 3@S inviting|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S here was an easy contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: if E does come down to AQh and 3@C then his only exit is a @c into S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy when @D split|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Undo please.|pg||

pc|h8|nt|xenya: is N thinking about 7 -- no|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nicely done.|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the poor spots in @S and K of @D off sie,  this does not look promising |pg||
nt|santyclz: A mirage trick.  The extra @s trick is duplicated by a winning @h.|pg||
nt|hantveit: must play club q now|pg||
nt|tsadek: Egypt Ladies Lead by 35 VP  , 2nd Morco 2VP more than Tunisia|pg||

pc|c4|nt|andyv:  agree...heart pitch is of no use|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1 logical end|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Egypt, after that difficult start to this set, has taken a 1 imp lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: it will be a swing board|pg||
pc|c7|nt|april7: W can't handle the hand without the @D finesse anymore|pg||
nt|daman: this is a case where a woman should go with her inyuition and drop the @C King|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile we have a new leader -- Egypt by 1 imp|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: best to play ace and a @D, she needs the communication  |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|april7: stuck in dummy has to play ace of @C|pg||
nt|tsadek: 2 Team Qualify for Venic Cup in Brazil|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: It would be a lot easier if n were playing it.  One tends to thing about setting up your own hand.  In this case should just ruff 3@hs from dummy and claim.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: lucky W|pg||
nt|daman: should not have played @D Ace first|pg||

nt|hantveit: Strange mistake there by East. The defence lost their chances but were given back the one down from dec.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hantveit: they did bid 6spades in open, so the next question is if they will bid and make a game|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|daman: you eith play at the 2 level or the 4 level depending upon the caliber of your hand |pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: oh dear the A@H was led on the last hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|snorris: north should try 5 @ds..if south had 10 of @s it would win|pg||
nt|hantveit: now he need to play spade, still one down I think|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes 1S+2H+1C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North missed his moment of glory|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: tame defence|pg||
nt|daman: @S Ace was weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well at least draw 2 rounds of trumps and snatch back the second spade trick|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c7|nt|andyv:  this should be a big swing|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hantveit: This line is awfull, south knows hearts are 4-1 after the dbl, this will be blood|pg||
nt|snorris: this is bloodbath..|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: they did reach 4@S on 13 in Open Room|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  S must have expected more distribution for 5@c bid|pg||
nt|xenya: can make an ovetrick now|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|daman: ruff a @D|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|baldjean: with an overtrick now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|sT|nt|xenya: or perhaps S counted on longer @Ds in partner's hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence by east er not her best|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: now has to under lead ace of @S this may not be easy to do |pg||
nt|pelu: dont help the N is endplayed|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
nt|hantveit: Club ace= do not throu clubs partner|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: J@S very comfortable no chance even desparate chance|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: were destined to i think|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|daman: South Africa has scored 40 unanswered IMPs|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good sacrifice in 4 spade with only 2 down. 3 imps gain?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: mind you as trump trick now promoted|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: they still make 3|pg||

nt|rnmalik: bad board for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  would appear so|pg||
nt|xenya: an exact tie at the moment, but the last board is likely to produce a swing for Egypt|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@h?  vul for N/|pg||
nt|andyv:  N/s makes sac unattractive|pg||
nt|daman: penultimate board now|pg||
nt|lestergold: the errors by both sides came so thick and fast that i cant unravel the hand|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks this time in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i meant board 14|pg||
nt|hantveit: In the open room they found the stop in hand 10 - and they got 10 tricks as extra sugar. 7 imps|pg||
nt|hantveit: the difference between the teams will probably be one digit now, after the hand 12 in the open room.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am a 3 @C bidder with N|pg||
nt|pelu: now 3@C?|pg||
nt|snorris: if you are e-w :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: But right now, the fun is for EW only|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  as suggested by one of the specs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct bid after pass by partner|pg||
nt|daman: yes    a piano hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  could easily go down 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: after being punch drunk last hand i need a piano hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: even if pd can have xx I prefer 3@CX|pg||
nt|hantveit: Board 9, open room found the better contract for 1 imp gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: sorry no X|pg||
nt|andyv:  but preempt value is priceless|pg||
nt|daman: you spiked your punch too much|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to find K @H or @S in pocket to make 3N,,,,,, neither are|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead likely too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they dont seem to play michaels or guestem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I like to show my 2 suiters|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he does have 6@H|pg||
nt|hantveit: West downgraded his hand to 15-18 it seems. The best chances are in 3nt, but will probably go down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|raghavan: E will bid 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mariner1: phantom save over 3N|pg||
nt|xenya: ot's not over yet...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|raghavan: P opened S has 2 Aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have seen N not make penalty dbl's, he does this time|pg||
mb|3N|nt|snorris: 4@s??|pg||
nt|hantveit: might go pass here|pg||
nt|raghavan: D 3 lead|pg||
nt|snorris: no double no trouble..|pg||
nt|hantveit: X and dia 3 = more pain|pg||
nt|lestergold: well landed on feet|pg||
nt|hantveit: one miss from defence here, and 3nt will go home|pg||
nt|hantveit: we need a heart or club lead, should not be too difficult to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not much to the play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E had no choice but to bid 5@Hs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not quite my usual result when I lead a 9x.  I usually pickle the whole suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good start for the defence. |pg||
nt|hantveit: If EW can take away Norths hearts and clubs, there will be an endplay for 9 tricks against North in D and S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: there did she find that bid (3@S)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah here we go of course 3d bid was somewhat of an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: I would understand 4spades from North, but from south...|pg||
nt|raghavan: H 10 to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear no piano no violins rather more like an  ugly blast from the trombone section|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 5@D has a problem|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@S+1@H+1@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that helps|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3nt looks hopeless|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hantveit: Heart Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: wants D shift|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that doesnt|pg||
nt|mariner1: check the vugraph schedule,,,,, many excellent matches, Roland has been|pg||
nt|mariner1: busy.........|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unlucky, both finesses off|pg||
nt|mariner1: Indonesia and more African Championships in the offing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I envy those players at Sharm El Sheikh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: great place for a holiday |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the scuba diving is the best in the world|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont suppose they have time for that though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what about the skiing?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would drown if I tried|pg||
nt|yo_yo: water ski?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That too|pg||
nt|hantveit: If dec plays a club to K, souths need to duck it so dec might missplace some cards.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: well played 3 nt brought 10 imps |pg||
nt|pelu: and no X from S - "genteman" bridge :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats ok, will just take my + and not give the hand away with X |pg||
nt|lestergold: what 5h mean?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: lied about here aces to compemsate for overbid of 3d?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is too exciting for me|pg||
nt|mariner1: better than Galapagos or The Great Barrier Reef>|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you cant swim Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: ?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|edmunte1: 1 overtick now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|raghavan: club shift?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: since 3@D to high W has hidden an ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: and her partner is unlimited in theory|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: why - u most exp 2 down - so 300 better that 100|pg||
nt|rnmalik: simple|pg||
nt|mariner1: better than Galapagos or The Great Barrier Reef>|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i havent tried those places|pg||
nt|baldjean: but the logical lead helped|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|nt|hantveit: difficult to see, but dec should not throwed the club from table.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: well true, |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe I am just timid |pg||
nt|mariner1: that is a question|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not ideal for partnership bonding/confidence |pg||
nt|rnmalik: make an effort swimming is like sleeping:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Ducking the @c in dummy was an error..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, I can swim, but I am not sure that is enough|pg||
nt|edmunte1: it was a maker even on a @s lead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hantveit: I think heart 10 back would be better. That must show that he stills hold something of interest in diamonds|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: but at least avoids the embaraasment of 6h off one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it helps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: as was the lead itself|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: I can sink :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: not right to cover spade 9 there, if dec runs the nine, he is good, now north gave away a trick.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|hantveit: there we go...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|hantveit: ?|pg||
nt|hantveit: is that right operator?|pg||
nt|raghavan: why not S Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now atleast ruff|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ruff|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rnmalik: Even I could have made it:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hantveit: ruff and hear looks like a good alternative, leaving your pd longer in spades then North|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: when u defend like that u need to X - to take 100 :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: ???|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hantveit: Looks like -2|pg||
nt|hantveit: operator, is this right?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: there were to many swings in this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew said east|pg||
nt|hantveit: did he play spade 8 from table - his 9th trick?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Ok, I guess that was just a missclick from operator. Thank you all for watching|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: it doesn't seem right to lead from a doubleton with only 2 trumps...|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure I wouldnt have pessured them with 4 @S bid the first time |pg||
nt|raghavan: so 2H is pass or correct to ur suit|pg||
nt|hantveit: personally I prefer 2H over 2 diamonds, again giving informations to my partner as quick as I can|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s might bet lucky here.. missing a very good 4@hs |pg||
nt|snorris: which cant win|pg||
nt|raghavan: but this is good for NS since 4H fails|pg||
nt|hantveit: Now, he would pass I guess. He knows hearts are on the back...|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, lucky development of the bidding :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i've noticed E doesn't like to mince his bids|pg||

nt|lestergold: not that many entries to dummy|pg||

mb|5D|nt|lestergold: maybe this needs a little help from tyhendefence to make in practice|pg||
nt|hantveit: Last hand comming up, a lot of missed chances for EW in this round.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  thank you all for joining us...an interesting set of boards to be sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the trump lead does not help declarer|pg||
