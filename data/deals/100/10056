nt|bridge_one: Hi friends !|pg||
nt|ady: tht north might open |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N an interesting opening here|pg||
nt|april7: N is to strong for a 1NT opening|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: Aggressive preempt by N|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT by East?|pg||
nt|ady: not l ikely to reach game|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C here showing limit raise or better @c|pg||
nt|ady: hi giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2Nt preempt. in a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: i think so|pg||
nt|ady: hardly a pre-mptive hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: quite a pre-empt too|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by S will be the contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqt: Team Rehder 1st Neuhauser 2nd|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Normally E/W would find their way to 4H, which is a more comfortable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: S will play in a @H partscorelosing 4 tricks,but EW have 4@S if thea could reach this contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi all! Welcome to the German Teams Championship 2009, Kassel, Germany -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/654   -  Tournament site|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree David looks like an opener to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: support X|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Christian Kaeppel|pg||
nt|april7: S could bid 3@H |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But the preempt put them under pressure and West understandably passed 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Constantin Stancesu from Switzerland|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North should duck the first club to retain communication with South|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and hello Nigel|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Roland and Constantin|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: wait these are wrong hands in line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the only way to stop EW from 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Rashid and Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Roland busy as ever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi Rashed|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welcome back sorry for delay 1st cant be played in vugraph so contract is 4! bye East|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 4@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that looks more like it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Kath |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont have their ccs but presumably that's spades and another suit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do you know rashed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: i give u the result when played .....we had serverproblems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: christian what is their system ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The partnerships which play 3 way @C-would open this hand as 2@D both majors less than opening hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that unusual do you think Rashed to have 1h as the 2nd suit? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: actual E/W 4 tricks N/S 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i play (sometimes) @H and a minor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or @S and a minor|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no but if they are playing 2@S-@S and another suit-possible-with 2NT by responder for a feature|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: north using support dbl to show 3 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our commentators for this session are Linda Lee (Canada), David Greenwood|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Ireland),  and Roland Wald (Denmark) ........... I am Rob Brown (USA)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Christian Kaeppel (Germany),  is our superb operator, Hi Christian !|pg||
nt|mariner1: dbl from E unusual, maybe NS play a 2 range 1@C|pg||
nt|stc: Hi|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Eamon Galligan|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi Eamon|pg||
nt|eamongall: morning by minute ..(irish time) |pg||
nt|eamongall: hi Carl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Avram|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS gave up easy here I think|pg||
nt|ady: could not 3@D by north have been natural    as yet east's suit not disclosed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D and after 3@S to do a  2suit hand|pg||
nt|april7: I expectet N to bid 1 @S, but he decided  to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|stc: 9 tricks because unexpected 2 in @c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@H/4@S good hand|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: east might have contested with 3@S   after west has bid twice |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10+cards in the suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS find their fit at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: one too high|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the alternative at 4@C was 3Nt by South|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: well - by now you're on our schedule Eamon - afternoon :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if Live Updates is back - go to http://nmlag.com/LIVE-oppdatering and continue from there. Worked for me!|pg||
nt|april7: S has 3 Kings and N a 6card @H suit most probably.It doesn't need much to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: good play by W not taking the ace|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead and N must ruff a @S in handand then play ace of @H and @H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|eamongall: is it 2pm in Norway ? |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|stc: overtrick now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk6: 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 PM|pg||
nt|april7: 3@D was a good intermidiTE BID TO KEEP ew AWAY|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A second club and third spade makes nine|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Second diamond also possible|pg||
nt|april7: second @C is not for sure,where is the ace????|pg||
nt|ady: should get a 2nd trick in diamonds  on the lay|pg||
nt|stc: can't go wrong|pg||
nt|april7: lead is most helpful for 11th trick|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting that S did not compete here|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|sharkey: Think we're always 1 hour ahead of you|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: N might go down,if W cashes his ace of @C and underleads @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: the good news is S only has one @H higher than the 10 and 9|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd club available  unless a false card from west|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, JC marks 10 with East|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|ady: seems to have turned a plus into a minus|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No choice for declarer but to rely on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|stc: bad contract making on the lucky position in @h, 4@h much better|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eggy: Good mroning everyone|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: hi Steve|pg||
pc|c6|nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi and/or re folks.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: a @H back taps dummy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: E/W are one of the famost german pair Linde a former junior German master|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W have 1 trick - i see other 6 tricks (when ruff in the dummy South play K in @H and @H)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: entcho takes long time to do his next card|pg||
nt|ady: yes    only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with @CQ falling might loose 2@Hs|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome Joe Shair (North Pole)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: North's preempt "forces" EW into the best contract - would they get there without help?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: well done west   the only way to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|april7: but still good score for NS|pg||
nt|ady: will lessen a the potential loss  as 3@H making  should be a poor score for e/w|pg||
nt|april7: the 5 of @S was a positive signal for @S,thats why W defended as he did|pg||
nt|april7: ace of @H,@S@S@C@Srufface of @C @D sluff and so on|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: the 5 showed the Q or sigleton|pg||

nt|duschek: So it's advantage Chile before the last 16 boards, but no decisive lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Arguably two of the best pairs in South America at this table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree John, Beto?|pg||
mb|p|nt|levix: hello all|pg||

nt|vugraphb1: wlc back all|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: PAcareu Robles are the best junior one most probably|pg||

nt|vugraphb1: welcome all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If specs like to send some info pleeeece do it:) |pg||
pc|hA|nt|beto: so if ties Chile wins|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Can be a bad start. Minus 3?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|beto: Ventin is from spain|pg||
pc|h8|nt|beto: but is playing for argentina|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru: I have no info regarding Ventin..as Lambardi used to play with Lucena for many many years|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|beto: i think he has a residence in there|pg||
nt|duschek: Apparently it was - Robles drove it all the way to game once he heard partner had an opening bid with 5-4 in the majors|pg||

nt|sybarra: "only" 50 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: key play was the @C to make 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: to the German National Team Bamberger Reiter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has some play here......|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS might lose 1 or more there|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have some play for 4@S here|pg||
nt|hlortz: a @S preempt may buy this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 3@H by west was difficult to interpretate - E thought could play or 4@H or 5@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3@H DBL in Open Room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thinking ad double fit|pg||
nt|stc: easy part score in @s|pg||
nt|stc: Action now ? 4@h, 5@d ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: logical end:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no live again|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|yo_yo: hurrray :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: two key cards are the stiff J@H and the 8@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: the trick is getting the @c pitch before losing the @D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: 6@D by EW|pg||
nt|ady: 6 of either minor for e/w|pg||
nt|santyclz: I liked 2@h by s.  Takeout x of @ss.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well NS has to bid to be able to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is either multi or just a weak major|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a lower @S contract is likely I think|pg||
nt|hlortz: zo ew play a WEAK nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW play a very low NT at least NV|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D could be also short - they play similar precision (i suppose)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Elinescu was shocked and asked me whether I put the names in BBO lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks:):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: may duplicate CR here|pg||
nt|jbgood: not now|pg||
nt|eamongall: not any more .. but will it be 3 doubled undertricks or 2 |pg||
nt|jbgood: sh be 3|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Rob and Rashid|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H says play your suit if weak|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N by S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has a good chunky 14 without @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: EW may even overbid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I would prefer a 3@S from north   |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree David,   |pg||
nt|april7: I would have bid 3@S, but would be of no awayl anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: better description,  doubt I am beaten tin the home suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Roland, Rashid and Christian|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good steady bidding so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welc rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N is less miss leading to me than a DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: do NS play transfers here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to realize that S probably has weak @S because 2N and not DBL|pg||
nt|santyclz: With those @hs, I'd bid 3nt even if a transfer were available.|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes me too Joe or transfer and bid 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you open NT that weak I like the 2@H and 2@S natural|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes no use transferring into a weak hand.|pg||
nt|ady: no good spot for n/s     e/w   have nice heart fit   looks good for 9 tricks       think trump lead best if they play in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is a 20 vs 20|pg||
nt|mariner1: everything from here on will be HIT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess this is the way they show a minimum raise to 2S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard for N/S to come in at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D1@S1!NTperhaps 2@C nonforcing and then 2@S by W|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|jbgood: unless NS overbids |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D is interesting|pg||
nt|santyclz: N took it as minors.|pg||
nt|mariner1: that would explain 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: it was long hesitating .....on N|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might have thought S had less than a full opener too|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now on S thinking|pg||
nt|santyclz: Multi is not difficult to defend.  Many defenses word.  The only problem is both partners have to be using the same defense.|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is very RED to be coming in very weak|pg||
nt|santyclz: (work)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so since S would not come in weak I think N is being timid......|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think N has just enough for 3@S here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W could make many @H |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Worked well here because after 1S-2S, South might have balanced|pg||
pc|d9|nt|stc: of course :)|pg||
nt|ady: not clear for n/s to enter the b idding  vul against not    5@D like might well only go down 1|pg||
nt|eggy: And even if they had, they couldn't guarantee -1 by any means|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eamongall: ah yes ..there is the @DAK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Apologies, our operator is Christian Kaeppel. Hallo Christian, good luck!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like the treatment of coming in early (the 2@h bid) with minimum values and passing then taking action with stronger hands.|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT  was certainly going to be bad for n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT forcing?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: since EW is the German National Team I wonder if that makes NS less|pg||
nt|mariner1: confident?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The difficulty in that is the rare case where 2@ds is passed out.|pg||
nt|stc: very good contract|pg||
nt|april7: it looks like E will lose 1 @S,1@H,1@D and 2 @C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: hi Christian|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually not by passed hand?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: will the @D bid stop a @D lead, as maybe the @H will?|pg||
nt|mariner1: might not try for 4 now as not in it|pg||
nt|eggy: even with the diamonds 2-1 onside|pg||
nt|april7: at least 2 down on @D lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: probably will finish at 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: they will find their diamond fit now      will east sit the penalty double of west?|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure he will|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 2@D Dbl probably 2@S by North - it is more difficult the dbl at 2@s |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: they might end in spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning folks.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: board 1 was 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: spade position favourable Steve for 5@D to only go down 1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if you pass with 11 or 12 first seat than ...........|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   the better slam   has chances with a 4-1 club split|pg||
nt|stc: he can make also 3@s if guessing @s|pg||
nt|stc: which is not the % play|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Now needs the heart finesse just to make 2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Aiming to ruff a diamond might have been safer|pg||
nt|stc: strange that he didn't go for a @d ruff first :(|pg||
nt|april7: @D ace and @D might cause E some difficulties, but E will succeed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hlortz: no reason to risk the 3@S contract w @C finesse|pg||
nt|hlortz: rite no reason to risk 3@S contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: well 2@H was not my call|pg||
nt|ady: out of it now     east did not even wait for west   to take action after 2@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H bec with void in @D East know to can pass the Dbl at 2@D by West|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes very lucky they can lead spades from North twice|pg||
nt|eggy: I know that, David, but the spades aren't always so nicely placed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: might  well make on this lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: hunt the Q@D now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: hiJOe|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|mariner1: well snuck one by|pg||
nt|ady: agree     just saying as it is   only down1   |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: in fact if clubs are 4-1 they can be ruffed good for the 12th trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good evening|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: Kof @S and @C finsse|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: the @c lead here was reasonable however leading from KJ's is not for the timid|pg||
nt|mariner1: setting up to cross ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: And/or trying to get the opps to lead trump.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Tom Jacob|pg||

pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: also @H lead make - impossible for defence to play a second round of @H|pg||
nt|ady: partner has shown strong no-trump values    usally best to lead a trump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this agree David|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mariner1: W can hook either pointed suit but not both|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: he will guess clubs - or else|pg||
nt|eamongall: I presume the doubles allow us play @Cs correctly |pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 down|pg||
nt|april7: not the best idea|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: he knows the @S position so that is the safer one|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the crunch point|pg||

nt|Walddk2: aha, weak with 5-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|beto: 2@H must me weak 5@S4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H was the alternative, showing spades|pg||
nt|duschek: 2@H is probably showing a weak hand with 5@S4@H - advance Flannery or whatever it's called|pg||

nt|jbgood: 4 if he missed the club play.. (as I tried to say . causing 214 direct chats)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/654  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lost 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: so a plus however maybe a imp loser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 trick ruffing with A in @H at end - deconcentration by declarer, happen|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam in diamonds|pg||
nt|stc: he must take the @h hook, he will still make with @s 2-2 and he needs it with @s 3-1|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, they lost their spade trick somehow|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the names of the teams  are they regions or names of the players?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Bamberger Reiter = German Best + National Team .....Team Ludewig named by player|pg||
nt|yo_yo: christian i bet you know |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: slow play already 14 min late|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I understood ..jb|pg||
nt|jbgood: Eamon - you are great!|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by S and 2@S by E|pg||
nt|sybarra: in fact on bd 1,  the "only 50" bought n/s 3 imps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand 4@S or 3NT|pg||
nt|stc: Is 6@h makeable here ?|pg||
nt|ady: to much to do with hearts 4-0 to make 6@H a good proposition    |pg||
nt|motbocaj: both majors?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT NS|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rnmalik: part score either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@h?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score may be 2@S but W would not settle for it|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could get too high here,,,,,, or possibly make 3N|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Might not make with spades 2-2 if they can get a heart ruff and make trumps separately|pg||
nt|april7: a nice slam in @Dand @C and NT because of distribution|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed 12 tricks are there for NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thank you|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: this may well go down 3|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H shows the 4@H and 5@S less than game force|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they find the grand?|pg||
nt|stc: very destructive opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: there was a guy watching the rugby outside  in smoking shelter of a bar and everytime there was a score he ran in to cheer with those inside the bar .. |pg||
nt|mariner1: though game makes here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 7@C not so good|pg||
nt|stc: sure, but  low probability|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a club  and at  least one diamond in the south hand  so unlikely to pick up QXXX hearts  |pg||
nt|eggy: kept EW out of trouble anyway|pg||
nt|motbocaj: slam is definitely in Norths mind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@C will solve all problems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so bamberger is what?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: East has very little respect for the colors here...|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3N would require the miracle guess in @S I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has a chunky 13 so............|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree, heart finesse is better but playing on diamonds before ace of trumps is better still|pg||
nt|stc: anyway thev major error was the early trump play|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: where to begin |pg||
nt|mariner1: oops no game I meant|pg||
nt|mariner1: contradicting my own commentary :)|pg||
nt|april7: RKCB|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 8 tricks are not 100% here so neither is 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: good pass from S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bec depending only from keycards - also if need a doubleton in @C, or find @C 2/2 or !Q in @c sgl if South have 3@C|pg||
nt|stc: 6@h seems OK with 2@c, 2@d, 1@s and 7 easy trick in cross ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: best?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: location of 1st league team|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: yes I think S made a good move|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: not easy to play and S will go at least 2 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to play everything our of his hand |pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: You are WLC:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite a disciplined pass by w.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  minor suit transfer    obviously 3 diamonds now must be forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: but have forced NS too hight looks like|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead helps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hands of highly disparate strength often play better in the weak hand's suit.  Not this time, though.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to set up @S for @c pitches|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is makeable|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to hold to 2@H and a @S loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe needs help from W too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed I still think 3NT was a better playable contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: well I see 8 in NT, the 9th would be an issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: and only one entry to S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW will provide the 9th|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room N used stayman over 1N...... auction still open|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means 2 stop in both majors - with slam interest North would be reopen. But no guess|pg||
nt|ady: poor effort by south  with prime support  and top maximum  inclusing good controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a vital point - if you pass opps play a peaceful 1 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: E does not like what he sees in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 3 nt are gone now 5@D|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Problem for North here, he has four card diamond support but everything else about his hand suits 3NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: -1 on small @S lead but now it is a different ball game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: and Narvik need IMPs!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good sequence-4@D minor suit key card-4NT=3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As it happens 5D also makes because spades are 3-3 so no ruff possible|pg||
nt|stc: IS N considering slam without @s control and lost values in @h?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I have no idea who is thinking or why :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|eamongall: No respect ...but he was buying a good dummy ... how many does 2@S go for ... maybe only 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they bid both his best suits,,,,,,,, and he is very RED|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: may make - |pg||
nt|sybarra: that 8 of clubs is huge card for e/w |pg||
nt|stc: note that with inverted @h/@ss slam is cold !|pg||
nt|stc: now trembling :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|hlortz: nice @D play!|pg||
nt|mariner1: would have been better off duck with J@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: great @D play yes........ how did he see that|pg||
nt|hlortz: dont think he did was just trying to set up maybe 2 @D tricks...got lucky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: excuse my lack of geographical knowledge but now i know about Bamberg being a city  ty helmi|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: y - might make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  could make 9 tricks in diamond   so no great damage losing 100   or 150|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/654  -  Tournament Site|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately kibitzers are not allowed to claim|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: will just make 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no choice 2 is 2|pg||
nt|motbocaj: at some stage near the end he would have to take a position on the @HQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: I think to have any chance he had to work on @S 1st and that was slim|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back dooms this|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eamongall: Carl thats almost  what I meant ... maybe only one ...almost  = may make .. |pg||
nt|eamongall: :):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 or 9 tricks david in !'s?  E only had one @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: *in diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, the good news is no game is likely to make.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@D pitch a @S and @D ruff and @C but no way|pg||
nt|mariner1: E can wait on his 2@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: on 13 Open Room found and made 3N NS for 11 imps|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: still can make 9 tricks |pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: exactly |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: rite Eamon :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but in the final analysis, not a huge win/loss either way |pg||
nt|santyclz: Why it's disciplined rather than timid.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if south had opened 1@D he might have been declarer, not sure then no @S lead maybe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but difficult to see 9 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: doubleton in @C, AKxx in @D and A A in majors could be sufficient to give a raise at 4@D|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|eamongall: but i did not want to recieve jb's 214 messages|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: but I can**lol|pg||

nt|mariner1: 7@D bid in Open Room|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C   here|pg||
nt|stc: very well done if they find it|pg||
nt|april7: is S should have ducked first trick there could hve been also squeeze possibilities against 4-1 @D distribution|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sybarra: your were right, think e/w can make 9 tricks in @D's |pg||
nt|mariner1: I do not know if there is a RESULTS link so if anyone has one please forward it|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S saves NS from being in 4|pg||
nt|hlortz: 2@S muiderberg?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S must be Muiderberg/Tartan type|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 5 with minor and less than opening count likely|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This should be a routine 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: nice weak 2 in W, white vs red|pg||
nt|stc: NS must stop in 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eamongall: I think best for EW was to play 3@Cs ..|pg||
nt|santyclz: 21+ inch screen is helpful.  On my 12" laptop 1 room is enough.|pg||
nt|mariner1: E likes it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so it pinpoints the @D suit unless there are 6@S|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|eamongall: those 2@DX and 2@CX often have enough to escape |pg||
nt|sharkey: showing 4@H and longer minor?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should not doubt you |pg||
nt|ady: duplicating sing diamond for e/w    3NT   best spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW find the slam? they should|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H Ogust? showing good suit good hand?|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the bad old days, the auction would be 2@s 6@s.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E has a massive hand.3@H singleton?|pg||
nt|mariner1: confirmed it is Ogust|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: although its june :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: the only outside strength W could have is A@H or K@D so E has to be thinking 6 or|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 6-er or 5/5 with @D preemtive|pg||
nt|mariner1: E not loving either suit|pg||
nt|ady: another split deck    probably 1NT   n/s  |pg||
nt|eggy: and it has to be made|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split  means only 11 sure tricks   west will need to draw 2 trumps to stop north making 9@C when playing diamonds   but a lucky spade position can compensate|pg||
nt|stc: S will also fight for a while, N may preempt in @h|pg||
nt|april7: @C partscore from NS (4@C)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 card major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose he might have run all his @D and tried to endplay someone|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and EW are very red|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C only, sorry|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with holding 4@S DBL |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|bridge_one: 1@C alert, so probably they play 1@D with 4cards, so 1@c can be only 2 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: you should have a very good reason to pass a take-out double, not sure E in the CR had that|pg||
nt|sharkey: More IMPs to Narvik...|pg||
nt|mariner1: Operator humour :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no my fault wasn´t alerted....(betterminor)|pg||
nt|eggy: not a given although the spade position may retrieve the position if declarer plays two rounds of trumps |pg||
nt|april7: wrong position of honourcards,S shouldn pass|pg||
mb|3D|nt|april7: 3NT but also 5 @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: so E knows its 6 now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just arrived from Turku, and just in time for a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D now for Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: makes 7 if no @H lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct:)|pg||
nt|stc: S very conservative this time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems strange to me, 4 card majors and a strong NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that K@H was bothering him|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: will not be a good advert for their methods...|pg||
nt|motbocaj: I was wondering if E would support @C's|pg||
nt|april7: N must bid now 3NT or 4@C and go down|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eamongall: in Ireland its called anti ...in USA suction ... (although I don't know rest of system)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe @d and one higher Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes .. like @DKQT9 maybe |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C is checkback or similar NMF|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Christian|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in UK we have 4 card majors and a weak NT or 5 card majors and a strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I don't recommend reversing on that North hand, but nothing is very attractive|pg||
nt|stc: 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 7@H is a save at 1400 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And since people who x for a lead seldom lead it themselves...|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is one reason I do not like these type calls are VUL vs NV|pg||
nt|stc: give S a 5-4 minors, slam is good|pg||
nt|stc: N must show extra values somehow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has overbid his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: though it could go for 1700|pg||
nt|mariner1: @SA being in S helps|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: they are already playing I cant folloe this one......only give result|pg||
nt|mariner1: np Christian|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: because of net problems ....sorry fellows|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 or 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|mariner1: we blame all of those on Santy :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mariner1: nah, 1400 seems its max|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good for us:)|pg||
nt|ady: maymay scrape home  |pg||
nt|ady: not clear to me to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|april7: what a lead!?!?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we play 5 card majors and NT slightly balanced hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eamongall: and you are still wrong side of declarer|pg||
nt|eamongall: multi landy I am told .... thats a fine defence to NT |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs confirm 2@H shows 4@H and longer minor...|pg||
nt|jbgood: I passed 2@c doubled five 5 good trumps after my prd had neg doubled in a European Chship once - was an uptrick:(, |pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - I thought you referred to the bidding in the CR Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: I know folk who reuse their multi stuff as defence to NT ...also folk who play 2@Cs for majors only ....but very few in Ireland are sophisticated enough for both at same time |pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - no|pg||
nt|jbgood: this 3@h is the modern way of playing multilandy - a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h|pg||
nt|eamongall: JB ... I can beat that ... I held @HKQ8754 and them trumps and a bidding partner ..and a lady by the name of Irene Robinson cruises into 4@Hs ...well what should I do |pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have come out smoking this half and really put the pressure on Topbridge.  Although they're ahead at halftime they may sense the tide's turning here...|pg||
nt|jbgood: you should ask her out for dinner:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: the lady made it ... (no uptrick) and the Deep finesse indicates 10 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: oh yeah I doubled |pg||
nt|sharkey: if she was good looking your defence may have suffered....|pg||

nt|sybarra: @S suit is remarkably friendly here |pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: and no 7 with @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: open in NV but beef it up RED vs WHITE would be my thinking|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why fritsche thinks 2@D is superior to 1NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very favourably placed for E|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: E can have any strong hand 2@cs was asking strenghts and distribution|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he does not have a positive entry and no help other than @Ds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so what was the 1NT rebid?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: yes, in open room both players choise don't play 3Nt :)|pg||
nt|april7: but still not help enough|pg||

pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: i am making you  work hard Christian, what is 1NT rebid pls |pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|eamongall: well both Don't and multi landy win ... as 3@Cs is safe haven for EW |pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: no - if partner dowesn't want club support with this hand, 3@C was probably the wrong bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: better to continue diamonds    but e/w  can always make    just lose 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all said it is a gift from EW:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nigel_k:  No it's lucky they can take nine tricks before letting opponents in again|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6@H here?|pg||

nt|vugraphzqt: But u see even World Champions make silly mistakes ......gives us hope for the game :)|pg||

nt|stc: perhaps E didn't discard the J@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I see a swing board. I hope I am wrong.:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|jbgood: if Topbridge lose by more that 16 imps (13-17) Studenetene may overtake them with a maximum win|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like 4@H   or possible 3NT for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could be in a tough game here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H if no @D lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good 6NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as if the previous one was not easy after A@D lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I could manage to lose 3 @s tricks in 4@ss.|pg||
nt|ady: yes    13 tricks without diamond cashed|pg||
nt|april7: but then W could have been endplayed by not cashing the ace of @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yes she did !J discard|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: 4@H   looks fairly routine   making 10 or 11 tricks on spade view|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 6@H in fact|pg||
nt|mariner1: that splinter might get them there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 6@D with no @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H warns E about distribution|pg||
nt|ady: and they m ight get a message if they do|pg||
nt|april7: sorry, I lost connection with BBO.Now I am back|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Is transfer and pass enough with West?|pg||
nt|april7: now it will be expensive for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: 14 tricks after loosing the A@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: unfortunately we do not have live board-by-board update - as this is becoming very exciting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 5@D|pg||
nt|stc: a pair not playing transfer, wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  will pay high price for any save  vul against not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C should get them to slam|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: drury of some sort |pg||
nt|april7: all leads by W are helpful except trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@S lead beats 6 though|pg||
nt|hlortz: the bold preempt worked|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe not, S has no quick entry so 6 not really a maker|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: nice 3 @H BID  so he cant bid @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C probably 6+@H good suit and 4 @C (with 5/5 probably 3@C)|pg||
nt|stc: there is work to do even in 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: I think the scores you see on Live Updates have been manually entered, so no live updates |pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: 2@C = Drury|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to lead a club now |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S looks like it can be set|pg||
nt|hlortz: if it went for 800 we would call it something else LOL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks with stiff K@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: found slam easy enough|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West really wants to bid a quantitative 4NT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But it is probably Blackwood now|pg||
nt|stc: here you can also make 6@c@D! and even @Hs !!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H+2@D+2@C+1@S=9 (contract)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Another double score for Narvik?|pg||
nt|ady: that wont exactly give south any problems|pg||
nt|rnmalik: BRAVO|pg||
nt|mariner1: any other lead and N can ruff out the @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C could be also a cue if Dbl at 2@H means good raise in @H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think they used 2D GF Stayman in the last set so that makes sense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@H passing sequence-transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @D out also causes an issue though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - discard two clubs and a spade on the diamonds and lead a spade up (still have to guess though)|pg||
nt|ady: got their only trick|pg||
nt|stc: with 89@H falling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very good sequence then|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: S has to ruff third @D with 9 of @H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: looks like 2@H 1@C and 1@D unless defense helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: certainly worked this time|pg||
nt|stc: u r wright|pg||
nt|april7: 1 down ,because W has to lose 3 @H tricks,1@C,1@D and 1@S trick|pg||
nt|stc: Wondering if good to give up transfers|pg||
nt|stc: 2@d X -> -4, but N still not recovered....|pg||
nt|april7: take with K or duck once,then QJ of @H and Ace of @C!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: as Avram said   leads otgher than a trump will help declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: claim|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|april7: not needed any more|pg||
nt|sybarra: not now |pg||
nt|santyclz: Only comfortable on a @c lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @C first|pg||
nt|april7: also ok|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 6@S E would have bid 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: I think W should have bid 2NT after transfer-3NT no play|pg||
nt|mariner1: wonder if going for 1100 has anything to do with this call|pg||
nt|april7: there is also no endplay possibility|pg||
nt|stc: probably not, according to the majority :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: @H 3 & 2 a help|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|eggy: Isn't there?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  Claim at trick 1|pg||

pc|d2|nt|mariner1: well 2@S after the DBL showed good @S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: unlucky   if north had a 4th club   could make  ruffing 3 clubs in hand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mariner1: has it now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: you know the K@C position I dont. Would you play @CA|pg||
nt|april7: must play up to the Q anyway|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  It just really looks like there should be an endplay |pg||
nt|ady: also could make with diamond finesse  just ruffing 2 clubs |pg||
nt|eggy: He probably should have tried the elopment, but is short of entries now anyway|pg||
nt|motbocaj: and that would be a good (but unlucky) line.. would S take his D King on a low diamond now?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|santyclz: In other words cold.  "Cold" in BBO-speak means "can be made double-dummy with a little help from the defense".|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: on 15 NS bid 3N in Open Room and it will be tough for that to make|pg||
nt|ady: could be a good result    others might get to higher contract|pg||

nt|rnmalik: np|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C EW ?|pg||

nt|ady: part score    either clubs n/s   or hearts e/w|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: if you're going to play a partscore, 3@D looks safer than 2NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs @h underleads against 4@ss.|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to get there I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but E did not open 1NT?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C should fail though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @H and one @C must be lose|pg||

nt|april7: another 3NT but this time not successful|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d!|nt|sybarra: other room played 3 more bds than we have |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but that still allows 4@S to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW play weak NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C makes because @H are 4 3 and K@C in pocket,,, 3rd @D goes on @SA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West keep the 10 in @C ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: N wants to defend 2@H DBL|pg||
nt|ady: probably wont get there      |pg||
nt|rnmalik: what deals. I hope the computer is well rested:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt loses two aces and three spades - but you are lucky spades are 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be very unlucky to lose more than one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D now?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: I thought they were at lightening speed|pg||
nt|ady: this is not so easy to bid   and anyway on a finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: would beat an aggressive 5@S though|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL here shows count|pg||
nt|mariner1: they might find 5@C now|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT has some play|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT by North should be ok as the cards lie|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's hard to beat 3C in practice I think|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: need to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your analysis of the hand is correct. Let us see if they reach it?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would have bid 3Nt with North I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and lucky that diamonds split favourably|pg||
nt|mariner1: 15 was -200 and 8 imps|pg||
nt|stc: I think EW play 4 cards major|pg||

nt|motbocaj: Why not 2@H by east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the finesses is k stiff |pg||

nt|mariner1: tough to think game looking at W|pg||

nt|ady: e/w   can make 8 tricks      n/s  might make 9 tricks in clubs  on a likely diamond lead    will need sspades attacked quickly to beat 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6 @H would be a good save if EW should reach a slam|pg||
nt|ady: now 5@C   from east|pg||
nt|mariner1: now is the key ,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E can't tell W has the magic hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S can't duck this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if south duck however 7 tricks the same for N/S|pg||
nt|stc: On @c lead ?|pg||
nt|april7: or @D, both are ok|pg||
nt|rnmalik: will have to play to make it-@S lead|pg||
nt|stc: it seems almost no play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: sorry, private|pg||
nt|stc: yes, he has to knock the A@h early|pg||
nt|stc: down if E continues @c|pg||
nt|april7: 8 tricks only,but you never know.....:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: right always keep defending mistakes in mind|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: yes, that as well |pg||
nt|rnmalik: S will bid 5@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: S shouldn't bid 5 unless N inverts his DBL's|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: S is thinking :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL to me here says I would rather defend|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it might mean no clear action|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rather timid by e.  The @hq upvalues (although not as much as it might) and he has controls in the other 3 suits.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzqt: w thinking :)|pg||
nt|april7: since no @H honour with E, W might bid the slam now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E could bid 4@C-I would:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: good news here is @H are 3 2 and @SA lead helps|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe what would have helped would be a 4 @D (cue) bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry, meant 4 @S |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: after 3 @s, 4 @S |pg||
nt|ady: yes  a fair point|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @c doesnt help pard,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3N if they play it as showing K (ala Benito)|pg||
nt|ady: all said and doned 5@C  not an unreasonable spot    |pg||
nt|sybarra: something to show the @S holding |pg||
nt|mariner1: no clear action is pass to me....... S is a passed hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Kind of depends on whether you're in a forcing pass situation and I'm not sure.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless pass/dbl inverted, yes, a la Meckwell - pass would ask partner to double |pg||
nt|hlortz: this might go down/// IF NS get their @D tricks prompty|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eamongall: maybe time for a tea|pg||
nt|ady: this should bed quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: N holding all the ourside Aces is not worried about a quick pitch so leads a trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: we are 10 min late so hurry up table :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: tomorrow we start at 10 MET :)|pg||

nt|stc: oops !|pg||

nt|stc: many IMPs on this (bad) switch|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 10@S|pg||

nt|mariner1: on 16 W in Open Room also opened 2@S so will it be 1100 again?|pg||

nt|mariner1: you can only DBL to show you want to defend or pass to show no clear action in|pg||

nt|april7: @HJ@H@H and @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  What do people think of North's 1S compared to pass or double?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|motbocaj: I like 1@S -- lead directional value|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: N bids 2N over the 2@S so it saves EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: that on 16 in Open Room|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you did pass 5@H you would "usually" expect S to do something|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3@D making 4 did lose, however not to 3n making, it was 2@H X off 300|pg||

nt|mariner1: 7@H ?  6 likely|pg||
nt|ady: well done    but  10@S  should have been played|pg||
nt|eggy: and promote the S , one way or another|pg||
nt|eggy: S6|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mariner1: part scores is all here|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe a tough 3N EW or 4@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the counterplay by south was the best, knowing good @H in North (otherwise impossible to bid for penalty at 2@H)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eamongall: the presentation has been  improved immensely by software / bridgemate things for us spectators |pg||

nt|april7: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: they dont play the 10pt NT VUL |pg||
mb|2C|nt|april7: best contract is 4@S and 5@H are only 2 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I agree, doubling 5@H looks best with that North hand...it is just that there are different ways to do it|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would pull with a 6th @s, but not with that hand.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N vs W:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|stc: Big swing on 4 after Q@S lead and questionable declarer play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Using the Meckwell agreement, North can pass (requests double) and then pass  |pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to find the @H fit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 5 of  either minor makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW steal one|pg||
nt|mariner1: QJ @c xx make this a winner EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C strong except 16/18 one suit hand 6 cards - they open 2@D that hands)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  do have a good save against 7@H   |pg||
nt|eggy: highly questionable actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one positive entry with W might make 6:)|pg||
nt|april7: E has actually more than 10  tricks but no entry to them|pg||
nt|april7: K of @S instead of Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: with QJ@C no problem|pg||
nt|mariner1: my general feeling is you have to strain over a weak NT, even VUL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cuts both ways|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome David Greenwood (Ireland)|pg||
nt|mariner1: or possibly when partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: or both|pg||
nt|hlortz: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 14-16 valnurable|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Christian|pg||
nt|ady: -1700  good save |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  better    does not require heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: but we still should remember 21 years ago we had folk who could score a 15-17  table mitchel with a pencil in 20 minutes |pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - but the software here dealing with the Bridgemate was not working properly..|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may just be waiting in the bushes here to trot out 5 @H,  guess not |pg||
nt|mariner1: right N's DBL says we are beating 5@H, so S should only pull if he thinks 5@S has|pg||
nt|stc: @c continuation is good even if W has double @C, don't know how the show count |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best defense 5@H  -800    spade ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 too many |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: good play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H not too bad a spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely to make 3|pg||
nt|stc: it does on a @d switch|pg||
nt|motbocaj: some might have bid 3@S over 1@S to ask for @S stop, and take a chance on the diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: south's double was presumably support showing three spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H shows a fit and a max|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Aggressive action by South has worked here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4S may make with good guesses and anyway has pushed opponents one level too high|pg||
nt|stc: Can make if guessing the A@h short|pg||
nt|stc: but not if he play on @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why 3 can be passed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: well the 7 was not likely to be bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes 3NT better, 5C can also fail if North has Jxx of clubs|pg||
nt|stc: not after the X, W showed some values|pg||
nt|april7: I don't think so, the X was GF|pg||
nt|stc: looking for trouble, already -800|pg||
nt|april7: now the X is tops, 4 down!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has saved the situation and now we might see 4@S DBL|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: it's easy to have problems in these auctions when responder only has 4 in his suit, and goes to a new suit|pg||
nt|athene: how strong is 3@C in this auction?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@H easy with both @C @H finesses on|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no spots in @H missing either|pg||
nt|mariner1: 9@H not an issue since @H are 3 2 onside|pg||
nt|stc: ..plays...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: it can help if you play lebensohl but easy to have misunderstandings over whether 3@C is weak, invitational or forcing|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: bd 6 the other room tried the ill fated 3 nt |pg||
nt|eggy: will probably just cash his tricks now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: the slam on 17 was played in 4@S -1 in Open Room so 14 imps|pg||
nt|hlortz: note he will start x@H not J in case of singleton K onside|pg||
nt|ady: well 7 is not a good contract|pg||

nt|mdgraham: played quite well|pg||
nt|mariner1: nicely played|pg||
nt|mariner1: so I expect a swing to EW there|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: and so it was |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, well done|pg||
nt|ady: 11 top tricks for e/w       spades will be the 12th|pg||
nt|stc: 6NT on @s or @d 3-3|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: i guess south expected his partner to have more defence for the double|pg||
nt|sybarra: boring bd 7 so we skipped?  (just kidding) |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yes only good hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N the spot NS here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: preferably by North|pg||
nt|mariner1: makes a lot with no @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now its gettin´faster :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score|pg||
nt|mariner1: again part scores here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play here and so does 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see action here..........|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s was a very good save|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@S or 6NT:)|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunate 6@S by N, down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: sorry, again bad connection|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|hlortz: @S game here or NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: echo LOL|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a fizzle|pg||
nt|ady: should locate 6NT   |pg||
mb|1H|nt|nigel_k:  Yes plus squeeze possibilities|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: and a rousing 1 nt here |pg||
nt|mariner1: actually a @S lead from W is nice if S plays 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems both have 4 losers or more off top|pg||
nt|april7: but 6 @D are there|pg||
nt|april7: and 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps north would have done better to win the first trick with the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: that might persuade declarer to finesse trumps|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jbgood: they are going for Bronze medals now! |pg||
nt|athene: but since dummy doesn't have any entry, it's going to be hard|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will always be suspicious if you give him a club finesse he can't take himself|pg||
nt|athene: *sorry a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice choice Christian |pg||
nt|rnmalik: checks in both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D inverted showing a limit raise or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: has to be careful in 4@S to not allow a @H ruff or trump promotion|pg||
nt|april7: should give up a @S and then hope for 3-3 in @D or @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: best is 6NT with @D finesse|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: 2@S better contract for NS|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S make 5@D here|pg||
nt|stc: but if dec tries @d first he may take 2 finesses in @s and go down ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you risk it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and this one is not easy |pg||
nt|ady: this looks like down 1 |pg||
nt|stc: On 17 my 6@h joke was reality and dec didn't guess @h and went down !!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: now will E risk a @H lead?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep could get careless if @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: can make 12 now|pg||
nt|ady: reasonable save   -300     5@D   makes n/s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzqt: !10 marks @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The heart suit on 17 is an unusual application of restricted choice|pg||
nt|ady: also if defence fails to switch to a club   a possible double squeeze|pg||
nt|stc: nobody will play 6NT with this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: lead not helping|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|vugraphzqt: after @c ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: now a @H and @H|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stc: % plays seems to be 2 times @D, then cash AK@s|pg||
nt|april7: I think the best play is AK of @S for either doubleton honour or 3-3|pg||
nt|eggy: all sorts of chances though, if NS don't switch to clubs|pg||
nt|stc: Yes but only after testing @d|pg||
nt|april7: no must be before|pg||
nt|eggy: I think a diamond to the K and then a spade to teh 9 looks natural|pg||
nt|motbocaj: You would perhaps normally do that but the 3rd @S could lose two tricks immediately to QJxx with @D's 33 or squeeze chance|pg||
nt|stc: N will never switch to @cs|pg||
nt|stc: You have all the time to test @d first|pg||
nt|stc: in this case, not if @d are 4-2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: will go for diamonds   but should lose 7 tricks   1 diamond 4 hearts and 2 black aces|pg||
nt|april7: but only because S shows out on second round|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s -1 is a normal result|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: W's discards call for the @H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: now its possible to be made4 discards !!!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: re inverted minors, is 2N the best way to show a minimum balanced hand?  Or next suit? (Here, 1@d-2@d-2@H) |pg||
nt|stc: next|pg||
nt|april7: no problems anymore|pg||
nt|eggy: well that solves that problem then :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: But to do that you have to take a finesse rather than playing for the squeeze.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a good duck|pg||
nt|ady: now no problem|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jbgood: a kib indicated that doubling to get 100 rather than 50 and paying out 670 is more Tapsbridge than Topbridge|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: or cards played rather|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 is 2|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is a meaning of the word "discards" with which I was previously unacquainted.|pg||
nt|stc: INDEED !, why not ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no now the A@H has not been cashed N can play on @D. A hand holding 4@S and 4@D 6 is 6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: yes, I think the % play is to finesse|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very complex hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: lol - gd point|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|april7: interesting now, N can take the chance and finesse in @D|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: Tapbridge = losing bridge|pg||
nt|april7: after cashing the @H a @S switch will beat the contract.N should have ducked @H twice, then N would have had a chance to make it|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 12 in the bank|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbgood: and surely ment 200 for 100|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 4 on last board was worth an imp|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: east must keep a spade|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The takeout double may have helped declarer guess hearts here|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: oouch?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: I think there used to be a bridge website called Topbridge some years ago |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|mariner1: well played|pg||
nt|bridge_one: securety for 2down |pg||
nt|april7: cash always the ace!!! against slam!!!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|kit: Some might overall the 4-card suit here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|granguru: a 20-20 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|levix: will N lead doubleton?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: The overcall works well, as 1NT is cold and 2@S has chances|pg||
nt|othered1: good lead|pg||
nt|beto: yes, very nice leaf|pg||
nt|beto: lead|pg||
nt|granguru: he he|pg||
nt|granguru: avoids a @c ruff|pg||
nt|kit: West is 4-3-3-3 so isn't gettng ruffs, so why should he let anybody else get ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We already see the result but 12 might was hard|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Graded up the cards from 19 til a 20-21NT|pg||
nt|levix: it is ok with 5d |pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|levix: keep CK in dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: K109xx make one point|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as KJ10XX fore shure do|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|granguru: wise comment Kit|pg||
nt|levix: no overtrick with this lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: declarer might still make by setting up hearts, discarding a club on third heart rather than ruffing it|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Clasic one|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|granguru: but the menace of the @H establishment arises|pg||

pc|d6|nt|rodal f: U are a bit more concervatice at K109XX?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: but it looks like the force in clubs will get him anyway|pg||
pc|dK|nt|beto: maybe more|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will lead a heart and pitch a club|pg||
nt|beto: he will only get 3 more tricks now|pg||
nt|frankaus: started and finished with 6 top tricks|pg||
nt|kit: then opponents play on clubs, he ruffs, crosses to dummy, and plays another heart pitching diamond|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: West ruffs, but must break diamonds, so down 1 I believe|pg||
