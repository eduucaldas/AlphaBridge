nt|Walddk2: 9½ - 11½|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit annoying for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still was in principle right to lead trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: and E's @D8 could have suddenly become a big card, had he exited witha small @D at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Bekkouche must hope that the double is negative; it usually is|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: not this time Roland|pg||

mb|3N|nt|lestergold: fairly normal part score competitive auction|pg||
nt|asig: Ready for the football match tonight, Ralf?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW plays precision, 1@d can be void, 1NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another plus score for the Icelanders|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|cenglund:  Seems overoptimistic after partner's sign-off|pg||
nt|kastan88: GE Christer, you are far South from us :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough boards to analyze, not sure the best defense here|pg||
nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: close, yes -- but not quite maybe -- i think EW can get 2 trumps, 2@Ds, 2@Cs and a @S|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 3NT ?|pg||
nt|xenya: they should do that quickly however|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

nt|lestergold: and 4c has play in any case|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 2@d= 5+M+5+m, weak|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: but pard (W) said she had zilch with the rais |pg||
nt|haans: gustavsson won swedish championships three years running. claimed he was lucky|pg||

nt|kastan88: wow, I thought you in South Africa :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Shirley this is a bidders game |pg||
nt|lestergold: east knows pard is shor in  dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: so as long as there is good club support she can push|pg||
nt|sybarra: true but I also do not like going for 300/500 agst zip |pg||
nt|lestergold: you dont have to make everything u bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c can lose one club one spade and one heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: its actually a good point Mike |pg||
nt|lestergold: it wont be doubled into game on this sort of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: o vont to win or u want to sit there and let opps roll in easy contracts|pg||
nt|haans: would be interesting to know why they have left swedish clubs ( = weak/strong1@C) for pure Big Clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: but of course there is still room for a defensive error|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bob McPhee|pg||

nt|sybarra: Hi Bob@H@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|kastan88: still i don't like such advantages, too much pressure to partner, and i am with you Mike, i would bid 2@H not passing, partner could have  6S3-1D3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the theory becomes different- in the pass out seat you are  in the trap in effect weven though east hasnt spoken|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H or 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: or pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: hmm I thought that was Lebensohl too|pg||
nt|talion: 1@c = 15+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes my vote 2 (just)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: South has the option to sit for it or to escape by showing both majors|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Precision or some other strong club opening, I presume|pg||
nt|talion: skuladotti is tempted to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Bob|pg||
nt|haans: must be transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@H by N might even make?|pg||
nt|xenya: or W might run?|pg||
nt|pelu: if S wont to run - the West can just sit and wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 boards compared now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the tables are not linked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: flat  3 and 5  to Sweden|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: Auken perhaps hoping pard is strong enuf to double again|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cenglund:  3NT is piece of cake|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the no science route|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: Hi Bob, |pg||
nt|mcphee: just getting an idea whats being played|pg||
nt|haans: no double = good bidding|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: should make plenty |pg||
nt|mcphee: these sort of hands really offer little play choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant agree with the 3nt call - why cant 6@D be frigid |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|talion: yes it is, but it could have been very poor contract if nurmi has minimum 15 points for her opening|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer may get home if she plays on the black suits however playing on dims looks doomed|pg||
nt|mcphee: why|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D Q is ok|pg||
nt|haans: may make|pg||
nt|haans: @HK a joker|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this would be in jeopardy if spade queen not falling|pg||
pc|d2|nt|asig: It looks as if 9 tricks is the limit in hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that diamonds don't break 3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you play strong club then use your system tools to investigate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have to rebid 1@H forcing, if available|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: because defence can come to 3heqrts a dim and two bullets|pg||
nt|mcphee: although still needs to develop other tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: this line is going to work even better|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: i think east perhaps with her two doubles had bid here values and that the fourth heart was optinmistic|pg||
nt|haans: yes worsed for sweden|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: south covers dims set up hearts set up no  fast ntry six tricks for defence|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a trumph return is better |pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h|pg||

nt|m_niemi: @s4= @d-signal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what discards are they using, lavinthal?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Roman|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: most headmaster can either by the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|cenglund:  Now it's only about fighting for overtricks|pg||
nt|talion: now ahonen has double stopper in hearts. if danielsdot had lead high heart, then ahonen could have taken only one heart trick|pg||
nt|talion: but with no side entry, low heart lead seems reasonable|pg||
nt|asig: One loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence may put pressure when aqce and another club is played if north ducks|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c7|pc|h5|nt|cenglund:  8 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is one reason why roland would want to be in it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcphee: 2-2 @D or 3-1 split onside it is also a make|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a small without hesitation...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well requires cool courage|pg||
nt|asig: maybe Christiansen should have tested spades first|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not muck to loose compared with the win|pg||
nt|asig: then he would know that N had the @cK for his opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: much....|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is that east must ensure that there are enough spades to take care of the clubs should any mishaps aoccur |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Or @sK!|pg||
nt|asig: He would know, had he played spades first|pg||
nt|m_niemi: easy to defend now|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They might play 2NT D in the open room if N opens weak two |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt it would be doubled|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: is this a tank or a tech hitch?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: however in 6 maybe west would double for the spade lead- admittedly risky pso probably would roll in|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|xenya: now decalraer has time to set up a @H for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: excatly the reason why roland would want to be in it well above his 12.85 recurring pwerent requitrement|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: not so clear to dble for @S lead, I know I would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: i garee i wouldnt either|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would expect a redouble and make|pg||
nt|lestergold: still all very academical|pg||
nt|lestergold: unles it gets bid in open|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s6|nt|kastan88: IMO nothing problem with strong pass systems on high-level tournaments, problems on club level only. Every restriction only stopping development of bidding|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c8|pg||
nt|cenglund:  It was a wrong guess|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2s already probably too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h by n/s isnt guaranteed either|pg||
nt|asig: No|pg||
nt|asig: 5 apparent losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence  a spade a heart  2 clubs and a dim to lose|pg||
nt|haans: invite spade support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt must be a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a trappy hand for n/s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D openeron the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: for weak to bid 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is another example of inadequate fighting ofr the part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: sensible idea to me also Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i can see how this made|pg||
nt|asig: Win the ace, to rounds of trumps an another diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ruffs with his mony and then fourth dim takes care of club an d a club is ruffed in dummy! what an extraordinary position|pg||
nt|asig: *two|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a perfectly normal defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Not among the best 3NTs I have seen|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: u do not win letting vul opps play in 2 of a minor normally|pg||

pc|s3|nt|cenglund:  If they lead 3rd and 5th best Q would have been a better card|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|pelu: in 3. seat vuln: 1Nt = 15-17, so N had to open 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: with spades and dims both breaking 3/3 this should make|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 7 tricks - and a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: we've got our first comparison -- let's hope it will continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie but imagine you were in club slam and recieved a heart lead - you would not be a very happer sapper|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: your only entry to dummy under attack immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it i think even roland would baulk at this slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: life can be mean, i have this E hand and partner opens slam is going to be hard to avoid:)|pg||
nt|asig: Yes, even if W finds an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the lead helps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: easy to duck and then only one club  trick for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a horrible choice for east now|pg||
nt|haans: had been much harder to bid if sylvan first passed|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|xenya: nicely done by NS|pg||

nt|lestergold: ionically a heart lead may have been threatening|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4N simply does not do the hand any justice|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: 29 combined points without a grat trump fit why have you got to be in slam?|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: complain when he misses something, not before|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = non forcing|pg||

mb|d|nt|haans: 2@S or 3@H????????|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  They must strike it out|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: from "wrong" hand - 6NT making|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: he did, at some point|pg||
nt|jakow: Avery tricky 3NT to bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well perhaps she was right to go up: it was the setting trick |pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 5 level many play that A denies K|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so declarer missguessed the @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H seems damp too surely a clear pass assuming double was penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  This board is no good for a strong club opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably would fail in practice buut not a bad contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: here lebensohl is often used|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n the safe and obvious spot|pg||

nt|mcphee: yes, very awkward bidding problem for N |pg||
nt|haans: suprise passing???????|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cenglund:  Slam depends on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: hand is too good to bid only 2n partner would pass with two many hads where 3n was laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happesn this isnt one of them |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

pc|c2|nt|asig: No problems here making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: when east sees dummy hell be regretting the lead but sighing with relief when he find sthat declarer has a stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make on the dim position|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|kastan88: but what else here to open, if 1@C means  all hands 15+? you can't open other way|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Slam is slightly over 50%, since Q singelton off-side makes as well|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|nt|pelu: from the West-hand 6NT sh be as good as 6@Cs (also in CR)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have thought east hand worth an upgrade to 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: well done Rimstedt and Sjöberg. Deserved swing|pg||

mb|2D|an|8-11p. 5+!D|nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 12-16 unbal or 15-17 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: 2@d = 8-11 5+ @d unbal|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no M|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so like 2@d opening|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the kind of hand where the 1@C can potentially cause problems|pg||
mb|2N|an|5+!H|nt|pelu: 1NT= 13-15(16)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: perhaps N sould consider raising 1N|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcphee: this is a rather solid 14 she holds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mcphee: S had a hard choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: normally 1NT response indicates a better hand than this poor 6 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im in favour of aggressive take out doubles but with north's minimum bad spade suit an stiff diamond, i would not make this bid here very dangerous vul aginsty not|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would not dble as N either|pg||
nt|kastan88: in this part of Earth (East europa) we play that mostly 6..10, so I can't see reason to raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: let pard balance if east passes also much too much in heasrts|pg||
nt|lestergold: zip outside hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: 8-11, 7-10 range is more in tune here in NA|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like 8-11 a lot|pg||
nt|mcphee: however I make ligth t/o dble with the right shapes|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the contract|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry i didnt see the first triick was distracted bgy breakfast appearing|pg||
nt|mcphee: 9@D lead the K winning onm table|pg||
nt|mcphee: and poor S wants to leave the room now!|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1N she asks, why did I bid so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: so do i please ignore my comments i took my eye off te ball dues to  PLATE OF SAUSAGES EGGS AND CHIPS APPEARING|pg||
nt|mcphee: no kippers?|pg||
nt|lestergold: provided by my der bridge widow|pg||

nt|ralfwil: @d A and @dK and crossruff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: profitable save if he can get out for -3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: this is a silly contract and clearly the system has a serious flaw|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the clubs both offside and the spade losers needing to be ruffed not laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get diamond right|pg||
nt|roswolf: trick 1 was interesting though|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N was too aggressive in this board|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I think it's just bad judgement|pg||
nt|m_niemi: against 8-11 that is not so great hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: S can get a @H ruff, but it's still 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: the lead gives a @H-ruff - but cost a @C-trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: j of spades on tabel rather than another dim|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: initial trump lead would have meant down 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannt afford any more club finesses|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|xenya: but, of course, S switches to a trump, which means -4 |pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|xenya: S plays a @H, if W discards a@D, S cashes @DK and plays another @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel 6d looks v good|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@C must have been transfer 4@C natural|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: wow aggressive!! both of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lucky no double|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a hopeless spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: may even make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course every finesse in sight works|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: will require a defence worthy of that aginst the israelie raid on entebbe|pg||
nt|lestergold: and yes it may happen|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: 2@S is a super accept but W is not interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: but plenty of play even on a less favouravle layout|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As the cards lie  - yes, but 2 of 3 finesses is needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: its better than that Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: because played bu south with the spade protected the fourth heart will take care of possibloe spade loser so whenever club finesse is right its a very good contract and has chances ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when clubs finess is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland mandatory and porbably in the region of upwards of 50% in any case|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 16+, 1@d = 0-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: clubs ruff beat it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: her 2N was just a further transfer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: plus all the possible helpful leads too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @d in on N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 is makeable, though maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: the standing it 30-0 + board 20 where Denmark can loose many IMPs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cenglund:  3NT would have been cold, but this is more difficult, but should make on good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like a very resonable spot to this bozo|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart suit is blocked now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: on a @c lead the slam is cold|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

nt|lestergold: i do against weak defender|pg||
nt|mcphee: vul I think it is imperative you reach game|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: but its absoutely a dreadful contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 4-1 trumps makes it hard|pg||
nt|lestergold: favourable spade position dims 3/3 fav lead etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: and still work to do|pg||
nt|mcphee: even with a @C lead this is not so horrid, 3-3 @D comes in as well|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Oops!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a poor 4/4 trump fit misfitting side suit combs and a shotage f high card points- its a part score hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|mcphee: although 3@H is aggressive, if the S hands values are outside of @S it is not so bad|pg||

nt|mcphee: wonder what would have happened over 5@D?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@D is creating horrors for N as it is:)|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|haans: good bidding by sweden|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: but why save if you think it might be going off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kastan88: this 1@C= 16+ unbal or 15+= bal, thats why stopped in 2NT only|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N would be more comfortable here|pg||
nt|kastan88: their 1NT=12...14|pg||
nt|kastan88: and of course good afternoon Martin :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems he needs to take the right view in @Cs to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he will have to find the club jack just to make|pg||

nt|lestergold: well e/w get the mps again|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: 5d is only a spade pip short of making!|pg||
nt|lestergold: swop 7 and 9 of spades an 5 is frigid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this was not the best return|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course imps not so many |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh more now a spade trick has been binned|pg||

pc|hT|nt|lestergold: at mps it is abetter proposiotn to save|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: however if 4@D is weak, the E hand has ZERO defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: match points off the scale to get away with one down|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S knew N has max 2@h so easy duck|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|haans: we have a delay now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: looks like +1 to Fin|pg||

Anyway, the Icelanders seem to be playing some kind of Precision, stron 1@c with 5c M's|pg||
nt|pelu: the @Hs very bad for decl, but there are 9 tricks to take|pg||
pc|s4|nt|plateos: The sequence was planned to be a sort of puppet, but 3Nt denied M's|pg||

nt|mcphee: and the K@H is not worth a hill of beans|pg||

nt|lestergold: howeevr flat as i see denmark overboard in open ... undertsndably|pg||
nt|haans: :) thank you and bye :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator Anni. Great Job! Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Walter, Matti and Christer for ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: their wit and perceptive comments. Finally, our appreciation to the Nordic and Finnish Bridge Unions for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Kari Patana, Pauli Nieminen and Lea ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Seestelä have been instrumental in setting up a great show.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nice defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anni was so good, she was invisible|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back. Let's keep our fingers crossed. The operators have a very poor connection|pg||
nt|lestergold: you rarely find that people fins saves of 1100 against 143o vul slams|pg||
nt|mcphee: no brainer to save at these colors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had tried a X as S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Iceland scored +3 board 26, 1NTX-1, this table 2@h=|pg||

nt|m_niemi: N aqqressive at the last moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pelu: Long way up to Finland :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 2@H - I cant :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjöberg are still juniors I believe. Early 20's? Someone in the audience may be able to message me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sandra 22, Emma 24|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and rather few IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again - can u defeat 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Anni and she is having a hard time. Please bear with her|pg||
nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are stuck again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|pelu: Vladimir - I take @D 10 discard 2@Cs ruff a @S and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes that's true -- you need to play a small @D early|pg||
nt|pelu: are we still waiting for the lead?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: makes a lot more sense over artificial 1@C than natural 1@S to preempt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  After all that fruitful chickening Koistinen had to break the line|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2+2+3+2=9, any problems?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not really, but declarer doesn't know the location of the K|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Furthermore, diamonds may be 4-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 36 imps = 23-7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finns have played very well in both tables|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if 16 boards...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 15 boards/match now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 more to Fin, Salomaa run 4 rounds of @h to make 4@s with 6-1 fit|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The only snag on Finnish scoreboard is 3NT -1 on this board|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room was @s lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: has declarer gone to sleep here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed 3nt was makeable even after spade lead|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer ducked 2nd @d, so spades were cleared, -1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: dec played S to have @dQJxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same potential problem here|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I wonder how they managed to go down in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still he cant make till he plays to trick 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade, spade, diamond, diamond to jack, and spade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: in mps there is a lot more to gain at imps you may save a few but what a disaster if you make a big sac and they cant make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom at this level |pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: NS will bid game here -- 3N or 4@H?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not a very good decision|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: another battle of communications and not helping declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@H looks hopeless, but this has a practical chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i cant see a defense|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no second club trick and no way to make|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: but there it seems overtaking for spade lead is best for defense|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: unlucky 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: but flat|pg||
nt|kastan88: this is last brd, ty all and cu evening again|pg||
nt|mcphee: needed to play 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @c had given a chance|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: yes not easy bidding competition hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|m_niemi: even +1 with endplay|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now can actually make an overtrick|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c4|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|mcphee: i suppose the NT rebid was required to show 15-17|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|m_niemi: @hK and W knows all cards|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard luck|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|xenya: yes, that would have been best -- still declarer can prevail by just covering W's spade |pg||
nt|kastan88: I don't want to sit on East chair this moment|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s7|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
