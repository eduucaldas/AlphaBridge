nt|joest: lead a diamond up or a club up|pg||

pc|s7|nt|brgpro: run 7@s and N has to come down to 3@h and @c Kx, then he can play 4 rounds of @h to throw N in|pg||

nt|jcwla: Probably Rosner's choice not to compete on to 3@H with four trumps will earn a couple imps.|pg||
nt|daman: the others will be here around 4 or 5|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@S on 35 came home in the OR so that's 6 to Beatty.|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: p://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224 for the tournament website and the complicated format|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jcwla: Whew.|pg||
mb|p|nt|clarsen: 1h is a transfer i presume|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: whoops, that didn't come out well|pg||
nt|joest: double here brings both majors into play and avoids the danger of a direct 1NT overcall at unfavorable opposite a passed hand|pg||

nt|daman: be that as it may, he now has to declare|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|joest: unfortunately double also brings diamonds into the picture  :)|pg||
nt|clarsen: now we see the downside to the double|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|joest: Thank you partner! |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, 2@h or 3@c seems best for EW, but theres not much hope of finding that|pg||
nt|joest: well west MIGHT reason to yank to 2NT in which case east pulls to 3@c but that's good guessing|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|mtvesuvius: that's tough though...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|joest: if they could guess that well they would have been in 6@s on the last hand :)|pg||
nt|daman: eliminating the shrapnel|pg||
nt|jcwla: The OR auction on 36 went 1@H-3@D overcall-3@H, and looks to be making, so as predicted likely 2 to McKellar.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|clarsen: im not sure this is best way to play this hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think it's best just to play trumps, but trying to ruff spades in hand is appealing also|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|joest: you don't hve lots of entries to ruff spades|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcwla: So the actual score through the first 6 comparisons (31-36) is Beatty 68, McKellar 56.|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c is 10+ no 4CM, possible 3C or longer dia |pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jcwla: On 39 in the OR, South did not bid 2@S over 2@H, and West jumped to 4@H over 2@H and is playing there.|pg||

nt|clarsen: what will pepsi lead|pg||
nt|joest: diamond ten?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Tough lead for him, but I think the 3@c isn't too bad|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4th best from longest suit...|pg||
nt|joest: declarer -- given an eternity has nine tricks but I think they get five first|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Attitude leads I think according to their SSF|pg||
nt|jcwla: They are panicking about time with 2 minutes remaining in the OR.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 44, the OR also stopped on a dime in 3@S so that should be a push.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A @D trick went away on a @C with a trump lead out in 44, so 1 to Beatty.|pg||
nt|jcwla: WOW!|pg||
nt|jcwla: West in the OR made a very weird responsive-ish double with the 7-heart hand on 45, then PASSED partner's 2@S rebid...|pg||
nt|jcwla: So despite the confusion about the meaning of 4@H in here, Beatty will retake the lead heading into the fourth and final segment.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't know if the time pressure got to Lamprey, but there may be plenty of time to regret that sequence after the match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some thought that the double by W was a xfr to @H's, but in any case the wires got crossed.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Crazy close with 15 to go.  Thanks again to all and for now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
