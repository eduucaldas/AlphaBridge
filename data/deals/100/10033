mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: This may sound like a contradiction, but only an expert player would go 3 down. His line was correct at IMPs|pg||
nt|haans: ReHi all welcome Ladies Denmark-Sweden closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Uh oh...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|konow:  wow both players overcalled 2S here|pg||
nt|haans: bridge have not been boring|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the other room Christiansen transferred into diamonds and raised. He found Auken with useless cards, really|pg||
nt|konow:  Wow, S never passes a forcing bid :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: quite as a spec pointed he could play the Q of @h playing against 3361 distribution but I thing he would lead @d then|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easy 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: no gazzili called witsch by swedish players|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D gf is strong|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|haans: strong = 15 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@C natural or strong|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: This is a contract withour 'arme og ben' as a Dane would say|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: impossible contract unless K of @d second on side|pg||
nt|konow:  and 5 top loosers|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: super max by East: 2@C = 10-15, 6 card @C or 5+ 4M|pg||
nt|Walddk2: right, which means that declarer often escapes for less than he ought to have|pg||
nt|konow:  H shift on the way|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: sorry i can project how many down the declarer will be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should be rather, we can't predict what will happen|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: let us be generous  to him and say 4|pg||
nt|konow:  E will cash out when partner has the heart K|pg||
nt|pelu: a H back now loks normal - in hope to find K or !Q (and misguess)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our matches in round 2 will be Norway v Iceland (open) and Denmark v Sweden (women). In around 1 hour and 25 minutes|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: led by over 20 is harsh for iceland   who could bid 6 NT and make 3 NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: understand nothing|pg||
nt|jcwla: I am guessing operator just put in an auction due to VG issues?|pg||
nt|haans: may b|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|konow:  damm!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The first trick vanished for the defence, but you must understand Askgaard. He obviously fears that diamonds are running, so he was looking for 5 top tricks first|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|lebridgeur: he did not look for long as he had them !|pg||
nt|jcwla: A common "natural" auction would be 1@S-1NTF-2@C-2NT-3@H-3NT.|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|haans: now time to claim|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: misfit to @D - and a weak hand - I lika the way he has bid|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|haans: playing on = never give up|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: strange that N gave up|pg||
