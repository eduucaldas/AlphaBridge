nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: a cold 4@S for EW here -- they just need to bid it|pg||
nt|jjsb: hello all |pg||
nt|othered1: Here EW have 32 HCP and 12 tricks in NT, as the cards lie.  6@C also looks good |pg||
mb|3N|nt|kamras: transfer|pg||
nt|prof 1: hi all|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @hs north?|pg||
nt|xenya: a partial for starters|pg||
nt|xenya: is it a weak NT or strong?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 15-17 seems to fit the bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the @H fit found thix should propel  them to game |pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @C by S most likely |pg||
nt|hantveit: The bidding will probably stop very fast|pg||
nt|xenya: i think they will|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 15-17 I think|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly matters here|pg||
nt|jjsb: kinda surprising we are just playing 1@h here |pg||
pc|s2|nt|snorris: well..|pg||
nt|xenya: but the uaction might be interesting with all those misfits|pg||
nt|april7: NS might compete to 3@C making even 4|pg||
nt|xenya: oh it does|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the key to 6@C is that you can take a ruff (a spade) in the short trump hand |pg||

nt|snorris: well..e-w are endplayed all the time more or less|pg||

pc|s9|nt|enachou: with @h sure :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes, a @c would have been a better lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hantveit: Difficult for EW to get 6 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|werge: UPS...|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer would have been in trouble if trumps were 4-1  |pg||

nt|mariner1: still I would not have found the DBL in S|pg||

mb|1S|nt|werge: Not my cup of tee, such a suit-quality for a weak two - and now 2 @H will not be the contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slightly premature claim for 11 though.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hussein2: Would everyone consider wk 2 opening E hand? Looks light to me although it is on a favarobale vuln.|pg||
nt|prof 1: i think 3@d ppp|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but EW rate to win the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 1N here?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|werge: Why let the opponents go down, if you can manage to do it yourself...|pg||
nt|prof 1: i wonder who is thinking|pg||
nt|raghavan: Trend of boards in this set may be more part scores than games & slams|pg||
nt|snorris: a conservative pass in s|pg||
nt|xenya: not now maybe|pg||
nt|enachou: there 1sa is the contract on NS but impossible to play 1sa when you play 1sa forcing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|abdoucha: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: West's action may depend on style.  Borderline hand with support. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4333 shape is unappetising|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: max:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: looking for trick 7|pg||
nt|othered1: common for 2N to show limit raise (or more).  As  before, right in trump length and high cards, but not in shape.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello again |pg||
nt|sybarra: and she made 6 @H well done |pg||
nt|werge: Nobody|pg||
nt|hussein2: Can this 3@d make? Doesn't look bad on 10@s lead. W might get endplayed |pg||
nt|sybarra: may need to play ace and a @D |pg||
nt|werge: In practice you are 1 down in 3 @D|pg||
nt|prof 1: -1 at least|pg||
nt|hussein2: If E did not exit with @h, her p will get endplayed!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: I would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree Snorri, it seems like a minor fight, but 3spades NS is not a bad contract either|pg||
nt|andyv:  can it ever be right to balance with 1@d in these situations?|pg||
nt|xenya: a fairly routine 4@H for NS -- but also a fine save for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: north may come to regret her reponse here|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless she drops the auction right now|pg||
nt|april7: N should pass otherwise NS ends up in an unmakable game contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzsb:  A live vugraph broadcast has just started. 5th African Zone Championship RR 02 / Open M 04.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bjurn: 2@H är naturligt men med @C-håll skulle jag tro|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 2 hj alerteras antagligen för att det visar håll i kl|pg||
nt|minnie lee: lokks like 2@d. N has no bid because of the @h bid in W|pg||
nt|hantveit: Agree, think 1spade is an obvious bid for me also, too difficult to bid it later.|pg||
nt|snorris: would be otherwise if s bid @s first time|pg||
nt|xenya: yes it can it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't do justice to his hand|pg||
nt|xenya: well E is there...|pg||
nt|frankaus: that say 4@H by opps  is a transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: S's hand to strong for 1@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@S and back @S 7th trick|pg||
nt|othered1: North's double is likely specific over the raise.  Just not sure what it implies|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S possible by East - cut out the whole of the three level|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|werge: Cover...|pg||
nt|andyv:  how about a simple dbl over 1@d?|pg||
nt|frankaus: trafic light say green|pg||
nt|lestergold: south knew when to underbid her hand!!!|pg||
nt|april7: might be angry about teh pqass by NS but after seeing the dummy.....|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, if west guaranteed 4-card support|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tjolpe:  Det stÃ¤mmer|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 Clubs for NS seems better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead will now make a extyar lub for a heart discard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some pairs play transfers after 1@H/@S - double. Here, 2@H would show a good raise to 2@S.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and a single raise to 2@S would show a not good raise to 2@S |pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: you make a most natural lead from KQ10x and, of course, it costs a trick -- always happens to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: E exiting a @D hoping NS do something else to help|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: 2 @D must must multi, including a big bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just guess I am afraid since I do not have their conv. cards |pg||
nt|xenya: the key feature here is the double fits for both sides |pg||

nt|tjolpe:  Man kan gÃ¥ bet om man tar tvÃ¥ ronder trumf och misslyckas i sÃ¥vÃ¤l spader som ruter.|pg||
nt|xenya: but E opted to sarifice ven without knowing that|pg||
nt|frankaus: the light 1@S overcall has done the trick here|pg||
nt|xenya: *even|pg||
nt|enachou: strange lead from N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and once y lead 4th best y play in to AJ doubleton:) tough|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like this comes up one short, as south has plenty of out cards before having to break @H himself.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, Norht could compete with 2N (usually, two places to play) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 3@C is quite playable NS|pg||

nt|minnie lee: right but S passed with his @s|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|xenya: all woiuld have been easy for EW had E opened 1N -- but it looks like they are playing a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all. Sorry for being late.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashid|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Rashid|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can get 2 club ruffs|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|enachou: @h and @c ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: E knows W is short @H and with a stiff @D  the save is quite clear after the @S overcall|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: east's 8 of spades will come into its own|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: Ils ont filé le coup, like the french say|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: sure club 10 because you can see cards |pg||

nt|hussein2: Lucky Nessrine! |pg||
nt|sybarra: just any high card in dummy pls |pg||
nt|hussein2: She will play the Q|pg||
nt|prof 1: no it is the worst return but the only chance to avoid the end play|pg||
nt|werge: One good thing to be said abaout Easts defence - she did not use the information, Wests hesitation in secend round of @D had given!!!|pg||
nt|prof 1: she has the J  u dont see|pg||
nt|sybarra: are they playing with screens?   I would assume so |pg||
nt|werge: But screens do not eliminate hesitation during PLAY|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|pelu: she forgot to count her tricks - had to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello peter |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes needed one ruff in hand |pg||
nt|pelu: hi Sherley|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hussein2: WD Hussein :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
nt|andyv:  if playing a strong club, doesn't dbl show a 17-19 NT hand in this situation?|pg||
nt|enachou: S can't guess that K@c is a singleton|pg||
nt|enachou: it's not good to lead a K singleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: malani should get the credit for this swing should it not be replicated in the CR|pg||
nt|xenya: well actually you don't need any ruffs here to set it 2 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: south would have been better sticking to @S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: but the @C's are foing to come home |pg||
nt|werge: East defence: TOO fast|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@D or gone|pg||
nt|xenya: S knows everything by know and should cash @DK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|april7: no use ducking on generalprinciples|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can't control the hand |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|mariner1: yes should be easy to see K@D... was not though|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: i think pass would show that|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: @C now to set up the suit -- fror 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: another club now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: well played bu south|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: nice defense|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: what does she think?  someone throwing away K of @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  i would think pass is 1 round force with no clear direction (i.e. no @d stopper)|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, E just might have upgraded his hand, playing a natural system|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: would earn all the match points for sure |pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|xenya: please ignore all that rubbish about strong club i said|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score available here|pg||
nt|frankaus: openings not what they used to be either will N open ?|pg||
nt|enachou: i think N think opening 2 or 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w combined 25 but the duplication adn unkind layout looks like any game bid is doomed|pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone gets too aggressive here is in the soup|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score hand more of Gulash type-can be swing board|pg||
nt|othered1: Slam is just about good enough here, depending on a favorable lead or the @CA onside|pg||
mb|2N|nt|arvidsson: 1 bricka som kan skapa lite imp NS har en bra zon offring i 5kl mot 4hj|pg||
nt|werge: A grown-up NT!|pg||

mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  Anders, vet jag inte, kanske 10-11|pg||
nt|xenya: of course 1@C was natural|pg||
nt|frankaus: if N opens will E X for T/O and will W leave it in? |pg||
nt|enachou: 2@h there is bicolor @h and minor 54+ weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s being the obvious candidate|pg||

nt|othered1: I was looking at NT.  It's early here.|pg||

mb|3C|nt|xenya: N more likely i think -- but we shall see|pg||

nt|andyv:  very borderline 4th seat opener|pg||
nt|xenya: to say the least|pg||
nt|frankaus: now on the way to 3@C then ?|pg||
nt|xenya: naturally S tries to find N's other suit|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 3@S!|pg||
nt|xenya: i expect to see something like 4N from N at some point|pg||

nt|mariner1: well W might push himself too high|pg||

nt|minnie lee: S won't hold 3NT with his @d position|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am not a fan of this treatment|pg||
mb|4D|nt|arvidsson: kanske eframsson bjuder 5 hj?|pg||
nt|timmy5: doesnt need heart split actually to win 4h|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's is ok for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but my pard may still bid 2 @S with 6 of them |pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt I say "wait and see"|pg||
nt|sybarra: W knows where the high cards are |pg||
nt|andyv:  -200 or -300 very possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: can N pass now?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: mind you if south leads singleton diamond (a poor choice with qjx trumps) it could let the game thru|pg||
nt|april7: its close to a mirror hand and if EW reach 4 @S E can't make it .Depends on @D play whether 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT must have been a 3 card @S raise it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: S had a DBL to me|pg||
nt|xenya: both 4@H and pass by S are somewhat mysterious |pg||
nt|yo_yo: if only to shut north up|pg||
nt|enachou: nice lead from Kchaou|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but NS have not been on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|daman: whatever happened to drury?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont see point as i said|pg||
nt|april7: better than @D singleton, no spare trump|pg||
nt|xenya: ah there comes 4N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to save worst result S should have DBL..ED.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has an impressive array of controls|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pelu: playing WJS (weak 2@S/2@H) over 1@C N would bid 2@S |pg||
nt|lestergold: only when you find pard with two quick entries and get two ruffs would this work|pg||
nt|xenya: they have no red cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: en straf om han gissar spadern, och det gör han. 6 IMP till Everfresh|pg||
nt|minnie lee: well, I'm wrong|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not pass 3nt with souths hand. |pg||
nt|frankaus: i guess N happy for 50's even quite a few of them|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Yes|pg||
mb|5S|nt|timmy5: why not|pg||
nt|hantveit: If heart is not breaking you are gone, you have more tricks in 4H|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 tricks in NT, 5 tricks in H|pg||
nt|timmy5: his partner told him i have a good holding in diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: also i'm puzzled by W's 1N (instead of 1@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hardly N has found the best lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT GF with 4+ hearts|pg||
mb|6H|nt|xenya: oh W has got one|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the phantom save|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: efter att fått in kl A på E är gissning ganska enkel|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get messy |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minnie lee: I wouldn't either, but that's what makes bridge: you've got to trust youor partner|pg||

nt|minnie lee: when you have a bi-colour hand, bid it! I think N should have bid 2@d|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes 2D|pg||
nt|raghavan: even now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C shows a feature and is encouraging|pg||
nt|enachou: a switch for tunisia now they are playing 4@h on board2 on the OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|snorris: south thinks there are no @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: tror ni att FI kommer offra sig mot 4@H? Vad är ni rädda för?|pg||
nt|pelu: but N is not sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would bid 2 @H but not sure what 2 @D is |pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S sh show extra values and fit for @H???|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue |pg||
nt|sybarra: jx doesnt look like a fit |pg||
nt|raghavan: 4D|pg||
nt|april7: @C @C and @D return, 1 off|pg||
nt|april7: only though if W gives E the @D ruff|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hantveit: I like 2 clubs first, then 3diamonds later, showing 5 clubs and 4 diamonds. No need to rush the bidding with a strong hand where you can bid NT at any time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh|pg||
nt|timmy5: it really feels bad to play 3nt -1 when u have a slam that makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W was stuck... probably should have bid 1@s and hope pd had five|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w need totake their 5 tricks quickly or they wont get em|pg||

nt|werge: East has a clear-cut PASS to 2 @D - as I see it!|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree hans |pg||
nt|sybarra: pass and hope for the best |pg||
nt|werge: Would we bid 1 @H instead of 2 @C?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|arvidsson: 4nt var nog ett alltför optimistiskt bud|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C  1-4|pg||

nt|minnie lee: not even good bips in @s for that kind of bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well bid by West|pg||
nt|mariner1: E should note that W did not NEG DBL 1@S so he can't have long @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Est|pg||
nt|yo_yo: east even|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E did indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: Det är ju Syd själv som bjuder tokigt. Om partnern går ner efter 4@C ska man inte till slam|pg||
nt|arvidsson: en förhandspassaf N bjuder nog kontroll med rätt honnörer|pg||
nt|frankaus: just 2 aces to lose here|pg||
nt|mariner1: play should be quick|pg||
nt|abdoucha: lakhdhar very agressive with 4@h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|arvidsson: efter kl ut är det en enkel match|pg||
nt|hantveit: Vest has to be awake and put up his club K if south plays low clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@H and a@C for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: It´s more flexible|pg||
nt|sybarra: true it is |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: -1 on the placement of cards|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjurn: även med @SA @DA ist.f. kungarna är det tveksamt att gå vidare mot slam|pg||
nt|enachou: yes he is a very agressive player|pg||
pc|dT|nt|arvidsson: framförallt då det är morath som dubblar, kan man räkna in AQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: however....you do have 6  @C|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|snorris: better to play king of @d|pg||
nt|hantveit: good, club t in return...|pg||
nt|april7: should play small @C on ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: now this is a suit pref situation- surely east should confirm she want a dim continuation|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever they play st or udca or whatever it should be clear|pg||
nt|april7: to late to beat it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 clubs looked like an encouraging card to me|pg||
nt|daman: can't be done|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: but in argument FOR 1 ht,   is how raggy the suits are|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|werge: Yes, but partner can describe the hand better this way |pg||
nt|snorris: takes a singel queen|pg||
nt|hantveit: nice|pg||

pc|sT|nt|sybarra: http://www.egypt-bridge.org/Zone%2009.asp|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand for E/W not to get a minus score.|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|werge: Anyway - should be one down for 100|pg||

nt|snorris: here|pg||
nt|xenya: -3?|pg||

nt|xenya: something starnge has happened in the play here -- why didn't N pitch the @S loser?|pg||
nt|april7: now we have a grand!|pg||
nt|daman: the grand salami|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will do well to bid it with confidence we can count 13 top tricks but they have to count them in the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have excellent save in 7h if they are allowed to play there|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S  3 or 4@D or only 2 and if NS finds their good fit in @C and the void in @H the grand is bidable|pg||
nt|lestergold: or 7d for that matter|pg||
nt|april7: 7@D might push NS to 7@S!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has all the potential for a brief but exciting auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has a difficult decision as to what to open|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 4s|pg||
nt|april7: without oponents bidding its easy:1@S 2@C 4@H and so on|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Avram but at this vulnerability east would be  in even over a 4s openere|pg||
nt|daman: this is a baby grand   not getting there would be cause to revamp your bidding system|pg||
nt|lestergold: a baby gfrand George with no interference yes|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S X is also possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the baby might grow into a stroppy teenager|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@S here EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west didnt bid his full value imo|pg||
mb|1N|nt|raghavan: He will open 1D|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: teoretiskt, ja|pg||
nt|werge: That was what West ought to have played...|pg||
nt|werge: Here 140 is a cood score for E/W|pg||

nt|timmy5: 2d for majors|pg||
nt|snorris: 6@ds also ok|pg||
nt|hantveit: if 2 shows both major, I think I would prefer 4 spades here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d not enuf!!|pg||
nt|daman: will get there now   3@C by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 5d?|pg||
nt|daman: then 5NT|pg||
nt|daman: to make sure|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hantveit: But can be a bit hard to give up the 3nt so early|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||

nt|daman: sfar's first name is Napoleon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Egypt playing extremely well and getting some help also|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5@d looks like a possible sac against 4@h, since there is no entry to South, which would be needed for 4 down.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: nexi 12 IMP for Egypt from the 4@H misplayed - 3NT making in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: You are welcome to play with me - but please know, that I do NOT bid 2 @D...|pg||
nt|sybarra: website but they are not posting results that I can find |pg||
nt|hantveit: I prefer to give as much information I can to my partner, look how difficult it is now for North. |pg||
nt|hantveit: 4 hearts would make things very easy for North.|pg||
nt|timmy5: but 6sp is not bad at all|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 5spades now, and they might still find 6D|pg||
nt|minnie lee: 6@c would help alot|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, 6spades do not look too bad. -3 is it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have th eright idea but not taking up enough space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S from Nabil?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: take a look at the venue! |pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S was weak|pg||
nt|mariner1: E can't hold what I need for slam and I want to be in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 2 sp eller x?|pg||
nt|raghavan: How to enter Yousry hand in 5S|pg||
nt|hantveit: there is the pass...|pg||
nt|hantveit: With single heart, spade ace, and club ace and king there should be possible for north to bid 6d now|pg||
nt|minnie lee: last hand a pass on 3NT and now no help to play a grzat contract...either in @c or @d|pg||
nt|raghavan: Vul is a fear|pg||
nt|snorris: a  better bid in north was 5@cs instead of 5 @ds|pg||
nt|minnie lee: the best bid was 2@h|pg||
nt|snorris: then south would bid 6 |pg||
nt|timmy5: this delay might prevent east west from bidding 6spds|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would not reveal my hand  by bidding C|pg||
nt|timmy5: if N-S bid 6ds|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, only 6 losers and a good 5 card suit, so 5 clubs is a good bid. But the negative is a little bit weak trumph|pg||
nt|xenya: excellen slam here -- think they'll get there|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H slam here|pg||
nt|daman: has to bid 7 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north lost the plot in this auction|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT is so simple|pg||
nt|daman: my mother would bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east west may get awy with a save in 7h doubled if tghey do they will make a massive profit|pg||
nt|april7: whay 3 @S? if the @C are rigid then 13 tricks in @C so 5NT was best forN|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N is brave|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice call by W here|pg||
nt|xenya: also purposeless i think|pg||

nt|mariner1: well he might be trying to generate a swing,,,,,,, being behind|pg||

nt|rnmalik: in case of some values with this is a ploy for a scrafice against 4@S|pg||

nt|enachou: 2@d there is forcing game with @d|pg||

nt|daman: EW will have a hard time explaining this to their team|pg||

pc|c3|nt|werge: After 4 boards, 31 IMP´s at stake|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S was a real reach imo  |pg||

nt|hussein2: seeking some cool air :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and a nice sequence|pg||
nt|rnmalik: reasonable contract and should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the trouble with bidding 4@H, partner gets carried away|pg||

pc|d4|nt|kamras: Visst Björn, men kanske inte Hx. 2NT kanske överdriver rutern. Svår avvägning mellan dessa tre bud|pg||
nt|sybarra: the sequence of pulling to 4 @C should make @C slam easy to bid  |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||

nt|geot: Dont know about 3@D in this position, but most would play it as splinter. It is common to play diamond as a bid suit even ag Precision 1@D. |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with 1S, especially over a nebulous 1D|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass|pg||
nt|daman: nothing but junk|pg||

nt|lestergold: its hard for east to know they can make 7 i sympathise but i think east should have done a bit more jumping in the bidding|pg||
nt|baldjean: Nice 6@h here. Ultrastrong West hand.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did South ever show his six clubs?|pg||
nt|frm: No!|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N making 5 on board 1 cost east only 1 imp, as the open room could get only to 5N!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|arvidsson: 3hj verkar obetbart|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 4 hj har väldigt goda chanser|pg||

nt|timmy5: west is Ahmed Youssry and East is sherief Noshy both played in several juniors world championships|pg||
nt|minnie lee: an example of bad communication here...afetr 2@d I would bid 2@h in S or alternatively after 4@s, I would bid 5@c in N|pg||
nt|xenya: another slam hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make4 @H I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they get there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 2@D?|pg||
nt|bjurn: kort @D med öppningsstyrka kanske|pg||
nt|arvidsson: öppningshand med 0-1 ruter|pg||

nt|rnmalik: no CA+HK+AS|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes I raise to 2@H with W here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with Q@H lead some play will be required |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Eddy Munteanu|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four-suit transfers would work well there. 1N-2@S (clubs)-2N/3@C -3@H-3N knowing of not much fit   |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @C is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it if they were not prepared to bid 7  in the first place what made them so confident to bid it given a second chance what was the new info?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D  p 1@H-p- 1@S -1NT |pg||

nt|edmunte1: hello everyone|pg||

nt|edmunte1: hello Jeanine :)|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall might have kept EW out of their 8-card fit.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: not many safe contracts on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: tobbe börjar med AK i spader om kontraktet står kvar?|pg||
nt|bjurn: nu hamnade @Sn på hel hand|pg||
nt|bjurn: fel hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S suit may come into play now|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1s is ugly and dangerous|pg||
nt|daman: the 7@H bid on the last only cost EW 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: or 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 5@C good save here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamras: Vid andra bordet Återbjöd Nord 2Sp i stället för 2Hj, som han kanske inte tyckte han hade kort till. Men då tycker jag man hellre passar på 2Ru|pg||
nt|baldjean: This 6@h should be reached.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: seems easy after 2@c now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the problem for West is that they play 2@D as GF opening - and then it is almost impossible to show a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|timmy5: very intresting hands N-S are having|pg||
nt|xenya: N taking a save|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C=10-15, 6+clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder why east chose that opening|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: if penalty, W's double is very lazy i think|pg||
nt|abdoucha: nice lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Egyptian star player Tarek Sadek|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tjolpe:  3@S var ett mÃ¤rkligt bud, givet att parntern kan ha 3415|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Kommer Åhlén att dubbla är frågan|pg||
nt|arvidsson: han har extravärden borde räcka till en dubbling|pg||

nt|sybarra: unfortunately I have to leave,  so sorry to miss the end of this  |pg||
nt|snorris: dont think they will find their @d fit|pg||
nt|raghavan: why not open 1D and bid 2c,...3c|pg||
nt|xenya: but it may be a go-on double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C transfer advance|pg||
nt|othered1: North seems to be  assuming that south actually had something for  his overcall.|pg||
nt|frm: Probably 8 tricks in diamonds!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|abdoucha: very difficult hand|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|hantveit: Samjee led a spade vs 3nt on board 3 = 10 tricks. |pg||
nt|timmy5: the bidding was a bit different|pg||
nt|snorris: 4nt looks like a quantum bid|pg||
nt|timmy5: can't be|pg||
nt|snorris: but south answers his aces|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ace asking - I thinl|pg||
nt|timmy5: seems Like rkcb|pg||

pc|hA|nt|xenya: i mean the previous hand|pg||
nt|xenya: seems it is not though|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, misclick|pg||
nt|baldjean: I must confess I don't like 2@d waiting. I call it 2@d wasting. It is the opener who needs information, not the responder.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|snorris: I would|pg||
nt|timmy5: 2d would have been a reverse|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would|pg||
nt|hantveit: me too :)|pg||

nt|timmy5: so lots of pairs jump to level 3 showing frekish 6-5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|timmy5: i wouldn't:)|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, this is a situation you need to discuss with your regular partner|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes definetly|pg||

nt|othered1: As cards lie, that was a friendly shift for NS|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|tsadek: when you ask for aces with Void , it is diffuclt to get the right result|pg||

pc|dK|pg||

nt|lestergold: it might also result in being raised by south with west holding a stack over|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Didn't occur to me.  It has the advantage of being right.  This time...|pg||

nt|xenya: EW stopped in 3@C in OR -- no doubt as a result of some misunderstanding|pg||
nt|lestergold: and have fair chances to make with the favoutrable dim position |pg||
nt|hantveit: 3nt and 4H are makeable.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|timmy5: sometimes with this holding i prefer not to be in 4spds:)|pg||
nt|xenya: E took a practical approach by bidding 4@S directly|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1nt shows 4+, so Soliman should decide between 1nt and 2@s|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1@s i meant|pg||
pc|dT|nt|arvidsson: han inte med EW kort men korrekt Björn|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  just det!|pg||
nt|xenya: opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|rnmalik: after 1@S a jump to 4 would have cards like that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H is a tad bold|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H feels a bit undisciplined|pg||
pc|dK|nt|frm: Looks like one down!|pg||

pc|h9|nt|bjurn: om @Hn sitter trevligt hade det nog kunnat ordna sig även med @Cn 5-0|pg||

nt|frm: Now just made!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|frm: Can anyone explain when it´s correct not to use the ace of spades? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has to assume that he will win a club trick, so likely to play North for @HA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|arvidsson: tur att man spelar med RKC, annars är det lätt att komma i denna slamm|pg||
nt|mariner1: or at least 3@D would|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but good sign off in 3@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: you need a club finesse in both. In 4H you also need the diamonds to break 3-2|pg||
nt|hantveit: or stiff T|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|edmunte1: still, a maker|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: E probably thinking S has q of @H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hantveit: Spades 2-2 * dia K onside = 20%|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: hts will help declarer a trump by east better|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i go into depression when I have a score card like NS  - all minuses|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|april7: this helps .why not trump?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|raghavan: should not try finesse S 10|pg||
nt|othered1: Don't believe I have an explanation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon the answer to that is....no |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: defence not too inspired hee|pg||
nt|hantveit: Must play the club q and di Ace and new diamonds. 4H needs to be played carefully as trumphs are not breaking.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz: It looks as if they had a toy and w decided not to play a major.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: maybe -- in their system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: must cash that dim first|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: unless it's a trick question, where the answer is something like that a spade had not been led|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|baldjean: I actually like the step ladder points system after 2@c opening, but with a twist. After responder has shown the points a waiting bid by opener is ace question (provided responder ...|pg||
nt|baldjean: can have aces with his points). Another waiting bid is king question then. Suit can be found later :).|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  A@s a bit risky...better low @s to hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hantveit: can go down now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: yes, always a bad sign|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these matches are for qualification for the Bermuda Bowl?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.egypt-bridge.org/Zone%2009.asp  -  Tournament Site|pg||
nt|xenya: they are i think|pg||
nt|tsadek: south has to play 10@S to make this hand|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear discard the dim west!!|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes, he has to pin @s9|pg||
nt|edmunte1: not anymore now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|daman: feeble|pg||
nt|hantveit: It was free to play dia ace and a new diamonds in trick 2, as he needed dia to break with only 2 losers. Now he will be short of trumphs.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|hantveit: + single spade ace and jack by West and single spade J by east = 19%|pg||

nt|geot: can of course be a game still|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C apparently is any invitational hand    therefore he must pass|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  For example if West's minor suits were switched|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

nt|snorris: this one better|pg||
nt|xenya: right -- or W thought his 3@C was forcing |pg||
nt|lestergold: another contract let thru|pg||
nt|april7: S forgot to pull the last trump|pg||
nt|hantveit: Missed chances for both sides there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: u remember the posible 61C hand - only cost 5IMPs - Egypt stopped in 3@S (140)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|timmy5: now some intresting hands for EW|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes will reach 6S|pg||
nt|snorris: should be bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: Board 4 nor reached the diamond contract...|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true but has to be bid|pg||
nt|xenya: but yes, it was not an easy hand to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: Championship Bermuda , Venice & Seniors Qualifications|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andyv:  this should get them there|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D has a play, though can be beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: har man till 2hj på E|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know the convention, but can't imagine how 3@cs could be anything but an escape.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@Cs would be better contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 @D tougher played in S,,, in N  a @H lead would give it a chance|pg||
mb|2D|nt|werge: Now it´s 36 degrees...|pg||
nt|raghavan: with this jump sure slam bid|pg||
nt|timmy5: brd no 5 went ideal in open room|pg||
nt|snorris: now nothing can hold east back..after 3@ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  polish 2S bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5-5...2N asks other suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: asking for feature?|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 2@S is a bit too heavy here, if it denies normal opening values|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like a polish weak 2...2 spades shows 5 spades and 5 of other suit...5-10hcp or so|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow S didn't pass, so all will be well for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  judging by length N is taking to bid, i'm guessing this may not be polish:)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: slam possible here|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably a normal 3nt will be the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: What would 3 NY from East have shown???|pg||
nt|werge: NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: difficult to see dec ninth trick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: full power!|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pushy but a good bid - only 6 losers and good trumph|pg||
nt|raghavan: RKC 2 without Trump Q|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D on 5 brought Morocco 9 imps when NS in OR reached 3N, going 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: 3NT går nog bet med @S ut (Öst har inte nog med ingångar för två @Cmaskar)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: har N tillräckligt med ingångar att få spadersticken?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get too high here |pg||
nt|enachou: i think 3@c is not forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead beats it|pg||
nt|xenya: S must have been thinking how to steer th eauction into a minor-suit game -- he took a simple road|pg||
nt|xenya: seems dubious to me though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he does have a @D play IF he plays K@D from hand 1st, which is counter|pg||
nt|mariner1: intuitive|pg||
nt|frm: Perhaps a make. Cards are well placed for declarer!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|arvidsson: man duckar andra spadern?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there are many variations after weak 2 and 2NT-some partnerships play singleton-some honour in a side suit etc|pg||
nt|enachou: that show 6@c 16 17pts|pg||
nt|santyclz: It was one which required "Least Lie" bidding.  I guess mixing a @c up in your @ss is probably the best thing you can do.|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have done well to bid 4s which i think is infrangible|pg||
nt|othered1: aOne of the benefits of a strong @C aproach is that you can bid out west's hand.  One of the disadvantages, is that you get high quickly.  Here couldn't west's shape be: 5=0=5=3?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: needs careful management tho|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H is a very good save against the 4@S contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h excellent save and should find it really|pg||
nt|lestergold: east'shand enormous in offence useless in defence|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: too bad the @S fall as they do |pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might, East has shown both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
nt|mariner1: he also has the failing @c hook|pg||
nt|yo_yo: restricted choice when East plays J@D?|pg||
nt|hantveit: more spade can actually help dec here, to set up the spade suit|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: good stop |pg||
nt|pelu: now N has to pull the breakes - she has done her duty (or more) by bidding 4@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are they playing a forcing @c?|pg||
nt|hantveit: more club from east at any time will give south the 9th trick. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: can we scream LOW?|pg||
nt|andyv:  again, i don't think this is a normal weak 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear overboard|pg||
nt|mariner1: good play :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: try:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I knew he would do that :) )|pg||

nt|yo_yo: come one!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: on|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hantveit: East West seems much more solid and confident.  What do you think guys?|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N followed by 3S was invitational...N was certainly at top of his range|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eoff on tis obvious lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: oh dear|pg||
nt|mariner1: commentator's curse,,,,,, :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: oops|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not lets not draw trumps |pg||
nt|xenya: i agree, Andy -- many would just open 1@S with the N, getting to the same spot|pg||
pc|s9|nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|timmy5: definetly when u start having good scores self confidence increases|pg||
nt|raghavan: steady|pg||

nt|edmunte1: a small gift here|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: he played like me:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hantveit: If you play spade ace, there is only a 11% chance that North will hold qxx in spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hantveit: In these situations it is normally the best line to take all trumphs and see if something nice happends. Difficult for opps to discart right|pg||

nt|xenya: *the N hand|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|hantveit: 3-0 is as high as 22% on any hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time the bid one more when in doubt not as successful as the one more to 7s a few hands ago|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Time for plan B.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: on a good day, 3N could make here -- so EW have been lucky to stop low|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: but it was in teams a necessary bid, because it might make and 5@H goes only 1 or 2 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Vassilis Virvikadis of Greece spotted that South could have gone up with ace on the second club play. Then he can cash @HQ, and play a spade. East can ruff, but the club position ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is blocked. East loses the last trick to @DQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: yes insurance i suppose|pg||

nt|santyclz: Yes, if they're not playing a forcing @c.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: red and pard is unpassed hand yet,  you overcalling? |pg||
nt|frm: Askgaards lead against 3 NT in Board number 5 was queen of spades with QJ9x, xxx, AQJxx, x. Now probably a swing for Denmark!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|werge: Off we go...|pg||
nt|hantveit: god sacrifice vs 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|timmy5: 3nt now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Arne Larsson öppnade med 3@C|pg||
nt|hantveit: I like 2H over 2D as this is not giving away the bidding sequence to the other side. |pg||
nt|othered1: double may not be to everyone's taste, but 2@H isn't perfect either and to pass with @S shortness doesn't look good, either.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: ÖV kommer inte in här|pg||
nt|hantveit: Even with a trumph lead, West will make 4spades.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: opponents just bid the long suits of sellami|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: eller ....|pg||
nt|prof 1: where is the stopper??|pg||
nt|werge: Why not just bid 3 @H = show, what you have...|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry 4 @H, I mean|pg||
nt|prof 1: that would be NORMAL|pg||
nt|werge: BRIDGE, they call it|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 spade tricks at hand, 3 diamond tricks at the table and one ruff in clubs =10|pg||
nt|edmunte1: she , will be very quiet i presume|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1@s final contract|pg||
mb|4S|nt|enachou: yes they play forcing@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: nu bjuder Öst och kommenterar "jag har inte kommit för att passa"? :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  3NT av VÃ¤st gÃ¥r vÃ¤l inte att beta|pg||
nt|pelu: I would have bid 3@D in S - they play 4 card @D opening - 2@D= 11+|pg||
nt|snorris: not the best contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: but almost normal|pg||
nt|hantveit: It is terrible to feel you are doing everything wrong, easy things are suddenly hard. I had the same feeling last sunday, for those of you who watched...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Finessing D 10 is need to make 3NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @hs had chanses|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahh, that explains some things.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if he's getting the ruff he needs to beat this.|pg||
nt|hantveit: 4D is a dangerous bid unless they have strong agreements. Might go pass round, but here East will correct regardless to 4sp.|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a slightly lucky make on the @C position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well hard to make this as cards lie|pg||
nt|edmunte1: not an easy task for Trabelsi|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: bid your hand first time - this could cost a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @D also,  maybe I can keep them out of the bidding |pg||
nt|xenya: should be a quick 1 off on this lead|pg||
nt|april7: this contract is goind as also 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: hjowever defence has to find the spade switch after the forced dim duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho what else can east play she cannot play passive with that club suit sitting in front of her eyes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS will get a plus at last|pg||
nt|mariner1: this looks flat though|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Det tog lite längre tid att komma till samma kontrakt som i slutna rummet. Larsson gör allting snabbt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: and then pd can decide if we have to go on to 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|hantveit: I do not see how West could bid 6 spades? Kxx in hearts are not good, nor is his void in partners suit.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point now|pg||
nt|hantveit: Maybe they have agreed sound overcalls on 2 levels, as most of us have in teams. Especially in red vs white.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|hantveit: better to duck the diamond q, but difficult|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: Not EVEN in this hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: What a lead - Good start for East West! Heart K will be his 12th trick.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 5|pg||
nt|hantveit: Dec now has 6 spade tricks, one heart trick, one club trick, 3 diamond tricks and a ruff in hearts for 12|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Mens den spiller færdig, er det tid til at sige nogle afsluttende ord. Det bliver så på dansk ....|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north decided not to duck so it will go off easily|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|nt|werge: What can East possibly have been thinking after partners bid - at 3-level and in a suit, where you have K D B 4 - the answer is not very polite...|pg||
nt|werge: And 3 NT is no winner, 8 tricks are not enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @D he makes 5|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: @C to A and 3! @C-ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c seems pretty unilateral here...i guess the pass cards were missing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|timmy5: defenders can make things harder if S doesnt cover the first diamond declarer will have to guess|pg||
nt|raghavan: if D is ducked - will take 4 clubs - down 1|pg||

nt|bjurn: (och nu känns vi förbrukade)|pg||
nt|snorris: then west has toguess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think north should duck because she has the contract made if the clubs come in and if they dont east has to find the spade switch|pg||
nt|hantveit: To start with an ace vs a slam from AJ will very often give you a bad result + your partner will be frustrated.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|werge: CLAIM|pg||

nt|snorris: so e-w even lucky on the mis-bid boards|pg||
nt|hantveit: lucky and good|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess is that this slam will not be reached on the other table...|pg||
nt|edmunte1: important in this small boards to write on your column|pg||
nt|edmunte1: even if not finding best part-score you'll lose 1-2IMP's, not 5-6|pg||
nt|baldjean: Lucky 3 nt for N/S here|pg||
nt|edmunte1: intresting board now EW  cold for 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|arvidsson: hur ser kampen om silvret ut?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H EW this time|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bjurn: tätt tätt|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hantveit: East did not want to bid 2 clubs on 1nt because opps would get information. |pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  tied match as E took a rather unique approach to 4@s contract on board 7|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S by W on a @C lead or finding the @C Q|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS can fight back with diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: though 5 @D is a very good save|pg||
nt|yo_yo: drury ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: drury works for me|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|daman: they won't find 5@D|pg||
nt|april7: S not strong enpough for 2NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: drury is very unpopular here in UK|pg||
nt|edmunte1: @ck+@s10 are huge here|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s can actually be set.Is 4@s really cold?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3nt or 5 @ds |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, not easy to see how that 4@S could go down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did s not have a natural 2@d available or did he choose not to make one?  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s should make because the hearts will show up 5/2 on discovery play trhus making it more likely that south has the club length|pg||
nt|april7: but E took the bid away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it used to be banned in fact|pg||
nt|mariner1: that's because of 4 card majors?|pg||
nt|mariner1: why was it banned?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lots used to use it as a psyche|pg||

nt|yo_yo: weak 3rd in hand opener, then pass 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 1 down|pg||
nt|hantveit: jump to 3nt = minimum hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tjolpe:  d v s bÃ¥da lagen har tvÃ¥ givar kvar|pg||
nt|sybarra: safely in 2 @H  |pg||
nt|pelu: is it tiome now to bid 3@D? - easy for me - I can see the S-hand :)|pg||
nt|werge: If West covers the secend @C from hand, she will get a @D-ruff instead...|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT must be a form of Bergen|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card limit raise|pg||
nt|april7: as before|pg||
nt|lestergold: or it may be a raise to 3s or better|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes agreed, pysche'ing it should be discourages|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's allowed again now though|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hantveit: Do we know what 3 clubs is?|pg||
nt|snorris: natural it seems|pg||
nt|timmy5: fit|pg||
nt|april7: hand  3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have the ultimate discovery play at trcik 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if I"m reading NS's convention card correctly, since it seems to say south bid "bad hand multi".|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W pulled 2 rounds of trump and then ruffed @d in dummy... was stranded with 2 heart losers|pg||
nt|daman: making 4|pg||
nt|hantveit: West has self confidence after the last hand and jumps to 4 spades. I guess they cannot have single spade H in their system...|pg||
nt|edmunte1: how can be set?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|timmy5: 4 clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and it was very well executed as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: what is 2C|pg||
nt|snorris: 4. suit|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||
nt|raghavan: then he says he has clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: the latter i think|pg||
nt|daman: next hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope they dont land in @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is the suit 2@D supported|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H is a worry|pg||
nt|edmunte1: after rufiing @c with @s10 play @Sa+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: 1@C är dubbeltydigt (11-13 NT eller 17+); 1@H är naturligt, 8+|pg||
nt|timmy5: not necessary|pg||
nt|baldjean: If North leads a trump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H would be pass/correct then|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tjolpe:  jag undrar vafÃ¶r inte Anders bjÃ¶d 3NT pÃ¥ 1NT och visade sin 17-19 hand med 5ko spader?|pg||
nt|bjurn: 1@S visar @S med starka handen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: han ansåg nog att sina 19 kunde vara för bra mot händer som passar på 3nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 tricks likly..maybe 12 ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: though again W should realize that it is unlikely a passed hand has what he|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a difference in bidding close slams and looking for magic fits|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the alert says 4 card support, am I seeing things?|pg||
nt|xenya: very true, Rob|pg||
pc|s2|nt|timmy5: but East has a description he can make so why not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so North would be fairly surprised when South corrected to his five-card suit  |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|april7: look at the movie,7 @S contracts!!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hantveit: 2 spade losers, 2 heart losers in addition the the club loser. -2 and a possible loss of 310 if 2spade is reached at the other table|pg||
pc|h5|nt|timmy5: 11 only|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 tricks, but some communication issues|pg||
nt|hantveit: with dia 2-2 there are no dangers, but dec dos not know that|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@S K@H A@D can he have more? and with those slam is???|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose unlucky that each has 2@C|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|arvidsson: och ville göra en mild invit  till högre höjder|pg||
nt|kamras: 1@S kan fortfarande vara svaga handen|pg||
nt|mariner1: and those cards are at best.......|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has 6 looser hand a passed hand can only provide 3 covering cards-sorry but bad bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: another warning is the 3@S call, W should realize that he might have 1 or more|pg||
nt|mariner1: losers in @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: it also says E does not hold long @D or @c|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: and taps now |pg||
nt|edmunte1: East is declarer|pg||
nt|baldjean: But now it makes.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sybarra: this gets messy |pg||
nt|timmy5: but when he playes he will know|pg||
nt|hantveit: now it is over :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Definately an iffy one.  Standard in the jr's and midnight swiss.|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a great believer in leading singletons against suit contracts but i think here that north had  quite a lot of stroength to hope to fins south with a fast  entry to get a club ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: correcting=-1|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|xenya: oh i don't know Rob -- in my view 3@S is just a cuebid |pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: not ideal defence|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  parntern har max 12 pinnar, men kanske han kan ha en intressantare fÃ¶rdelning, typ x Exxx K10xxx Exx?|pg||

nt|hantveit: Sorry for that, did miss trick 1.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|april7: @DK a much better lead|pg||

nt|april7: South Africa is trailing because  of the grand slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: so door open here but Egypt has a big lead|pg||

nt|werge: A nice 5 @D here, difficult to bid|pg||
nt|snorris: 4@ss e-w|pg||
nt|hantveit: club ace and new club would be the best defence - with open cards :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
nt|hantveit: the open room have reached the slam hand now, will they be able to find the slam also?|pg||
mb|p|nt|prof 1: 1@s - x - 2@s|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, 4sp is a fine contract|pg||
nt|minnie lee: I am a sceptic so when I see 2@c bid, I would lead A@c to see the dummy and when the Q falls small @c because I have 1-2 potential tricks to get back with the @c again|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C -- both majors?|pg||
nt|april7: it wasn't the best bidding sequence|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 2 or 3 @H here|pg||
nt|edmunte1: an easy 3nt here for Egypt|pg||

nt|minnie lee: that would have been my lead...eyes closed!|pg||
nt|xenya: if so, E must be pleased|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7 of either minor rolls, but even 6 may be tuff to bid.|pg||
nt|mariner1: even though Kjx @H are in W there is an entry issue to S|pg||

nt|raghavan: E will bid 4 S - has enormous strength|pg||
nt|minnie lee: nothing to loose and everything to gain!|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS might have a very agressive style on the 2h bid, making south bidding a carefully pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: i wouldnt lead ace of clubs if anyone told me queen is singelton|pg||
nt|april7: first 1NT opening|pg||

nt|othered1: But only fair and play isn't straightforward|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hearts plays quite well, but the entry position is not straightforward|pg||

nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|prof 1: lolll, the pass is strange|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i fear a doomed game on the way|pg||
nt|april7: do they play weak NT? or precision?|pg||

mb|p|nt|timmy5: Invitational hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 3n has more prospects than 4h|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2 finesses :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: what does 4N mean in this situation, i wonder -- do they know that?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: 1@D alltid obalanserat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11-16|pg||
nt|raghavan: and H A will be lead for a club discard|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess would be that 3h is a good raise with spade support|pg||
nt|hantveit: trumph out after these actions is to recommend...|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: settled for game. Can't blame them|pg||
nt|frm: Exactly|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Take the plunge!  You know you wanted to bid 6 over 4@ss.|pg||
nt|othered1: NS took away enough space that EW wound up in a quantitative auction, to their benefit as the cards lie.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: avoided going overboard-tricky hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@C and another|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand however he may get help|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 nt will probably go several down with the right defence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Pass showing 1st round control of @ss.|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's hand very suitable for no trumps very uncopmfortable for hearts|pg||
nt|daman: they landed on their feet|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid ladies|pg||
nt|lestergold: stil hard work tho|pg||
nt|daman: a lot easier than 4@H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hantveit: 11 easy tricks, next pls|pg||
nt|daman: ouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a lot easier with this lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: absurd lead|pg||
nt|daman: totally|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good lead from East|pg||
nt|baldjean: But I don't think they will get there|pg||
nt|edmunte1: they're in the steaming phase :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: whatever NS do know, they win the board|pg||
nt|lestergold: qc lead looks sensible|pg||
nt|daman: not on the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: ity happens to give a trick and of course west cant return them but it looks, like the best shot|pg||
nt|april7: N will finesse the @H correctly,why not @C lead? needs very little from partner|pg||
nt|daman: @Cs were bid and supported|pg||
nt|daman: partner is like to be void    that's why|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok klead a second suit of the opps like spades not the first suit bid on ur left|pg||
nt|daman: you could give away the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a hand advertised as strongish|pg||
nt|daman: yes   a @S would be better than a @C imo|pg||
nt|baldjean: They could actually land in 6@s with this bidding|pg||
nt|baldjean: But no...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: With the mirror minors, the sac is a little to expensive.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|april7: now N can give up a @S and so making his necessary tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: or not -- they need to beat it by 5 -- perhaps they can't do that?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H lead pretty much does him in|pg||
pc|dA|nt|timmy5: u have to tell the players that|pg||
nt|hantveit: Looks like -3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: N has to be care in pitching|pg||

pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Only -4, you're right.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Oh well...|pg||
nt|xenya: @DA looks very starnge, with Kx in view|pg||
nt|daman: we are seeing things double dummy   think about putting yourself in East's seat and go from there    not every contract should be beat|pg||
nt|april7: communication problems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: nortyh houild be asking herself why did east lead a short heart?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hantveit: The 2H bid increased the possibility for south to hold 4 diamonds, but east has 10 trics even with dia 4-1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|tsadek: H.Sellami , bid 3@S which probably misbid , he mean 3NT , but he decide to pass 4@S correctly|pg||

nt|santyclz: They did *very* well last hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s by n/s cold as cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: weak 2 by W and 4 @S by S|pg||
nt|frm: Nine tricks in spades for N-S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Dom kommer kanske i 4@H här, men den går att beta|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers, so the hand is worth an opening bid, but the danger is that partner starts to dbl...|pg||
nt|raghavan: they have 44 fit in S |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n also|pg||
nt|april7: what doesX mean now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S i suppose, no ruffing values|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score board-but E can be end played for making 41S|pg||
nt|xenya: NS are in danger of getting too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2 over 1|pg||
nt|april7: hoping that W has a 2@H opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  Den gÃ¥r i vart fall inte att spela hem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H normalt svagare än en 2@H öppning, i alla fall som jag spelar|pg||
nt|hantveit: ouch|pg||
nt|timmy5: ouch ?|pg||
nt|snorris: d: take out|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl over 4 clubs is showing secondary support in major and cards, east might pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes ofc|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raghavan: Vul fear|pg||
nt|frm: A quiet 1 NT was the result|pg||
nt|othered1: everything sits well for this to make|pg||
nt|frm: If he plays a small diamond, he might be one down!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hantveit: if it shows major fit, then take out|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H has a play here, so 4@S looks like a good save|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: Great sac.  The only problem is 4@h may not make.|pg||
nt|xenya: but 5@H is hopeless|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kamras: Deras är ca 4-8 hp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Inte N-S här |pg||
nt|timmy5: never pass|pg||
nt|xenya: as i see it that is|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good decision by Yousey|pg||
nt|hantveit: I cannot see how 4H would go more then 3 down for 500.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: Hard work for North - he also bids his partners cards...|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d holding may persuade E to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks after this lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: if you x then pard bids freely over 1 nt  dont you bid again? maybe I am wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that EW is cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see a way, but that doesn't mean there isn't one.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes there is a way to make 5@H|pg||
nt|xenya: but it takes perfect reading |pg||
nt|enachou: no way i think|pg||
pc|cT|nt|snorris: 4@hs: showing both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored minor cards make this difficult|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Sellami should forget previous board|pg||
nt|edmunte1: and concentrate now on this tough 3nt|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hantveit: never say never :) We have seen it all, and done it all, havent we?|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5clb if anyone bids it will get doubled|pg||
nt|snorris: and now...|pg||
nt|snorris: undisiplined 5@cs?|pg||
nt|enachou: 1@s 1@h and 1@s|pg||
nt|enachou: @c|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see one, but I've seen many hands where top players make things single-dummy that I can't see dbl-dmy.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm willing to bet even papi couldn't make 6@cs.|pg||
nt|othered1: 8 is a nice card for north to see|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: so maybe let them play here,  true |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt notice the 4 S possibilities|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl on 4 clubs is explained as TO, I think I would bid 5 clubs there|pg||
nt|xenya: for one thing, you can take a double finesse in @Ds, secondly, you can through W in with 3rd trump |pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: but I would support to 3@H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  i don't like 3@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not the right player to play 3NT-@D lead |pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like mp bid|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to get @Cs right too of course|pg||
nt|april7: ace and then Q of @S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: E made a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so...seems like E wasn't sure where he wanted to play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vassilis Virvidakis shows me the way to make 5@h.  Double finesse @ds and guess @cs.  Thanks.|pg||
nt|hantveit: Noshy is pushing on with a 3 loser hand. Understandable, but 6 spades is a huge error.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hantveit: Finally, a good pickup for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|snorris: first good board for n-s |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|xenya: but his pass over 3N looks ill-judged -- unless he is not sure about 6 @Hs in the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand certainly doesn't merit a slam try opposite a minimum 4-6 hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hantveit: overtake + more hearts|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @H |pg||
nt|edmunte1: it would have been better for Soliman to play small|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  W painted a picture of exactly what he held... not much to misinterpret.|pg||
nt|baldjean: This defense is quite helpful|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|pelu: 1100 - just a flat board ?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps this has a play after all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|hantveit: Open room now has reached board 8, the East Wests slam|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: I do not like the 3@S raise as S has nothing to cover outside losers,,,,, and is RED|pg||
nt|mariner1: vs WHITE|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see a way to make |pg||
nt|mariner1: has a play only if E makes a mistake|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|timmy5: yep|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now he has|pg||
nt|hantveit: More hearts now will shorten table|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|edmunte1: taking the only entry to declarer's hand earliy|pg||
nt|edmunte1: but it's easy for us , we see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|nt|pelu: in Open East bid 1@S (naturel bid) and 3@D from S - but later N - on her falt hand - bid 5@D|pg||

nt|sybarra: yikes |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 9 |pg||
nt|snorris: more slams|pg||
nt|hantveit: I never pass first and bid 5 clubs later like this, but here it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|raghavan: slam in NT?|pg||
nt|timmy5: all auctions are totaly different in the open room|pg||
nt|hantveit: 17 + 14|pg||
nt|snorris: will be hard if north shows 12-14 nt range|pg||
nt|hantveit: Hard to find the slam on this hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: will they reach 6 C or 6NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: Chemaly might feel stronger after last hand, maybe 1nt in opening? if 15-17?|pg||
nt|timmy5: why with 14|pg||
nt|hantveit: he knows they are down much, so when you need to make swings - make then when you are in the floating zone|pg||
nt|hantveit: make them|pg||
nt|snorris: 14hp and 3 nines..|pg||
nt|hantveit: 14 hp + a good feeling + urgent need lol|pg||
nt|hantveit: seems like a break?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Probably a break/|pg||
nt|timmy5: i dont know|pg||
nt|timmy5: i have to go out and see|pg||
nt|andyv:  @S partial?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: close-|pg||
nt|xenya: i must confess i would be happy to pass with the N hand here|pg||
nt|xenya: we can't complain about a lack of exciting hands|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7@ds again.  Again 6 is the target.|pg||
nt|april7: S didn't want to make 11 tricks,playing for 12|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats an unusua phrase roared back - are they lions?|pg||
nt|lestergold: lionesses?|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he would have made it by cashing all yrumps -- what does E discard?|pg||
nt|xenya: *trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@C nd AQ@H?|pg||
nt|hantveit: I do not understand the defence. knows he has 4 spades, and I do not understand why he is not continuing in hearts in trick 2. |pg||
nt|baldjean: It was still tricky, even towards the end|pg||
nt|edmunte1: last three boards were a nightmare for Sellami|pg||
nt|tsadek: Egyptian Ladies Team played great in this tounment , with huge Lead , Dr.Azzam their captin has done great job to prepare this team|pg||
nt|baldjean: Operator says there wil be a short break in broadcast|pg||
nt|baldjean: will*|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|timmy5: may be ill have a smoke break too|pg||
nt|snorris: if they play 14-16hp then six will be bid|pg||
nt|minnie lee: ok...a good start|pg||
nt|xenya: all that double dummy of course|pg||
nt|frm: Quiet game in spades for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: sorry - have to go - back in 10 min|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 spades was not reached in open, so it was a 13 imps loss.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: but 1@C is perfectly normal of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  i would too... first seat... very soft values and no quick tricks or 5 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: might be tough to reach 6 here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh the @H10 comes into play|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: most of all ace less 12|pg||
mb|3C|nt|raghavan: may pass|pg||
nt|minnie lee: no|pg||
nt|hantveit: how strong is the 1nt, do we know?|pg||
nt|xenya: mass missed?|pg||
nt|andyv:  he must have liked his spot cards|pg||
nt|hantveit: difficult to find the club q lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|minnie lee: quantum bids are rarley good, even without a 4 card major, this hand deserves develpement|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe 14-16 and a carefull south?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: *pass|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps those two mysterious bids might help?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: he has no way to use 10@H fast enough|pg||
nt|edmunte1: this should be easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: weak 2 by N and a save of 4@H against makeble 4@S,but will go down because of bad break in @S and not finding K of @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I am wrong|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: at least they have located their @D fit -- first step to slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West can splinter, but opposite a limited (non-strong club) opening, why give the opposition a chance to bid   |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|xenya: 4@S from E looks like an overbid to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s makes partners not want to balance as often:)|pg||
nt|xenya: a slight one, admittedly|pg||
nt|andyv:  simply 3@s would have been sufficient|pg||
nt|rnmalik: balanced hand could bid 3@S inviting|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S here was an easy contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: if E does come down to AQh and 3@C then his only exit is a @c into S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy when @D split|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undo please.|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 2NT?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hantveit: I guess so...|pg||
nt|minnie lee: with S's hand there is a possibility for a slam even in minors so what to loose to develop his hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N|pg||
nt|xenya: 3 boards to go|pg||
nt|april7: with a transfer to 2 @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I don't like bergen type raises at all to tell the truth)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i used to play them but actually cant see the reason for them|pg||
nt|xenya: on 14, 4@S was bid and made by Egypt -- on the @HA lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in S with a @c lead unlikely|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3nt NS should be reachable here. 3 spades now from north?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: everyone has a suit|pg||

nt|daman: 2@C|pg||

nt|edmunte1: 4@s available here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|raghavan: I will pas in N position|pg||

nt|baldjean: Lucky 4@s for E/W, if they find it|pg||

nt|hantveit: Hard opening on Wests hand on only 10 points and 8 losers. It would not be my choice|pg||

nt|rnmalik: not this time:)|pg||
nt|xenya: this has no hope -- with no help from N in the majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  I must admit, 5@c is not the bid that comes to mind with the N hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but I said 5:) he beats by one|pg||
nt|hantveit: Dia q from north telling south about his club income? |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hantveit: only one down if you play carefully I guess?|pg||

nt|othered1: east now should have a good handle on the @D count, making that suit's play a toss-up|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe south has @Dxx and @CAjxx and made a good play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Clive Everton said when Cliff Thorburn was lining up the last black for the first-ever televised 147, "Good luck mate"  |pg||
nt|othered1: Do you see any clear inference for east to take?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no really, no|pg||

nt|kastan88: so West upgraded his hand to 14-16 1NT, as CC saying sometimes may have 5-card M or 6-card  minor and less points with compensation (esp in nonvul )|pg||

nt|rnmalik: bad board for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  would appear so|pg||
nt|xenya: an exact tie at the moment, but the last board is likely to produce a swing for Egypt|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@h?  vul for N/|pg||
nt|andyv:  N/s makes sac unattractive|pg||
nt|daman: penultimate board now|pg||
nt|lestergold: the errors by both sides came so thick and fast that i cant unravel the hand|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks this time in @H|pg||
nt|othered1: well done by east|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i meant board 14|pg||
nt|hantveit: In the open room they found the stop in hand 10 - and they got 10 tricks as extra sugar. 7 imps|pg||
nt|hantveit: the difference between the teams will probably be one digit now, after the hand 12 in the open room.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: I am a 3 @C bidder with N|pg||
nt|pelu: now 3@C?|pg||
nt|snorris: if you are e-w :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: But right now, the fun is for EW only|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  as suggested by one of the specs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct bid after pass by partner|pg||
nt|daman: yes    a piano hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|andyv:  could easily go down 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: after being punch drunk last hand i need a piano hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: even if pd can have xx I prefer 3@CX|pg||
nt|hantveit: Board 9, open room found the better contract for 1 imp gain|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: sorry no X|pg||
nt|andyv:  but preempt value is priceless|pg||
nt|daman: you spiked your punch too much|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to find K @H or @S in pocket to make 3N,,,,,, neither are|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead likely too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they dont seem to play michaels or guestem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I like to show my 2 suiters|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he does have 6@H|pg||
nt|hantveit: West downgraded his hand to 15-18 it seems. The best chances are in 3nt, but will probably go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: E will bid 4H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mariner1: phantom save over 3N|pg||
nt|xenya: ot's not over yet...|pg||
nt|othered1: is north thinking of doubling?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: P opened S has 2 Aces|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slight disparity of final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have seen N not make penalty dbl's, he does this time|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a lot of EW bidding i the open room.  Wonder if EW were on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|othered1: But in open room, north's grungy overcall had something to do with it.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Looks like West took 3@C as forcing|pg||
nt|frm: In the other room north introduced his "spadesuit" on the first biddinground. Do you agree with that? I surely don´t, but he succeded in getting E-W to a hopeless 4 H-contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 4@s??|pg||
nt|hantveit: might go pass here|pg||
nt|raghavan: D 3 lead|pg||
nt|snorris: no double no trouble..|pg||
nt|hantveit: X and dia 3 = more pain|pg||
nt|lestergold: well landed on feet|pg||
nt|hantveit: one miss from defence here, and 3nt will go home|pg||
nt|hantveit: we need a heart or club lead, should not be too difficult to find|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  not much to the play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E had no choice but to bid 5@Hs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not quite my usual result when I lead a 9x.  I usually pickle the whole suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good start for the defence. |pg||
nt|hantveit: If EW can take away Norths hearts and clubs, there will be an endplay for 9 tricks against North in D and S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: there did she find that bid (3@S)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah here we go of course 3d bid was somewhat of an overbid|pg||
nt|othered1: I would not have bid on north's hand over 11D|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hantveit: I would understand 4spades from North, but from south...|pg||
nt|raghavan: H 10 to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear no piano no violins rather more like an  ugly blast from the trombone section|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 5@D has a problem|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@S+1@H+1@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that helps|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3nt looks hopeless|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hantveit: Heart Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: wants D shift|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that doesnt|pg||
nt|mariner1: check the vugraph schedule,,,,, many excellent matches, Roland has been|pg||
nt|mariner1: busy.........|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unlucky, both finesses off|pg||
nt|mariner1: Indonesia and more African Championships in the offing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I envy those players at Sharm El Sheikh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: great place for a holiday |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the scuba diving is the best in the world|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont suppose they have time for that though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what about the skiing?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would drown if I tried|pg||
nt|yo_yo: water ski?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That too|pg||
nt|hantveit: If dec plays a club to K, souths need to duck it so dec might missplace some cards.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not my personal style to overcall on 108xxx, but you have to admit it worked well |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: well played 3 nt brought 10 imps |pg||
nt|pelu: and no X from S - "genteman" bridge :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats ok, will just take my + and not give the hand away with X |pg||
nt|lestergold: what 5h mean?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: lied about here aces to compemsate for overbid of 3d?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is too exciting for me|pg||
nt|mariner1: better than Galapagos or The Great Barrier Reef>|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you cant swim Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: ?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1 overtick now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|raghavan: club shift?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: since 3@D to high W has hidden an ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: and her partner is unlimited in theory|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and if it is going to push EW up, then maybe there is something to be said for it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: why - u most exp 2 down - so 300 better that 100|pg||
nt|rnmalik: simple|pg||
nt|mariner1: better than Galapagos or The Great Barrier Reef>|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i havent tried those places|pg||
nt|baldjean: but the logical lead helped|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hantveit: difficult to see, but dec should not throwed the club from table.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: well true, |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe I am just timid |pg||
nt|mariner1: that is a question|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well not ideal for partnership bonding/confidence |pg||
nt|rnmalik: make an effort swimming is like sleeping:)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ducking the @c in dummy was an error..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, I can swim, but I am not sure that is enough|pg||
nt|edmunte1: it was a maker even on a @s lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hantveit: I think heart 10 back would be better. That must show that he stills hold something of interest in diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: but at least avoids the embaraasment of 6h off one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it helps|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: as was the lead itself|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: I can sink :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: not right to cover spade 9 there, if dec runs the nine, he is good, now north gave away a trick.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: And after all of this 2 imps are in play|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|hantveit: ?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Even I could have made it:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hantveit: ruff and hear looks like a good alternative, leaving your pd longer in spades then North|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu: when u defend like that u need to X - to take 100 :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: ???|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hantveit: Looks like -2|pg||
nt|hantveit: operator, is this right?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|april7: there were to many swings in this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew said east|pg||
nt|hantveit: did he play spade 8 from table - his 9th trick?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Ok, I guess that was just a missclick from operator. Thank you all for watching|pg||

nt|othered1: This is our last board of this set.  Thanks to Pinja Pyykkonen our operator for the fine presentation.|pg||
nt|othered1: This 2@S is said to be constructive, while the earlier multi was said to be bad hand,  But the last hand looked as good to my eyes as this one.|pg||
nt|frm: South could not open the bidding. You have 9 HCP and a lousy spadesuit. I don´t see the point in bidding 1 SP at your first opportunity. Later on you might get a chance to bid 2 S ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: @H@H  thx peter, and same to you |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I wouldnt have pessured them with 4 @S bid the first time |pg||
nt|raghavan: so 2H is pass or correct to ur suit|pg||
nt|hantveit: personally I prefer 2H over 2 diamonds, again giving informations to my partner as quick as I can|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s might bet lucky here.. missing a very good 4@hs |pg||
nt|snorris: which cant win|pg||
nt|raghavan: but this is good for NS since 4H fails|pg||
nt|hantveit: Now, he would pass I guess. He knows hearts are on the back...|pg||

nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: useful dummy|pg||

nt|daman: Canada (and the USA :))  please joing us for the next seeion...|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that many entries to dummy|pg||

pc|d8|nt|andyv:  thank you all for joining us...an interesting set of boards to be sure|pg||
