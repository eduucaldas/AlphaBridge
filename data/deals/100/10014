pc|hK|pg||

nt|tlc: the 4s bid achieved one of several positive results...|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: Obviously with a 50+ imp lead she did not want to write down -620 on this hand.|pg||

nt|charles_l: 4@h is a good spot - should E bid more?|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: Unlucky for Declarer, dummy's @D holding and declarer's play at trick 1 will tell south all he needs to know.|pg||

nt|chthonic: How to bid intelligently to the diamond slam?|pg||

nt|motivasi: i guess they play for support double here|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: I think east's pass was fine, although on a good day I would raise to 3@c|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding 2@D on south's hand isn't impossible|pg||

pc|dA|nt|motivasi: if he trump a diamond he will lose two more spade|pg||

nt|manado_1: on this situasion(vulnareble) im 100% agree whit 3nt by franky|pg||

pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Sr. I was of a moment. Friend at the mobile.|pg||

nt|ptbambich: 2@d for a weak majors|pg||
nt|motivasi: 2D for weak any major's or mightbe a multi 2D|pg||
nt|westjava: @S lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: sorry makes|pg||
nt|chthonic: They stayed low on this board in other room after west contributed a double of 1D|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West will have to pass to put the breaks on for East|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|raghavan: weak NT by W|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,3 nt cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems like easy @H bid|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @H should be a winner here, if you get enough entries to finesse twice in @C|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,they play multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|motivasi: i wonder to opening 2S with that suit |pg||
nt|raghavan: curtains  for 4H|pg||
nt|chthonic: Without that double, NS might get too high.  The double was a warning|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 2@C would have been a canape (longer @C) in their methods|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and now North can double and bid NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|moen: must be a weak 1 suiter the rdbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: bad|pg||
nt|motivasi: overcall i mean|pg||
nt|motivasi: I like this 4@H bid :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: wrong again....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@H is an interesting contract actually|pg||
nt|charles_l: doesn't a 4th seat 2N show about this hand?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, it should|pg||
nt|othered1: No, I think a 4th seat 2N initially is just a strong NT +|pg||
mb|3C|nt|westjava: uppsss,dont over the top...|pg||
nt|motivasi: and  a vulnerable condition|pg||
nt|motivasi: hanging around in a dangerous zone...and....|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S still ok,but enough|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C will a disaster|pg||
nt|motivasi: yes,but what this double mean from W?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: because of the @s blockage, I think 4@H may make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|levix: 1nt and 2nt should be some agreements for them|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H here also,  lets see how defense does |pg||
nt|sybarra: played from opposite side |pg||
nt|westjava: a real @D,of course|pg||
mb|3H|nt|werge: Take your 500 NOW|pg||
nt|motivasi: if they play for a D double seem better pass,even with singleton A of D|pg||
nt|othered1: Limited opening bid system has worked in their favor, but that rebid doesn't have to work out well at all.|pg||
nt|charles_l: we will see in a moment|pg||
nt|charles_l: the @h8 may be promoted|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that is the only concern|pg||
mb|p|nt|moen: hmm|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,agree Andre|pg||
nt|westjava: 3 @D may go home|pg||
nt|ptbambich: E must aware... that N maybe have another majors :( |pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C may go to some where|pg||
nt|motivasi: lol :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: in traditional precision 2@c rebid is 54 either way|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: 12 are flat by no @S lead but still to hard tobid 6|pg||
nt|levix: some people play 1c-1nt=8-10 and 16+ with even shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: If they do. They are lucky. KJ@C on|pg||
nt|levix: if have 5M,always bid suit if 8+,so think the 1nt is their agreement|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes|pg||
nt|manado_1: why E tke to much time with he hand ...??|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: if the 5 and 6@h were switched, I think it would always make|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: 2/1 are Ok Mic. Can't be to many witch bid 1NT by 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sr 12|pg||
nt|levix: still down with S lead if can find,even CKJ on side|pg||
nt|motivasi: let's see what N play on Q@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 1 @S vulnerable - to me, West needs 1-2 aces more for that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Made just 2D in other room.  Surely sount can do better|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now declarer has a roadmap, but it may not be enough|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|charles_l: well done|pg||
nt|westjava: small|pg||
nt|motivasi: best for E now to steel a spade truff |pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: needs the 9 @H |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: More @S, pls|pg||
nt|werge: @C-shift - and 790|pg||
nt|sybarra: can this make?|pg||
nt|charles_l: not sure if the @s7 is readable for @cs|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: making on trump coup perhaps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: complicated hand |pg||

nt|othered1: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ptbambich: hmmmm....|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: declarer probably is thinking about trumps 5-0|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @c return would really make this interesting|pg||
pc|dA|nt|manado_1: i think bid 2@d is auto bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: at this point.  if only 4-1, hand is over|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|charles_l: which is why the @s7 was unreadable|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|raghavan: no entry to get HK|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ruff the 5@s high, and draw trumps and play a @c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or not :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it might have been a bit misguided, but it was readable|pg||
nt|othered1: He had gone to 2@S solo.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|motivasi: neither hoping patner to hold Q spades or A of hearts....about 60% chance to make againts the odds|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|pef: Connie seems to be the most conservative member of the team|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C!|an|dont|nt|pef: she's 54 with an aqj10x suit, and has 15hcp.  I can't imagine more than a tiny fraction of experts passing over 1s with that hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree that the only reason for Goldberg's sequence is to keep partner from getting overexcited, but it comes at the expense of allowing the opponents to exchange a full round of ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: information.  I prefer Weinstein's choice.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tlc: i should think the delayed seq should show a reasonable suit but suspect values...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: well not only that, what makes you think it's their hand rather than yours or that you don't have a vul. game?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|tlc: the actual hand seems like a routine 2H overcall..|pg||
nt|pef: yes, I agree, but those values are hardly suspect|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pef: and if you are worried about danger, it might be more dangerous to balance than to overcall directly since with that good a suit, hardly likely somebody is going to have a trap ...|pg||
nt|pef: pass sitting over you|pg||
nt|pef: what do you think about 3c on the north hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Before Wittes started putting her hand down, Quinn said "more!!" Wittes " I have a good hand" Quinn: "your hand's good enough that I might make it"|pg||
