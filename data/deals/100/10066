nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|pelu: 1.2.3 seat nv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9½ - 11½|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit annoying for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still was in principle right to lead trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: and E's @D8 could have suddenly become a big card, had he exited witha small @D at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Bekkouche must hope that the double is negative; it usually is|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 2@HX will not be pretty|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not this time Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she can escape for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ralf Willquist and Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: fairly normal part score competitive auction|pg||
nt|asig: Ready for the football match tonight, Ralf?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|cenglund:  Seems overoptimistic after partner's sign-off|pg||
nt|kastan88: GE Christer, you are far South from us :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough boards to analyze, not sure the best defense here|pg||
nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: close, yes -- but not quite maybe -- i think EW can get 2 trumps, 2@Ds, 2@Cs and a @S|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 3NT ?|pg||
nt|xenya: they should do that quickly however|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  can u bid it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 4c has play in any case|pg||
nt|asig: This hand should be over in a second - 10 easy tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: but pard (W) said she had zilch with the rais |pg||
nt|haans: gustavsson won swedish championships three years running. claimed he was lucky|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|cenglund:  Not really, I am staying in Finland for the moment|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer is obliging -- back to 2 ruffs now|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he could have made it by playing a high @D|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|kastan88: wow, I thought you in South Africa :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Shirley this is a bidders game |pg||
nt|lestergold: east knows pard is shor in  dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: so as long as there is good club support she can push|pg||
nt|sybarra: true but I also do not like going for 300/500 agst zip |pg||
nt|lestergold: you dont have to make everything u bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c can lose one club one spade and one heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: its actually a good point Mike |pg||
nt|lestergold: it wont be doubled into game on this sort of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: o vont to win or u want to sit there and let opps roll in easy contracts|pg||
nt|haans: would be interesting to know why they have left swedish clubs ( = weak/strong1@C) for pure Big Clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: but of course there is still room for a defensive error|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|xenya: 3N seems a make on a @S finesse|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|tjolpe:  It's surprising that West coul ddouble 2@H|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  most players use negative doubles here to day|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: i think looking at the compeitive bidding on this hand your singleton heart and dummy's  marked singleton diamond or much more relevant than how many points partner has for her ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak raise|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: your biew Shirley is a sensible view but not quite aggressive enough if you'll forgive me|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: Denmark lost to Iceland in round 1 - Sweden won 24-6 agasit Estonia (not Nordic but the 6. team!)|pg||
nt|kastan88: and after sign off 3@H from partner|pg||
nt|haans: only 2@H|pg||

nt|haans: but 4 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: not many other can invite and stop at 2|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|lestergold: has east had a peak at south's cards no screens? long necks!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: E selecting "let pard play" option |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west promises a weak 2 in amajor why doesnt east want to play in the guaranteed 8 or even 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable for all she knows 4h is frigid|pg||
nt|asig: Christiansen on lead against 2@h in a moment|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|haans: bjarnarson kicked sweden down|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Kari Mäkikangas|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A lousy start for the Finnish ladies|pg||
pc|c4|nt|talion: hi all|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2NT= Lebensohl I guess, and still, now West riding on, with 18+, that's OK west has good support for both minors, that partner may have|pg||

pc|c2|pg||

nt|sybarra: very deep position by E |pg||
pc|c3|nt|kastan88: 2@D= 3...7 points only and may be 5+M; they have constructive 2M with 8...1 and 6-card|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The contract is not a great one|pg||

nt|cenglund:  I thought it was Lebensohl, but I was wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|lestergold: with so many points what did she expect south to balance with- on a multi auction the [passout seat is not a balancing seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hi Bob@H@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|kastan88: still i don't like such advantages, too much pressure to partner, and i am with you Mike, i would bid 2@H not passing, partner could have  6S3-1D3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the theory becomes different- in the pass out seat you are  in the trap in effect weven though east hasnt spoken|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H or 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: or pass|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kastan88: hmm I thought that was Lebensohl too|pg||
nt|talion: 1@c = 15+ any|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: yes my vote 2 (just)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: South has the option to sit for it or to escape by showing both majors|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Precision or some other strong club opening, I presume|pg||
nt|talion: skuladotti is tempted to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Bob|pg||
nt|haans: must be transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@H by N might even make?|pg||
nt|xenya: or W might run?|pg||
nt|pelu: if S wont to run - the West can just sit and wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 boards compared now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the tables are not linked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: flat  3 and 5  to Sweden|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: Auken perhaps hoping pard is strong enuf to double again|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|cenglund:  3NT is piece of cake|pg||
nt|lestergold: but doesnt want to push south out of spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: Hi Bob, |pg||
nt|mcphee: just getting an idea whats being played|pg||
nt|haans: no double = good bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: should make plenty |pg||
nt|mcphee: these sort of hands really offer little play choice|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|talion: yes it is, but it could have been very poor contract if nurmi has minimum 15 points for her opening|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer may get home if she plays on the black suits however playing on dims looks doomed|pg||
nt|mcphee: why|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D Q is ok|pg||
nt|haans: may make|pg||
nt|haans: @HK a joker|pg||
pc|s3|nt|asig: It looks as if 9 tricks is the limit in hearts|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: because defence can come to 3heqrts a dim and two bullets|pg||
nt|mcphee: although still needs to develop other tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcphee: this line is going to work even better|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: i think east perhaps with her two doubles had bid here values and that the fourth heart was optinmistic|pg||
nt|haans: yes worsed for sweden|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: south covers dims set up hearts set up no  fast ntry six tricks for defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: club up would be good now |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes bjut south needed to cover altho not obvious |pg||
nt|asig: maybe not|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|cenglund:  11 tricks should be made:test first hearts and then spades|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||

nt|lestergold: sorroh wrong sex|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Also this @s return!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph return is better |pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: this is likely to make, decalrer losing 2@Cs, a @S and 2 trumps |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Noe Jens has his chance|pg||
nt|asig: Now its making|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: With a  trumph return W had no chance to cover his 2 losers|pg||

nt|talion: now ahonen has double stopper in hearts. if danielsdot had lead high heart, then ahonen could have taken only one heart trick|pg||
nt|talion: but with no side entry, low heart lead seems reasonable|pg||
nt|asig: One loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence may put pressure when aqce and another club is played if north ducks|pg||

nt|kastan88: byt that's onlu mine opinion :)|pg||
nt|jakow: Anyway, I think Magic diamond better than Carotti...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the mistake from S on board no 36 was expensive|pg||
nt|haans: bjarnason has an openin or ???|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|cenglund:  Flannery, I presume|pg||
mb|d|nt|talion: 2@d is both majors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: a part score here not too high for either side|pg||
nt|mcphee: and this is the reason why I prefer to open 1@D as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s already probably too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h by n/s isnt guaranteed either|pg||
nt|asig: No|pg||
nt|asig: 5 apparent losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence  a spade a heart  2 clubs and a dim to lose|pg||
nt|haans: invite spade support|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt must be a lebensohl bid |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D openeron the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: for weak to bid 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is another example of inadequate fighting ofr the part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: sensible idea to me also Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i can see how this made|pg||
nt|asig: Win the ace, to rounds of trumps an another diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ruffs with his mony and then fourth dim takes care of club an d a club is ruffed in dummy! what an extraordinary position|pg||
nt|asig: *two|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a perfectly normal defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets it thru|pg||
nt|asig: Einarsson should work this out on the bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cenglund:  Not among the best 3NTs I have seen|pg||
nt|talion: very optimistic bidding here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: u do not win letting vul opps play in 2 of a minor normally|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you havent notice yet,  Mike had his "wheaties" for breakfast this morning,   making quite agressive |pg||
pc|h3|nt|cenglund:  If they lead 3rd and 5th best Q would have been a better card|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: declarer is unlikely to gey @Cs right, then it will be for S to find a @S switch|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|cenglund:  Ahonen could work out that there is no hope in spades|pg||

pc|dA|nt|cenglund:  Duck is necessary|pg||

nt|mcphee: defenders lost a trick I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: bridge is believe me anaggressive game- i relearned it after thirty years from a ounger relative who retaught me the basics|pg||
nt|mcphee: E gets all the gooddies|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jakow: In original Magic D we opened 2S on this hand  55 S+C or D+H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant 1@H show 45?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: in bridge you musttighten the screw up to the maximum but not brwak the bolt by overdoing it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a close 3n with nothing to spare made in the open|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: nothing to stop them now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcphee: good @C slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: so iceland really needs to flatten this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: creeping about cautiously will win nothing|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jakow: About 12-14hcp and 3+H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in 3. seat vuln: 1Nt = 15-17, so N had to open 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: with spades and dims both breaking 3/3 this should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: easy 7 tricks - and a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: we've got our first comparison -- let's hope it will continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie but imagine you were in club slam and recieved a heart lead - you would not be a very happer sapper|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: your only entry to dummy under attack immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it i think even roland would baulk at this slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: life can be mean, i have this E hand and partner opens slam is going to be hard to avoid:)|pg||
nt|asig: Yes, even if W finds an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the lead helps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: easy to duck and then only one club  trick for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a horrible choice for east now|pg||
nt|haans: had been much harder to bid if sylvan first passed|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|xenya: nicely done by NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: now spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: ionically a heart lead may have been threatening|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4N simply does not do the hand any justice|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: 29 combined points without a grat trump fit why have you got to be in slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: because it makes? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (just a joke)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|pelu: that from board 22 - board 17-18-19 = 8-0 for Sweden|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcphee: I have 8 tricks in my hand an partner opens I certainly do more than a tiny invite|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 tricks if clubs are behaving |pg||
nt|mcphee: missing slam at imps is cowardly here|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a passive lead you have 6c tricks heart finesse for 2 tricks 3 sapdes and then a dim guess fo the contract when spades dont break that is if you havent mangled up your ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: i strongly disagree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ht switch now surely|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kastan88: neede to jump in with @HK and lead @D thru|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cenglund:  Declarer should try to score dummy's spades by ruffing|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: did Einarsson have time to mess around with that club|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: all true what you say, W has a complete minimum as well|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: it is a hand full of holes and hazards|pg||
nt|haans: nothing to it :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: and it still has good play|pg||
nt|sybarra: so if you are so interested in slam, perhaps 4 @c is better bid over 3 nt|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C is clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: now i think declarer is in tyrouble|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|asig: He takes the rest on a double squeeze|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: emphasize your @C, they are worth it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: 4n after wheeling out the fourth suit does full justice to the hand that is a very strong slam try|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|lestergold: only an original heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: not easy for defence , as we saw|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead would have set 4@H, but how could W find it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "conservative" e/w pair here are winning imps nevertheless |pg||
nt|lestergold: i probabbly wouldnt wheelout the fourth suit just make a straight quantitative invite|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: The Danes were in 5@S here after N-S competed to 5@C|pg||
nt|asig: So, "messing around with the club" was in order to rectify the count :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 5@S had the obvious two losers|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: we all know about the amount of luck there is in this game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in chess the best players always win in bridge chaque chien a son jour|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, Jaak, that's even more difficult|pg||

nt|haans: a natural penalty double!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cenglund:  On good day you make slam, but this not that day|pg||
nt|mcphee: this response range places a lot of pressure, 2N as N kinda forced in case S has more and works poorly when S has a 6 count|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Slam depends on the club finesse|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|kastan88: but what else here to open, if 1@C means  all hands 15+? you can't open other way|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Veikko Jokinen, one of the old-time Finnish internationals said that it's always right to bid a slam when the finesse is working|pg||

nt|fabsayc: out of control auction|pg||
nt|jakow: Somethin strange with th double of 1H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs partner to cover 3 losers, surely then north would bid more than 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: instead its the greaqt danes in a little trouble 3n easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: however weight of cards is a factor here |pg||
nt|asig: I think this should make, though|pg||
nt|asig: Not many losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims favourable so u lose 2 or 3 tump tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: just not the most elegant looking contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: !!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: fortunately for NS, it's just another -50 against a makeable 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: and here another 5 card suit too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kastan88: yes, from S hand down with @S lead|pg||
nt|talion: i gues the 5@h asked about quality of openers hearts|pg||

pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Safe contract; investigating slam without getting overboard. Excellent technique|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcphee: you count it  as 12 points all you like, to me it's a pail of poor values|pg||
nt|mcphee: K@H and Qx@C not exactly features I am anxious to rave about|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bob you are right to view the hand with circumspection but i promise you that not an expert this side of the antarctic would agree with a pass|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: but so what  |pg||

nt|haans: we have to wait before results are compared working on it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kastan88: if double showed 5...7 points, i can't see reason to bid 6@C over partner sign off, or what was double?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kastan88: then I am some Antarctic person too, I open this hand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: by the way i forgot to comment that north should have given simple pref to 2s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bid 2n|pg||
nt|kastan88: but as I said i would personally bidding 2@S after partners 2@D and waiting, may be she can do someting with her 15-pointer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @d!|pg||
nt|asig: I think he is down now|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think a trump should have been played before that spade ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: I heartily agree|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|asig: Two more trumps to lose|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it was more than inelegant this contract |pg||
nt|asig: Down a lot if he tries a heart in search of 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a few back for iceland who i think actually deserve some|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cenglund:  You could hardly imagine that declarer can dispose of all the spades from dummy|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: S had a hard choice|pg||

nt|mcphee: I would not dble as N either|pg||
nt|kastan88: in this part of Earth (East europa) we play that mostly 6..10, so I can't see reason to raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: let pard balance if east passes also much too much in heasrts|pg||
nt|lestergold: zip outside hearts|pg||

nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: may even make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course every finesse in sight works|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: will require a defence worthy of that aginst the israelie raid on entebbe|pg||
nt|lestergold: and yes it may happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@S is a super accept but W is not interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: but plenty of play even on a less favouravle layout|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As the cards lie  - yes, but 2 of 3 finesses is needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: its better than that Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: because played bu south with the spade protected the fourth heart will take care of possibloe spade loser so whenever club finesse is right its a very good contract and has chances ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when clubs finess is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland mandatory and porbably in the region of upwards of 50% in any case|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: clubs ruff beat it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|xenya: her 2N was just a further transfer|pg||

pc|d8|nt|lestergold: but its absoutely a dreadful contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 4-1 trumps makes it hard|pg||
nt|lestergold: favourable spade position dims 3/3 fav lead etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: and still work to do|pg||
nt|mcphee: even with a @C lead this is not so horrid, 3-3 @D comes in as well|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cenglund:  Oops!|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mcphee: although 3@H is aggressive, if the S hands values are outside of @S it is not so bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but sometimes opps preempt you or if south expectsb pard to show 4 hts however minimum she is then she did not have here 4h raise you cant have it both ways|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcphee: and to reach a close game vul at imps is good|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pelu: Long way up to Finland :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 2@H - I cant :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjöberg are still juniors I believe. Early 20's? Someone in the audience may be able to message me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sandra 22, Emma 24|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and rather few IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again - can u defeat 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Anni and she is having a hard time. Please bear with her|pg||
nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are stuck again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|pelu: Vladimir - I take @D 10 discard 2@Cs ruff a @S and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes that's true -- you need to play a small @D early|pg||
nt|pelu: are we still waiting for the lead?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: in mps there is a lot more to gain at imps you may save a few but what a disaster if you make a big sac and they cant make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom at this level |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: NS will bid game here -- 3N or 4@H?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not a very good decision|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: another battle of communications and not helping declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@H looks hopeless, but this has a practical chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i cant see a defense|pg||

pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: but there it seems overtaking for spade lead is best for defense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: unlucky 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: but flat|pg||
nt|kastan88: this is last brd, ty all and cu evening again|pg||
