nt|bridge_one: so 2Nt preempt. in a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: i think so|pg||
nt|ady: hardly a pre-mptive hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: quite a pre-empt too|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|d|nt|april7: S will play in a @H partscorelosing 4 tricks,but EW have 4@S if thea could reach this contract|pg||

mb|3H|nt|april7: support X|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Christian Kaeppel|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS gave up easy here I think|pg||
nt|ady: could not 3@D by north have been natural    as yet east's suit not disclosed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D and after 3@S to do a  2suit hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ady: east might have contested with 3@S   after west has bid twice |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10+cards in the suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS find their fit at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: one too high|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the alternative at 4@C was 3Nt by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: well - by now you're on our schedule Eamon - afternoon :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if Live Updates is back - go to http://nmlag.com/LIVE-oppdatering and continue from there. Worked for me!|pg||
nt|april7: S has 3 Kings and N a 6card @H suit most probably.It doesn't need much to make 10 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|eamongall: is it 2pm in Norway ? |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 PM|pg||
nt|april7: 3@D was a good intermidiTE BID TO KEEP ew AWAY|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|mariner1: interesting that S did not compete here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|sharkey: Think we're always 1 hour ahead of you|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|april7: N might go down,if W cashes his ace of @C and underleads @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: the good news is S only has one @H higher than the 10 and 9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|ady: seems to have turned a plus into a minus|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi and/or re folks.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: a @H back taps dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: E/W are one of the famost german pair Linde a former junior German master|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W have 1 trick - i see other 6 tricks (when ruff in the dummy South play K in @H and @H)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: entcho takes long time to do his next card|pg||
nt|ady: yes    only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: Welcome Joe Shair (North Pole)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: North's preempt "forces" EW into the best contract - would they get there without help?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: well done west   the only way to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|april7: but still good score for NS|pg||
nt|ady: will lessen a the potential loss  as 3@H making  should be a poor score for e/w|pg||
nt|april7: the 5 of @S was a positive signal for @S,thats why W defended as he did|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: the 5 showed the Q or sigleton|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: probably playing forcing NT and 2@H shows 6 that is it|pg||
nt|hlortz: HI Rob|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2-3 doubled undertricks in 3@c might have been an alternative|pg||
nt|eamongall: hopefully when next board comes I can say something bridge related|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he is off 2 so NS came out ahead|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Henry|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|hT|nt|april7: well played by ruffing with ace|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: poor judgement    even if 4 clubs makes  this is a high price to pay against a part score   and 4 clubs is down     east just taking a wild guess|pg||

nt|sybarra: "only" 50 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: key play was the @C to make 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: to the German National Team Bamberger Reiter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has some play here......|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS might lose 1 or more there|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have some play for 4@S here|pg||
nt|hlortz: a @S preempt may buy this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 3@H by west was difficult to interpretate - E thought could play or 4@H or 5@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3@H DBL in Open Room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thinking ad double fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: two key cards are the stiff J@H and the 8@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: the trick is getting the @c pitch before losing the @D|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|april7: 6@D by EW|pg||
nt|ady: 6 of either minor for e/w|pg||
nt|santyclz: I liked 2@h by s.  Takeout x of @ss.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well NS has to bid to be able to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is either multi or just a weak major|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a lower @S contract is likely I think|pg||
nt|hlortz: zo ew play a WEAK nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW play a very low NT at least NV|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D could be also short - they play similar precision (i suppose)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Elinescu was shocked and asked me whether I put the names in BBO lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: may duplicate CR here|pg||
nt|jbgood: not now|pg||
nt|eamongall: not any more .. but will it be 3 doubled undertricks or 2 |pg||
nt|jbgood: sh be 3|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Rob and Rashid|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H says play your suit if weak|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N by S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has a good chunky 14 without @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: I would prefer a 3@S from north   |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree David,   |pg||
nt|april7: I would have bid 3@S, but would be of no awayl anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: better description,  doubt I am beaten tin the home suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Roland, Rashid and Christian|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good steady bidding so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welc rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N is less miss leading to me than a DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: do NS play transfers here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to realize that S probably has weak @S because 2N and not DBL|pg||
nt|santyclz: With those @hs, I'd bid 3nt even if a transfer were available.|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes me too Joe or transfer and bid 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you open NT that weak I like the 2@H and 2@S natural|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes no use transferring into a weak hand.|pg||
nt|ady: no good spot for n/s     e/w   have nice heart fit   looks good for 9 tricks       think trump lead best if they play in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is a 20 vs 20|pg||
nt|mariner1: everything from here on will be HIT|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|jbgood: unless NS overbids |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D is interesting|pg||
nt|santyclz: N took it as minors.|pg||
nt|mariner1: that would explain 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: it was long hesitating .....on N|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might have thought S had less than a full opener too|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now on S thinking|pg||
nt|santyclz: Multi is not difficult to defend.  Many defenses word.  The only problem is both partners have to be using the same defense.|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is very RED to be coming in very weak|pg||
nt|santyclz: (work)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so since S would not come in weak I think N is being timid......|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think N has just enough for 3@S here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W could make many @H |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|eamongall: ah yes ..there is the @DAK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Apologies, our operator is Christian Kaeppel. Hallo Christian, good luck!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like the treatment of coming in early (the 2@h bid) with minimum values and passing then taking action with stronger hands.|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT  was certainly going to be bad for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: since EW is the German National Team I wonder if that makes NS less|pg||
nt|mariner1: confident?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The difficulty in that is the rare case where 2@ds is passed out.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: hi Christian|pg||
mb|r|nt|mariner1: will the @D bid stop a @D lead, as maybe the @H will?|pg||
nt|mariner1: might not try for 4 now as not in it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably will finish at 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: they will find their diamond fit now      will east sit the penalty double of west?|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure he will|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 2@D Dbl probably 2@S by North - it is more difficult the dbl at 2@s |pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: they might end in spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning folks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: board 1 was 9 imps|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: 6@D   the better slam   has chances with a 4-1 club split|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: no reason to risk the 3@S contract w @C finesse|pg||
nt|hlortz: rite no reason to risk 3@S contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 2@H was not my call|pg||
nt|ady: out of it now     east did not even wait for west   to take action after 2@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H bec with void in @D East know to can pass the Dbl at 2@D by West|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: might  well make on this lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: hunt the Q@D now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: hiJOe|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: well snuck one by|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: in fact if clubs are 4-1 they can be ruffed good for the 12th trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good evening|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: the @c lead here was reasonable however leading from KJ's is not for the timid|pg||
nt|mariner1: setting up to cross ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: And/or trying to get the opps to lead trump.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also @H lead make - impossible for defence to play a second round of @H|pg||
nt|ady: partner has shown strong no-trump values    usally best to lead a trump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this agree David|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|mariner1: W can hook either pointed suit but not both|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: he will guess clubs - or else|pg||
nt|eamongall: I presume the doubles allow us play @Cs correctly |pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 down|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knows the @S position so that is the safer one|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: the crunch point|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@h?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score may be 2@S but W would not settle for it|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could get too high here,,,,,, or possibly make 3N|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: this may well go down 3|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H shows the 4@H and 5@S less than game force|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they find the grand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: there was a guy watching the rugby outside  in smoking shelter of a bar and everytime there was a score he ran in to cheer with those inside the bar .. |pg||

nt|hlortz: 3N would require the miracle guess in @S I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has a chunky 13 so............|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: where to begin |pg||
nt|mariner1: oops no game I meant|pg||
nt|mariner1: contradicting my own commentary :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 8 tricks are not 100% here so neither is 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: good pass from S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bec depending only from keycards - also if need a doubleton in @C, or find @C 2/2 or !Q in @c sgl if South have 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes I think S made a good move|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: not easy to play and S will go at least 2 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to play everything our of his hand |pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: You are WLC:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite a disciplined pass by w.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  minor suit transfer    obviously 3 diamonds now must be forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: but have forced NS too hight looks like|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead helps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hands of highly disparate strength often play better in the weak hand's suit.  Not this time, though.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to set up @S for @c pitches|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is makeable|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to hold to 2@H and a @S loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe needs help from W too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed I still think 3NT was a better playable contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: well I see 8 in NT, the 9th would be an issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: and only one entry to S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW will provide the 9th|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room N used stayman over 1N...... auction still open|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means 2 stop in both majors - with slam interest North would be reopen. But no guess|pg||
nt|ady: poor effort by south  with prime support  and top maximum  inclusing good controls|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: a vital point - if you pass opps play a peaceful 1 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: E does not like what he sees in dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: and Narvik need IMPs!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|eamongall: No respect ...but he was buying a good dummy ... how many does 2@S go for ... maybe only 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they bid both his best suits,,,,,,,, and he is very RED|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: may make - |pg||
nt|sybarra: that 8 of clubs is huge card for e/w |pg||
pc|cT|nt|hlortz: nice @D play!|pg||
nt|mariner1: would have been better off duck with J@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: great @D play yes........ how did he see that|pg||
nt|hlortz: dont think he did was just trying to set up maybe 2 @D tricks...got lucky|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - might make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  could make 9 tricks in diamond   so no great damage losing 100   or 150|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/654  -  Tournament Site|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: will just make 3NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: no choice 2 is 2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: I think to have any chance he had to work on @S 1st and that was slim|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back dooms this|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eamongall: Carl thats almost  what I meant ... maybe only one ...almost  = may make .. |pg||
nt|eamongall: :):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 or 9 tricks david in !'s?  E only had one @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: *in diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, the good news is no game is likely to make.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@D pitch a @S and @D ruff and @C but no way|pg||
nt|mariner1: E can wait on his 2@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: on 13 Open Room found and made 3N NS for 11 imps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: still can make 9 tricks |pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: exactly |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite Eamon :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but in the final analysis, not a huge win/loss either way |pg||
nt|santyclz: Why it's disciplined rather than timid.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: doubleton in @C, AKxx in @D and A A in majors could be sufficient to give a raise at 4@D|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eamongall: but i did not want to recieve jb's 214 messages|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: good for W not squeezing pard with cah of @D's |pg||
nt|mariner1: smart works too :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: W is on the National Team for a reason :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: little technical glitch here folks|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rob, stop playing with the buttons.|pg||
nt|mariner1: you mean this one -->|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like we are hung up|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: he needed to set up @S so he could shorten himself in @D and use @S as trumps|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: through E..... and even then he needed help from E|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|c4|nt|santyclz: To have any chance, n needed to ruff @ds at every opportunity to shorten his trumps.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so off 1 maybe ok here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we will keep a check for board 15 and open room auction|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|eamongall: however I reckon some forcing plays would doom 2@SX|pg||

nt|ady: west gave an overtrick   but should not cost|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@D bid in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: your were right, think e/w can make 9 tricks in @D's |pg||
nt|mariner1: I do not know if there is a RESULTS link so if anyone has one please forward it|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S saves NS from being in 4|pg||
nt|hlortz: 2@S muiderberg?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S must be Muiderberg/Tartan type|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 5 with minor and less than opening count likely|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mariner1: nice weak 2 in W, white vs red|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I think best for EW was to play 3@Cs ..|pg||
nt|santyclz: 21+ inch screen is helpful.  On my 12" laptop 1 room is enough.|pg||
nt|mariner1: E likes it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: so it pinpoints the @D suit unless there are 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: those 2@DX and 2@CX often have enough to escape |pg||
nt|sharkey: showing 4@H and longer minor?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should not doubt you |pg||
nt|ady: duplicating sing diamond for e/w    3NT   best spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW find the slam? they should|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H Ogust? showing good suit good hand?|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the bad old days, the auction would be 2@s 6@s.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E has a massive hand.3@H singleton?|pg||
nt|mariner1: confirmed it is Ogust|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: although its june :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: the only outside strength W could have is A@H or K@D so E has to be thinking 6 or|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 6-er or 5/5 with @D preemtive|pg||
nt|mariner1: E not loving either suit|pg||
nt|ady: another split deck    probably 1NT   n/s  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and EW are very red|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1@C alert, so probably they play 1@D with 4cards, so 1@c can be only 2 cards|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: you should have a very good reason to pass a take-out double, not sure E in the CR had that|pg||
nt|sharkey: More IMPs to Narvik...|pg||
nt|mariner1: Operator humour :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no my fault wasn´t alerted....(betterminor)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: 3NT but also 5 @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: so E knows its 6 now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just arrived from Turku, and just in time for a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D now for Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: makes 7 if no @H lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hlortz: will not be a good advert for their methods...|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|eamongall: in Ireland its called anti ...in USA suction ... (although I don't know rest of system)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe @d and one higher Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes .. like @DKQT9 maybe |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C is checkback or similar NMF|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Christian|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: 7@H is a save at 1400 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And since people who x for a lead seldom lead it themselves...|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is one reason I do not like these type calls are VUL vs NV|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: though it could go for 1700|pg||
nt|mariner1: @SA being in S helps|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: they are already playing I cant folloe this one......only give result|pg||
nt|mariner1: np Christian|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: because of net problems ....sorry fellows|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 or 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|mariner1: we blame all of those on Santy :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: nah, 1400 seems its max|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good for us:)|pg||
nt|ady: maymay scrape home  |pg||
pc|cT|nt|eamongall: and you are still wrong side of declarer|pg||
nt|eamongall: multi landy I am told .... thats a fine defence to NT |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs confirm 2@H shows 4@H and longer minor...|pg||
nt|jbgood: I passed 2@c doubled five 5 good trumps after my prd had neg doubled in a European Chship once - was an uptrick:(, |pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - I thought you referred to the bidding in the CR Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: I know folk who reuse their multi stuff as defence to NT ...also folk who play 2@Cs for majors only ....but very few in Ireland are sophisticated enough for both at same time |pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - no|pg||
nt|jbgood: this 3@h is the modern way of playing multilandy - a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h|pg||
nt|eamongall: JB ... I can beat that ... I held @HKQ8754 and them trumps and a bidding partner ..and a lady by the name of Irene Robinson cruises into 4@Hs ...well what should I do |pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have come out smoking this half and really put the pressure on Topbridge.  Although they're ahead at halftime they may sense the tide's turning here...|pg||
nt|jbgood: you should ask her out for dinner:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: the lady made it ... (no uptrick) and the Deep finesse indicates 10 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: oh yeah I doubled |pg||
nt|sharkey: if she was good looking your defence may have suffered....|pg||
nt|sharkey: Reistand's in the tank....|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 down, and as a kib said, 1-0 in favour of Dont over Multilandy|pg||
nt|jbgood: not - one of the players left for the bathroom..|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 7@D in Open Room tied up the score|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|sybarra: @S suit is remarkably friendly here |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no 7 with @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: open in NV but beef it up RED vs WHITE would be my thinking|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: yes, in open room both players choise don't play 3Nt :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|eamongall: well both Don't and multi landy win ... as 3@Cs is safe haven for EW |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: better to continue diamonds    but e/w  can always make    just lose 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: west has discarded 1 heart too many     nice duck of J@C by east|pg||
nt|ady: if west had 1 more heart now  contract would be down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: still south has to play spade to tje jack|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hlortz: yep this is 1100 territory|pg||

pc|s7|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6@H here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jbgood: if Topbridge lose by more that 16 imps (13-17) Studenetene may overtake them with a maximum win|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like 4@H   or possible 3NT for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could be in a tough game here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H if no @D lead|pg||
mb|2H!|an|michels|nt|santyclz: I could manage to lose 3 @s tricks in 4@ss.|pg||
nt|ady: yes    13 tricks without diamond cashed|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 4@H   looks fairly routine   making 10 or 11 tricks on spade view|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 6@H in fact|pg||
nt|mariner1: that splinter might get them there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 6@D with no @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H warns E about distribution|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4C|nt|sharkey: unfortunately we do not have live board-by-board update - as this is becoming very exciting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  will pay high price for any save  vul against not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C should get them to slam|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sybarra: drury of some sort |pg||
nt|april7: all leads by W are helpful except trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@S lead beats 6 though|pg||
nt|hlortz: the bold preempt worked|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe not, S has no quick entry so 6 not really a maker|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: nice 3 @H BID  so he cant bid @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C probably 6+@H good suit and 4 @C (with 5/5 probably 3@C)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: I think the scores you see on Live Updates have been manually entered, so no live updates |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2@C = Drury|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to lead a club now |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S looks like it can be set|pg||
nt|hlortz: if it went for 800 we would call it something else LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: found slam easy enough|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: Another double score for Narvik?|pg||
nt|ady: that wont exactly give south any problems|pg||
nt|rnmalik: BRAVO|pg||
nt|mariner1: any other lead and N can ruff out the @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C could be also a cue if Dbl at 2@H means good raise in @H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: @D out also causes an issue though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - discard two clubs and a spade on the diamonds and lead a spade up (still have to guess though)|pg||
nt|ady: got their only trick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: S has to ruff third @D with 9 of @H|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like 2@H 1@C and 1@D unless defense helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: certainly worked this time|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: as Avram said   leads otgher than a trump will help declarer|pg||

nt|bridge_one: West keep the 10 in @C ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: N wants to defend 2@H DBL|pg||
nt|ady: probably wont get there      |pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 2nt loses two aces and three spades - but you are lucky spades are 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be very unlucky to lose more than one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought they were at lightening speed|pg||
nt|ady: this is not so easy to bid   and anyway on a finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: would beat an aggressive 5@S though|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL here shows count|pg||
nt|mariner1: they might find 5@C now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: need to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your analysis of the hand is correct. Let us see if they reach it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and lucky that diamonds split favourably|pg||
nt|mariner1: 15 was -200 and 8 imps|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: the finesses is k stiff |pg||
nt|ady: west might bid 3@S now|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: boards dont come from open table ....but from another match|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough to think game looking at W|pg||
nt|ady: -500     not a bad score for n/s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 down is sufficient for N/S, E/W are vuln|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: 6 @H would be a good save if EW should reach a slam|pg||
nt|ady: now 5@C   from east|pg||
nt|mariner1: now is the key ,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E can't tell W has the magic hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S can't duck this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if south duck however 7 tricks the same for N/S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: sorry, private|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that as well |pg||
nt|rnmalik: S will bid 5@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: S shouldn't bid 5 unless N inverts his DBL's|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: S is thinking :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL to me here says I would rather defend|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it might mean no clear action|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rather timid by e.  The @hq upvalues (although not as much as it might) and he has controls in the other 3 suits.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzqt: w thinking :)|pg||
nt|april7: since no @H honour with E, W might bid the slam now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E could bid 4@C-I would:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: good news here is @H are 3 2 and @SA lead helps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: maybe what would have helped would be a 4 @D (cue) bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry, meant 4 @S |pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: after 3 @s, 4 @S |pg||
nt|ady: yes  a fair point|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @c doesnt help pard,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3N if they play it as showing K (ala Benito)|pg||
nt|ady: all said and doned 5@C  not an unreasonable spot    |pg||
nt|sybarra: something to show the @S holding |pg||
nt|mariner1: no clear action is pass to me....... S is a passed hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Kind of depends on whether you're in a forcing pass situation and I'm not sure.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless pass/dbl inverted, yes, a la Meckwell - pass would ask partner to double |pg||
nt|hlortz: this might go down/// IF NS get their @D tricks prompty|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe time for a tea|pg||
nt|ady: this should bed quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: N holding all the ourside Aces is not worried about a quick pitch so leads a trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: we are 10 min late so hurry up table :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: tomorrow we start at 10 MET :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|mariner1: did N really play low @S?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: pard reversed,  we are not stoppiing short of game after support of @H's  I am into slow approach,  even my q of @D should be working |pg||

nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbgood: some kibs still think that the lacking updates are to be blamed on the organisers - that is not true. The software provided for them simply failed to do its job |pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can set up a club and make nine|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 16 W in Open Room also opened 2@S so will it be 1100 again?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mariner1: you can only DBL to show you want to defend or pass to show no clear action in|pg||
nt|mariner1: this auction,,,,,, there is no 100% forcing pass|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: N bids 2N over the 2@S so it saves EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: that on 16 in Open Room|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: if you did pass 5@H you would "usually" expect S to do something|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||

pc|d8|nt|sharkey: cant see @HQ being right?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: but he had to rise @HA of course...both sides swapped a tempo loss there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Right or wrong I would have bid 5@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D making 4 did lose, however not to 3n making, it was 2@H X off 300|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hlortz: gentle defense here makes 2@H easy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|eamongall: its a tough life even running a vugraph show with say 6 tables ...|pg||

nt|ady: another grand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H ?  6 likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: part scores is all here|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe a tough 3N EW or 4@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the counterplay by south was the best, knowing good @H in North (otherwise impossible to bid for penalty at 2@H)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|eamongall: the presentation has been  improved immensely by software / bridgemate things for us spectators |pg||
nt|ady: looks like the best spot is 4@S for n/s    but might play ina minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: a funky multi bid it looks like |pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like part score battle here|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H are right and @c are right|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: they dont play the 10pt NT VUL |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|april7: best contract is 4@S and 5@H are only 2 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I agree, doubling 5@H looks best with that North hand...it is just that there are different ways to do it|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would pull with a 6th @s, but not with that hand.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N vs W:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Using the Meckwell agreement, North can pass (requests double) and then pass  |pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to find the @H fit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: 5 of  either minor makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW steal one|pg||
nt|mariner1: QJ @c xx make this a winner EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C strong except 16/18 one suit hand 6 cards - they open 2@D that hands)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  do have a good save against 7@H   |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: with QJ@C no problem|pg||
nt|mariner1: my general feeling is you have to strain over a weak NT, even VUL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cuts both ways|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome David Greenwood (Ireland)|pg||
nt|mariner1: or possibly when partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: or both|pg||
nt|hlortz: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 14-16 valnurable|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Christian|pg||
nt|ady: -1700  good save |pg||
mb|6H|nt|eamongall: but we still should remember 21 years ago we had folk who could score a 15-17  table mitchel with a pencil in 20 minutes |pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - but the software here dealing with the Bridgemate was not working properly..|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may just be waiting in the bushes here to trot out 5 @H,  guess not |pg||
nt|mariner1: right N's DBL says we are beating 5@H, so S should only pull if he thinks 5@S has|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best defense 5@H  -800    spade ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 too many |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: good play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H not too bad a spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely to make 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south's double was presumably support showing three spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H shows a fit and a max|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well the 7 was not likely to be bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: it's easy to have problems in these auctions when responder only has 4 in his suit, and goes to a new suit|pg||
nt|athene: how strong is 3@C in this auction?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@H easy with both @C @H finesses on|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no spots in @H missing either|pg||
nt|mariner1: 9@H not an issue since @H are 3 2 onside|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: it can help if you play lebensohl but easy to have misunderstandings over whether 3@C is weak, invitational or forcing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: bd 6 the other room tried the ill fated 3 nt |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mariner1: the slam on 17 was played in 4@S -1 in Open Room so 14 imps|pg||
nt|hlortz: note he will start x@H not J in case of singleton K onside|pg||
nt|ady: well 7 is not a good contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: the double may induce declarer to go wrong in trumps|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@H DBL on 18 was set 2 in Open Room so 5 imps|pg||

mb|d|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: and a rousing 1 nt here |pg||
nt|mariner1: actually a @S lead from W is nice if S plays 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems both have 4 losers or more off top|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps north would have done better to win the first trick with the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: that might persuade declarer to finesse trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: they are going for Bronze medals now! |pg||
nt|athene: but since dummy doesn't have any entry, it's going to be hard|pg||

nt|rnmalik: checks in both majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2@S better contract for NS|pg||

nt|santyclz: But to do that you have to take a finesse rather than playing for the squeeze.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a good duck|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 6@D are ON with finese in @S and squeeze @S/@H in the end|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting @S @H squeeze vs W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this means that isn't a good slam to call :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mariner1: 3@C puppet stayman, looking for a 5 card major from W|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|mariner1: now 3N by W|pg||
nt|mariner1: could W be thinking @c slam?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Getting the normal @s lead, since they bid @hs and @ds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: too big    means e/w  will make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: no info about the other matches - just half time results|pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have played very well this half and exerted a lot of pressure on Top Bridge|pg||
nt|april7: I am back. 3 @S is probably for the minors and 5@C was a good decision because 3NT fails as we can see. If you bid well you are also lucky, K of @C is finessable|pg||
nt|sybarra: we shall see if E can make this |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S confirms the 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: duck 1st @S best play|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so we will go to the closed room after we have finished here, and watch the exciting finish|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sorry, was thinking w was declarer.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that is a very red @S :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would it matter if W had 4?|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a violation of Burn's Law (Rules) here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: swich to the 9 @D easy enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: swish|pg||
nt|santyclz: Which black suit should s lead?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me E was looking for 4/4 @H fit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: Shudn't make - but....|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so now its a psuedo|pg||
nt|ady: need  to play in a careful order    must knock out A@C   early   |pg||

nt|sybarra: not that this slam is easy to bid |pg||
nt|mariner1: next session here in 27 minutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Christian|pg||

nt|rnmalik: for that .............................CU|pg||

nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt dangerous here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: how do you play 3 @D here |pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland has more Germany and many other excellent vugraphs on the|pg||
nt|mariner1: schedule..... he has been busy!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yw :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: E very timid not bidding here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after East's double on the last board, I was sure he would bid 2@S over 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room S passed in 1st seat which helped too|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: mini splinter ..thats a cool bid |pg||
nt|athene: well, he has more than a mini-splinter|pg||
nt|sybarra: or even 2 @S?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: 5@D is the correct game|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay very well   can certainly make 12 tricks    but they only need to bid game for a nice swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Grand?|pg||
nt|ady: may have been more chance if south had opened 1 club and reversed to 2@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of matches, and have flat hands,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: E wants no part of 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also slam in @d is playble|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|santyclz: And dimples in your ,.. er ... posterior.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: better contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: @DA is shown |pg||
nt|ady: there is A@C off   and 1 diamond trick will often bed lost to this combination|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mariner1: @D lead helps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I really do not 1 nt on 5422 patterns |pg||
nt|sybarra: *do not like|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just never works well for me |pg||
nt|ady: it has become more popular these days|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D lead helps here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@D need @D 2/2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: same contract as open room|pg||
nt|sybarra: old fashioned me just hates it |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: Rdbl showing first round @D control|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S really promised only a raise to 3@H with stiff spade, then clearly east has loads of entras|pg||
nt|athene: extras|pg||
nt|jbgood: a big chance for Topbridge to regain some ground here|pg||
nt|athene: and must force to slam when his partner bids 4@C|pg||
nt|jtr: 37|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to bid 4@H by South would need 2key + Q or 3 key|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: my spy tells me it is 4@h in CR too|pg||
nt|athene: i think he should just take control with 4NT over 4@C|pg||
