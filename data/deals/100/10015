nt|snorris: 2 @hs north?|pg||
nt|xenya: a partial for starters|pg||
nt|xenya: is it a weak NT or strong?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 15-17 seems to fit the bill|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: the @H fit found thix should propel  them to game |pg||

nt|xenya: hardly matters here|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: well..|pg||
nt|xenya: but the uaction might be interesting with all those misfits|pg||

nt|snorris: well..e-w are endplayed all the time more or less|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer must be careful here -- the one thing he shouldn't do is draw trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|enachou: with @h sure :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes, a @c would have been a better lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hantveit: Difficult for EW to get 6 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: UPS...|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer would have been in trouble if trumps were 4-1  |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he is trying to find a line that would cater for the bad break|pg||

nt|snorris: guessing -1|pg||

pc|h5|nt|arvidsson: alltså efter 1 sp, för att undvika att fi kommer in|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: And good day to Frank Budai|pg||

nt|werge: Best spot here is 2 @H E/W - or 1 @H...|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @cs vs 3@d|pg||
nt|hantveit: close hands again, 21-19 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 20/20 -- some competition here? |pg||
nt|andyv:  2 way partials |pg||
nt|andyv:  but E/W should buy it for 2@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|werge: Not my cup of tee, such a suit-quality for a weak two - and now 2 @H will not be the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: Would everyone consider wk 2 opening E hand? Looks light to me although it is on a favarobale vuln.|pg||
nt|prof 1: i think 3@d ppp|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but EW rate to win the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 1N here?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|werge: Why let the opponents go down, if you can manage to do it yourself...|pg||
nt|prof 1: i wonder who is thinking|pg||
nt|raghavan: Trend of boards in this set may be more part scores than games & slams|pg||
nt|snorris: a conservative pass in s|pg||
nt|xenya: not now maybe|pg||
nt|enachou: there 1sa is the contract on NS but impossible to play 1sa when you play 1sa forcing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: max:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: looking for trick 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello again |pg||
nt|sybarra: and she made 6 @H well done |pg||
nt|werge: Nobody|pg||
nt|hussein2: Can this 3@d make? Doesn't look bad on 10@s lead. W might get endplayed |pg||
nt|sybarra: may need to play ace and a @D |pg||
nt|werge: In practice you are 1 down in 3 @D|pg||
nt|prof 1: -1 at least|pg||
nt|hussein2: If E did not exit with @h, her p will get endplayed!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|snorris: I would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree Snorri, it seems like a minor fight, but 3spades NS is not a bad contract either|pg||
nt|andyv:  can it ever be right to balance with 1@d in these situations?|pg||
nt|xenya: a fairly routine 4@H for NS -- but also a fine save for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: north may come to regret her reponse here|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless she drops the auction right now|pg||
nt|april7: N should pass otherwise NS ends up in an unmakable game contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am surprised that with 19 south did not make a more robust /forcing rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the K @S sets up J @S for 7th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: 2@H är naturligt men med @C-håll skulle jag tro|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 2 hj alerteras antagligen för att det visar håll i kl|pg||
nt|minnie lee: lokks like 2@d. N has no bid because of the @h bid in W|pg||
nt|hantveit: Agree, think 1spade is an obvious bid for me also, too difficult to bid it later.|pg||
nt|snorris: would be otherwise if s bid @s first time|pg||
nt|xenya: yes it can it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't do justice to his hand|pg||
nt|xenya: well E is there...|pg||
nt|frankaus: that say 4@H by opps  is a transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: S's hand to strong for 1@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@S and back @S 7th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Cover...|pg||
nt|andyv:  how about a simple dbl over 1@d?|pg||
nt|frankaus: trafic light say green|pg||
nt|lestergold: south knew when to underbid her hand!!!|pg||
nt|april7: might be angry about teh pqass by NS but after seeing the dummy.....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tjolpe:  Det stÃ¤mmer|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 Clubs for NS seems better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead will now make a extyar lub for a heart discard|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: you make a most natural lead from KQ10x and, of course, it costs a trick -- always happens to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: E exiting a @D hoping NS do something else to help|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: 2 @D must must multi, including a big bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just guess I am afraid since I do not have their conv. cards |pg||
nt|xenya: the key feature here is the double fits for both sides |pg||
nt|lestergold: extra cklub|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|arvidsson: intressant om man felaktigt spelar spader till Q och ruter|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Man kan gÃ¥ bet om man tar tvÃ¥ ronder trumf och misslyckas i sÃ¥vÃ¤l spader som ruter.|pg||
nt|xenya: but E opted to sarifice ven without knowing that|pg||
nt|frankaus: the light 1@S overcall has done the trick here|pg||
nt|xenya: *even|pg||
nt|enachou: strange lead from N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and once y lead 4th best y play in to AJ doubleton:) tough|pg||

nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|xenya: all woiuld have been easy for EW had E opened 1N -- but it looks like they are playing a strong 1@C|pg||

nt|xenya: now he can get 2 club ruffs|pg||

pc|cA|nt|werge: Ils ont filé le coup, like the french say|pg||

nt|hussein2: loll|pg||
nt|hussein2: Lucky Nessrine! |pg||
nt|sybarra: just any high card in dummy pls |pg||
nt|hussein2: She will play the Q|pg||
nt|prof 1: no it is the worst return but the only chance to avoid the end play|pg||
nt|werge: One good thing to be said abaout Easts defence - she did not use the information, Wests hesitation in secend round of @D had given!!!|pg||
nt|prof 1: she has the J  u dont see|pg||
nt|sybarra: are they playing with screens?   I would assume so |pg||
nt|werge: But screens do not eliminate hesitation during PLAY|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|pelu: she forgot to count her tricks - had to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello peter |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes needed one ruff in hand |pg||
nt|pelu: hi Sherley|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hussein2: WD Hussein :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
nt|andyv:  if playing a strong club, doesn't dbl show a 17-19 NT hand in this situation?|pg||
nt|enachou: S can't guess that K@c is a singleton|pg||
nt|enachou: it's not good to lead a K singleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: malani should get the credit for this swing should it not be replicated in the CR|pg||
nt|xenya: well actually you don't need any ruffs here to set it 2 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: south would have been better sticking to @S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: but the @C's are foing to come home |pg||

nt|raghavan: Wc Taymour|pg||

nt|rnmalik: part score available here|pg||
nt|frankaus: openings not what they used to be either will N open ?|pg||
nt|enachou: i think N think opening 2 or 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w combined 25 but the duplication adn unkind layout looks like any game bid is doomed|pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone gets too aggressive here is in the soup|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score hand more of Gulash type-can be swing board|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 1 bricka som kan skapa lite imp NS har en bra zon offring i 5kl mot 4hj|pg||
nt|werge: A grown-up NT!|pg||

nt|mariner1: EW could be pushed too high|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tjolpe:  Anders, vet jag inte, kanske 10-11|pg||
nt|xenya: of course 1@C was natural|pg||
nt|frankaus: if N opens will E X for T/O and will W leave it in? |pg||
nt|enachou: 2@h there is bicolor @h and minor 54+ weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s being the obvious candidate|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: N more likely i think -- but we shall see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it might not be so bad for EW, North might lead his partner's suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: N will push|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Tommmys 12:e, Morats 11:e Bjerregårds 6:e Axdorphs 3:e och Berik o Östbergs 2:a  ... tack Carina Westlin|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Man or mouse?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: och i 4 hj måste man spela spadern på rätt sätt|pg||

nt|pelu: and 2@S now|pg||
nt|raghavan: will bid 4 H|pg||
nt|andyv:  very borderline 4th seat opener|pg||
nt|xenya: to say the least|pg||
nt|frankaus: now on the way to 3@C then ?|pg||
nt|xenya: naturally S tries to find N's other suit|pg||
nt|enachou: 2@s is asking for the 2e color|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@D P,P, P ???|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S!|pg||
nt|xenya: i expect to see something like 4N from N at some point|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@S by W and 2NT by N would it not show both minors|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W might push himself too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  Man|pg||
nt|andyv:  must have been lead directing:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: and goes down |pg||
nt|pelu: dont even think of bidding now Catherine :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D opener on the S hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: then I have a rebid (2 @C) |pg||
nt|minnie lee: S won't hold 3NT with his @d position|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am not a fan of this treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: kanske eframsson bjuder 5 hj?|pg||
nt|timmy5: doesnt need heart split actually to win 4h|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's is ok for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but my pard may still bid 2 @S with 6 of them |pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt I say "wait and see"|pg||
nt|sybarra: W knows where the high cards are |pg||
nt|andyv:  -200 or -300 very possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: can N pass now?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: mind you if south leads singleton diamond (a poor choice with qjx trumps) it could let the game thru|pg||
nt|april7: its close to a mirror hand and if EW reach 4 @S E can't make it .Depends on @D play whether 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT must have been a 3 card @S raise it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: S had a DBL to me|pg||
nt|xenya: both 4@H and pass by S are somewhat mysterious |pg||
nt|yo_yo: if only to shut north up|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but NS have not been on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|daman: whatever happened to drury?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont see point as i said|pg||
nt|april7: better than @D singleton, no spare trump|pg||
nt|xenya: ah there comes 4N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to save worst result S should have DBL..ED.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: playing WJS (weak 2@S/2@H) over 1@C N would bid 2@S |pg||
nt|lestergold: only when you find pard with two quick entries and get two ruffs would this work|pg||
nt|xenya: they have no red cards?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: en straf om han gissar spadern, och det gör han. 6 IMP till Everfresh|pg||
nt|minnie lee: well, I'm wrong|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not pass 3nt with souths hand. |pg||
nt|frankaus: i guess N happy for 50's even quite a few of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: why not|pg||
nt|hantveit: If heart is not breaking you are gone, you have more tricks in 4H|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 tricks in NT, 5 tricks in H|pg||
nt|timmy5: his partner told him i have a good holding in diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: also i'm puzzled by W's 1N (instead of 1@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hardly N has found the best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: oh W has got one|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the phantom save|pg||
pc|h8|nt|arvidsson: efter att fått in kl A på E är gissning ganska enkel|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get messy |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|minnie lee: I wouldn't either, but that's what makes bridge: you've got to trust youor partner|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe, but the fact remains that one of them has forgotten the system|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Vid ett borde till spelades 5 klÃ¶ver, som gick hem efter spadersex ut!|pg||

nt|timmy5: u never know if pd holds jack of hearts|pg||
nt|hantveit: no, you do not know :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think 1N showed spades|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: may be more of a preempt|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: oh oh,  defense didnt find all of their tricks I think |pg||
nt|snorris: north ha sto be careful|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  spade shift by S would have been quick curtains|pg||
nt|frankaus: in not certain they forgot - many would pass 2@S to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|xenya: S meant 2@S as pass or correct: N has to pass with @Ss and bid his suit otherwise |pg||
nt|xenya: the word "save" doesn't even seem to apply here, Rob |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|timmy5: very dangerous contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: error|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: always run if Xed|pg||
nt|lestergold: now cant make|pg||
nt|april7: the lead makes the contract makable because of double finesse in @D, what by itself E couldn't find it|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|werge: Wests hand seems perfect for 1 NT AFTER javing doubled 1 @C!|pg||
nt|werge: having|pg||
nt|xenya: why should N be so anxious about EW making game?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|arvidsson: nu behövs ingen spader giss längre|pg||
nt|hantveit: Has winning chances, but need to guess hearts og clubs right. Mabye he can get an endplay in spades|pg||
nt|snorris: think his best chanse is cash @cs  and @hs and endplay east so he gets @s up to aq|pg||
nt|raghavan: PlayH and play 4th H - he gets 2 S|pg||
nt|minnie lee: or he could be very bold and play @h to the 10|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: oh dear if north didnt cover she was off|pg||
pc|s6|nt|werge: Claim|pg||
nt|lestergold: couldnt gwet back to dummy to repeat the finesse|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hantveit: When east is showing out in clubs, the chance for finessing the hearts is increasing|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like 1N may have been alerted at table|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|arvidsson: utan stöld reser bara klövern|pg||

pc|s8|nt|werge: Not many flat boards up to now|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5 clubs on his right shows hearts with East|pg||
nt|hantveit: to topplay the hearts is with the odds, 52,4% as you have 7 cards and are missing a critical card|pg||
nt|snorris: should see it now.. or who has @d eight?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|pc|c3|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh she does with 9s its true|pg||
nt|april7: 9 of @S is in dummy|pg||

nt|mariner1: BTW if S wanted to compete over 4@S instead of DBL he could bid 4N for|pg||
nt|mariner1: takeout, so a DBL to me would be 100% penalty|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: may hear a larger @D bid from W however |pg||

nt|sybarra: this seems a kicked up version,  like a transfer now? |pg||
nt|timmy5: ihad a feeling 3nt was coming|pg||
nt|hantveit: he went for the practical bid, not the rush with a good partner. You bid 3di and partner bids 3spades with no spade stopper.|pg||
nt|minnie lee: when you have a bi-colour hand, bid it! I think N should have bid 2@d|pg||

pc|cK|pg||

nt|timmy5: or 6d?|pg||
nt|minnie lee: or 6@d?|pg||

nt|snorris: 6@cs in north a possibility|pg||
nt|snorris: here|pg||
nt|xenya: -3?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S X would be quite expesive|pg||
nt|xenya: something starnge has happened in the play here -- why didn't N pitch the @S loser?|pg||
nt|april7: now we have a grand!|pg||
nt|daman: the grand salami|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will do well to bid it with confidence we can count 13 top tricks but they have to count them in the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have excellent save in 7h if they are allowed to play there|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S  3 or 4@D or only 2 and if NS finds their good fit in @C and the void in @H the grand is bidable|pg||
nt|lestergold: or 7d for that matter|pg||
nt|april7: 7@D might push NS to 7@S!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has all the potential for a brief but exciting auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has a difficult decision as to what to open|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 4s|pg||
nt|april7: without oponents bidding its easy:1@S 2@C 4@H and so on|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Avram but at this vulnerability east would be  in even over a 4s openere|pg||
nt|daman: this is a baby grand   not getting there would be cause to revamp your bidding system|pg||
nt|lestergold: a baby gfrand George with no interference yes|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S X is also possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the baby might grow into a stroppy teenager|pg||
nt|daman: with warts|pg||
nt|xenya: very well done by EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S here EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west didnt bid his full value imo|pg||
mb|4S|nt|raghavan: He will open 1D|pg||
nt|hantveit: they did bid 1spade on board 2 in the open, gaining 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: teoretiskt, ja|pg||
nt|werge: That was what West ought to have played...|pg||
nt|werge: Here 140 is a cood score for E/W|pg||
nt|raghavan: so may be in D contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: 2d for majors|pg||
nt|snorris: 6@ds also ok|pg||
nt|hantveit: if 2 shows both major, I think I would prefer 4 spades here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d not enuf!!|pg||
nt|daman: will get there now   3@C by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 5d?|pg||
nt|daman: then 5NT|pg||
nt|daman: to make sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: But can be a bit hard to give up the 3nt so early|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: Scania behöver 21 IMP på 8 brickor samtidigt som antingen Everfresh eller Hans-Ove behöver tappa 10|pg||

pc|dK|nt|pelu: nexi 12 IMP for Egypt from the 4@H misplayed - 3NT making in Open|pg||

nt|sybarra: website but they are not posting results that I can find |pg||
nt|hantveit: I prefer to give as much information I can to my partner, look how difficult it is now for North. |pg||
nt|hantveit: 4 hearts would make things very easy for North.|pg||
nt|timmy5: but 6sp is not bad at all|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 5spades now, and they might still find 6D|pg||
nt|minnie lee: 6@c would help alot|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, 6spades do not look too bad. -3 is it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have th eright idea but not taking up enough space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S from Nabil?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1NT by S the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 for me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely not, vulnerable|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: take a look at the venue! |pg||
nt|timmy5: yes|pg||

nt|mariner1: E can't hold what I need for slam and I want to be in game|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 2 sp eller x?|pg||
nt|raghavan: How to enter Yousry hand in 5S|pg||
nt|hantveit: there is the pass...|pg||
nt|hantveit: With single heart, spade ace, and club ace and king there should be possible for north to bid 6d now|pg||
nt|minnie lee: last hand a pass on 3NT and now no help to play a grzat contract...either in @c or @d|pg||
nt|raghavan: Vul is a fear|pg||
nt|snorris: a  better bid in north was 5@cs instead of 5 @ds|pg||
nt|minnie lee: the best bid was 2@h|pg||
nt|snorris: then south would bid 6 |pg||
nt|timmy5: this delay might prevent east west from bidding 6spds|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would not reveal my hand  by bidding C|pg||
nt|timmy5: if N-S bid 6ds|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, only 6 losers and a good 5 card suit, so 5 clubs is a good bid. But the negative is a little bit weak trumph|pg||
nt|xenya: excellen slam here -- think they'll get there|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H slam here|pg||
nt|daman: has to bid 7 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north lost the plot in this auction|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT is so simple|pg||
nt|daman: my mother would bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east west may get awy with a save in 7h doubled if tghey do they will make a massive profit|pg||
nt|april7: whay 3 @S? if the @C are rigid then 13 tricks in @C so 5NT was best forN|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N is brave|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice call by W here|pg||
nt|xenya: also purposeless i think|pg||
nt|xenya: i meant brave and purposeless|pg||
nt|yo_yo: samjee will probably bid now, after what we saw previously|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he might be trying to generate a swing,,,,,,, being behind|pg||
nt|mariner1: is N thinkin or E|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjurn: jag hade föredragit Dbl|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: now @S X|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3S was an awful lost opportunity|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kamras: Eftyer att ha förnekat 3-korts är väl Ax ok att bjuda 2Sp på|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 6@Cs but at @C-lead will make life hard for decl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in case of some values with this is a ploy for a scrafice against 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: all you achieve is show declarer your distribution, because you can't seriously hope to win the auction here |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|werge: 3 trump-loosers and - at least - 1 @D|pg||
nt|raghavan: take a + score|pg||
nt|hantveit: This will most likely be a gain for East West|pg||
nt|snorris: a good board for e-w again|pg||
nt|timmy5: very good actually|pg||
nt|raghavan: Kope does not lead CK|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope|pg||
nt|timmy5: if they dont get heart ruff will be even better|pg||
nt|frankaus: will make 13 i expect|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is too powerful to stop short of 6@H|pg||
nt|xenya: not at these colours|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: 7 makes on a trump finesse -- so it shouldn't be bid |pg||
nt|daman: this is a joke really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes now what? n/s cannot guess their way to the grand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|arvidsson: nu skulle sivve sitta vid bordet|pg||

nt|bjurn: jo, men visar inte dubbelt också acceptans för @Sn?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hade inte 2nt visat 4-6 i @d @c?|pg||

nt|april7: very good bid by S!!!|pg||
nt|daman: comedy of errors|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they did oh my i preictedf an exciting auction but i could not have dreamt this one up for a hefty pay packet|pg||
nt|daman: EW will have a hard time explaining this to their team|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear the excellent save pushed them to the grand they couldnt find by normal bidding|pg||
nt|april7: S can't imagine a void in @H with N and only  15 HP,so must bid 7!!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|werge: After 4 boards, 31 IMP´s at stake|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S was a real reach imo  |pg||
nt|hussein2: One important fact here; this zonals is being played in Sharm El-Sheikh wich is extremly hot at the moment -- keeping in mind the wethear, I am sure ladies will tend to swing ...|pg||
nt|hussein2: seeking some cool air :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and a nice sequence|pg||
nt|rnmalik: reasonable contract and should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the trouble with bidding 4@H, partner gets carried away|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tror x är det mest flexibla budet, när rutern är så dålig|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: they will know they miss a KC|pg||

nt|mariner1: well 4@H here has no purpose either,,,,,,,, E can't have what W needs as a|pg||
nt|mariner1: passed hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true|pg||

pc|h4|nt|raghavan: good|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: are we headed to 6 @C or 5 @C?|pg||
nt|pelu: if u play '1430' u can bid 4NT now : 5@C = 1 A and u pass and 2@H = 2Acws and u bid 6@C|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: he needs AQ @S A@C and K@D  from a passed hand... A@H would not help|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kamras: Visst Björn, men kanske inte Hx. 2NT kanske överdriver rutern. Svår avvägning mellan dessa tre bud|pg||
nt|sybarra: the sequence of pulling to 4 @C should make @C slam easy to bid  |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|pelu: to make 6@C u need to set up the @S-suit or ruff 3 red cards in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a commentators curse comment |pg||
nt|pelu: ok 1 down in 4@S with a play for 6@C - Reunion have a bad start on this match|pg||

nt|rnmalik: asking for feature?|pg||

nt|sybarra: may get too high here |pg||
nt|enachou: i think 3@c is not forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead beats it|pg||

nt|xenya: seems dubious to me though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he does have a @D play IF he plays K@D from hand 1st, which is counter|pg||
nt|mariner1: intuitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: man duckar andra spadern?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there are many variations after weak 2 and 2NT-some partnerships play singleton-some honour in a side suit etc|pg||
nt|enachou: that show 6@c 16 17pts|pg||
nt|santyclz: It was one which required "Least Lie" bidding.  I guess mixing a @c up in your @ss is probably the best thing you can do.|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have done well to bid 4s which i think is infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: needs careful management tho|pg||

nt|werge: - or is East planning a RD?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: contemplating going for 800 or 650|pg||

nt|tjolpe:  3NT av VÃ¤st gÃ¥r vÃ¤l inte att beta|pg||
nt|pelu: I would have bid 3@D in S - they play 4 card @D opening - 2@D= 11+|pg||
nt|snorris: not the best contract|pg||
nt|timmy5: but almost normal|pg||
nt|hantveit: It is terrible to feel you are doing everything wrong, easy things are suddenly hard. I had the same feeling last sunday, for those of you who watched...|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|lestergold: well hard to make this as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: bid your hand first time - this could cost a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @D also,  maybe I can keep them out of the bidding |pg||
nt|xenya: should be a quick 1 off on this lead|pg||
nt|april7: this contract is goind as also 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: hjowever defence has to find the spade switch after the forced dim duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho what else can east play she cannot play passive with that club suit sitting in front of her eyes|pg||

nt|mariner1: this looks flat though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Det tog lite längre tid att komma till samma kontrakt som i slutna rummet. Larsson gör allting snabbt|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes|pg||

nt|lestergold: well north decided not to duck so it will go off easily|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|werge: What can East possibly have been thinking after partners bid - at 3-level and in a suit, where you have K D B 4 - the answer is not very polite...|pg||
nt|werge: And 3 NT is no winner, 8 tricks are not enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @D he makes 5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: @C to A and 3! @C-ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c seems pretty unilateral here...i guess the pass cards were missing|pg||

nt|hantveit: yes, 4sp is a fine contract|pg||
nt|minnie lee: I am a sceptic so when I see 2@c bid, I would lead A@c to see the dummy and when the Q falls small @c because I have 1-2 potential tricks to get back with the @c again|pg||

nt|april7: N will finesse the @H correctly,why not @C lead? needs very little from partner|pg||
nt|daman: @Cs were bid and supported|pg||
nt|daman: partner is like to be void    that's why|pg||

nt|april7: communication problems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: nortyh houild be asking herself why did east lead a short heart?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mariner1: K@S|pg||

nt|timmy5: iam in the adjacent room so ill do that 4 u|pg||
nt|hantveit: Thank you! :)|pg||
nt|xenya: for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score battle here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|raghavan: may reach 5C|pg||
nt|hantveit: By the way, we have beautifull sunshine here in Oslo today, very nice...|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5 clubs is a beautifull contract, but how to reach it?|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5d is even a better saving|pg||
nt|snorris: if north opens|pg||
nt|hantveit: Must open 1 clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, EW have got 11 cards in @Ss... |pg||
nt|xenya: can they do better now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: They did *very* well last hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s by n/s cold as cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: weak 2 by W and 4 @S by S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Dom kommer kanske i 4@H här, men den går att beta|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers, so the hand is worth an opening bid, but the danger is that partner starts to dbl...|pg||
nt|raghavan: they have 44 fit in S |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n also|pg||
nt|april7: what doesX mean now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S i suppose, no ruffing values|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score board-but E can be end played for making 41S|pg||
nt|xenya: NS are in danger of getting too high here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: 2 over 1|pg||
nt|april7: hoping that W has a 2@H opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  Den gÃ¥r i vart fall inte att spela hem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H normalt svagare än en 2@H öppning, i alla fall som jag spelar|pg||
nt|hantveit: ouch|pg||
nt|timmy5: ouch ?|pg||
nt|snorris: d: take out|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl over 4 clubs is showing secondary support in major and cards, east might pass|pg||
nt|timmy5: yes ofc|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Vul fear|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: if it shows major fit, then take out|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H has a play here, so 4@S looks like a good save|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Great sac.  The only problem is 4@h may not make.|pg||
nt|xenya: but 5@H is hopeless|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kamras: Deras är ca 4-8 hp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Inte N-S här |pg||
nt|timmy5: never pass|pg||
nt|xenya: as i see it that is|pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: Hard work for North - he also bids his partners cards...|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d holding may persuade E to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks after this lead|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you x then pard bids freely over 1 nt  dont you bid again? maybe I am wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that EW is cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see a way, but that doesn't mean there isn't one.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes there is a way to make 5@H|pg||
nt|xenya: but it takes perfect reading |pg||
nt|enachou: no way i think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|snorris: 4@hs: showing both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored minor cards make this difficult|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hantveit: never say never :) We have seen it all, and done it all, havent we?|pg||
nt|timmy5: 5clb if anyone bids it will get doubled|pg||
nt|snorris: and now...|pg||
nt|snorris: undisiplined 5@cs?|pg||
nt|enachou: 1@s 1@h and 1@s|pg||
nt|enachou: @c|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see one, but I've seen many hands where top players make things single-dummy that I can't see dbl-dmy.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm willing to bet even papi couldn't make 6@cs.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: so maybe let them play here,  true |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt notice the 4 S possibilities|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the dbl on 4 clubs is explained as TO, I think I would bid 5 clubs there|pg||
nt|xenya: for one thing, you can take a double finesse in @Ds, secondly, you can through W in with 3rd trump |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: but I would support to 3@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  i don't like 3@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not the right player to play 3NT-@D lead |pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like mp bid|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to get @Cs right too of course|pg||
nt|april7: ace and then Q of @S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: E made a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so...seems like E wasn't sure where he wanted to play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vassilis Virvidakis shows me the way to make 5@h.  Double finesse @ds and guess @cs.  Thanks.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hantveit: Finally, a good pickup for NS|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|snorris: first good board for n-s |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: but his pass over 3N looks ill-judged -- unless he is not sure about 6 @Hs in the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand certainly doesn't merit a slam try opposite a minimum 4-6 hand|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: I would have bid 3 @H |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  W painted a picture of exactly what he held... not much to misinterpret.|pg||
