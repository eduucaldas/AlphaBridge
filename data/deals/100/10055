nt|vugraphzqt: last 2 in this round ...next round  there will be Bamberger reiter again|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session after a short break,,,,,,, in 25 minutes or so from now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could make all tricks playing the squeeze @S/@C vs East and finesse in @S|pg||
nt|stc: NS played a very good match and will be surprised to be behind :(|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1NT doubled would have been more interesting|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think North would need to lead 8C from A82 to beat it (not necessarily on opening lead!)|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H by NS and 3@S by W|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: B 10 corrected on -3 ( 300) after TL decition|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: time late 8 mi for 2 boards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: next session here in 120 minutes or so|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's a little harsh|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: because od undefinend claim by declearer|pg||
nt|stc: here 4@h may be made if guessing in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: this looks bad for Topbridge.. but Studentene will have to win by a margin to overtake them|pg||
nt|sybarra: not that this slam is easy to bid |pg||
nt|mariner1: next session here in 27 minutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Christian|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 5 @D makes here|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 6@D can make|pg||
nt|eggy: why so?|pg||
nt|april7: was not guessed in OR|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@S mini splinter|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to get to 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for that .............................CU|pg||
nt|mariner1: Santy is making dinner for all!|pg||
nt|ady: 13 tricks   seems a lot in OR|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|eggy: it was automatically -3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess he can lose an extra one if they play a diamond and he ruffs in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|stc: I think it was -3 on @d and -2 on @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Kondoch played a small @d from Hand ....and declearer said i ruff but not where in Hand or Dummy .......|pg||
nt|eggy: a club is OK to because of teh heart blockage|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt dangerous here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They have some chance to pick up on the last two|pg||
nt|stc: the two big swings in OR were more or less unforced errors|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: indeed ....2 hands enough to come back for rehder team|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: how do you play 3 @D here |pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland has more Germany and many other excellent vugraphs on the|pg||
nt|mariner1: schedule..... he has been busy!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yw :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct-no choice but to play KQ@H|pg||
nt|stc: the %play seems to be to finess the J|pg||
nt|rnmalik: you mentioned swing board:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am poor at that-8 cards with me I like to play straight|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: E very timid not bidding here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after East's double on the last board, I was sure he would bid 2@S over 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room S passed in 1st seat which helped too|pg||
nt|motbocaj: I don't much like overcalling 2@C with this type of hand, would rather double and live with a 2@D response|pg||
nt|eggy: why did it matter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: mini splinter ..thats a cool bid |pg||
nt|athene: well, he has more than a mini-splinter|pg||
nt|sybarra: or even 2 @S?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: 5@D is the correct game|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay very well   can certainly make 12 tricks    but they only need to bid game for a nice swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Grand?|pg||
nt|ady: may have been more chance if south had opened 1 club and reversed to 2@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of matches, and have flat hands,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: E wants no part of 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also slam in @d is playble|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|santyclz: And dimples in your ,.. er ... posterior.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: better contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: @DA is shown |pg||
nt|ady: there is A@C off   and 1 diamond trick will often bed lost to this combination|pg||
nt|eggy: if she ruffs in dummy, she hasn't enough entries to establish the heart suit|pg||
nt|april7: there is also a convebtion:1@S 2@S shows exactly 4 @H and longer @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: B9 sorry (not 10)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Only needs two hearts and a ruff to cover the club losers and KC is an entry after unblocking|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S  a good save   -50     surprise  west sold out  at 2@H  OR|pg||
nt|april7: should bid 4@H, sometimes it even makes|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @C is big card|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: @D lead helps|pg||
mc|9|nt|sybarra: I really do not 1 nt on 5422 patterns |pg||
nt|sybarra: *do not like|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just never works well for me |pg||
nt|ady: it has become more popular these days|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D lead helps here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@D need @D 2/2 |pg||
nt|stc: going for trouble/double|pg||
pg||
