nt|Walddk8: It's a tournament for women only|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Does that explain it?|pg||
nt|jallerton: This one is, yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good morning|pg||
nt|col3435: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: NS play precision 12-15 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Our operator is Tobias Förster|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: EW play acol-based|pg||
nt|shevek: hello again|pg||
nt|shevek: here we go, close match, only 12 boards left|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the live score link is: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj|pg||
nt|col3435: 1@d slightly unusual even in Precision  - they must have some special meaning for 2@c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Martin, David and Nicoleta. Have fun!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|finch: West feels pleased to have a 20-count, followed by worry at being fourth in hand|pg||
nt|shevek: hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And a Multi opening to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the NS convention card misses the 2@d opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@d=weak2 in a M|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk7: I can guess where your heart is, Josef :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Josef Harsanyi originally from Hungary|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: Tobias, are they using screens?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: EW may easily get overboard here -- a trappy hand for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no|pg||
nt|finch: with the opponents NV, you never get first crack in fourth seat|pg||
nt|Walddk8: 2@H, and then 3@H by Cilleborg is enough|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mcarroll: W has a huge hand, and will probably support @Ss but the 5-1 split is merciless|pg||
nt|shevek: ok then we know where your @h is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H makes but will it be bid?|pg||
nt|shevek: but what was 1 @d  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W asking 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk7: True Nico|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W asking what N showed|pg||
nt|shevek: martin :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Obviously no problem for this NS|pg||
nt|projekt1: after a strong 1Nt and 2@d transfers superacccept  and south decides|pg||
nt|shevek: strong 1@d opening maybe|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: NS are likely to end up in 3N here -- probably going down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@d probable the "convenience diamond opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: 1@d doesn't say anything about @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: with clubs 4-4 there are eight tricks - and where's there's eight...|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead, but anything would work here it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk8: I don't think the hand is good enough for 4|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jallerton: well the auction is a bit cramped, I can understand 4@h|pg||
nt|jallerton: some case for 2NT to show the values|pg||
nt|finch: if the @SQ were in diamonds I like 4@H more|pg||
nt|Walddk8: It's a 6-loser hand opposite a partner who was asked to bid on a zero count. Surely 4@H is too much|pg||
nt|jallerton: opposite @sJxx 3NT could be the only making game|pg||
nt|jallerton: should duck the lead|pg||
nt|finch: ..smoothly|pg||
nt|finch: see if you can tempt South to continue them|pg||
nt|Walddk8: If partner can't raise 3@H to game, you won't have missed anything|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I wondered why N did not open 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they play variabel NT i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Looks like a standard game making either 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|projekt1: they open 11-14 hcp 1Nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: apart from maybe 3NT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: so they did get too high, but not by much, somewhat surprisingly|pg||
nt|xenya: except an unrealistic @D lead of course|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: 9 tricks can be easily made|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jallerton: desparately hoping for @cQJ onside - not much else to hope for|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d4|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|nt|jallerton: @dKQ doubleton I suppose|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj  for the results (i hope)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: Can actually make 4@S, 2@C, 4@D, 3@S and a @C ruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: good spade switch. No endplay chances now |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: i've got a feeling there was a 10th lurking somewhere -- but not now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: West would dump @HQ under the ace-king of course|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|d5|pg||

mc|10|nt|mcarroll: @H ruff en passant was the possibility|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Either 10 or 12 sorry - depending on @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|col3435: would have been in danger if the @d finesse was wrong - could take @d, @h, @c and a @h ruff|pg||
nt|projekt1: 6@c ?   a nice contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: terrorist 2@h|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
nt|projekt1: multi style|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: That was a good hand for opening as South, otherwise she would have defended an opening 2NT making|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this looks like a fairly straightforward 4@H for NS |pg||
nt|xenya: or 3N|pg||
nt|jallerton: still might have done had W chosen 2nT over 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the link to the live scores is:|pg||
nt|shevek: south shouldn't be afraid to show a 1-suited if available|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|xenya: canape to @Ss by S?|pg||
nt|projekt1: schönen Tag aus Bad Griesbach|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: N: 5@s 4@d 15-16|pg||
nt|shevek: pass or correct|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzpb: 1N=forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s=17-19 bal.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: leads? attitude|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N asked|pg||
nt|finch: lead will give the heart suit for four tricks|pg||
nt|finch: unfortunately that's only 8.  I wonder if there's a ninth somewhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: E has time to switch to @c|pg||
nt|jallerton: but then W might be endplayed|pg||
nt|finch: I think declarer can make it double dummy by playing on spades, but it's natural to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: as W's red cards will be stripped|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: W asked|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or 5@h 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: -500 not terrible|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3 down not bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: The 'obvious' line is to win the heart in hand and start on diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: probably @SK then @DQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: no can start with @d and switch to endplay line when @d turn out to be 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Seems so|pg||
nt|finch: that 9 of clubs is also a good card|pg||
nt|shevek: NS need to take a @c ruff...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|projekt1: Kriftner - Reim play Blue Club - 1 @C 17+, canape openers else, 1 NT 15-17|pg||
nt|projekt1: Jörg Fritsche, NPC of Germany sitting here too|pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H was relay, 2@S showed 15-16 with 5+@S, 4+@D|pg||
nt|projekt1: club lead kills,  every other allows to make it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: E has a choice betwwen @Cs and @Hs here -- seems N's 1@H was not natural |pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H could be 11-12 balanced without @H, so the choice was between @C and @H|pg||
nt|xenya: and she has found it|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: @c now|pg||
nt|shevek: misguess in @d though... can go for -800|pg||
nt|projekt1: would you bid instead of 4@h double 4Nt for the minors?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E wanted to pass but took the wrong card|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|finch: East has to duck the first diamond.  Looks very very silly if West has singleton @DK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|shevek: too late now|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|finch: On the second diamond it is tempting to duck to make communications more awkward|pg||
nt|finch: but against that East might be worried she'll never make it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|finch: with the clubs doubly stopped declarer can also make just by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: @c are not necessarily double stopped.  E could switch to @cJ from AJxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: and restricted choice and lack of @cJ lead might persuade declarer to play for that|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: now the defence should be easy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|finch: declarer now will now worry about losing 2 spades 2 diamonds and a club if she sets up diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|finch: so may now start on the spade suit, knocking out the K, 10|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|finch: ... although possibly not having ducked the first spade|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: True but it seems counter intuitive that the hand with a singleton trump is the threat of the vital ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: cashes @HAK just to avoid any nonsense|pg||
nt|shevek: north knew south didn't have @dsg or !K |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|finch: Jeffrey is confident declarer is going to make via an endplay.  I am worried she's going to try and endplay the wrong hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: East passed originally|pg||
nt|finch: Anyway, she can now go back to setting up diamonds... cash the heart discarding a spade and concede a diamond trick|pg||
nt|finch: the actual spade position looks quite plausible|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mcarroll: Still needs careful play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: anyway, easy when we see all hands|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jallerton: Did she need to play for @hJ to drop?|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  But the attitude lead should have given the heart position away.  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|finch: Unless the lead was from 832, but that looks an odd lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|shevek: lucky the short @c hand doesn't have trump left|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||

nt|shevek: 3NT looks like the normal spot here|pg||
nt|projekt1: if the Hungarian caan manage that South plays in 3 Nt?|pg||
nt|shevek: not sure Josef, pass would be resonable|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|shevek: west would dbl anyway|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|jallerton: potential canapé?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I think so|pg||
nt|jallerton: quite popular in Austria|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: E asked about 1@s ? natural ?|pg||
nt|shevek: so they might duplicate the result at the other table|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|shevek: everything is friendly, @s 3-3, @h 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: there is no canape from @Cs to @Ss available for S here as the 1@C opening would show a strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the answer was: yes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|maribelxx: Some unfortunate technical difficulties...|pg||
nt|finch: 4-card majors makes it hard for South to raise to 2H as partner could have 8532|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: from @Cs to @Hs i meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very annoying for East, that 2@S bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: Low from doubleton leads?|pg||
nt|finch: East's 2@C shows a good hand, but West wants to get out while the going is good|pg||
nt|jallerton: nothing wrong with a 4-3 fit at 2-level NV.  Makes life difficult for oppo|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: unlucky evaluation  of souths hand ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: y|pg||
nt|finch: but as NS I'd be very happy to be defending 2@C on this layout|pg||
nt|jallerton: ....if they can't be certain of your fit size|pg||
nt|projekt1: 2-way stayman  2@c the weaker |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: N asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sorry, I had to shut down due to open rooms conn problems|pg||
nt|maribelxx: They seem to have points but can they get 10 tricks here, I wonder|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT rightsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|maribelxx: she took her bid seriously :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I doubt it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- popular in Poland i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: asking leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2./4.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jallerton: Does 2@c imply interest in other strains?  If so, W should try 2@d|pg||
nt|finch: I wouldn't mind playing 4@S EW here.  Particularly if I could see the NS diamond cards first.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW know there is no 8 card Major fit so 3NT seems the obvius continuation rather than giving more info to opps|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpb: E consulting CC for leads|pg||
nt|shevek: MUD|pg||
pc|h4|nt|maribelxx: if it was lead directing or not....  she found a good lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|finch: 2@C has a fairly easy 8 tricks by ruffing two hearts in hand and cashing winners|pg||
pc|c5|nt|projekt1: if the safety   ( technically correct play play ) in @c will be choosen?  YES|pg||
pc|cK|nt|maribelxx: it gave nothing away in the minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: always|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like one or two down - no great deal, as EW can make eight or nine in hearts |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: same as NS do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, as a correspondent points out, 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: looks more than just 1 or 2 down to me, Mike -- i would bet on 3 at least |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that they were all that likely to bid it, though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, North can't get any club tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: really tough for declarer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|finch: the main thing to avoid is finessing into one of South's diamond honours|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E asking signales|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: smith low=enc.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, it's only 50's, as they say|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true|pg||
pc|d7|nt|maribelxx: a kib suggested a club lead...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|shevek: wd|pg||
pc|dK|nt|shevek: East correctly tried the weaker suit first|pg||
nt|shevek: if @s are 3-3 the suit can be cashed later|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|c7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|finch: discarding a heart from dummy is showing confidence: that's the stop for their suit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|maribelxx: I must admit that I have an aversion  of leading from Kxx.... might prefer spade|pg||
nt|maribelxx: if not finding hearts that is :)|pg||

nt|shevek: claiming the rest now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|maribelxx: the operator had to shut down and we lost the names of the players :(|pg||
nt|xenya: also, the defenders don't have to do anything brilliant to get their tricks|pg||

mb|1H|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|maribelxx: and we also lost the comparison, but you may use this: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj  for running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: hmm. 6@H looks very good for NS - until you look at the club suit|pg||
nt|xenya: a very good slam indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: 1Nt natural|pg||
nt|shevek: 11 tricks in 4@s here|pg||
nt|col3435: which suit should East choose?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzpb: south asked about 1N: nat.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|projekt1: unusual in Poland :)|pg||
nt|xenya: EW doing their utmost to stop NS from reaching it?|pg||
nt|shevek: depends how much he wants to be dummy :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: horrible problem for South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you hate to defend with a trump void, and also there is the considreation that slam chances must be good |pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately, no-one has bid hearts yet |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S asking|pg||
nt|shevek: not keen|pg||
nt|col3435: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=extras|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: west should pass this|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Ty operator for the names @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: your are welcome :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah. 3@S showed hearts.|pg||
nt|xenya: yet, if N's double is basically business, S has every reason to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed, North might (on a good day) have three trumps tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: which he did -- a lucky decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1N was frcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: this might make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzpb: S wants to remove her last pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD here|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I know you have very little time for extra typing when they are playing :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: missed a good penalty here|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Peter Eidt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she didn't see west 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass stands, 2@s also|pg||
nt|xenya: seems they are going to end up in 2@C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: not a happy contract|pg||
nt|mcarroll: probably 2 down|pg||
nt|projekt1: @c opening lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 4-0 spade split renders this unmanageable, I think. Just a question of how many off |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W: asking 1@d opening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be happy to see @CA in dummy - if 6@H is reached at the other table, it may very well go off |pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 1 off at worst|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes trump best lead|pg||
nt|xenya: stands out on this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: NS have balance of power, so lead trumps|pg||
nt|projekt1: discussing here why 2@s,,   why not 2@c?|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@s more discouraging|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: @C 10 lead, ducked, 3@H tricks and then no more?|pg||
nt|jallerton: needs to pick up @s for no loser and avoid a @d ruff to make 4@s.|pg||
nt|jallerton: with the @s layout a @d ruff won't be an issue|pg||
nt|finch: the percentage line in trumps is to play for the 10 onside|pg||
nt|jallerton: indeed, small to J on 1st round picks up @sAK10 with N as well|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: ugh|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now could get out for down 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: er..|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jallerton: (tripleton)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, W might decide to lead a @S against 6@H...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of permutations.If South is declarer, East may double for a diamond lead |pg||
nt|shevek: north doesn't want a conversation|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: on a trump lead, declarer can get 1@C, 3@Hs and 1@S, but that's all -- 3 down|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: Not sure why South played C!K there |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: yes, i agree|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will certainly be interesting to see what happens in the other room|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|finch: North would have thought hard about rising on the spade, because South's switch looks like a singleton|pg||
nt|shevek: Ctr C|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|finch: However, declarer would be unlikely to start with a low spade away from AQxxx knowing there is a risk of a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate - especially as S made 3NT in Open|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: Nice defence|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d6|nt|xenya: that @C return was not best|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: well concentration is required to play international bridge|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|projekt1: swinging between 1  and 2 down  ..|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see why she didn't ruff that @D|pg||
nt|projekt1: yes,  2@c and after any 2 red bid promises 2@s more|pg||
pc|c2|nt|maribelxx: I assume screens are used if she claims "not having seen the bid"|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no screens|pg||
nt|maribelxx: oh...|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure this is an optimum defence, but NS will think they are playing with house money, given the 6-1 club break    |pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: NS have rather given up control here|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, swinging between -200 and -500 -- quite a difference|pg||
nt|projekt1: I bet on 1 down|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East was a bit too passive there.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: one problem with those type calls is they become considerably less effective as|pg||
nt|mariner1: the level of opponents increases......... they need to be fit well into the overall|pg||
nt|mariner1: structure of a system|pg||
mb|1H|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should force more in @D here than in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW are finding out if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of tournaments and|pg||
nt|mariner1: have flat hands............|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial EW.... game off best defense|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has no reall attractive call here,,,,,,, I do not particularly like 1N with KQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, all calls seem to have one or more major flaws|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike do you like the 1N? (2@C regrettable @c might be my call)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: so EW must play some sort of forcing @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with KQ stiff, and 2@C should really be a better suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes NS, hard to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and has to play @D the only way that works|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what do you bid with S over the 1@S?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps this is the unbiddable hand|pg||
mc|11|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes, it is possible that EW next door may not get into the bidding, or, if they do, not find spades  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or maybe asking for @s stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: 1@h -2@h |pg||

nt|mdgraham: told board 4 in 6@H on a club lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going a few off|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes, lead-directing :)|pg||
nt|finch: it's ended with NS in a good contract for EW, so in that sense I agree with it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|finch: do you agree with 2@H (rather than 2@S)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: running scores are at  http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A certain swing here - Open N played 5@C dbl and made for 750|pg||
nt|maribelxx: partner has opened.... so whose game should this be?|pg||
nt|projekt1: 2@S might loose more|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: violated burns law|pg||
nt|mcarroll: HMM playing in a 3-3 fit not to be recommended|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: east looks twice on the dummy|pg||

nt|finch: do you agree with not passing out 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|shevek: west should keep all @cs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: on 19, Germany picked up 5 imps when the Polish women in the other bid to game but failed to make it on a less than optimal play|pg||
nt|col3435: well, 1@s can work out too - can get you to 2@c or 2@d when that's right|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why not @HQ, I wonder - that only loses to the king - oh, South has ducked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may regret that in a minute or so|pg||
nt|xenya: the duck is puzzling|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|projekt1: Ewa Harasimowicz is European Champion, perhaps she finds more tricks as GIB|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is all rather baffling - West had nine tricks there |pg||
nt|xenya: S can see what's going on here?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|finch: I assume North could be 4=3=2=4 which makes 2@H more attractive than 2@S|pg||
nt|finch: Possibly it makes passing out 2@Dx even more attractive|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: can we not claim at this point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she did due to lack of time as she said|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|col3435: well, it's more that opening a strong NT solves the problem of how to show your strength|pg||

nt|ady: good save by wales in OR  5@H|pg||

mb|r|mb|2N|nt|thegarve:  West is unlikely to save looking at least 3 defensive tricks|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ady: think South will have to get to 4@S herself|pg||
nt|dburn: so the Welsh West, Jean Hand, took a pretty good decision|pg||

nt|mariner1: @S off, @H off, at lead @c are 3 3,,,,,, @D could be worse|pg||

nt|finch: double dummy... although you might not in practice.  Anyway, why not play in your 11 card fit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: S may compete to 5@d over 5@c |pg||
nt|projekt1: we shall have some more exciting boards - hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: hearts are lying nicely, to put it mildly|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: 54 minors|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzpb: 3@c=5@c|pg||
nt|shevek: best possible layout :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now it depends on partnership - is 4@H natural or a cue in support of pd|pg||
nt|shevek: still not a maky  :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|projekt1: rebid of 1@S would have been 54 minors|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have obviously discussed this sequence - I have seen wheels come off in these auctions |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E consulting CC|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On board 15 the @C play  found here was missed in Open and so 3NT went down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: this wasn't the bidding - Tobias has just entered the final contract   |pg||
nt|projekt1: the well known safety combination  A9xx  KJxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: first K then 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: low to 9|pg||
nt|projekt1: to the 9|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S is just the final contract of course -- W did not open 3@S i'm sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I lost the trck here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: track|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't worry|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1N was the opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @d back|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @cA next|pg||
nt|xenya: no problem, Tobias|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@c for both Majors was the overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: west bid 3@s|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|finch: NS will be even more disappointed to find that 5@C was going off|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|projekt1: west could double 5@d  to clear the case ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: There are some strong teams in this event -  for more info the link is  http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/675|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|xenya: well 5@D can be made on a natural @H lead?|pg||
nt|shevek: north hoped for less in @ss nad more in @cs|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzpb: N asking signals|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E: count|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: or maybe not...|pg||
nt|shevek: and*|pg||
nt|projekt1: East reads also the best books :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: close anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: East asking N possible distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: 6@s 4-5@d possible|pg||
nt|projekt1: South try to imagine the promissed 15-16 hcp-s :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: perfect @H split for declaresIdea|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj is the link for running scores|pg||

nt|mariner1: penultimate board now|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes aggression backfired there|pg||
nt|mariner1: easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session........|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I am reminded "only 4 imps" |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes they were lucky there is this close a match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 imps in a 6 - 7 match is huge....... lead vs being behind|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: South missed an inference there - if North was strong, he could have bid 2@S for take-out a round earlier|pg||
mb|d|nt|thegarve:  maybe not if West cashes a@h v 4@S and underleads the @ds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@s  a make for e/w   |pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|finch: that would get you into the papers|pg||
nt|thegarve:  get 4@s two off|pg||
nt|mariner1: we started a little late so I am NOT sure when the next session from Greece|pg||
nt|mariner1: will start.|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule for the many vugraphs Roland has|pg||
nt|mariner1: scheduled this weekend! -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/s play a club system (perhaps orange club)  and 1 @D =07 |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might make 4@H here,,,,,,,, 3N has an issue|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: more plausible is one top diamond first|pg||
nt|ady: it is a possibility|pg||
nt|thegarve:  switch to q@d to get an enc/disc signal|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland has many excellent vugraphs on the schedule this weekend!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so there is an inference that North is just protecting with good shape  |pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   save to much if they find best defence|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|finch: if diamonds are 5332 with partner having the doubleton you look a bit silly underleading the first round|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: am told its a sort of polish club with variations |pg||
nt|mariner1: ok a @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think its very close to the orange club via Jan Jansma |pg||
pc|h2|nt|thegarve:  hmm|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|mariner1: and off from the top now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|finch: not sure what's percentage here. Partner could have singleton @SJ and declarer the @DJ|pg||

nt|jallerton: N/S haven't seen the trump promotion|pg||
nt|finch: @CQ not very relevant to the play in 5@D|pg||
nt|shevek: tight match|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass out of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: from North|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD here|pg||
nt|shevek: we're in trouble if it's condoned Tobi  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: East doesn't accept|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: 25-16 after 6 scored bds to croatia|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jallerton: easy to miss those things out when you have spent most of the time playing not analysing|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: Thats a relief - BBO does not cope with human error well lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: re hi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: re|pg||
nt|xenya: this doesn't look right|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: timid auction|pg||
mb|1N|nt|maribelxx: no protective dlb from north?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but it was a 20/20 split hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E looking at NS convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1@d=0+@d, bad clubs possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: :)  not possible to enter a bid out of turn?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: 9 either top or third|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is not going to make - |pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Weak NT seems to have a few followers in Denmark despite Roland's feelings on the matter|pg||
nt|shevek: unfriendly hand for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X or 5@d ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|finch: South has a fairly horrible lead problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she tought for a while|pg||
nt|finch: the three low diamonds not very tempting, but evertyhing else looks worse|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s= no 4@s|pg||
pc|dT|nt|shevek: of course east is considering a dbl  :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: Having pondered on the question David, in theory I think 4@H was an overbid but I also think I would give in to temptation at the table and hope pd has at least one useful feature |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S asking 2@d|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: not much to the play here|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the NS aggression may backfire here - East may raise 2NT to 3NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have Norway and Indonesia and many many more coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, he has passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 2@d  is the limit  n/s|pg||
nt|ady: I think 1NT better 2nd bit by east    |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: yes and not the easiest play,,,, is possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: good to see a player that knows an invitation can be refused|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mariner1: easier now|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|finch: I admit I'd have led my AK suit. Dummy is known to be short in diamonds|pg||
nt|thegarve:  why not a@H?|pg||
nt|granguru: establishing the @H might also help|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately (or rather not, as it is a flat board) this is an occasion when it would be a good time to accept |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: dont like A@D lead    why not A@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bad news in clubs, but good news in diamonds  |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: yes now has a couple of ways to make it and both work|pg||
nt|granguru: to avoid losing @Cs..the @C return made things much more easy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: so a push.,|pg||
nt|granguru: so it is a tie..in this board|pg||

nt|mariner1: many many more vugraphs coming up!  Roland has been busy!|pg||

nt|finch: that's a nice play in clubs. gains with Ax and also on this layout|pg||
nt|ady: spec has requested address to find previous results|pg||
pc|d9|nt|finch: although from South's perspective, if North's 5 was a true card it's either a singleton or J95|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|mariner1: well this is one of those STOM hands..... and could decide mathc|pg||
nt|mariner1: STOM - state of match|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might just bid at other table if they think they need it |pg||
