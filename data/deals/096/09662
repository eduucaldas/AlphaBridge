nt|ady: 4@H   to start of with n/s|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: But we won't know for sure until the very end when Jim has no fingernails left|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Majors|pg||
nt|ahh: this is a great hand should be throw in but no    every player has a bid |pg||

nt|ady: this the final segment?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Jon Sveindal|pg||

nt|roswolf: WELL IN WE JOLLY WELL GO - MICHAELS STRIKES|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do not want to sacrificie|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4s x 800 today|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Ed :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the conventional raise are full in all world |pg||
nt|othered1: Ew may get in here, as west has a normal to double of @S, if that's what double means, not just @H|pg||
nt|caitlin: I assume a X by West would show hearts not takeout|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a bad method|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi  Jon   Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D  10-15   4+  always unbalanced|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: 3@H invitational with 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: 2nt was lebensohl |pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 5 major it is important to distinguish between 4 and 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning all and welcome back to Copenhagen|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Goodmorning everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning Nadia and John|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahh: asking north to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 3@H is too high on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you don't always get that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mafia13: Hi Roland.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north not wasting any time|pg||
nt|roswolf: shortish and sweet|pg||
nt|lestergold: east had better take his violin away quietly|pg||
nt|caitlin: Why a bad method Ed?|pg||
nt|ady: 3H!   invitational I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, 6+@h and invit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|idc: It looks like 3@c was making|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Nu er vi klar|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm... diofficult to find the lead hdere|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Difficult lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: from AQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does S have enough to act? not much but nearly all of it probably working. with 4 hearts X obvious, but even so, i am wondering...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean over 1S|pg||
nt|dburn:  perhaps in this system clubs could be significantly longer than diamonds, hence 4NT and not 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I think 5@c in stead of 4nt would be @c-canape|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's it, David|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: hi guys|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no bloodshed and therefore no fun for the specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Anders|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi anders|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume west's double was a  support double|pg||
nt|frm: 10 tricks. You will never find the @D-lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: agree:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henrik Røn|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 trick theft|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well 9 maybe|pg||

nt|cindy:  this isnt a forcing pass situation is it ?    wonder why the double|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: well it was a noise:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so very dangerous on his pile of fester i know players who would have bid 4s as east|pg||
nt|othered1: because, first, since 2@H doesn't deny @H, when you double you better be able to beat them.  so double will be rare.  And how do you safely make a 3-suit takeout?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Can afford to cash @DQ, then the spade switch must come|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect the defence need a spade ruff soon to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ha|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 1@D can have longer clubs and 5@C would show that; hence 4NT|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|roswolf: yourself on a frisky day?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: always am|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think the methods are all good or bad - the important it ia to have agreements, memory, and find a reasonable way to do the more probable hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back everybody|pg||
nt|ady: really needs K@S onside   assuming a diamond dwitch|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzpf: a difficult contract|pg||
nt|ady: west might hope declarer has singleton small spade and 4 diamonds    then a passive defence might be needed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: i get paid so much kroner by roland to entertain|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: you know how much?|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol please tell me how to get anything from him except virtual cokes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i get a kroner for every slam he bids that makes|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: In Italy it is used 2@H 2 way : weak raise or natural|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Marshall|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: oh well|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: in other words Zilch|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double of 4NT should create a force, i think|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, with an ace West is happy to suggest defending - he can't have a lot for 4@s|pg||
nt|cindy:  i mean the double of 4N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is short in spades for a 4S bid. still, the rest of his hand is offensive enough :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  and since East doubled 4NT, West needed to indicate his own preference for defending as opposed to bidding on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh sorry cindy|pg||
nt|cindy:  im talking about the first double|pg||
nt|cindy:  E has no idea if he can beat anything|pg||
nt|dburn:  that was just "I think we ought to be defending"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but E   surely DOES know he wants to defend rather than hear 5S from pd|pg||
nt|cindy:  wouldnt pass say the same thing ?  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if he passes they can never collect 300 when they have it|pg||
nt|dburn:  not really - pass would say "I don't know what we ought to be doing"|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|idc: I don't know whether to be jealous or to pity you Roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: good odds then!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i get virtual danish pastries|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N/S is playing a strong club system|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: 3@H wasn't too high|pg||
nt|idc: If I could choose a person in all the world whose mind I could read, it sure wouldn't be me :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know how Kenny envisaged thet she would beat the hand if partner did not have @SAK. @CA would not be enough|pg||
nt|ahh: not sure that that is a gift i would wish to have |pg||
nt|lestergold: because in Denmakrk they do not exist|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy:  only if it is a forcing pass situation|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however the stop at 2@S is a perfect bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is short in spades for overcall, musch better chance of 2 tricks there than normally on this EW auction|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: overtrick goes begging|pg||
nt|lestergold: an overtrick disappeared somewhere|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes very unlikely|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, 9 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: who doubles 1C with N hand?|pg||
nt|mollerjep: never 10...|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may not be flat not if in open south makes a two suited overcall!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Horrible slam, it's much too good|pg||
nt|frm: Six @s is on!|pg||
nt|lestergold: then  game may not even be bid|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, since 4NT is not going to be the final contract, East may as well express some opinion over 4NT rather than having to guess over five of a minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is pretty sure no overtricks and might get 300 against a phantom. i think the IMP odds make double reasonabl;e|pg||
nt|dburn:  and enlist West's co-operation in the process|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes david  i think you are right since 4N wont be the final contract|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: part scores only here|pg||
nt|mafia13: 4 @S here for EW?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: faitly even split of assets|pg||
nt|ady: e/w might make a tight 4@S     but might not reach it|pg||
mb|r|nt|lestergold: 3h looks like n/s limit|pg||
nt|lestergold: the weak no trump strikes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6s is excellent|pg||
nt|ady: assume 3@H a limit raise or better in spades|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: i dont include 3nt as reasonable |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ireland made 3NT against NI which is good news for Scotland|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may pass as well as east and then?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south in if he can show the two suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: ladns on feet with this bid slightly risky at unfavourable|pg||
nt|roswolf: north better not be too aggressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Not Bjarnarson, not me:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass by North it is a possible choice|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only problem would be a bad trump break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you claim copyright, Mike?|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: If they had led & run the knave instead, hmmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because vuln|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i dont have strong feelings. if EW were red, then i think pass is better. in trhe actual conditions i have no strong feelings. for a change :)|pg||
nt|mollerjep: yes, in a few sec..|pg||
nt|ady: yes   with 3 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The N Irish are in 5@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i amretiring shortly on the royalties|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: all very sane|pg||
nt|lestergold: north maybe pl;ayed with pard before|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2NT conventional?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No alert|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding that N hand i wouldnt be that worried about 3NT making while there are 4 losers in 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you don;t really have a second spade stop and almost all your stuff is outside spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hearts are weak but you have great chunky stuff where it will do a lot of good|pg||
nt|ady: cant blame east  for the sign off in spit of singleton heart|pg||
nt|ady: oh    has accepted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: sry|pg||
nt|ady: np|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: NS are vul, but also N has all working values & excellent spots, and EW are NV so no riches likely on defense|pg||

nt|ahh: 5@D better contract  but perhaps less successful |pg||
nt|idc: a @c was led other room by South, so defence can only take 3 quicjk ones there - 3NT may have been makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: declarer may be forced to duck a @D now|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead instantly attacks the entry |pg||
nt|roswolf: a slam is possible here in the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North-South wife and husband, Charlotte and Dennis. Liz may remember Charlotte from Venice 1988 when Denmark defeated Great Britain in the Venice Cup Final|pg||
nt|lestergold: good players know that in 4th seat their pards usually bid their hand for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be a flattie|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I like the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if south had not been a passed hand then north would have made at least a try|pg||
nt|ady: looks though this will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid reaps its very just punishment|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: safe enough contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Charlotte and Bettina, the very young Danish pair then|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would X with North hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would be pretty unbelieveable if this slam was not reached in a final of this nature|pg||
nt|cuttysark: @CJ is a big card: North worried about what to do with all his losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: he knows that the singleton diamond is enormous bound to find the solution to his losers in dummy one way or the other|pg||
nt|ady: north may duck the club|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: small @d to the knave could be ducked by SOuth of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I remember it well - we lost by about 5 imps after I played off a game...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahh: nice defence if she does |pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is the president of the Danish Bridge Federation. For many years in the past he formed a very successful partnership with his cousin, Peter Schaltz. Bronze medal at the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Olympics in Seattle among other achievements|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: 1984 I think it was|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1984 was Seattle, certainly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There are times when Deep Thought does not help. This is one|pg||
nt|ady: not now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|ahh: still shouldnt go 4 down so small swing to scots |pg||
nt|idc: not so quickly South... good|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|idc: well done|pg||
nt|ahh: excellent play by dec and south |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzpf: making 2?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|ahh:  dec will be pleased 3 down is imps in |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|idc: after the @c lead to the knave in other room - if East had led dJ, she has an easy duck if South covers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect they are well out of 6@C here - can be made, but you need to take good views|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Anders|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on borderline 4333 hands (Pass or Double) it is not unreasonable to make the decision--if nothing else serves as a decider--based on whether or not your 4-card suit is spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because that makes 2S more likely to make and more likely to push opps to 3 level|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|lestergold: so far the hands have been boring and sane|pg||
nt|lestergold: thinking about the biding another way is that north has made two minimum bids and his partner has made a slam try splinter- he has two bullets and a first round control and a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: supported second round control- its more than enuf|pg||
nt|ady: can make with the 3-3 diamon split|pg||
nt|ady: back with a diamond    draw   duck a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart was a very reasonable alternative to a trump. on this auction trump might blow a trick and a tempo, and in any event S can probably overruff at least one club.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: and welcome to Cindy Marshall|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|idc: so South must duck and then declarer has a tough choice - running knave and perhaps losing 4 quick clubs is silly if @d were 2-2 all along|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes excellent sense to me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK caitlin you've convinced me :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|asig: hi cindy|pg||

nt|bridge_one: all finesses are good, so np for N/S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: 2 remarkable bids here: the vulnerable double with the disparate majors, and the 1NT with no spade stopper :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: you should not bid grands that depends on a suit breaking 4/3 or even on a 3/2 break according to the conventional wisdom|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes science doesnt exist in Denmark it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, easy slam, three finesses, what's the problem ?  :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: however always 12 tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: no u havenet Liz|pg||

nt|lestergold: nor do I but this was starightforweard the defence was ,logical and clearly working well and thebn west decided to join declarers team for some reason|pg||

nt|bridge_one: after pass pass pass 1weakNt np to overcall for west|pg||
nt|lestergold: not double dummy it was mkisere to play a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: an error possibly due to teh pressure these players are under in  a tough final|pg||
nt|frm: I agree with Mike. It´s not double dummy to figure out, that you have to continue @C|pg||
nt|othered1: or EW may have a play for 3N on @H lead|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Walddk2: Not that bad when the singleton is in diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, South has his values in the wrong places opposite a major 2-suiter|pg||
nt|cindy:  not for me thx|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He could also have given partner a diamond ruff instead of playing the forcing game|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I might find A AK too much but you do have a point|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 29 imps lead is a carry-over!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have no comparisons in this segmwnt yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a very good save|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to get a @D ruff in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a v good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends on whether e/w get their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that disappears with @S lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: great minds rob!:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: with dim ruff thats only 2 off|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D dropping is bug too|pg||
nt|mariner1: big|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bug is right :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like the 4c bid i feel it implies more defensive strength|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wshould have bought ghis hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't think NS were ever not bidding 5@C, question is whether EW should bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@S|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   may be tricky on a heart lead  even from south      the entry for clubs taken     but n/s  will find it diffficult to make 5 triccks outside hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzmq: what will you miss by passing...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2S was artificial|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s was 4@h|pg||
nt|asig: 6@d is makeable but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  3N would show 4@h also|pg||
nt|asig: Especially after the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c forced 2@d and then 2@s shows 4@h|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|cindy:  gotcha|pg||
nt|marlowepi: TYVM Soren|pg||
mb|p|nt|frm: But you play a lot of boards, and it´s a tough final. You can´t completely avoid mistakes|pg||
nt|ady: duck club|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|jbgood: queen - club queen (jack) small? - then dia = 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: West should know North has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was not optimum|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @c is now as good as the ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: They try to hide declarers hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzmq: and all the suits breaking badly for the opposition|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So he can pick up South's trump now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: But that does not give him enough tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it is hard to see how the 5th defensive trick arises|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hej VM|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: 9 @C and 2@C, so one is a false discard ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors if i passed the W hand i would not be that eager to overcall. i don't want E to raise, really, and meanwhile N might have a bad 6-count so declarer might go down ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: several in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S was thinking in 2 seconds before playing @c2|pg||
nt|cindy:  well at least he has the ace|pg||
nt|bridge_one: perhaps was more easy playing @S instead @C for the declarer|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: S wants them to break @D, does not know it does not matter|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: south can dream on|pg||
nt|asig: Declarer rises with the Ace in order to block the clubs, good play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: but as commnetators its our job to identify errors as well as to praise excellent plays |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Must concede a heart now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But I think he has too much to do|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|caitlin: I wouldn't open the West hand and he takes chances with the overcall|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs the spade finesse|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: 9 in @S by North - nice guess by West|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would rather open and get it off my chest than overcall. but pass throughout is fine |pg||
nt|cindy:  looks like he is going minus only 200|pg||
nt|cindy:  100 maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: +110?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South has only 3 @H, so 1 down, not 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in general i don;t like to open a one-bid on a 5422 10-count when i have 100 honors in a suit other than the one i am bidding :).  in a way i would rather open 1D, but would settle ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for pass|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: these are good players and they expect us to tell it how it is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am told that GIB says a club lead lets the game through....|pg||
nt|lestergold: is GIB always right?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahh: i agree with all this about 4441 hands i generally feel they play a king below their point count |pg||
nt|lestergold: it does matter south has the losing option not now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: that west has rushed in|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably more often than I am, Mike|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: It's always an advantage to open the bidding. Defensive bidding is not as accurate|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one advantage of this NS method is that when N and S each have one (different) 4-card major, the opening leader doesnt know whether declarer has the major that dummy ddoesnt have. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it makes the lead harder (and maybe the later defense) compareed to more standard methods|pg||
nt|othered1: endplay for an overtrick, but east may just take his tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: good method for me, because when i open 1NT i usually want to hide my hand also :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D a playable spot, though|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Probably by starting with a small heart from south|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahh: well if opps open your shortage you have a great defensive bid |pg||

nt|lestergold: north must do something for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n may war oppos about hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: failing that, S might have tried 3D over 2NT. it is not as if the combined values are so thin that 3NT rates to hinge on the lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would we all Pass as W?|pg||
nt|cindy:  no|pg||
nt|cindy:  im a spade raiser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: uhmm, i don't no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm a straight razor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always go for the throat|pg||
nt|cindy:  heh|pg||
nt|cindy:  chic razor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would bid 3S before pass. that might work out badly, but it has a lot of upside. 2S seems normal|pg||
nt|cindy:  this is one where i would bid 3S   they are never going to stop and double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem it is to give informations at declarer bidding the raise in @S - and with zero can be bad|pg||
nt|caitlin: I like transfer overcalls over strong club and 2@C strong|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spades the only suit west could have opened but wiosely didnt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North-South obvioulsy of the old school where 11 points did not make an opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: north borderline for opening probably didnt like the fact that none of his meagre points were in his long suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And South, 3rd in vulnerable, does not have a god suit to bid|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  At the other table they will open  as they play precision|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even a good suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think notth's hand is for the above reason a hairs breath short of an opener altho not a hanging offence to open|pg||
nt|lestergold: the vulnerability is indeed very relevant|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: A short break. I told S that he is from the old school. He didn't like 10xxx in @c|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: I like 4@S much better|pg||
mb|2C|an|!|nt|mariner1: N actully has 17+ so I do also|pg||
nt|lestergold: east is undeteered|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will bid 3s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: and north will raise to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: or make a t/o double w|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, we should bear in mind that apparently one of the hands N can have is a strong NT, which lessens the attractivenss of 3S a bit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C may be could be any balanced hand without stop in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c was not alerted by S|pg||
mb|4C!|an|spl?|nt|marlowepi: that heart suit in the S hand looks eerily familiar|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It shows a strong hand because you don't pre-empt against a pre-empt|pg||
nt|ahh: so do i |pg||
nt|idc: Oh, it was a Benjaminised 2@c - even then, North has a little bit to contribute|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that N-S play Benjamin, where 2@c shows an Acol 2 bid and 2@d shows a gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes - they do|pg||
nt|ahh: even the great Albert (alleged inventor of it ) doesnt play it |pg||
nt|idc: EW have done well to limit the likely loss for Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 300, 4 IMPs to CBAI. Next hand Stephen, please|pg||
nt|henryb: is he still around?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: one of the minors will probably be useful...|pg||
nt|ahh: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: soth apparantly needed to bid 2@D, now will be interesting to see how well he candescribe his hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: This may come down to a diamond guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: west has done quite enuf|pg||
nt|roswolf: now for the play|pg||
nt|lestergold: so all on reading the spade position|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting K&R show it as 16.5 however DK = 18|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Denmark recently signed the treaty accepting the idea of a slam bonus, so NS were really carrying the "hide declarer's hand" principle too far|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can arrive at slam (:|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not now, sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought south would make the cue in @s over 3@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: superficially looks like a possible misunderstanding, but pairs who play strong club encounter the auction 1C-1S by opp with depressing frequency, so they should know their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bid i was expecting from S pver 3H was 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H by South it is intelligent - beacause more richt give the minimum of hand that the control in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right()|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S doesnt bid 3NT, they will never play there, and why shouldnt it be the right contract some of the time?|pg||
nt|jbgood: you asked for action - here you go!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I guess K&R reduce it for AQ @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you if club not set up then long dims will take care of club loser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was a perfect choice, agree|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: his hearts are terrible and his minor suit help might mean 9 tricks in NT with 4H going down|pg||
nt|cindy:  uhoh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N wants to correct to 4H that is fine also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have a feeling that EW will be overcalling a lot in the rest of this match when NS open 1C :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is a squeeze cuebid - means control in @S (the suit where North don't bid control|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I think 3nt could be unserious/serious|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is perfect - 2 stop in @S, no shortness, minimum (otherwise 3@s)|pg||
nt|othered1: game in either major is normal |pg||
nt|dburn:  I guess that will do as well as any - once North showed stuff in the minors, South just bid what he expected to make without describing his shape for the opponents' benefit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mafia13: seemed like it would have been more fun to dbl NS here...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mollerjep: what about Brøndum? Will he raise the stakes...no!|pg||
nt|jbgood: W tried - but E let NS off the hook|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: one obstacle down|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht discard of course of no value to declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N/S discussed board 2. S was not sure aff 4@h in N. That was wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: West think he is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: still early|pg||
nt|mafia13: well, Kasper is a very nice guy :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: A new leader in the match|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have made 6H, as it would be somewhat attractyive to E to lead a D, playing W for the queen. but S is doomed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: x was unlimited|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|caitlin: that may be why South bid 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my opinion, what is "unserious" is playing 3NT as artificial when no more than an 8 card fit has been promised|pg||
nt|bridge_one: too much value in @h for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It is a (loosing) finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is right to think a long time|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume if north had bid a major over 2@D, south may have gotten more interested in a slower auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Club now for an easy set|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: hasnt even given himself the option of a spade finesse on the second round|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: club needed urgently|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: Back to the diamond guess....|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: not difficult|pg||
nt|dburn:  one would think so - even a 2NT rebid might have seen South investigate a slam|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi:  2 could be a swing (doubt it though). it's a lucky make at 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: on eoff is good bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks so much Soren for continuing to provide so much useful information :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: Well done - nneded to play @SA other to avoid the endplay|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: if South has th 9 in @S no exist chance for East, so A is correct|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mollerjep: it's much easier to hook NS if S passes, so full marks to Brøndum for that strange 2h  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn:  for whom?|pg||
mc|11|nt|marlowepi: i think the play of the spade king at trick one conventionalkly signals "partner you bid too much" |pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only addressing the flatness of the boards, not the hope of Konow :)|pg||
pg||

nt|ahh: he was a true great |pg||
nt|idc: great fun man|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So was Victor Goldberg who died recently|pg||
nt|ahh: sadly we also lost Victor Goldberg recently too |pg||
nt|cuttysark: West was playing South for @DA, so I do not fancy his chances of getting it right|pg||
nt|lestergold: flaw?|pg||
nt|mariner1: after opening lead W was marked with @SA,, so J was issue,,,,, @c to dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: best line|pg||
nt|roswolf: another freakish hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C nice spot,,,,,,,, 6@S not so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: not right to play club because that would have given up the possibiklity of the club loser eventually going on diamonmds|pg||
nt|mariner1: remember he knew where @SA was|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice?|pg||
nt|lestergold: where does the spade loser go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: one point less (K in @d instead Q@H&Q@D) and the slam was made|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: lol, but Askgaard doesn't do that:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N to S: You are born lucky|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb: hard to imagine anything but a push on this board|pg||
nt|idc: East has one of my hands, though it's a bit more shapely than I usually get|pg||
nt|ahh: a true yarborough |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: one diamond for discard not enuf!|pg||
nt|mariner1: you play @S to q|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: hmm slightly suprising line of play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have a comparison now - Konow mised the thin 3NT onBoard 1, losing 8 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: now how will north value this hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like it - I like aces :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: end up hopefully playing W for Ajx  not easy I admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: how double will give south a problem|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh right only one @D pitch here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so no 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: had he opened they would have probably socred a plus |pg||
nt|cuttysark: You are not supposed to quote us :) I shall have to be careful what I say :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 12 HCP in north, plus a fit, but is it worth a game force?|pg||
nt|dburn:  might be anxious to try for 3NT, with all that slow stuff in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4H  can be beatend on diamond lead  with 2 ruffs    but e/w  can make 4@S  on club view|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn:  but might be wrong to do so on this lie|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahh: Roland will give exact odds of 1 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even better news for Scotland now. NI -5 against Ireland|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: well difficult for n/s now not to over cook the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the raise here may be unwise|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c for sure being bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: south cant know who is making what here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well does S think N bid 5@C to make?|pg||
nt|caitlin: good Namyats hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem for North was to guess if AQ@d was 2 tricks or one - after 1@S overcall he choose the chance to find the K in West|pg||
nt|othered1: meanwhile, can ew find a good 4@S spot?|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure whether 2NT is natural or a heart raise|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW won't get their @S into the auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 card heart reai|pg||
nt|jbgood: raise|pg||
nt|jbgood: at least an invite|pg||
nt|dburn:  but East won't enter the auction, I don't think, and West certainly won't bid again, so 4@s unlikely to be reached|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: yes he should|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: np, they enjoy the comment|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a good spot, without west's @D bid.  With it, there's obvious danger|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability he is certainly on a guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would make the samew bis as south|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: ut I would not want to get too high with these breaks!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho we can see that double is thewinning bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|frm: A lucky slam in @H or @C is on!|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like @S may be where they end up + west may have a flyinf hack|pg||
nt|lestergold: south delighted with the second bid!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: found it|pg||
nt|jbgood: y|pg||
nt|othered1: This will be down quickly|pg||
nt|jbgood: quickly is a non-existent word ....|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, board 2 was a gain for Konow anyway when a weak two bid on @hAKJxx and a 5-3-3-2 shape, vulnerable against not, cost only 300|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that bid could be right, with a different shape and suit quality :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmmm wet by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Worth a thought when there are no overtricks - more tempting if NS were vulnerable|pg||
nt|jbgood: S's response: I find your suit prd|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: 6c is two way its inmsurance again st vul opps makingh 5h and its slam if partner is good|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: now @C|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think @H7 signalling for diamond|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East will make the contract only discarding on @D and playing @D from dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a namyats hand in playing strength, yes. the problem with opening 4D is that you need specific stuff in specific places and it will be awkward looking for it at that level, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as there may be no safety at the 5 level. for slam purposes i would rather open 1S. with hearts, though, i would open 4C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: @cA, @cq and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but a club is best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is thinking at a hand like  @S@S@S@S@S@S, xxx @D Kx@C inEast|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this case must play @D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: plauing bridge it is very important to guess :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S is a practical bid because NS may have a cheap save. also at these colors 4S cannot be chopped liver so you arent really underbidding by much|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: i f you dont axe with 3 solid trump tricks and pard making a free vul bid - when will you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes the result doesnt work out in ur favour|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.dk/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South has done very well to bids his time and buy the contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed didnt want to show overenthusiasm|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: S had an awkward bid over 2D. pass, double, and 2H could all turn out best|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: that is why players preempt as west did|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true giorgio, but most people cant guess that i am playing bridge :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: E is asking about signals|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the call in @D by North, now become usefull for East|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: (The expression is 'bide his time'; the typing is abysmal, sorry :))|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5-3-3-2 is not generally a good shape for sacrificing|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  When playing with Nielsen it is usually right to show as little enthusiasm as possible|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: now no chance|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|jbgood: but seems as if you are right!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: He had opened - and partner's raise scarecly improves his defensive propsects outside the trump suit :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was easy to defend just no one discard spades|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: when the almighty gives you such a hand it is not wise to decline the present|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You sound like Confucius :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect he will go 2 down, and might escape for 1 down after a double....|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm yes i can - but one of my hobbyhorses is that doubling + redoubling for businees is a dying art|pg||
nt|cuttysark: She?|pg||
nt|roswolf: except qj doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west is not short of discards|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are they just thinking soren or is there a break?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: or stiff honour|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: i get the drift|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: it was not a totally hopeless slam actually better than a oland|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|mariner1: Roland slams make though :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: I agree that players do not double enough - but there is little point if you cannot show a profit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: thinking|pg||
nt|frm: Who is to blame for the missed (good) game in @H or @C. West or east (or noboby)?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: if they think any longer about a partscore we will have to ask them to switch to Goulasch :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
mc|8|nt|marlowepi: i maybe incline toward pass, as it makes it more likely for us to find a 5-3 heart fit. of course we could miss a 4-4 spade fit that way, but it is easier for pd to have 3+ hearts ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: than 4+ spades |pg||

nt|idc: Which has set my mind off at a tangent|pg||

nt|ahh: better stop family show |pg||
nt|idc: A fearless declarer called Caira, said Roland could never be fairer|pg||

nt|mariner1: no 6@C very reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: more big fits|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK fresh meat now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: A short coffeebreak|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Brøndum is born lucky, but he's also one of the most skilled players in Denmark...and born natural by the way :-)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think east has to stick his neck out and bid that excellent heart suit on the next round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like one of those things: nobody liked his spade holding |pg||
nt|ady: e//w   have dome well   not easy to get to-gether in spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also S is minimum & N could have just 5-8, which i think also argues for pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: she must be a liar as they never got higher |pg||
mb|1C|nt|henryb: a tricky defense available to hold N-S to eight tricks|pg||
nt|idc: Though Roland had never been barer?|pg||
nt|ahh: its not going to win any prizes is it |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: not impossible if E supports ?|pg||
nt|henryb: in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: my bidding advisor says that if you dont bid you dont get|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  West might have tried 2@H instead of 3@C, but after the 1@S overcall his @SKJ10 to do look like they are worth much|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S     needs a bit of luck|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|idc: true, back to the drawing board|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a tough 4@H here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but no games on for anyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe rob|pg||
nt|jbgood: and it is there|pg||
nt|ady: once the diamond is rught   can eliminate and get end play in hearts|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: 4h may make i suppose |pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead club switch obvious no play|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the type hand N that if you open that S needs to have a 2@C tell me more|pg||
nt|mariner1: bid....... not that you would stay below game anyway|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok  3N  next|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|henryb: well, E has two more honors than she had on the last hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont think i would have kept quiet as S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: when i am S i believe the literature--i am supposed to become declarer--so i better start early in the auction :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahh: if the event was held elsewhere in Ireland we could do Knock Knock jokes |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looming|pg||
nt|lestergold: should beat this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i would not be that eager to balance with the E hand, especially with a big lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  heres a plac e to get some imps back|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think it is easier for east having made a negative double to tell his partner that he has more than a mere 4 card heart support type holding|pg||
nt|frm: Just made!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not much going for this contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Provided North leads an unbid suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h should not be strength showing after the double but maybe in their methods it is|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   a bergen raise  spec asked?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I guess|pg||
mb|3C|an|!|nt|henryb: I think E ahould lead the Q -- partner could show the J then|pg||
nt|idc: difficult problem for North first round - I quite like 2@s opposite a five card major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec says "S is a state of mind". ouch, guilty as charged|pg||
nt|cindy:  ya know thats funny   in real life i always sit S and never get to play the hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: kill point at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm south forced to game did he-- very optimistic|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|cuttysark: I think they have guaranteed a heart lead - fortunately the hearts are kind|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Are we thinking, or disconnected?|pg||
nt|ady: seems so|pg||
nt|cindy:  his idea of a 3 suiter is unique|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mariner1: needs to find the @c switch,,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a lousy game even with Kc favourable|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: we were thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: no prob|pg||
nt|lestergold: well defended|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Queen probably asking for reverse attitude signal|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: Dinner time :) See you next session.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: at end of day north had a minimum opener south had a limit raise and north had a non acceptance|pg||
nt|mariner1: well N could easily have the K@S instead of Q@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so im not sorry for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ruff two diamonds a play club?|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably as good a line as any from here|pg||
nt|lestergold: west knows east had ten of clubs|pg||

nt|roswolf: natural play brings 9 tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, there was little point in putting it off - either there was a running minor or there wasn't :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sneaky @HQ - bu there is little to do bu play a top club|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (butttt - practising typing)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: even if endplayed declarer still has to guess the spade|pg||
nt|ady: heart problem solves on opening lead    now straight foward A@D needed with east|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|frm: I think you are right! Missing showing the good @H-suit seems to have missed the game!|pg||
nt|dburn:  aggressive lead, but may have been reluctant to try a passive club since West could not double the artificial 3@c bid|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn:  and no one leads trumps these days|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not unique, but non-mainstream :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: his idea of a balance at equal vul is also worth re-thinking, IMHBAICO|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Koch-Palmund clawing back the lead - another 5 imps on board 4 when Konow wwent down in partscores in both rooms|pg||
