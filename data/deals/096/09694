nt|Walddk2: Will they wriggle to 2 of a major I wonder|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand, you do have 15 high and you are balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2M would not have been a success either|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Matchpoints I play escapes here with W....... REDBL stayman..... a tad risky|pg||
nt|mariner1: in imps|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A wriggle would not help - you get a level higher and lose at least one more trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you should be able to play 1NT doubled. That is often your best spot|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: it doesn't really matter whether N-S find their 8 black tricks fast|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|athene: E-W only have 5 red ones anyway|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever leads clubs if you bid 1NT over 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: if the guy on lead has clubs, he wants his partner to lead through you|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I'm sure declarer will cash out - quick get your bets down|pg||
nt|athene: if he doesn't have clubs, he isn't going to lead them either|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: yes and that lead warns @S are probably not well set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Since I am asked by a couple of spectators, I had better tell that N-S are from England, E-W from Ireland. In the closed room N-S are from Switzerland, E-W from England|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||

mb|d|nt|mdgraham: running a bit behind schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: with good card reading, West can make 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: doesn't a @D lead beat 3@H?|pg||

pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: yes, he has :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|granguru: around the limit|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mariner1: well EW could save here....... not now however|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: very risky for W to come into the fray|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2NT is an interesting choice - you don't expect to want to play anywhere but 4@H very often facing a weak-2, do you?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: so either it was tactical (i.e. worried that a direct 4@H would be more likely to encourage unwelcome competition)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: This should not take long|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam but is game automatice with all those K's?|pg||
nt|mariner1: automatic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You may not make it, but you've got to bid it|pg||
nt|athene: i can't imagine ever not bidding game with north when partner opens 2@H in that position|pg||
nt|vugraphzqb: 2@h is 9-12 too|pg||

nt|hedyg: hello :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi Hedy|pg||
nt|ady: only 2nd hand    first was a throw in|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 4 matches: AIDA 64, Kannavos 59, ONYX (Romania) 58, POLINA 58, Papakyriakopoulos 57, Zipovski 54 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: missed the announcement . sry|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s with their combined 17 pts  can make  4@C   but will they find the club contract after a no-trump opening from west|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@h limit in EW, 4@c NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure I believe Open made 6 there :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores it seems here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: EW can make 3NT on this layout, but they are unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   very duplicated   can only make 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a tool to show a 3 suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|hedyg: can double 2@H for t/o now|pg||
nt|ady: north may well re-open with double|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: may have to re-open at 3 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: W should pass with QJx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand the long @hs..|pg||
nt|ady: but nothin much lost if letting e/w play 3@H  should be down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N very aggressive call from E with his 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems he is looking for the 8th and 9th trick|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And it's very unlucky anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need @S6 as an entry to take the club finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not get a spade lead on this bidding, mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: I see 8th, 9th will be harder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: *lucky I meant to say|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: pls disregard the score, it has NOTHING to do with this match|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT is certainly a better spot that 5@D|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: sure seems E owes W a @S raise here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have tried one more spade there |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think over 2@H was needed as well|pg||

nt|mariner1: not|pg||
nt|mariner1: S might think N has more or less than he has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mrs Jensen and Mr Hansen at my club would have saved at least 2 rounds of bidding|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: no 3N bidding cards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And they would not end up in 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting decision to play the Moysian @H fit|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D was just waiting, denying a 5-card major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Forrester has shown a small doubleton in clubs on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H showed any one of about fifteen different hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzqb: 3@s shows a 3NT raise with club concern|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Therefore, Bakhshi was reluctant to play in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 1@c was natural or balanced, 1@d a relay, 1@h still natural or balanced, 1@s a relay and 1NT a weak no trump|pg||
nt|dburn: then, 2NT was forcing to game with a small doubleton somewhere|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c asked and 3@s showed two small clubs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: well now they are fortunate that @H are 3 3|pg||
nt|dburn: so Bakhshi chose 4@h rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: and he will survive, which is as well for him|pg||
nt|mariner1: how will he play the @H suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: if North's black suits were interchanged, this would not be a bad spot|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if there's an interesting psychological effect here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: when you have a lot of complicated and unusual kit to explore the hand in the bidding|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|mariner1: there will be a sigh of relief now|pg||
nt|athene: you might feel under pressure to "take advantage" of it|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. you know they will just bash a crude 3nt in the other room|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: so if you have a close decision whether to do the same, knowing more than them|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: or bid a slightly unusual contract...you go for the latter |pg||
nt|dburn: again, if South had QJx in spades and Jx in clubs, we would all be saying how well they had bid|pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: yes agression is paying off for NS mainly because EW are not that aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  penalty shootout in the FA Cup semi final Man U v Everton, no goals at extra time|pg||
nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
nt|mariner1: so did not find the 8th then|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggression|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: NS have 6@H if they can find it|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the easiest bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: just stay out of grand..|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I missed a car, they have 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS playing inverted majors to 1@D? |pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW even find it now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: card|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S good spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c hook off stops 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 1@S shows a 1N call|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows hearts in their methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, 1@D-1@h=spades and 1@d-1@S=hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: some use 1N as 4+ @S and 1@S and a 1N call to put the 1N in opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: no alert so its hard to tell which it is Mike :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Roland knows it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's the advantage of that, Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E may be pickled here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no reason to go for the grand anyhow|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did not need much for slam......|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d splinter|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  could bid to 7@H      but  4-1 break  bad     6@H may get swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: again aggression goes to the front for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well NS can beat 4@S however it is not their top spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: a defense slip can allow 4@S also|pg||
nt|granguru: very unprobable|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a QUICK 4@h bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: well, they may or may not play sound opening bids, and North might have risked a move anyway, but as I say, it wasn't obvious|pg||
nt|finch: Carol Cautious, surely?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: North worried about wastage in diamonds opposite shortage    but north obviously bidding on|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: If clubs were 5-1 we'd be saying 'well stopped'|pg||

pc|sT|nt|dburn: maybe that 2@d overcall was a good idea after all, although I confess it doesn't look like one|pg||

nt|mariner1: structure of a system|pg||
nt|hedyg: might be difficult to avoid 4@h|pg||
mb|1H|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should force more in @D here than in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: EW are finding out if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of tournaments and|pg||
nt|mariner1: have flat hands............|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial EW.... game off best defense|pg||
nt|ady: a partial in hearts seems the best on this hand    only 3 top losers   but with the 4-1 trump break  game seems to much|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has no reall attractive call here,,,,,,, I do not particularly like 1N with KQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, all calls seem to have one or more major flaws|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike do you like the 1N? (2@C regrettable @c might be my call)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: so EW must play some sort of forcing @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: now we find out whether 2@d was gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with KQ stiff, and 2@C should really be a better suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes NS, hard to bid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: it wasnt|pg||
nt|ady: not|pg||
nt|ady: trump leads look best|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: and has to play @D the only way that works|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what do you bid with S over the 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @H in case pd has a stiff high honour|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: perhaps this is the unbiddable hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: borrow a @H from last deck..|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch: 3NT may not immediately appeal, but you have to compare it with the thought of playing 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: now a club should hold it|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|granguru: But E can also go for the @CJ  finesse which is bad this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT from top|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: 2@C is regrettable to me...... just no other good calls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 3@S seems a bit chancy|pg||
nt|mariner1: I find pass even more regrettable :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one-and-a-half clubs, perhaps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: when north wins A@C   ace and another trump|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|ady: ruff a spade and  discard last spade on K@D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: although maybe 1NT is just practical bridge - I have x-y points and a spade stop |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mariner1: operator says 1@D has different meanings based on position|pg||
mc|9|nt|mariner1: and since S can see 4@C in dummy he will pitch a @H allowing 7 if declarer sees|pg||
nt|mariner1: it that way|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking if I consider 2N unusual with S, yes I do NV, the problem here is|pg||
nt|mariner1: RED you have no way to assess N's strenght and will pay a high prices if wrong|pg||

nt|mariner1: stoppers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, South has gained 5 imps, but rather lucky really|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Chinese overcall 1N and open 1N and 2N with a stiff|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice stop on that hand |pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: 16 opposite a pretty good 8 though cards are not sitting well for them......|pg||
nt|arel1: 1@d 11-15 bal|pg||
nt|hedyg: score is 3:3|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: n/s  look destined to play either 1NT   or 2@S    both likely to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: now over the 2@S by E in Open Room I would have to bid 2N with S,,,,,,, DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: and PASS are not options|pg||
mb|4D|nt|finch: 2@D multi, showing a bad weak two in a major or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: good save by wales in OR  5@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should get to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets try again  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|thegarve:  West is unlikely to save looking at least 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear to save over it - that West hand has some defensive prospects|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: looks cold in fact with the pointed Aces set right|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need the @H guess |pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rob |pg||
nt|sybarra: a likely 3 nt for n/s here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think South will have to get to 4@S herself|pg||
nt|dburn: so the Welsh West, Jean Hand, took a pretty good decision|pg||
nt|thegarve:  if she passes 2@s it would only be 50s - an old ploy|pg||
nt|finch: at the other table West guessed well, although I don't think that weak two was a 'bad' one|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S off, @H off, at lead @c are 3 3,,,,,, @D could be worse|pg||
nt|mariner1: has no real choice I think and the 3@D call helps define the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: unfriendly hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west  could lead a top spade  and then decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c in EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: but no way to bid it|pg||
nt|ady: yes    e/w could make 2@C   but could not really get into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: you got there ffirst Heddy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a miracle in @D and there is no such thing|pg||
nt|ady: wont go down if they dont play a card|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: making at least 4 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|finch: 5@H more of a 2-way shot, could collect x AQxxxx Qxxx xx and make on a good day|pg||
nt|dburn: no saves now - Seale adopting more of a Manchester United approach than an Everton approach to saving|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in N I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: undo please operator :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: 4@H tough spot|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: can cash for 10 tricks |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|vugraphznh: sry the connection is very bad|pg||
nt|hedyg: still waiting for the @D spots to change|pg||
nt|ady: could make if spade position favourable    but not that difficult hand to play   |pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South missed an inference there - if North was strong, he could have bid 2@S for take-out a round earlier|pg||
