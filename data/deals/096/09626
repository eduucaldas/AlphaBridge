nt|athene: i suppose you might be a little bit scared that a very strong west player dropped @SA from 3-6-1-3 shape to make you miscount the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predicted par wouldnt happen but i didnt expect sell out to 5d!|pg||
nt|ady: how dod east make 3NT |pg||
nt|henryb: somehow 3N by east making seems like a very unlikely result|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially as 4s by n/s is frigid|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT in CR, but 4@S by N is on|pg||
nt|lestergold: debate gloing on as to hlo was to blame for the debacle on the previous hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: debate amongst specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: players play 15. board but it is not same on the movie.so when they finished i just write results|pg||
nt|henryb: I thought I saw this board played in 5@dX losing a three aces, the @hK and a @h ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think that possibly the cause of the disaster for E-W on the previous auction comes from the double of 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: the point is:- in this situation, does double say "i definitely want to defend this"|pg||
nt|athene: or just "i have a bad hand and hence don't think i can make 5@H"?|pg||
nt|athene: you often see people double in a forcing pass situation just because they don't want to encourage partner to bid on|pg||
nt|april7: something wrong in hand  15|pg||
nt|henryb: it says I suggest, based on my hand, that we defend|pg||
nt|athene: but their partner thinks "ok, he must have trump tricks opposite my void"|pg||
nt|athene: and no, he doesn't, he has two small|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a make n/s     5@D   a reasonable save    will have to defend well for down 3|pg||

nt|jcomyn: lots and lots of imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have played golf this morning, so letÂ´s see lots of imps|pg||

nt|Walddk4: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 93, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 78,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 67,  WALES 46  ****|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike and Rob|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland finished ur tourney then?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what tourney? that was last Sunday|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we have a shootour between N. Ireland and Scotland....... CBAI closed it up|pg||
nt|mariner1: on last 4 boards of the last session and put Scotland in 2nd place|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh Hedy thought u were running one this sunday|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Roland|pg||
nt|mariner1: shootout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2 VP's is not a huge lead though|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|viren169: It will be interesting to see how West copes with 2@H from South|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S will not be great success |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi all - Hi Shirley  John Comyn here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello John welcome |pg||
nt|jcomyn: dfidnt recognise the new caps on the NI team|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Martin.|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make a lot here |pg||
nt|mariner1: well we start with a makeable yet unbiddable slam imho|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score battle here between hearts for e/w clubs for n/s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb: a slam. should not be hard to bid: the problem, I think, will be to avoid seven on power|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: h partial |pg||
nt|thegarve:  scores update please operator|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jcomyn: hi all again|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big match this - both well in contention|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 76, SCOTLAND 71, ENGLAND 61, IRELAND 59, CBAI 58, WALES 31 ****|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jallerton: Your commentators are Ian Crorie, Cliff Gillis, Sarah Teshome and myself.|pg||
nt|viren169: Much easier route to 4@H now|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming 2@C was majs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Morning John, Peter and Gad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an ouch already|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 19-20 NT onbviously|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and on cue...|pg||
nt|sybarra: its pretty magic to bid the slam |pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S will make with the lucky Kx @S in pocket|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h the likely limit for E/W |pg||
nt|mariner1: @H win this battle|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|idc: NS are playing 15-17 NT, 5 card majors, 3 card minors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good contract but...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wish I were you lovely day here and me watching bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N makes in S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 6 nt off with the @C k off |pg||
nt|mariner1: someone has to bid @H though :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: England have brought in a new pair.  Catherine Seale (West ) is playing her first Lady Milne|pg||
nt|pkl: Why 2@D if 2@C was majors? I believe 2@C must be something else.|pg||
nt|pkl: Morning Roland|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like they all have something to say here...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had just said not a success, but could it be done?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will test N in a big way|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi ralf  John Comyn here|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hearts coming into the picture now...|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @c lead kills 6N in N|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm im not sure about that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: no sinecure|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely @D lead not |pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
nt|mariner1: reasonable spot and making 12|pg||
nt|mariner1: well could make 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably only 11 |pg||
nt|mariner1: declarer is worrying about 9th trick,,,, if she attacks @S that worry disappears|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pkl: After a club to the ace and switch to diamonds, declarer might well fail.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning Roland|pg||
nt|pkl: But 5@C is a very cheap save|pg||
nt|viren169: North is likely to switch to the J of @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi again John and John|pg||
nt|lestergold: how do u lose more than 2 dims a club and a heart played in 23d?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tihas: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d|pg||
nt|mariner1: well them coming in so late means they might have not competed at the 3 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 ruffs i see|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H has play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they do not fiund spade ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|mariner1: no dbl so no trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: cthis hand should certainly have been competed to the three level|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is too easy a ride|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|jcomyn: C switch |pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 13 tops, but 15 with the @c finesse.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 11 now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: now down  |pg||
pc|d5|nt|capercliff: 11h is not so easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: naw|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should venture 3d she knows partner has fivwe|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that solves the defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: why not pitch a @H there?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think she wants 3 ht tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: or thought she did |pg||
nt|sybarra: so easy for us to see,  not easy at the table |pg||
pc|hK|nt|tihas: so this is the last match in the championship, and 4 teams are rather close at the end of round robin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lively start anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... -2 for a (probable) par result! |pg||
nt|toobad: yeah lol|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: jeepers NS playing this|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: the 2H overcall should warn her|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have a wish to play golf in Ireland rather soon|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Monte Carlo had a good win in the last round.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Aivar Tihane from Estonia|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@h|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: even 1 isn't :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and at least 8 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now N is in a spot of bother|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|capercliff: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: should be ok though|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant give up 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: any idea where|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NSE or W|pg||
nt|mariner1: now in danger of going off|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: as she has already passed and limited her hand there is no danger of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mariner1: now @D loser can disappear though|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to stay away from the @c plays and there goes another @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: I think the @s9 mislead N|pg||
nt|thegarve:  So this match looks buried unless Wales perform the Lazarus coup|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: so is W with that play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pkl: Perhaps only down one, viren?|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 93, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 78,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 67,  WALES 46  ****|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tihas: un summary, monte carlo has a 13.5 VP lead over Druva, so for Druva to have a chance for the gold they must win at least 22-8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CK is (almost certainly) marked, so draw trumps and play a club towards the queen - may be a problem if trumps 3-1 and clubs 5-1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|viren169: Looks like all the players are keen to make their mark early in the match!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely this is a CRTFH hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no idea at all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no forgot the H10|pg||
mc|8|nt|pkl: Pender hoping for more clubs at East. This was not to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: except that...short in hts and not much esle to ruff |pg||
pg||
qx|o16|st||md|2SKT973HAJ9DT43CA8,SA5HKT8632D5CKQ65,SJ6H75DA876CJ9742,SQ842HQ4DKQJ92CT3|sv|e|nt|april7: but who would ever play 3NT with those hands, I  thing anybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactl;y my point!|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely shome mishtake as they say in private eye|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: player play diffrent 15 |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: not same with the bbo |pg||
nt|ady: we had this one before|pg||
nt|henryb: As the VG operator told us, the program had the wrong board 15 loaded, so he simply reported the actual result of a board we were not priveledged to see|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes thoughti had some deja vu|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: because some players accidently see this hand on a hand prints|pg||
nt|henryb: we have already played this board in 2@h|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: in a Bridge World bidding challenge you bid 3nt, because that's what you always bid with a 9-card major-suit fit |pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w part scoe in hearts|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|april7: here 3@H is the limit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: 4@H  ambitious CR   3 down seems a lot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: if E invites, W must bid 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Lack of aces is the problem|pg||
nt|ady: problem AX clubs in south hand   |pg||
nt|henryb: another hand on which I much prefer a 2@c rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: we have proble with board 15 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are not alone, Henry|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb: partner sometimes has five card club support and a void in hearts|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes must have been overruffs by south of clubs to account for the debacle|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't reach dummy to get a spade pitch on a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: so it doesn't matter that the defence didn't get a spade established right away|pg||
nt|ady: wests suit too moderate opposite a possible shortage not to offer clubs as a 2nd suit|pg||
nt|april7: @h @h now and W will go down|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|henryb: two rounds of hearts leave west with eight tricks: 5@h, 2@c and the @sA|pg||
nt|april7: but also @C continuation and after @H trick @D to N and another @C and W will go down also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, Avram|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: If you continue @HA and another, declarer has 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|april7: why not?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb: this endplays S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is in 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well certainly not going down now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 hearts, 1 spade, 2 clubs = 8|pg||
nt|april7: S has a third heart to play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Count his tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe hard for nortbh to judge that the dim suit was dead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 hearts agree? @SA, and the two high clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb: Roland, it is really not fair to count that high. the rest of us have trouble above 3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: north can't really judge the distribution here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't know that west has to be short in diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: south end played|pg||
nt|april7: true Roland, S ruffs a loser, but i WAS IN Â§1h SORRY|pg||
nt|lestergold: needed to play heart quickly and hope declarer misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: can play diamond   but may get end played again with J@h|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: playing dim gives another trick|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: well played|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c7|pc|d9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: not easy to read that south was endplayed|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h6|mc|9|nt|lestergold: and a lot more tricks than amde in closed|pg||
nt|ady: useful swing for e/w|pg||
pg||
qx|c16|st||md|2SKT973HAJ9DT43CA8,SA5HKT8632D5CKQ65,SJ6H75DA876CJ9742,SQ842HQ4DKQJ92CT3|sv|e|nt|capercliff: W did double 1@d|pg||
nt|capercliff: so 3-3 @h was unlickly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: great to see clubs come into their own at last|pg||
nt|pkl: I've heard that winning the Lady Milne Cup is almost as important to the Irish as winning the six nations, but that might be overdoing it|pg||
nt|pkl: Will East open? Would you guys?|pg||
nt|viren169: just a bit!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this spade suit would be easier to play :)|pg||
nt|toobad: when Ciara and Diane have the cards and are on form, anything possible!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But in fact - with Q10s on dummy and 19-20 on the opener, a @h cannot be right|pg||
nt|thegarve:  West had a huge hand on the bidding and 4@s is lazy|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandable that the opening bidder may have had 13 points!|pg||
nt|mariner1: misfits abound here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2 nine card minor suit fits|pg||
mb|1H|nt|capercliff: unlikely even|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hi all|pg||
nt|capercliff: hey Martin|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome to Martin Garvey (England)|pg||
nt|idc: I was remionded of some dates I've been on years ago|pg||
nt|viren169: No|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure is, but Ireland will NOT be winning the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|pkl: Do you have the standings, Bjorling?|pg||
nt|viren169: Bal'd 11 counts are looking for swings!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think NI has every chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! once I had contact with Golf & leisure Ireland. They sponsored a tournament at my club once a year|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but now itÂ´s bridge....|pg||
nt|toobad: sorry folks, Ciara Burns and Diane Greenwood ........... in the open room, i hope!! lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont care for that S suit lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makes things difficult|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you are right John - always 4@h + 3@d + @sA = 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad breaks abound tho|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes she should have cashed the A@H early as either k drops or has to ruff Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: with it|pg||
nt|lestergold: east opening light here pard is gonna do a lot of bidding now |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mariner1: part score special here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: Pass - really must be a question of style|pg||
nt|viren169: The Hackett boys would have opened East's hand in their sleep!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Northern Ireland 1, Scotland 2, Ireland 3, Ireland B 4 England 5  Wales 6|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: better to defend 2@s as EW and play it|pg||
nt|toobad: it will keep them out of trouble and 3/3 break |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N swish likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile hjard for vul opps to get into auction and find their club fit!|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: some of them were unlickly too :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  evening Cliff Jeffrey and Ian|pg||
nt|toobad: is that leb?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tihas: S aggressive opening bid mught get NS to 3NT|pg||
nt|tihas: which actually makes on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: 41s is a practical bid here|pg||
nt|jallerton: can N avoid partner's suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|capercliff: Scots better cash their tricks|pg||
nt|idc: hi Martin|pg||
nt|mariner1: a rounded suit works best|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s need to get the @H suit right (not sure that is easy)|pg||
nt|mariner1: now do we see action here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I ment instead of play it..|pg||
nt|toobad: at least the vulnerability is in their favour|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree John, but points in is better....|pg||
nt|toobad: this isnt a speedball then?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who wants to play in S?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should wrap up 9 quick tricks in 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|thegarve:  missed the first set and it looks to be  a close match|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I would open the E hand if I were dead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a real crunchy 11 count Not Vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whatever it is TROUBLE|pg||
nt|toobad: here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Intersting this 2@C bid... seems like it can be used for any hand!|pg||
nt|sybarra: who lead k of @H  (nobody) |pg||
mb|4H|nt|toobad: cutting down the ruffs early|pg||
nt|thegarve:  North took no risks with a 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u come in with t count vul holding two suits one of which has been bid by opps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but off on a heart lead - all up to East now|pg||
nt|tihas: so rather fortunate 11 imps for Monte carlo|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 2@C is? single suiter?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D or both majors I imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure where we are going here |pg||
nt|jcomyn: neither are they|pg||
nt|ralfwil: from a small trouble to a bigger|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pass 3D anything is better than this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NI new pair setting out stall early|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ante|pg||
nt|viren169: Makes sense now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6count|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S lead kills 3N,,,,,,, not sure it can be found|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n is the only game that has the vestige of a prayer|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: this might be best |pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead likely and some play now|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead if club opener was natural is absolutely off the scale|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pkl: Could 2@C be four spades and another?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcomyn: dont think so, they play ante|pg||
nt|sybarra: sp taps and what does W do? |pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|idc: Ace is for reverse attitude, so they should cash out|pg||
nt|capercliff: udca|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: I cant figure this bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: here |pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I must bid on S I had prefered 2nt (15-17) before D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|idc: wild boards in 1st half, lots of slams|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is tap  1 |pg||
nt|mariner1: she is removing her own transportation, so its good that @S will break for her|pg||
nt|mariner1: sort of an oops on the @D suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a funny kind of way the l;ead was successful|pg||
nt|lestergold: east didnt dare safety play the dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an oops Rob east is expecting a club thru and the falling in of the roof|pg||
nt|mariner1: well since 3 2 @D also put it in jeapardy the safety play still had value|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: can knock out @DA for nine tricks |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a small @h had been better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think a player at this level ould not make a safety play otherwise when they ar in a thin contract and delightwed to make it|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops 3 - 1 @D I mean|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: as spades are 4-3 |pg||
nt|viren169: I guess we will have to wait until next hand to know for sure...|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|pkl: Ah - sorry. Did stare a bit at that word. I don't know that convention ;-)|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice defence...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ante is 2C=D or both majors; 2D= H or S and a aminor; 2H H and a minor ; 2S=S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes the trump attack is good and works well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: in one with perfect fits and 3 grand slams available for NS, england reached game & scotland 4@d :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck! no exit card!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pkl: Ah... makes sense|pg||
nt|viren169: Thks|pg||
nt|sybarra: no rush on the @H  we know those cash |pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back now|pg||
nt|sybarra: k of @C or a @D? now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a @D we know that will be there also |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 - 0 @D is 10% so 60% for the play once S followed|pg||

nt|lestergold: and all then rest but one now to the defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: if S plays Q@D then you are off the hook and can duck,,,|pg||
nt|lestergold: the problem with taht Rob is that if follow low which is correct on the layout- uve lost the chance of dropping the stiff queen offside|pg||
nt|mariner1: if S ducks the J then you are still a higher % to duck than to win in W|pg||

nt|lestergold: slam time|pg||
nt|ady: good chance for n/s to hit back here|pg||
nt|athene: 7@H is pretty good here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One would have though they could have checked for @HQ next door|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: too good for a roland grand here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is 7@H pretty good? It's way below pair for a grand slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: but back on planet earth they had better settle for the small|pg||
nt|athene: it's fortunate for the defence that west doesn't believe in the "always lead a trump against a grand slam" idea|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: below par even|pg||
nt|henryb: it is 52%. If you think you are the underdog it is fair enough to bid it|pg||
nt|athene: surely it's better than 52%|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course but u gave 14 ish percent for your grands roalnd the other day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 57.5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still not good enough for a grand slam|pg||
nt|april7: does W lead @H against 7@H??? if not S might finesse W for that Q, because of not leading a trump as one should against 7!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 6h is surely in the infrangibility category|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|henryb: indeed, I forgot about picking up 4-0|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: i wonder if east made the very thin double of 5@S to stop his partner leading a trump?|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding a grand missing 4 to the q would be an error|pg||
nt|henryb: with QJ109 it is acceptable to not lead a trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless you were desperate for pick ups|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: perhaps declarer could pick up on that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: why would you make a lead-directing double missing AKJ in the suit?|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, a rule of thumb is that it should be as good as a suit breaking 3-2. So we are in the high 60's|pg||
nt|athene: it would be a huge view to take, i suppose....|pg||
nt|henryb: because you can beat 5@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6n notb too bad a spopt either|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh i was being axcademic and humouirouis abouit the grand|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt expect them to bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Henry said something bidding this morning|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please repeat|pg||
nt|lestergold: now all our theories will be put to the test|pg||
nt|lestergold: er west on er lead!!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: nop trump lead|pg||
nt|april7: in CR S didn't finesse W for the Q of trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: one off is my prediction|pg||
nt|athene: the problem for declarer is, west has a very safe club sequence to lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, he would not lead a trump from Qx either, so that point is moot|pg||
nt|athene: so there's no inference really that he has any special reason to avoid a trump lead|pg||
nt|april7: but why not starting with ace then??|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are not backward bidders these boys an unsound grand inm both rooms at their top level|pg||
nt|ady: what was 5NT    could not South bid 5@S to ask for trump queen?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: wouldnt see this in italy us uk norway etc|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb: so far in this event there has been some excellent play and exotic bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT should guarantee all keycards + trump queen|pg||
nt|april7: this S will probably start withace|pg||
nt|ady: so 5NT wrong|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|henryb: yes; needs a sixth heart or the queen for that bid|pg||

nt|capercliff: 1N?|pg||
nt|viren169: Good hands for opening weak NT|pg||
nt|pkl: It looks like the limit is 2@S EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt n/s?  have she handle it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont like 5-4 twos I believe it should always be 5-5|pg||
nt|santyclz: We get spoiled playing on bbo where that would have been claimed at trick 3.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  N/S should save in 5@d over 4@s - no guarantees though|pg||
nt|lestergold: when does it gain ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it is 100% the best line, whether it works or not :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: disagree on this occasion|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: nothing she does was a 100% so you opt for the best line|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: otherwise it would have been very dangerous play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these are again very tricky boards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c on W but how?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N ... about only game that makes either way best defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: an we open what with N hand?|pg||
nt|mariner1: we pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: E will open|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hope I have a 2 suited bid in my arsenal actually |pg||
nt|mariner1: if you open N you will never get both suits in and show as weak as you are|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes if you have that then its works here|pg||
nt|mariner1: a two suiter by N would possibly lead EW into 3N though|pg||
nt|sybarra: true also Rob|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|capercliff: 2@h will need a bit of luck|pg||
nt|pkl: Kelly knew that ;-)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: notice that excellent hand to start was a mere 2S in open room - jeepers|pg||
nt|viren169: Now North may roll back in with a dble...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|toobad: d trans coming up|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 3nt likely e/w|pg||
nt|mariner1: so does that|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has an interesting problem..... pass, 4@H or DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H would be my call though.........|pg||
mb|4H|nt|thegarve:  East will protect with a double|pg||
nt|viren169: and E/W will take the push to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|idc: just about to suggest the same thing|pg||
nt|idc: it isn't mandatory at teams, but just about worth it I think|pg||
nt|jallerton: giving W a decision|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@s will need even more luck|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant imagine W floating it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and they mat even play in the 33 @s fit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@c to show a good @h weak 2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: it would be tempting to pass on 2@s with E hand|pg||
nt|tihas: but you have to be fairly certain that partner would balance also with 6 hcp|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East goes for the vulnerable game - might even have bid 3NT |pg||
nt|jallerton: in which case East did well to pass out 2@h|pg||
nt|idc: 3-3 fits are good for you, they often play quite well|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like Knight got their 1st!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and interesting hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: even I wouldnt bid 2S on that rubbish|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: when you see all 4 hands it is often very hard to give an honest opinion,,,,, S|pg||
nt|mariner1: agrees though|pg||

nt|lestergold: if either opp holds singleton q its a losing play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H makes here|pg||
mb|5C|nt|idc: for one thing, the fdefenders rarely realize what's afoot|pg||
nt|capercliff: might make 2@h on this lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'd still prefer to defend 2@h that play in the concealed 3-3 fit vulnerable|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the 33 fit often plays rather well|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes because you normally have a 9-card side suit:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 3nt on W with a @h lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and in the only case it helps it needs an error from the defence |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South might have led the @SJ|pg||
mb|5H|nt|viren169: dble by S is a bit risky with West still unlimited|pg||
nt|viren169: and only 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Cant see any line to make this...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a trick she didnt have |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and a really bad lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with @dA on N always 9 tricks in nt|pg||
nt|toobad: i prefer 2nt rather than 3d from W|pg||
nt|sharkirl: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|mariner1: look at it later without worrying about being off,,,, consider only making it|pg||
mb|5S!|nt|tihas: the 2@s opening actually got NS out of the trouble with bad @h break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: was 2D a transfer?|pg||
nt|toobad: doubt it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then why did E bid 2H?|pg||
nt|toobad: prob dont play transfers to minors over interference|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at last they were. but I donÂ´t think they were agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi michael|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats what i am considering|pg||
nt|mariner1: this will play easy enough|pg||
mb|d|mb|7H|nt|mdgraham: partner's suit, and all that|pg||
nt|tihas: they probably would have arrived in 4@h if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|henryb: gee. I would get to 2@h|pg||
nt|tihas: 2@s opening promised a minor, too, so the logical thing would be to look for this minor|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i suspect more IMPs out here and at this rate for CBAI to clock up a century soon|pg||
nt|santyclz: The w hand has 2 strikes against it for a weak 2.  4 cards in the other major and a side ace.  Either one might be ignored, but both is iffy.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  FWIW I wiuld have opened the South hand 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: So any possiblility to win 3@S? There's no legit way, but could Pender perform some kind of magic? I dont believe so|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks cast-iron - north's overcall was somewhat light- hearted|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: 3d and a s it looks like|pg||
nt|toobad: tick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: w will make|pg||
nt|thegarve:  or 1@s playing my strong @C system showing hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: how can it rbe right to play the J when its never right for defenders tio cover and its never right to run it either|pg||
nt|mariner1: no you are hung up on N getting in without considering the highest % to make|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|henryb: 1@c-1@d-1@s-1NT-2@h all pass|pg||

nt|april7: another slamtry here?|pg||
nt|henryb: how would you plan to handle the S hand? 2@d, then 4N over 4 of a major?|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to start with 2@D with south|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: par is 6d doubled by n/s off one|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: if you start with 2NT, it's hard to show extra diamond length without bypassing clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: lets see if these exotic bidders achieve par|pg||
nt|april7: now 5@H asks for 2 @C losers!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doublt it|pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 2nt then (for example) 4nt, as they did in the other room, that just suggests 6-6 or something|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: very distributional     up to 5@H  for e/w    n/s  can sacrifice  even red agains green in 6@D  down 1|pg||
nt|henryb: since you really really want to play in @d when partner is 2-2, showing roughly equal minors is silly|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w will not risk vul n/s making 6dims remember aces split|pg||
mb|4N|nt|april7: 5@H by W is a possible bid, asking for @C second round control|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict e/w overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Aslan extremely lucky that partner has longer diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: this competition will swamp the science|pg||

nt|Walddk2: never|pg||
nt|henryb: he should.|pg||
nt|athene: if he pulls this, he is making a slam try, right?|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why didn't he bid 5@H over 4nt?|pg||
nt|henryb: he said "I have a game force with a stiff diamond. What extra does he have?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts 'too many'|pg||

nt|jcomyn: 3NT or 4S?|pg||
nt|toobad: 3n|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I like 2@d on E. I have seen many players bid 1@s on E here om BBO|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes awful isnt it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@H looks to be fairly easy to bid|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may find it difficult to get there with @D concentration|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C is my call with S..........|pg||
nt|sybarra: a quiet raise to 2 @H....|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sharkirl: was afraid of that|pg||
nt|sharkirl: positive bid in @Cs would make it easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: well both n +s have some extras but the splinter wont excite north|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ralfwil: What about 3@s on W?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: south must go on now|pg||
nt|mariner1: she has too much for 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Due to normal first round start-up glitches, we've missed a few boards, but with luck|pg||
nt|jallerton: I believe that EW play 5-card majors, strong NT, possibly also 2@d opener 18-19 balanced.|pg||
nt|capercliff: do they have more than one way to show? If not 2@h is pretty tame|pg||
nt|thegarve:  looks a bit too defensive and no ruffing value for a vul 2S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT is the best chance of game EW|pg||
nt|idc: East hand is borderline try I guess - playing with me it's not but lots of vul weak twos will give play for game|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2NT hre surely?|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would have thought|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think they may be playing 2 ranges of weak 2|pg||
nt|jallerton: this being the weaker variety|pg||
nt|capercliff: so this is the rubbish one?|pg||
nt|pkl: You are contemplating the fourth club by N? Will it cause problems?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well I cant see anyway S will lead a C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And I dont like Blackwood with a void!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes an advantage that 2/1 has|pg||
nt|roswolf: mid you south should cue now|pg||
nt|roswolf: mind|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is not bad too on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: pass is wet|pg||
nt|sharkirl: R.O.I. bid the 6|pg||
mb|5H|nt|viren169: I expected a little more bidding on this hand... perhaps the girls are running out of steam!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi peter|pg||
nt|toobad: what nt are ns playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Wales probably just picked up a nice score on the last hand |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done competent bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and without a @c lead, E must not find @dQ - @hJ is falling|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 3-0 is annoying though|pg||
nt|sharkirl: certainly worth a 4@S bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: E-w seem to be playing weak nt's not vul and strong vul (see bd 18).|pg||
nt|lestergold: and of course they are can only lose 2c and a spade|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C could be good or bad depending....... not clear here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: hmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: will the welsh pair do so?|pg||
nt|mariner1: seh might make 4 however that needs defensive help|pg||
nt|mariner1: she|pg||
nt|lestergold: and n/s can also make 3n|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: best contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this isnt junior bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: 1\C shows 2+ clubs|pg||

nt|thegarve:  only 1 off so no big deal|pg||
nt|jallerton: sharp double from E|pg||
nt|idc: the Scottish ladies have done a lot of protecting this match|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It cannot be difficult to find the @d in the defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Mark|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idc: I think they may have been playing too much pairs|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, any pairs is too much|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must lead small from W|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes which means that in practice it is often a genuine suit since its only used otherwise when the distribution iforces it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: missed next door - poor effort|pg||
nt|sharkirl: was awkward for N over splinter|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|toobad: 3 on ice on that lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe N felt 41c had play, but very risky|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@c|pg||
nt|capercliff: this might drift 2 off actually|pg||
nt|thegarve:  might well have made kx of @d is a good holding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  East will cash out|pg||
nt|capercliff: is there any hurry?|pg||
nt|idc: well, one way to try for -2 is cash out then @s ruff & discard|pg||
nt|capercliff: partner has to have something to open 2@d, if not a lot|pg||
nt|idc: declarer's trump position starts to look fragile - though as the cards lie she should escape ok|pg||
nt|thegarve:  people get worried in a doubled contracr and like to see the finishing line|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb: lazy bidding by N in the other room|pg||

nt|mariner1: EW have a @H save|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south shouldthird in hand bid it|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes E could bid 2 if not 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s my girl |pg||
mb|4H|nt|petepunt: fav vul,  1st or3rd.  but still tempted in 2nd|pg||
nt|roswolf: and south may try a transfer to clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: still, N had described balanced hand and driven to slam, so there was a case of adding one more for the road, because S actually hadnt shown a lot in the bidding|pg||
nt|tihas: but its tough at the table to do so|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d = less than 16 points, no 5 card or longer major|pg||
nt|tihas: I think N with balanced hand should have constrained to showing his values|pg||
nt|sharkirl: will they compete?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its the 4th match of six on a 25VP scale and this is the second half of a match|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets non vul opps in and puts pard under too much pressure|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does not need much for slam here....... KQx @c might do it,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: and A@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: strong NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Border line for me... |pg||
nt|lestergold: how will pard know that her qj to 4 clubs is worth three tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: NS play Acol, weak NT, Multi 2@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont criticize the bid, its just not my style |pg||
nt|thegarve:  5th match|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkirl: that was the danger - 2@H might be just a balancing bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: wonder what 2@H specifically shows?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: a bid showing both majors gives a second chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: h and s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: too difficult - if partner jumps to the six-level, he should know what he is doing |pg||
nt|steshome: I thought E/W were playing a weak NT, but we might have a chance to find out soon|pg||
nt|jallerton: S had an interesting decision: pass, double, 3@h or 2NT|pg||
nt|idc: Fearless protecting at teams, vul v not|pg||
nt|petepunt: south had tough bids,  final pass seems about right|pg||
nt|sharkirl: Irish girls are off to a good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have been in now having failed to find a preempt on thefirst round|pg||
nt|mariner1: no chance slam tried here now....... 4@S and out soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is give ur opps free reign to walk all over you bridge|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: my sentiments - that leaves D out of it God gave us 12pts to open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: okay SK but 4-card H|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed Mike, E holding 5 pts and NV vs RED in 3rd needs to JAM as soon as|pg||
nt|mariner1: she can|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless they walk all over themselves that is|pg||
nt|mariner1: wow|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S has to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|toobad: with only 2 clubs and no diamonds, South would have 11 major suit cards!!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too true|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 or more here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the result on 4?|pg||
nt|mariner1: bid mistake here|pg||
nt|lestergold: nlow shell balanmce!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: big|pg||
nt|mariner1: they must not play 2@C forcing to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: no she has maintained a consistent silence absurd on the first two occaqsions worth a brilliancy prize on the third!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe she is having an attack of lock jaw or lost her bidding box|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jallerton: Oh yes, I think you are right, Sarah.  Their 1NT rebid is 15-17!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats what the 2S did - keep opps out of trouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why 3S by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: could only get in so much trouble in @D |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and didnt bid over 2D so bound to have a relatively balanced hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahh, those are the vps not current imp standings.  Duh.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H making 2 I think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pkl: God does not play bridge - according to Niels Bohr, he doesn't even roll dices|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Its a shame that noe of the British Isles countries have any decent software to show hand records and boards - other countries such as Norway do it easily|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: in which case east might have bid 3@H as i play over a strong nt that 2@H promises good values|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump switch now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the minors well placed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t agree with this bidding. As I play N has shown a minimum|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still has a squeak - not a loud one but a squeak|pg||
nt|sybarra: just pesky that @h are 3/1 |pg||
nt|mariner1: she only needs one ruff in dummy so can lead @H tp hand and @D to dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is why you have to open 4s with this tupe of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes you go down thats life|pg||
nt|mariner1: meanwhile ROI has won the 1st 16 imps vs NI|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: 2d was art semi-positive|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not as bad as not bidding an infrangible throw against the wall icy idiot proof game|pg||
pc|dT|nt|idc: Stockdale might have put a red card on this, but she may have been worried about getting blood on her dress :)|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I was wondering if double was a possibility.  Still time for a trump switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: looks as though E is trying to put W in to get a ruff (or two if partner has @sK10x|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 3 @S to keep n/s out of minor suit partial '|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob 9 tricks|pg||

nt|jcomyn: no ralf the other way|pg||

pc|h3|nt|thegarve:  a low @d and a bit of worry now|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: north has shown three spades, so why is he bidding 4@S? why not 3@H, or 3NT, or something?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: partially: South had no where to go, but North thought 2@s showed five trumps|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Cliff Gillis|pg||
nt|capercliff: hello folks|pg||
nt|jallerton: pass out possible|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done, W will rue that result|pg||
nt|viren169: Eire are putting the imps on the board.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: helped by Wales it has to be said|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who wins this one?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done,  that may be a partial both teams,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: willl be interesting score |pg||
nt|sybarra: that 800 tightened up the match |pg||
nt|jcomyn: ordinary 3NT but you never know here|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have a play for 3n in the E|pg||
nt|mariner1: calm 4@H making 5 here|pg||
nt|lestergold: except its dangerous at this vul occasionalloy you have a slam opposite a  passed patner who holds a perfecto more often you let opps in with their grabage|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  4@S on the previous hand - not sure what 2@s 2NT 3@D meant|pg||
nt|viren169: Weak 2 in hearts will get Pender excited|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W if South doesnt bid here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we were right John game on board 4|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1 bid hand this|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in W has a shot too...... would have to duck a @S lead in both hands|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: on the 7-level setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, 7@S good save|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S have a 1400 save in 7@s|pg||
nt|pkl: South just have a 3@D bid now ... so will it be 5@D?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: u favour 4@H opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: or could rise Q@S I suppose|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: 3@S E|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: Hi Cliff - sit over there in Martin Garvey's chair|pg||
nt|capercliff: where is it?:)|pg||
nt|idc: just tell us how every hand is being misbid and we won't even notice he isn't here :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d both majors I suppose|pg||
nt|capercliff: prob some sort of Ogust|pg||
nt|thegarve:  what range is 2@D majors?|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S|pg||
nt|pkl: Only 3@H by Pender? He knows Kelly quite well, apparently|pg||
nt|jcomyn: SHE|pg||
nt|pkl: Sorry - She ;-)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: The Lady Milne is for LADIES only|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wow a vul NT on that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: have you seen the lead?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh sorry didnt see the opoening bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you don't overcall 1@h, don't complain when your pd doesn't defend as well as possible.|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
mb|d!|nt|henryb: 4N would not occur to me|pg||
nt|henryb: 1100 I stand corrected|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Scotland in the lead though last hand may change that|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: would you double as West?|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I would|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3@h is pre-empting yourself|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5-9|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass?!?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed in the main to stop both opps + pard from bidding/suggesting leads etc|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 6@H looks likely to be bid in the other room on Board 4 - 1@H : 3@C opening sequence|pg||
nt|sharkirl: probably difficult to stay out of 6 here now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: If 1@c could be 11-13 bal, probably not|pg||
nt|jallerton: No, sorry to mislead you earlier, 1@c was natural or 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|idc: but since that isn't what they play, i probably would|pg||
nt|steshome: Is that lead right?|pg||
nt|capercliff: ive never understood playing 1N natural here, but I suppose these days opp open and respond with anything|pg||
nt|capercliff: and N certainly has @h stopped|pg||
nt|thegarve:  as East was a passed hand|pg||
nt|pkl: Ouch. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 matches tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17, 2@C c/b|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 1nt-opening both hands have a @d lead in defence|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no penalty X any more|pg||
nt|roswolf: on another day north would pass this and they would miss a game|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is nothing here FRob to give us an opporunity to have a good old public debate about odds|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: West consults system file for "Interference over Blackwood" section |pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a logical lead; E thinks that declarer has @cJxxx and partner may have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: A lot like to play 2H natural there, so that would be an option|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and made|pg||
nt|sybarra: best to play from W?|pg||
nt|mariner1: should get this right as if S has A@C then she is always off so has to play N for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: in desperate times like these, E might actually consider bidding 7@h all by himself after partner launches blackwood|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes reasonable shot|pg||
nt|capercliff: could it hurt to get count in @c first?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not a great success here, however.  I think a top club would be found by most people (rightly or wrongly)|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I agree|pg||
nt|capercliff: good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|petepunt: may have upgraded S to 18-19 an drebid 2n|pg||
nt|thegarve:  will build a 9th trick in @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: well easier to play in E however should make anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: not easy for E to bid 3N though|pg||
nt|mariner1: rise Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: or duck just do not win in hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Aussies call that "punting" :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n or 4h sldegehammer proof two bullets only to lose|pg||
nt|mariner1: in US when you "punt" you give up :0|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: good thing declarer doesnt have 7 top tricks now|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, Cliff, is partner has a singleton club|pg||
nt|viren169: Wales are giving Eire a ahead strart before they get going... |pg||
nt|mariner1: Oz punting = betting on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: for me 1nt on W is too weak 11 HP and two 10|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they might be thinking of the 6 they missed on B 4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: yes too stroing with two bullets|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this is not nice at all|pg||
nt|toobad: EW off in 3nt played from the west hand on board 19, so another plus to NI|pg||
nt|roswolf: now we are in dangerous territory since north has cuebid clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: 6@H+1 may be EW's best result. NS likely to save over a seven bid|pg||
nt|jallerton: she can finesse in @H|pg||
nt|capercliff: but will still roll home with 3-2@h and 3-3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: should be OK with @s 3-3 and @dA onside|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: suits dont break well|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: now they are dead|pg||
nt|sharkirl: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi Joe|pg||
nt|mariner1: now she has it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jallerton: and W cannot get in to lead a low @d|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharkirl: as predicted |pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: the best possible result, rather than the best result possible :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If you are in 4@h and @s is lead, you will make!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely cant pass 3H bid thats bold Mary Madden|pg||
pc|hK|nt|thegarve:  East cannot get West in to play the pressure low @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: W figures to hold at least 5@D here so may guess @Hs right (vacant spaces)|pg||
nt|petepunt: however, may prefer to play on @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: choices choices I hate them|pg||
nt|petepunt: if @S a @C swith will defeat i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west has no other lead but a top club|pg||
nt|lestergold: u mean north should have considered slam possibilities he was pretty close to thinking about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: shde|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|jcomyn: musthave found the C lead against 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh my:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Still a trick short if defense is careful.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Cliff Gillis|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|capercliff: hello again|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: with hts not breaking ......|pg||
nt|toobad: 2d was going for a number, wires badly crossed|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I wonder why all weekend Ladies seem to have such problems with their leads, when lead looks standard|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is lucky that there arent 12 tricks on top - this should still go -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Cliff,  glad you arrived as I have to leave |pg||
nt|mariner1: just needs to not set up those losing @D tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|capercliff: chances of stiff @c are less than giving away the contract no?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now the H should be played right|pg||
nt|sharkirl: not if east lets go a @D on run of @Hs|pg||
nt|capercliff: ahhh|pg||
nt|mariner1: no I was speaking to the odds statement you made :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no bullets no singletons|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: no slam tries N here|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: It would still make 9 tricks with a @h lead in this case.|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Cliff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkirl: and they only got to 5 on Board 4 in the other room|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: but "right|pg||
nt|petepunt: odds still close|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi Rob|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: but "right" is a gentle term,  E  has a ht trick coming |pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt: 1@S 4!g 3@D 1C is ideal but tough|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petepunt: 4@H,  1@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: declarer thinking|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharkirl: only chance is to play 3 more rounds of @Hs and pray|pg||
nt|mariner1: N pitching a @D helps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: Q@H now strangles N|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: well both defenders should know the position and in particular that no trick can be ducked to rectify the count|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: time for a concession|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting ropey|pg||
nt|petepunt: small will guarantee|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh well it was a thoughtful lead as you say Jeffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: prayers coming|pg||
pc|dT|nt|viren169: If 4@C is NF... North has to start with a dble...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I  noticed this in the first session - there are no penalty doubles on lower levels today!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as I mentioned earlier whats wrong with leaving 2D X in - it is not a disaster if it happens to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 3 or 4 now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|viren169: Not easy...|pg||
nt|santyclz: It may be hard for e to imagine the @cak in w.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pkl: North has a fantastic hand after 3@D. If anything, she could bid 4@H as slam invitational.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|toobad: on that bidding 2d dble is clear penalty|pg||
nt|jcomyn: absolutely couldnt anything else|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Adam|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jallerton: undo|pg||
nt|sybarra: so cu later |pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: funny little hand this|pg||
nt|idc: we're being made to pay for the exciting hands in the first half|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s looks pretty routine after stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ok Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H@H!  thx all |pg||
nt|capercliff: but that would be ambitious|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam makes that I see|pg||
nt|lestergold: if e/w were not vulnerable then there might be some interest here possible sacrifices barrages but at this vulnerability east will pass quickly|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and it is very close now I think|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I sure the dealing machine, or the players, will have some excitement for us.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: this lot are a lot flatter|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 3N by e/w perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 7@h on 2 hooks anyone?|pg||
nt|steshome: Another reasonable slam.  |pg||
nt|jallerton: Roland, maybe|pg||
nt|viren169: brave dble|pg||
nt|petepunt: by, shirley good luck|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored @c and no place to put a @S from S means no slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can not afford to miss another game|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they have shown a little propensity to do that unfortunately|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D might be the call here,,,,, though that might be too strong|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: 2@D transfer?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 2@d = 6@h and I think 8-11 points|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT = 4-card raise, 3@S = shortage, I think|pg||
nt|steshome: The 3@S bid should get them to 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.cbai.ie/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 60 series England has won on 46 occasions, Scotland on 9, Wales won three times and Northern Ireland twice. The Republic of Ireland, joining the series in 1998, has yet to win|pg||
nt|idc: i prefer 3NT by North after a 15-17 NT |pg||
nt|thegarve:    4@Sor 3NT - looks like all the hands with singleton and voids were used up in the last set|pg||
nt|capercliff: my predictions living up to the bill|pg||
nt|idc: SHould make on power when a bad trump split might doom 4@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmm|pg||
nt|petepunt: interestin what u should play 2@s as here|pg||
nt|mariner1: can't set up @D to pitch enough @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think double followed by another spade bidaltho 2s should show almost these values|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL 3@S 3@D all reasonable|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Hope N/S have a way of showing values here - Lebensohl or similar.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S could be a great suit with less values I thihnk|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: For the first time we have six teams taking part. The sixth spot goes to the host, this year Ireland. They are represented by two teams: Republic of Ireland and CBAI (Contract ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bridge Association of Ireland)|pg||
nt|jallerton: not with 5-3 clubs...|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, if @c weren't 4-4 I'd be wrong but that wouldn't be the first time :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2H and leave it there|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is not 3-card drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Maybe, Sarah, although the minor suit jacks help to make 6@h so good|pg||
nt|steshome: Roland you heard your name being taken in vain! We think you would be in 7@h on this one|pg||
nt|pkl: Oh - that D is obvious with my glasses on|pg||
nt|pkl: Ah - perhaps not.... *shining glasses*|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@d by w anyone?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@d natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a 2s bid north would have no excuse for not inviting game|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: or 3@D cue?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now 3s and they are thwere|pg||
mb|3S|nt|capercliff: I would rather be in 4@s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a safe part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Without any doubt|pg||
nt|idc: EW or NS?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I confess I would pass in 4th seat if 1nt weren't available.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 2s is a slight underbid and this sequence is a slight overbid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|viren169: Looks like N/S are on their way to 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: CBAI managed to bid 4@H on Board 5 after a 1@C opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unless you paid my debts!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: NW|pg||
nt|santyclz: Response to 1@h, not opening.|pg||
nt|capercliff: but I believe they are playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the right spot and should make 5|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Phew.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: In the Camrose Trophy and Lady Milne (women), the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland play as separate entities, unlike other international competitions where the Irish Bridge ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Union sends one team to represent the island of Ireland|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting is that you kinda need both finesses to make 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many times did you win the LM, Sarah?|pg||
nt|capercliff: but 8x@d is helpful|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe she lost count|pg||

mb|p|nt|steshome: I don't know Roland.  I think six?|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@H is enough with Marray's hand, 2@S seems to be over stating their hand...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good to play 2@H as about 8-10 and 3@S and 2@S as 5-7 ?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: six is correct|pg||
nt|capercliff: is West worth another try?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Ah, so Roland was just testing!|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe 4@s?|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if they have agreements over the dbl - would pass by East have been more serious try for example?|pg||
nt|idc: maybe it would just have shown some sort of control and 4@c denies one|pg||

nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good spot here|pg||

nt|lestergold: a coup-le of clubs or nso vs a couple of diamonds|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: could only reach 4@d :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2NT-3NT ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a part score battle between the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@D = good raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|idc: hard to avoid 4@s now - but it does have some slim chances I suppose|pg||
nt|thegarve:  or show a weak doubleton major|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h direct now?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like only part scores here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: was east going to pass 2@HX for penalty?|pg||
nt|capercliff: Im assuming S passed what N thought was a forcing bid|pg||
nt|jallerton: a good method to play transfers from 1NT upwards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not 1D by S?|pg||
nt|pkl: Okay... 1@C looks sensible too - especially if your NT range doesn't comply ;-)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: why bid this way?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: u are right|pg||
nt|sharkirl: unlikely to get to 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome: Level now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @d2 from W E must trust her P and play low!|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn not high ones either a short auction i expecvt|pg||
nt|mariner1: well EW could play a @S Moysian but will not be found|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has valued her hand on the slightly optimistic side|pg||
nt|lestergold: the two jx dont count up to 2 worthwhile points|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb: 3N has good chances|pg||
nt|petepunt: strong NTrumpers may get to 6@D though|pg||
nt|petepunt: after 1D opening!|pg||
nt|mariner1: and NS cards are well situated over EW|pg||
nt|capercliff: needs to pick up the @h, there goes the @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the @c problem is solved|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 4@s has none|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT = 3-card raise?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  50-50 decisions.....|pg||
nt|idc: CC says bergen raises, surprised they can have only 3 card support|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2@d must have been @d and a major|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Agreed, but AQ109xx is worth more than 6 points.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3d is probably too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: Soctland only lost 4 imps on 21, dodges a BIG BULLET|pg||
mb|4H|nt|idc: the supplementary notes are missing, so no more detail|pg||
nt|jallerton: this needs a lot going for it to make|pg||

nt|capercliff: sm@d to the 8|pg||
nt|jallerton: in @s, @d and @c|pg||
nt|idc: @dT lead was perhaps one chance, as long as declarer ducked first round|pg||
nt|viren169: Now they will reach the poor 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would bid 3@S FORCING and then over 4@S (which west shoul bid) bid 6|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: my wife is a beginner and I would slap her hand if she bid 1H over 1C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: difficult after some jump by E|pg||

nt|mariner1: Open made 3N where 4@H was off here so 12 imps on board 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: why?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: just has to hope @d are 4-4|pg||
nt|henryb: and @s 3-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It seems that South does not like leading his partner's suit|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it is against the rules in Estonia based on observations yesterday and today|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this lead will worry declarer, until he sees the 4-4 split|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with xx and await developments|pg||
nt|mariner1: that was board 6 sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: ROI has overtaken N. Ireland! so Scotland in the driver's seat now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: one has to remmebe that a neg double doesnt promise the earthso when rebidding one should only jump with a full monty kind of hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: This is a good game to reach, some chances of it being missed in the replay|pg||
nt|viren169: That's why she would bid 1@H|pg||

pc|h3|nt|sharkirl: surely claim coming up|pg||

nt|lestergold: the kind of hand in whioch you had a jump rebid when partner responds at the one level- north hand did not qualify for that|pg||
pc|h6|nt|capercliff: 4@s is a good save but tough at these colors|pg||
nt|thegarve:  where's Frazer - "we;re doomed"  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: What can @d2 be? fourth best or what else?|pg||
nt|capercliff: down 1 now|pg||
nt|mariner1: CBAI can pick up on 7 too to close this match up|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: perhaps N felt her hand worth a strong NT rebid|pg||
nt|pkl: Hypothetical slaps seems proper for hypothetical auctions|pg||

mb|4D|nt|thegarve:  11 for us Jeffrey?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 64 imps in eight boards, with one flat. Not bad |pg||
nt|othered1: with kind splits, this is no problem|pg||

nt|jallerton: No, this is their only way to open a weak 2|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx Jeffery|pg||
nt|jallerton: some prefer a decent suit, vulnerable|pg||
nt|idc: there isn't a lot between the three possible games, but 4@s is the worst and on this layout, it may fail|pg||
nt|capercliff: if you turn the @h into @s it would be an easy pass no?|pg||
nt|steshome: How quaint ...|pg||
nt|jallerton: I don't know the meaning of 3@S (it was alerted) but if natural it sounds more like 3-card support|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WRONG on both counts Ralf older and higher|pg||
nt|capercliff: but if they dont play reverses GF, then a bid back to partners original suit is non-forcing|pg||

nt|toobad: i am only good on the 19th|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in that case letÂ´s join there...|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes expert play|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score special here|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: Table slow, players asking TD for a monitor|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@d over 3@c perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think that was bad luck a lot of players would reach six sopades on those cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: ROI now 34 1st imps vs NI so Scotland looking good so far|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was anexcellent contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: true you normally want to be in that slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  2nt |pg||

mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: in D but that wont happen|pg||

nt|petepunt: traaditional acol 2@H, ahh thos were the days!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1H with that???|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3N in S a better spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bound to be 4s now|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|petepunt: 4@H !  noahs arc bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well thats me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: none of us is perfect|pg||
nt|petepunt: :) west can x2h then bid 3@H to show this hand maybe!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Leb I assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: interesting to see how they get to 3NT here|pg||
nt|pkl: As cards lay, there are 13 tricks. I would be happy to end in 6@D|pg||
nt|viren169: Only in diamonds!|pg||
nt|toobad: yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Playing for CBAI, 1@d, for Wales, 2nt.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|capercliff: how or if?|pg||
nt|steshome: Equally of course 2@h-2@s-3@c would get there of course ...|pg||
nt|idc: I've watched too many English teams bid & make close games over the years to think they will end up anywhere else :)|pg||
nt|idc: Awful defence - @dT lead, declarer didn't duck, so they got their ruff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hate that 3S bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes - flat boards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: S wopnt pass|pg||
nt|toobad: dddd leaves spades in bad nick|pg||
nt|santyclz: May be hard to get to 4@h now.|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored hands hurt here|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as 4./1 spade break|pg||
nt|mariner1: as does 4 - 1 @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead best frodefence|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might lead a @S to help solve the issue|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Scotland seem to be heading for 6@s in the open room on board 26.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: (Not that it's a great contract.)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well K lead is sort of nuetral|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim looks ridiculous but gives nothing away in practice|pg||
nt|lestergold: west had a difficult set of choices|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead looks safe|pg||
nt|mariner1: though 4@D sets up|pg||
nt|rednaxela: The dreaded mirror distribution leaves declarer with few options.|pg||
nt|lestergold: which unsafe lead was the issue?|pg||
nt|mariner1: lot to do here for S|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a complete perfect mirror|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 6@s it is.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S also in Open Room on 26|pg||
nt|mariner1: ducking this might help|pg||
nt|lestergold: not much|pg||
nt|mariner1: neither is winning it attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will simply continue knowing that it cant cost|pg||
nt|mariner1: S could hope its a stiff and W has KQ @H and K@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: and she has to be concerned with 4 -1 @S too|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict 2 off must try tio get something wrong|pg||
mb|4D|nt|idc: then East switched to @c and the setting trick there was gone|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: lost the play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: she will try to push EW|pg||
nt|capercliff: hard to see N/S getting into this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@D transfer to @d?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c transfer to @d?|pg||
nt|steshome: Looked like it|pg||
nt|idc: Good to see that my predictive skills have lost none of their usual effectiveness|pg||
nt|jallerton: a few pairs play 2@C = weak with either minor here|pg||
nt|viren169: ummmmmmm|pg||
nt|jcomyn: see what I mean|pg||
nt|pkl: What? 3NT is a bit timid |pg||
nt|jcomyn: A bit!!!!|pg||
nt|viren169: More imps to Wales!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just the hand to defend a partial!!!|pg||
nt|capercliff: but you never know|pg||
nt|mariner1: what is best from how S sees it is tough ........ and its tough and we see more of|pg||
nt|mariner1: it|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 6@S was a push off in Open Room also|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: the problem with the nebuloud @d is that N cannot be sure that S has @d|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N makes me wonder if north's sequence is stronger than it looks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aggressive 3NT|pg||
nt|capercliff: if 2@c was a transfer, did it have a lower limit?|pg||
nt|capercliff: must have|pg||
nt|jallerton: that could be the case here; passing an unlimited transfer on W ould be dangerous|pg||
nt|idc: I'm no expert on xfer rebids - is 2@c better than 2NT say with that East hand?|pg||
nt|idc: not that game is rigid, but a @d lead from North is a strong possibility|pg||
nt|capercliff: well if 2@c was forcing fine|pg||

nt|petepunt: prob 1 off maybe 2|pg||

nt|capercliff: it seems they made 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N did make on 10 so huge lead to Scotland|pg||

nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n should be too high|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is a bit frightening...imagine diamonds 6-3 rather than 7-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   can make    but what a lucky diamond position|pg||
nt|lestergold: very lucky layout doesnt look as if it would be defeated in practice|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@C denies a 4-card major then 3@S should be five|pg||
nt|ady: where as 4@S  looks very dicy    might make if east can be squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps south would rebid 3@C with (for example) 5@C and a 4-card major|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: 4s it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: now in 4@S     will have to play well|pg||

nt|athene: declarer is trying to cater for @HKJxx over him|pg||
nt|ady: can ruff club out   and should get heart position   |pg||
nt|athene: there are various possibilities|pg||
nt|athene: the key is - declarer doesn't know the diamond break|pg||
nt|ady: if he knew of X diamonds   can enter with trump  cash K@D  and play club discarding a heart|pg||
nt|athene: if east has a third diamond it's a lot more tricky|pg||

nt|athene: right|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|d8|pg||

nt|othered1: price for doubling 3N, losing 50 points if they manage to run to 4@D, seems fair to pick up large swing when they don't.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, if you make a habit of overcalling on Jxxxx and a king, partner is going to be reluctant to double 3NT with "only" two aces|pg||

nt|mariner1: CBAI bid 3N on 27 in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: wild breaks here|pg||
nt|rednaxela: CBAI in 3NT on 27 and favoured with a Club lead into the AQ.|pg||
nt|lestergold: an exciting looking hand a simple 5c conjtcat tho or e/w seems the only possible game|pg||
mb|1N!|an|12 15|nt|mdgraham: yes, general,principle, not pointing the finger at anyone|pg||
nt|idc: and I suspect she is right, since a @d can go on the @hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 5@C nice spot|pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: they did well to stay low at any rate|pg||
nt|viren169: 4N should be quantative (unless agreed otherwise off course)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: both could play in H again|pg||
mb|2N!|an|!d xfer|nt|idc: Scotland stopped in 3@h on Board 10 when 4 was makeable, but enough for 6 IMPs and a tied match|pg||
nt|thegarve:  depends which finesse you take|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi.  Not one to show to the children|pg||
nt|idc: true, but I suspect the likely leads are @hA or @d7, both of which might suggest the working line|pg||
nt|thegarve:  bids like this 2@D often push oppo into a thin 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but u do that and the d suit vanishes - I hate quantittive whatever it means|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2@S likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting - EW found 5@s on board 8 instead of a @h contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no she cant be thinking|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s is on|pg||
nt|rednaxela: interesting!|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs accurate bidding here|pg||

nt|mariner1: even 5 is on|pg||
mb|3N|nt|capercliff: I can understand not raising, maybe N should X first?|pg||

nt|lestergold: and why should west end up bidding it with 2 small ims|pg||

mb|p|pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: EW seem to have stolen this one|pg||

pc|dT|nt|santyclz: I very much dislike opening 1nt without a 3+card major.  This might be an exception.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: presumably all interference is 2-suited so N could not introduce his @c|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess you look at the 5-card suit and upgrade west hand to 11, ignoring that some of the 10 is junk.   But it worked just fine here|pg||

mb|d|nt|pkl: There are so many variations in system here, a bid is impossible to predict.|pg||

nt|jallerton: What's your idea of a bad game, Cliff?|pg||
nt|idc: agree Sarah - it might look daring but much less dangerous than some of the protective bids they *have* been making|pg||
nt|idc: and a much bigger potential upside|pg||
nt|steshome: I see that Fiona gained 4 for passing the transfer on the previous board|pg||
nt|capercliff: well we can see all hands, after 1@h the K@d has a good chance of being right|pg||
nt|capercliff: also 2-2 @s not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jallerton: but you need both and even then need to get a trick out of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: director called to table, dummy put hand down before n made bid|pg||

pc|hK|nt|othered1: I'm told 1N is a game force.  If it demands defined rebids, possible 31H would show that shape.  Then 3@S might be another relay.|pg||

nt|jallerton: interesting TD call.  Did the sight of @sQ10x in West stop North from saving in 4@S?|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@S might make on the Moysian here|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 2@h in open room so game swing for Scotland coming.|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  no 4@s from East  on board27 - must be punchdrunk|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and I keep going no matter what she answers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1S for me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 18 to 10 HP!!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2S end|pg||
nt|thegarve:  still it went off|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @c break forces the correct @S play though to bring it in|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they should be in 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: on trump leads its dire|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes that is the "might" part :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Also thanks to Henry Bethe and Ed Shapiro (USA), and Aivar Tihane (Estonia) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and perceptive ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: comments.  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: s determined to compete|pg||
nt|jcomyn: c contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or maybe 3NT- something or other|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 3nt is makeable, but no way to reach it|pg||
nt|toobad: NI made 2N up 1 on board 28 for a gain of 10 and 1N up one on 27 for a gain of 5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: N will bid D and then S has no option|pg||
nt|capercliff: weak nt N/S|pg||
mb|3D!|an|4lÃ¼!s davet|nt|steshome: I think they had a suit preference misunderstanding.  Costly.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing like good neighbours to help out|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not surprisingly the @c duck on bd 10 cost 12 imps.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  forget 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the 31c bid worked on brd 12, England were aloowed to play in 2@s|pg||
nt|idc: I agree with the denomination, perhpas not the level of North's bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: @c|pg||
nt|diumraid: ******  In Running Scores ******* -  LIVE from LIMERICK ********-   N-Ireland 20, CBAI 17, ENGLAND 16, SCOTLAND 14, IRELAND 13, WALES 10|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@s was makeable, even on the good defence we saw here|pg||
nt|idc: The @s2 discard - expect you have it right Sarah|pg||
nt|viren169: Good pass by Kelly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes - no option now but 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Still, I agreed with the 1@d and 1@s bids.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  you should open 1H anyway|pg||
mb|4S|nt|viren169: Some would inv with 8 and 5-card suit...|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: include me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where to now - rudderless at this stage|pg||
nt|mariner1: well come to think of it the 9@S in E becomes unassailable so 3N has issues|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is a long distance too far|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I am told that in the event of two or more teams scoring the same number of VPs they shall share the trophy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: yes 4@s looks clear after 2@s, but im not sure im a fan of the 2@s to start with|pg||
nt|pkl: ... and with a heart lead there's eight tricks. At least ;-)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H should be off here best defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has not the slightest vestige of aq 4h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: looks like 2NT=transfer to diamonds. |pg||
nt|idc: What do I know?   3@c seems to have worked out well|pg||
nt|jallerton: East was not anticipating that pass|pg||
nt|jallerton: West's pass is perhaps a little pessimistic - could still have game on with AAKK and 3-card support|pg||
nt|idc: I might bid 3@s - or do you prefer 1@s Cliff?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  that from a man who In the last set of the Camrose, Cliff had the pleasure of bidding on all 16 boards- frequently with zip|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@s|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe only 15 Martin|pg||
nt|capercliff: this contract looks safe, but we have seen 1@h go down earlier|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s opens on a 9-count, E passes with 10 hmm|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ouch stop please|pg||
nt|ralfwil: soon will the reds appear|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely |pg||
nt|toobad: on that last board 29 the CBAI are in 3c EW|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****   N-IRELAND 78, SCOTLAND 68, IRELAND 62, ENGLAND 59, CBAI 53, WALES 36  ****|pg||
nt|capercliff: only way to make 3N is to take all 5@c tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: however if NS can find @S they might score an imp or 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in Open Room I mean|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: you mean cashing their winners i assume by best defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petepunt: 4@H ood spot but 3n likely to bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And IÂ´m talking about flat biards.... bah..|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a tough spot with the assumed @D lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzme: this is the last board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C can be used to show bad diamond support, and 3@D shows ok diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can use the same over 2@S if this is a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|capercliff: would be quite a view to cash a top @c and then take a finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure that works :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h bid what do u guys think?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: No where near.|pg||
nt|lestergold: off scale id say|pg||
nt|mariner1: not my call either|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Scotland now 14 up.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and partner is very good for her raise assuming that she has another ay of showing a good raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it were|pg||
nt|rednaxela: NI one down to ROI.|pg||
