mb|p|nt|athene: E-W didn't bid much in the other room for people who can make as many spades as they can|pg||

nt|odysseus69: a club guess for 4S|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I guess Robson could have balanced with 3@S, but he did not like @DK I suppose|pg||

nt|athene: maybe it's a bit thin|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very expensive save|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also possible|pg||
nt|athene: when he passed, the semi-psychic 2nt kept Robson out|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|athene: no real reason to lead a club here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: 2NT    jacoby raise to game with heart fit|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: there may become a reason to lead one - East-West may cue bid everything else|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D already revealed it|pg||
nt|dburn: or, as seems to have happened here, West may show short diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: when Brunner signs off|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: double = "do not lead a diamond"|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though N-S play double of a splinter asking for the lower of the other two suits|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: so the number of reasons to lead a club is growing by the minute|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: double = "do not lead a spade"|pg||
nt|ady: I thin double of 4@D  asks not to lead diamonds    a modern convnetion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it asks for clubs specifically, the suit below the shortage|pg||
nt|athene: ah right|pg||
nt|dburn: so now, there seems no real reason not to lead a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: it does not|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|nt|dburn: Forrester and Bakhshi play all doubles of cue bids as "don't lead this suit"|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jbgood: and S doesnt have any trump to lead..|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: could forrester actually beat 4@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: so, as I say, Forrester has doubled spades and diamonds to say "don't lead these"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What was the greater risk? South having @CJx or North all 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: ruffing high looks against the odds|pg||
nt|athene: it's not just north having all the hearts|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: because you have to guess right anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: even if in theory you can pick them up|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you might not|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1 disaster too many now for the Hackett team|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: you can't claim you are going to survive @HJx with north AND @HJxx with south, can you?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they wind their way too high here? surely not|pg||

nt|ady: yes     too high|pg||
nt|athene: N-S have a big diamond fit and lots of controls, but no trick source and no shortage|pg||
nt|ady: too much duplication|pg||
nt|Walddk2: IMPs back to Hackett now I think, unless West leads a club honour|pg||
nt|ady: yes     could make it on K@C lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: 10 imps back |pg||
nt|odysseus69: after lots of good bridge this set has produced a series of horrors|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: a priori you play a club to the @C9, playing east for @CK10x / @CQ10x but there is lots of scope for deviousness with this suit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: Bakhshi hoping honor and ten of clubs on right|pg||
nt|athene: the first thing is, with @CH10x, east inserts the honour|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like someone splitting from @CKQx|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But they have all seen that before|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|ady: 10 there but not higher honor|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: so if you are playing against someone who habitually does this, you lead small from dummy, and when they play low, you play the @CJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even be 11..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: will find it tough to give that impression - |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: the idea is all opener's rebids are transfers which makes things much better when he doesn't have clubs|pg||

nt|ady: mossop  price- simpson team?|pg||

nt|vugraphzqb: Yep, with Mesbur-Carroll and Zivkovic|pg||
nt|ady: right|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Robson vs Mesbur  Yawwwwwwwn says a spectator if Mossop makes it to the final|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Spot on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My guess is a 4:30 restart (in 45 minutes)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Robson has occasional very long tanks, Grotheim has more of them of less duration|pg||

nt|ady: its like Nadal and Jokovitch serving at tennis    you know they are going to serve  its a question can you wait|pg||

nt|ady: maybe its close|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Tom asked me for the average expectaion of the Norwegians  finishing time after them - it was estimated as 22 mins every set|pg||
nt|jtr: Remember the hand where Brunner ruffed with the @hK?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzqb: Irens team pulled back 5 IMPs in a low-scoring set and that wasn't enough. Mossop go through.|pg||
nt|jtr: Struck me Bakhshi should play @c!0 second|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Forrester did false doubles of cue bids (not alerted but a habit)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 3NT good again|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: no game on for e/w  on a diamond lead     both 3NT and 5@C will fail|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 2@C with that west hand i think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a vey vey big 3NT bid now - but painted in a corner|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ady: in fact 5@C   worse  no entry to spade winners|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H was sort of forced and very scary - ok now|pg||
nt|athene: if you find yourself having to invent reverses on 2-card suits, that's a sign you should have opened 2@C :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe one should open the West hand 2@C since you have no ideal rebid available after 1@C  1M|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3NT coming or should have come|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: this is getting the fate it deserves - down 2?|pg||
nt|ady: if east had bid 3NT  Bakshi would have had to find a small diamond lead   not the king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: down 2?|pg||
nt|dburn: not totally clear that West would have passed it if it had come, but I guess he had nowhere to go|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: D Ace and trump promotion|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|athene: if west had just rebid 3nt over 1@S, Forrester *might* lay down the @DA i suppose|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Even you would be able to play it for down 1, Victor. What trump promotion?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s4|nt|athene: on opening lead against a gambling 3nt you are supposed to lead an ace and see how to cash out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you not allowed to ruff high?|pg||

pc|c4|pc|sT|nt|ady: I think east might have bid 3NT after 3@D  the defence has not always got 5 diamonds to cash and South will havce to lead low|pg||

nt|dburn: mind you, South had better get rid of one of those hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East SHOULD have bid 3NT over 3D- over 3H maybe 3S from West saying I am stuck? often a good use of 3S over 3H|pg||
nt|athene: both defenders may still fondly imagine declarer has some hearts for his 2@H bid|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it matters, really|pg||
nt|dburn: even if he pitches a diamond, declarer still can't make|pg||
