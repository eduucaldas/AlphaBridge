nt|athene: east had the chance for a very modest suit-preference signal on the second heart, as a spec suggests|pg||
nt|athene: @HAK and you play @H2 then @H9|pg||
nt|athene: showing three hearts and interest in a diamond switch rather than the "obvious" club switch|pg||
nt|mariner1: well being conservative has worked  for NS this session, yet they are way|pg||
nt|mariner1: behind|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S now........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room found it so NS have to bid it here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: and now the real penultimate board of this session|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Gee, how on earth do you get all the way to 4@S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i like to open 2@h rather than 1@h on these type of hands in 3rd chair|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Roland, you mouse over the Closed room contract ... that's how|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session in 34 minutes and 32 seconds|pg||
nt|irwinbo: fifty per cent slams vul have to be bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|benjent: Roland may have been asking more of a metaphysical question|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't even know that word, so no|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or just plain rhetorical ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: its all about the @c hook and no ruffs for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  in the closed room north gave south a lot of leeway as in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: not a good slam really|pg||
mb|5N|nt|benjent: like "if a tree falls in a forest and no-one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, the big question is, can she make this to get a flat board?|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Looks like Diana needs to drop the @hK to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has nice play here|pg||
nt|athene: 11 tricks does seem like a lot|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: should be able to put in the scores for the rest of the movie shortly after the next board hopefully|pg||
mb|6S|nt|bjacobs: It does rather, and on that club lead, she will be thinking hard about West's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-2-5-1 the more likely shape|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, so if that's the case, her only hope would seem to be that the two hearts are small|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So win @CJ and run @H9?  A losing outcome, but reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: The @sA onside is a given (as in can't make without it), and West doesn't seem to have @dAK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: down on a club ruff as well as @CK off|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: not sure how declarer can prevent the defence from taking two spades and the @CK at the very least|pg||
nt|athene: maybe a club lead in the other room|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: not at all trivial how to play this|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps @DK, @HA, @DA for @H pitch, @C to @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer might decide he needs the heart finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|athene: there are a couple of small clubs to deal with and he might decide he needs the @DA for one of those|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Great work |pg||
nt|benjent: Well done ... but I think she needed to play a spade up right then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She is smarter than us. No pun intended of course|pg||
nt|benjent: nope, she's ok|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  no one doubted that|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That she's smarter than us?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|athene: we'll never know if he was intending to run that @HJ :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I would bet he was....... not sure he would later play Q@H though|pg||
nt|athene: it's very hard for West when the @HJ is led - not covering might be disastrous if declarer does need 2 heart tricks - you just gave him three|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lost play sorry|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: np, play isn't too interesting on this one :)|pg||

nt|athene: we probably need a second pass in there?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: I was saying last set that the only problems it seems to have created are for Gold|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the ABF, Autumn National Open Teams 2009, Adelaide,|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  roland will be playing them tomorrow evening|pg||
nt|benjent: I think they are vaguely ok if you rate yourself the underdog - try to generate some volatility|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently|pg||
nt|mariner1: at it!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: I would not open E had 1 nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: shape wrong |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|benjent: In this match, I don't think they're a good method for either team|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You accusing me of being volatile?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "love my @D stop" |pg||

pc|d7|nt|athene: the reason you open 1nt is you are really stuck if you open 1@H and partner responds 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: south trying to get a signal from his partner|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/anot/  - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|athene: but even with a discard the defence still don't cash the clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards still to score|pg||
nt|athene: well - only dropping one trick in defence is better than average for 1nt passed out|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjent: Afternoon Henry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are playing in Heaven|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like 1@D here was a transfer to 4|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure about the N-S system - will try to hunt it out|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes since @D are 3 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: or commented together as they did in Perth in '89|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|benjent: vaguely possible to go down in 2@c here|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 1@C (semi-) natural, 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: Irwin Boris, Bill Frisby and I are your commentators|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Welcome back all|pg||
nt|mariner1: Cricket is our super operator, hi Cricket!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/anot/  - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Cheers for the lovely intro Rob :) hi all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb: I would not dream of rebidding 2@c, which shows how much I know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: They were forced to - with the Acol base (1NT rebid = 15-18)|pg||
nt|benjent: 1NT for you Henry?|pg||
nt|athene: only three trumps to lose off the top, but that's not the same as ten winners|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D not that easy here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S I mean|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: true Bill|pg||
nt|irwinbo: if the heart 8 were the nine, prospects would improve immeasurably|pg||
nt|athene: i think he should run out of steam here|pg||
nt|mariner1: he might try a cross ruff here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: 2nt natural, 3@D = "i wasn't lying, i really DO have hearts"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb: you bet|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I didn't think N would pass below game here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lost the play sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: np ty Cricket :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: let's say the defence begin by running four diamonds and then play a heart|pg||
nt|athene: the blockages in both black suits are actually a bit troublesome for declarer - he can't take his 9 top tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: In that case she should have opened 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: if he unblocks spades, he can't reach the @CKQ|pg||
nt|athene: and if he unblocks @CAJ first, he can't get back to the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: something has to be overtaken in a black suit and neither of them breaks kindlyt|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|benjent: Aren't Beale-Smart playing strong 1NT in 3rd?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah,|pg||
nt|henryb: but then I guess you can't when playing weak NT, which argues for opening 1NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yes they are |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|athene: if west had covered the @HQ there declarer could have won and endplayed him with a trump|pg||

mb|p|an| |mb|4H|nt|mariner1: yes looks like EW stealing this one|pg||

nt|mariner1: @SA and try to set up @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: or not :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hope i got these alerts right|pg||
nt|mariner1: or yes :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will just plod away at diamonds and make about eight tricks|pg||
nt|athene: south should surely hit 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: he has loads of defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes S should DBL to me|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mariner1: now he has a transportation issue here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: That's a Gallus favourite ... and Dilks played with Gallus fairly recently|pg||
nt|henryb: ROMEX or Little Roman?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember how 1NT was 17-20 in Roman Club|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@c looks likw asking and 3@h maximum with 4@h?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  like|pg||
nt|benjent: Another awkward lead problem for Diana|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Roland would lead J@h|pg||
nt|henryb: but in Little Roman (Pabis Ticci-D'Allellio) it was their strong opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No, low heart ducked and a diamond back|pg||
nt|benjent: The @c lead didn't work last time, and it doesn't look like it's going to work this time either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I always defend perfectly (unless I don't)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@H is quite a call|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: magy said 'not max' but in reference to what bid i dont know|pg||
nt|mariner1: it works here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: *nagy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: you tend to take the money here because even if you suspect 4@SX is 500 against 650, going down in 5@H is a huge disaster|pg||

nt|mariner1: hi Cricket!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Del'Monte having a think at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 nt?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c3|nt|mariner1: in USA this would be a drug company vs fruits and vegetables :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjent: Just-in-time pass from Dilks. I reckon anything higher was getting cracked|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to believe east would bid 5@C - presumably pass or correct for his partner's minor|pg||
nt|athene: but that's very, very high if partner has 5@H 4@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C as Bill said mystifies me|pg||
nt|mariner1: why not happily pass 3N|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can lead to the @SK and set up a pitch for the @H2, but it's a question of reaching it|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|benjent: So looks like Butler are finally going to get on the board in the last set|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c4|pc|h8|nt|patricck: I must admit I prefer Gold's 3@C opening in the other room. Sure I have two 3 card majors where we might belong as well, but they are 963 and J32 while my @C suit is magnificent|pg||

pc|d9|nt|mariner1: for that matter why not pass 2@S :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|irwinbo: after the session n-s will amend their understandings|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: there would be a very nice line in 3@D if the defence cashed three hearts then exited a trump - you run the trumps coming down to @SAxx / @CA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: south has to keep @SKQx otherwise you can set up a spade|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@D meant as transfer|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|athene: if only you could persuade west to duck one round of clubs you could run all the trumps and strip-squeeze him in @C+@H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: then you strip his club with the @CA and lead a spade to the @S9, endplaying him|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: 3 @H for n/s  stealing the pot?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C Bergen, showing 4 hearts and a pretty bad hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from west i can believe more than from south|pg||
pc|d4|nt|irwinbo: it may work but i sure don't like 1nt vul with 5 points|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: Mike Lawrence (the champion of 4-card overcalls) would nod wisely at this result|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder what they bid 3 @H on?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: (also usually shows a bad hand)|pg||
nt|athene: west could have taken the opportunity to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is an interesting spot for NS to steal the board|pg||
nt|athene: west had a variety of options|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H over 3@C (michaels ish) or X 3@C to show clubs then bid 3@S over 3@H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|patricck: that has avoided any possible misdefence, so 10 more imps to the lead, becoming significant now|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N plays well with the @D lead|pg||
nt|athene: neither did Klinger (he took it back)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: my bad ... missed a pass|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|benjent: Absolutely spiffing timing for the 1@s overcall, and it's paid off big time|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What do we think of North's 5@H bid?  (in theory)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like DBL takeout of the @H suit as N will bid that anyway|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|athene: of course they may play a X of 3@C as t/o of hearts - it's a delicate issue at which point your doubles of artificial raises should become t/o of opps' anchor suit|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: most experts play that if the raise can be weak (as here) then X is t/o|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: It's not as bad as it looks.  She KNEW South was void in spades, for example|pg||
nt|benjent: It's a curse I'm prepared to try one day :)|pg||
nt|athene: certainly west had to do SOMETHING|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
nt|athene: you can't just go around passing with that hand|pg||
nt|athene: good switch; just needed to be at trick 1 |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of matches,,,,,,,,,, and have flat hands|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps South's 4@H bid, which is something of a "left handed transfer" must be examined as well|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: people often say "well, i have a void in their suit, so partner probably has a stack, and it's all a misfit, and they go down instead of us going down"|pg||
nt|athene: but this is just madness|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s9|nt|benjent: Sorry all, private comment to a kib there - just saying that I'm prepared to be try being cursed with wealth :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner hasn't got a stack just because you have a void|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|benjent: Well, I think we'll need to barack for a game swing back to Butler to keep it interesting ... but it's not looking like it for the next few hands|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: we are just taking a drink break here |pg||
nt|benjent: And a "change the luck" break as well I would think. If I were Dilks-Blakeman, I'd be trying to glue everyone to their seats|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they were the ones who opted for the break |pg||
nt|benjent: Incroyable. You couldn't get me up with a crowbar with the set flowing my way.|pg||
