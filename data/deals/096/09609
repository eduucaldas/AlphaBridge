nt|Walddk8: It's a tournament for women only|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Does that explain it?|pg||
nt|jallerton: This one is, yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good morning|pg||
nt|col3435: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: NS play precision 12-15 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Our operator is Tobias Förster|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: EW play acol-based|pg||
nt|shevek: hello again|pg||
nt|shevek: here we go, close match, only 12 boards left|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcarroll: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the live score link is: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj|pg||
nt|col3435: 1@d slightly unusual even in Precision  - they must have some special meaning for 2@c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Martin, David and Nicoleta. Have fun!|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: West feels pleased to have a 20-count, followed by worry at being fourth in hand|pg||
nt|shevek: hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcarroll: And a Multi opening to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the NS convention card misses the 2@d opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@d=weak2 in a M|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk7: I can guess where your heart is, Josef :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Josef Harsanyi originally from Hungary|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Tobias, are they using screens?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: EW may easily get overboard here -- a trappy hand for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no|pg||
nt|finch: with the opponents NV, you never get first crack in fourth seat|pg||
nt|Walddk8: 2@H, and then 3@H by Cilleborg is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: W has a huge hand, and will probably support @Ss but the 5-1 split is merciless|pg||
nt|shevek: ok then we know where your @h is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H makes but will it be bid?|pg||
nt|shevek: but what was 1 @d  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W asking 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk7: True Nico|pg||

pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W asking what N showed|pg||
nt|shevek: martin :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Obviously no problem for this NS|pg||
nt|projekt1: after a strong 1Nt and 2@d transfers superacccept  and south decides|pg||
nt|shevek: strong 1@d opening maybe|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: NS are likely to end up in 3N here -- probably going down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@d probable the "convenience diamond opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: 1@d doesn't say anything about @d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: with clubs 4-4 there are eight tricks - and where's there's eight...|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead, but anything would work here it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk8: I don't think the hand is good enough for 4|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jallerton: well the auction is a bit cramped, I can understand 4@h|pg||
nt|jallerton: some case for 2NT to show the values|pg||
nt|finch: if the @SQ were in diamonds I like 4@H more|pg||
nt|Walddk8: It's a 6-loser hand opposite a partner who was asked to bid on a zero count. Surely 4@H is too much|pg||
nt|jallerton: opposite @sJxx 3NT could be the only making game|pg||
nt|jallerton: should duck the lead|pg||
nt|finch: ..smoothly|pg||
nt|finch: see if you can tempt South to continue them|pg||
nt|Walddk8: If partner can't raise 3@H to game, you won't have missed anything|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I wondered why N did not open 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they play variabel NT i think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcarroll: Looks like a standard game making either 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|projekt1: they open 11-14 hcp 1Nt|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|jallerton: apart from maybe 3NT|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|xenya: so they did get too high, but not by much, somewhat surprisingly|pg||
nt|xenya: except an unrealistic @D lead of course|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|olson: he can now make this |pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: Oddly 4NT is the worst action because it gives up on the possibility that 4@S was going off--that is double might work better--but of course pass is best|pg||

nt|fifee: if 4@S were making that is|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Either 10 or 12 sorry - depending on @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|col3435: would have been in danger if the @d finesse was wrong - could take @d, @h, @c and a @h ruff|pg||

nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: That was a good hand for opening as South, otherwise she would have defended an opening 2NT making|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this looks like a fairly straightforward 4@H for NS |pg||
nt|xenya: or 3N|pg||
nt|jallerton: still might have done had W chosen 2nT over 2@h|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: leads? attitude|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N asked|pg||
nt|finch: lead will give the heart suit for four tricks|pg||
nt|finch: unfortunately that's only 8.  I wonder if there's a ninth somewhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: E has time to switch to @c|pg||
nt|jallerton: but then W might be endplayed|pg||
nt|finch: I think declarer can make it double dummy by playing on spades, but it's natural to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: as W's red cards will be stripped|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzpb: W asked|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or 5@h 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: -500 not terrible|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3 down not bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: The 'obvious' line is to win the heart in hand and start on diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: probably @SK then @DQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: no can start with @d and switch to endplay line when @d turn out to be 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Seems so|pg||
nt|finch: that 9 of clubs is also a good card|pg||
nt|shevek: NS need to take a @c ruff...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|projekt1: Kriftner - Reim play Blue Club - 1 @C 17+, canape openers else, 1 NT 15-17|pg||
nt|projekt1: Jörg Fritsche, NPC of Germany sitting here too|pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H was relay, 2@S showed 15-16 with 5+@S, 4+@D|pg||
nt|projekt1: club lead kills,  every other allows to make it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: E has a choice betwwen @Cs and @Hs here -- seems N's 1@H was not natural |pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H could be 11-12 balanced without @H, so the choice was between @C and @H|pg||
nt|xenya: and she has found it|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: @c now|pg||
nt|shevek: misguess in @d though... can go for -800|pg||
nt|projekt1: would you bid instead of 4@h double 4Nt for the minors?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E wanted to pass but took the wrong card|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|finch: East has to duck the first diamond.  Looks very very silly if West has singleton @DK|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|shevek: too late now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|finch: On the second diamond it is tempting to duck to make communications more awkward|pg||
nt|finch: but against that East might be worried she'll never make it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|finch: with the clubs doubly stopped declarer can also make just by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: @c are not necessarily double stopped.  E could switch to @cJ from AJxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: and restricted choice and lack of @cJ lead might persuade declarer to play for that|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: now the defence should be easy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|finch: declarer now will now worry about losing 2 spades 2 diamonds and a club if she sets up diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch: so may now start on the spade suit, knocking out the K, 10|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|finch: ... although possibly not having ducked the first spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: True but it seems counter intuitive that the hand with a singleton trump is the threat of the vital ruff|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: cashes @HAK just to avoid any nonsense|pg||
nt|shevek: north knew south didn't have @dsg or !K |pg||
pc|dK|nt|finch: Jeffrey is confident declarer is going to make via an endplay.  I am worried she's going to try and endplay the wrong hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: East passed originally|pg||
nt|finch: Anyway, she can now go back to setting up diamonds... cash the heart discarding a spade and concede a diamond trick|pg||
nt|finch: the actual spade position looks quite plausible|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still needs careful play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|shevek: anyway, easy when we see all hands|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|jallerton: Did she need to play for @hJ to drop?|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  But the attitude lead should have given the heart position away.  |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|finch: Unless the lead was from 832, but that looks an odd lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|shevek: lucky the short @c hand doesn't have trump left|pg||

nt|panja: South must avoid a Club lead..|pg||

nt|mcarroll: probably 2 down|pg||
nt|projekt1: @c opening lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 4-0 spade split renders this unmanageable, I think. Just a question of how many off |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W: asking 1@d opening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be happy to see @CA in dummy - if 6@H is reached at the other table, it may very well go off |pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 1 off at worst|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: Yes trump best lead|pg||

pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: @C 10 lead, ducked, 3@H tricks and then no more?|pg||
nt|jallerton: needs to pick up @s for no loser and avoid a @d ruff to make 4@s.|pg||
nt|jallerton: with the @s layout a @d ruff won't be an issue|pg||
nt|finch: the percentage line in trumps is to play for the 10 onside|pg||
nt|jallerton: indeed, small to J on 1st round picks up @sAK10 with N as well|pg||

nt|xenya: on the other hand, W might decide to lead a @S against 6@H...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of permutations.If South is declarer, East may double for a diamond lead |pg||
nt|shevek: north doesn't want a conversation|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: on a trump lead, declarer can get 1@C, 3@Hs and 1@S, but that's all -- 3 down|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: Not sure why South played C!K there |pg||

nt|mdgraham: it will certainly be interesting to see what happens in the other room|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|finch: North would have thought hard about rising on the spade, because South's switch looks like a singleton|pg||
nt|shevek: Ctr C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|finch: However, declarer would be unlikely to start with a low spade away from AQxxx knowing there is a risk of a diamond ruff|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: Nice defence|pg||

nt|xenya: i don't see why she didn't ruff that @D|pg||

mb|p|nt|danilo1: eventual overbid by West or East may be dangerous ... slam may be tried by partner than|pg||

nt|lestergold: true!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tweety1: 16 seems ok for a srtong 1 @c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the spade fit land dim singleton with east makes this and an unlikely candidate for 3n|pg||
nt|danilo1: as it is happening ... East will probably try slam now|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the drawback of the multi--North should double now I think--partner is marked with spade length|pg||
nt|garnetts: IF west started with 2@S I doubt North would bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: South must deceide between pass and 4@H|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|finch: really???|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S asking discards|pg||
nt|jallerton: I would have passed out 2@d as N.  S has an interesting 3-way choice|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: why not @HQ, I wonder - that only loses to the king - oh, South has ducked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may regret that in a minute or so|pg||

pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: this is all rather baffling - West had nine tricks there |pg||
nt|xenya: S can see what's going on here?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|finch: I assume North could be 4=3=2=4 which makes 2@H more attractive than 2@S|pg||
nt|finch: Possibly it makes passing out 2@Dx even more attractive|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4h makes 5d safe even 6d may make|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@C for NS ... may be foud since West will probably produce some oppening including @H (weak or two-suiter)|pg||
nt|kippari: kuka voittaa tarjoussarjan tässä|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: W might enter the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might open that N hand with 1 @H |pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 makable|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that 6d is a good contract!|pg||
mb|6H|nt|danilo1: opps ...srry, @S ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: this time 3 nt may make if they get there on the scattered values|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S will be a good spot here....|pg||
nt|panja: depends on @C guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Goddess beware; definitely not a good idea to go for 6@d.|pg||
nt|lestergold: probbaly well settle in 4h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or he may try 3nt.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d we can see veryhazardous even ith favourable lie of red suit honours|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3 @s seems ok|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@D alerted is?|pg||
nt|danilo1: tr. @H, thanks|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Boian Halachev from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ppilot: hi all|pg||
nt|wwalter: hi Boian|pg||
nt|danilo1: I thk South should produce one more bid - probably 3@H, partner's 3@C was free bid|pg||
nt|ppilot: if peichev bids will drive them to vulnerable game:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: Good morning Boian|pg||
nt|kaapo: Avaus 2@C olisi molemmat ylävärit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: good desision|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is better than 6@c , down :)|pg||
nt|panja: they need to find out @D weakness though, and typically, methods tell you only about Major controls|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normally that would show Dummy's first bid suit--and a decent hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: so that N can describe his hand better|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder if 2 NT would be forcing?|pg||
nt|olson: will depend on lead|pg||
nt|panja: not enough HCP for Nt, and @D suit open...still bidding does not seem out of the world...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: hm is this a serious stop?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess there is only 9 tricks in spades as well|pg||
nt|olson: chance for a pickup  now|pg||
nt|panja: and now...where should @CQ be placed..|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten Mirme joutuu avaamaan 1@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: communications dire apart from the pade weakness|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade weakness|pg||
nt|tweety1: with AJ in @s, S chose to bid 3nt which is not a bad option.|pg||
nt|ppilot: anyway at the other table they might bid 5 he sacriface so win 2 imps:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: nothing wrong with souths bid- everything wrong with north's accdeptance|pg||
nt|danilo1: Guess they would not try 6@C ... West's bid over Dble is probably @S shorth|pg||
nt|panja: % is for E to have it..|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|olson: declarer should play club K  since  the 4/1 split onside can be picked  up  |pg||
nt|panja: you assume he has 4 @D at most..|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: or then 1 nt?|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mutta voimaa on vähän liikaa|pg||
pc|sA|nt|baldfriede: The @d allow somed communication, but not after playing 10.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|nt|tweety1: may raise to 4h maybe  but he might have tht that his @hs are too weak.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Veysel|pg||

nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Rob :)|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|tweety1: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a very lame and wounded chicken|pg||

nt|kippari: nyt taitaa tulla 9 tikkiä|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|h6|pc|d2|pg||

nt|mcarroll: I agree David, I play strong NT and open with what we define as a non rediddable 5 card Major, i.e. at worst KQT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: best to draw a veil over that one.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|maribelxx: claiming is a good thing and helps to save your energy for more difficult decisions later|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Overtrick imps to Denmark on 1 and 2|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|finch: Redouble is often used here to show Ax or Kx on spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzpb: W asking XX|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: S: points|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: strong @c opening, 1@d=negative I assume|pg||
mb|2H|nt|finch: EW may end in either 4@H or 5@D, both of which make|pg||

mb|2N|nt|vugraphzpb: S asking 3@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: I think 3@s max or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N asked about 3@d|pg||

pc|d2|nt|shevek: does it say "good lead" ?  :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|jallerton: but the opening lead tells a story about the @s honours|pg||
nt|jallerton: the overcaller is likely to have @cQ now|pg||

mb|1N|nt|tweety1: 7 @d <NS|pg||
nt|rhelle: nobody can make much|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might prove hard for NS--pass  2@H or 2@S--not an easy choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6d on the NS cards looks like a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|tweety1: which cannot be bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: being endplayed for a vulnerable game hurts - especially when you could have avoided the endplay|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H a likely spot|pg||
nt|fifee: affter the 2@H overcall, seems easy from there|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|tweety1: EW!'s @h intervention will encourage N  for slam I believe.|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 5 or 7 hand, can they diagnose it?|pg||

nt|danilo1: what should be 3@C by South? |pg||
nt|ppilot: now popov as i know him will try 3 nt:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 diamond means pass or corect|pg||
nt|danilo1: if so agressive both, Dble is even more dangerous|pg||
nt|ppilot: limit 3 diamonds and ready for more at clubs|pg||
nt|panja: South should simply bid 4@S....and he did..good|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes--I think I prefer 2@S to 2@H  if were going to bid--in practice I would pass i think|pg||
nt|kaapo: Magicin 1@C|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|garnetts: Yes--not the worse slam I have ever seen but the trump break makes things awkward--needs care in game |pg||
nt|fifee: the pre empt makes it hard to find though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has heard the slam try and has 3 bullets!|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @d or 4@h ?|pg||
nt|ppilot: hard for popov now:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess so, 3@C would be also pass/corr ... thk enough to bid 3@C, after all, it is free bid|pg||
nt|wwalter: in the first 2 rounds they made 49 VP from a posible 50 :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wwalter: this is also strange|pg||
nt|olson: ew are playing  negative free bids   2h  was not forcing  |pg||
nt|kaapo: 12-16 epätasainen käsi tai 15-17 tasainen|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D joko 0-7 tai 12+|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Oops.|pg||
nt|lestergold: er em|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps 4d wasnt forcing in south's opinionm maybe just competitive|pg||
nt|lestergold: onviouslhy north must have inbtended it as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: It looks as if N did not communicate his hand correctly.|pg||
nt|tweety1: I didnt like 4 @d either.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT = end of discussion|pg||
nt|rhelle: it shouyldn't make, I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|danilo1: well, much better fit (3-2) than in first board (2-1) :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkv: a little break after the board|pg||
nt|rhelle: but on this lead it will|pg||
nt|jbgood: absolutely|pg||
nt|rhelle: I guess it needed a @h lead to defeat it - impossible to find|pg||
nt|olson: W would need to double  1s  to set up a forcing sequence|pg||
nt|olson: or cue bid  |pg||
nt|panja: there is a very small window for that negative free bid to work....more useful in Prec..narrow range opening systems..|pg||

nt|tweety1: @ds like North:)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Another slam on a finesse.|pg||

nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all!|pg||
nt|daman: they started early on us     |pg||
nt|kippari: jaossa 1 Kalma Maastik tarjosivat 6D=9 imppiä|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten ehkä Kauko tosiaan ei voinut kysyä ässiä|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: rare as nowadays|pg||
nt|santyclz: We might do some editting first.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: appears so|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|fifee: 4@H makes |pg||
nt|garnetts: They will probably bid it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: @d 2-2, @c finesse right ... no such a great slam :)|pg||
nt|daman: most of the Bulgarians play precision|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: heading to 3 nt|pg||
nt|tweety1: strong club system is very common in Bulgaria I suppose.|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be a club system with that 1 @D opening |pg||
nt|mmmakela: my estimate is that 4xp with today's aggressive bidding happens maybe 1/200 deals about|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no slam played by south due to the heart ruff|pg||
nt|ppilot: 5 clubs 4 SPADE|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess 4@S Dbled ... not probable West will get chance to mention @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even only be 11 tricks..|pg||
nt|daman: so they open any 11 point hand 1@D|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might have been a reasonable spot for EW here..but the 51 break will kill it|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|tweety1: 2 KC out anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, you need to ruff 2@s and 2@c ... and after 2 rounds of trumps you have only 3 trumps left|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h is an interesting bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: so only 1 loser - but also only 11 winners:)|pg||
nt|olson: not ewnough  points  |pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|baldfriede: Yes, @h ruff will set it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sensible spot|pg||
nt|tweety1: good judge by N this time:)|pg||
nt|kippari: ja ylitikistä 1 lisää jaossa 2|pg||
mb|5H|nt|lestergold: 3n was fine too but dont blame north wanting top lay in dims|pg||
nt|daman: forced to rebid his 4 bagger :)|pg||
nt|panja: y..but xxxx @H opposite @HA...and @C body working|pg||
nt|olson: declarer would also need to pick up clubs  for  4 winners  and this is  anti %  |pg||
nt|olson: since the  diamonds  are  2  losers|pg||
nt|kaapo: @C tasan joten tässä ei liene suurta jännitystä|pg||
nt|kippari: väh. 9 tikkiä näkyisi löytyvän tästäkin jaosta|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: just in case there is a hole in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|jbgood: should really be a big takeout 3 @h|pg||
nt|daman: this contract will be tough to make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 min won't fair but 3 nt has chance|pg||
nt|panja: y, not enough strength to bid any game..|pg||
nt|panja: @DT from JT9..I guess it promises Jack..|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: needs to duck the 1st @s to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: as it can be seen luck is with the brave|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C by South is much better bid than 3@S ... he is limited in precision, and hand is very good, esp. since 1S should be 5+|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances....slim and none|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ppilot: wonder how much time this will last ? no duplication at all and still many stones to be made|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: good lead director bid, needs to duck 1st|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: and guess hearts|pg||
nt|tweety1: and also 2-4 leads are common too.|pg||
nt|rhelle: ouch ... why didn't south introduce his @d?|pg||
nt|rhelle: clearly didn't get the meaning of 3@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange he didnt want to play the 9 card trump fit..|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with 3-lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll declarer will have a high blood pressure momwent shortly when he leads a dim from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think e will have at least a mini tank and then run the dim in any case|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kippari: ruutulähdöllä ne on syytä nopeasti ottaakin|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: next time someone will lead their singleton holding Kx dims!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: but if North ducks 1 round of @h, he should get a fair way here|pg||
nt|daman: now return a @H and duck|pg||
nt|daman: then it is 2 down|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: Chance of a reverse Grovesnor Coup  here--drop the Q@H under the A@H --the grovesnor coup involves playing the Q from qJx to annoy declarer|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|tweety1: @h ace must be in S to make.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|olson: S should  switch  to the  Jack of H   |pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbgood: if N has a 2 suiter - she would have bid the second duit directly - I think - so she must have @d also. Perhaps a redouble of 3 NT would have made it crearer to S|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I think you're right, Jon|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe South thought that 3@h just showed a very strong hand, and after 3@c a monster 2-suiter|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c, sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a XX over 3NT would clear it up|pg||
nt|rhelle: now North has blocked the @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this really how the @d suit has been played? The 6?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to go well|pg||
nt|jbgood: depends on what team you are rooting for..|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... I am impartial, so I'm just looking from declarer's perspective|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I unserstand why. Is he going to try and cut down on @c ruffs by returning a trump, or trying to get declarer trump short?|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps he thinks that N is 6-4 in the blacks (as S may think too)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  afternoon|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|tweety1: blocked|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Congrats on the Camrose win. Great stuff!|pg||
nt|daman: Popov has decided to let them make this one|pg||
nt|panja: note that because Declarer will get forced, he will make only 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|olson: called a  surround  play  incase  declarer has  q  or  AQ|pg||

nt|ppilot: with everything ok easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|danilo1: probable will make 9|pg||

nt|garnetts: You are kidding me :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure how South managed the double though|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: we say 'playing under the table' :)|pg||

nt|thegarve:  many would not play 2@d as natural - worked well here|pg||

nt|daman: so 2@D might always be natural|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tweety1: N wld bid 4 @d  if S bid 4 'c.|pg||

nt|ppilot: if they bid with like that playing later agg me will tear us into pieses:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: but guess, since 1NT ... will play safety ... @S10 from the table|pg||

pc|h4|nt|lestergold: asm soon as north shows sign of life south will drive there- i think this was lazy bidding bu south|pg||

nt|kippari: jos tää lupas ruutuja ja kortteja niin ...|pg||

nt|shevek: we have a new leader|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: well perhaps if she plays a small now...|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think that Stense Farholt's line (@c finesse) was correct|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch: back on this hand, looks like a spade switch is right here|pg||
nt|jallerton: so a deserved gain on that board|pg||
nt|finch: a spade lead would have worked very well indeed... but tough to lead the only suit the opponents have bid|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|shevek: NS are mother (S) and daughter(N) and their father/husband is watching  :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jallerton: but what about E's switch?  Might a heart have been better?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzpb: E asking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes W has no entry for the @Ds|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer needs to play it very carefully|pg||

mb|p|nt|tweety1: wow|pg||

mb|4D|nt|mmmakela: 6@C=3 places|pg||

mb|p|nt|tweety1: bye|pg||
nt|fifee: @S lead the only killing lead here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: wow dont believe my eyes:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to be a happy contract with the @h not breaking|pg||
nt|lestergold: main thing about a spade lead is it gives east the entries needed to pick up the clubs and enjoy them too|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Rugby about to start Scotland v Ireland|pg||
mb|d|nt|tweety1: hmm|pg||
nt|ppilot: now if double ilko will show graet feel about cards:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: Thanks East. I bid 3@S now as South ... maximum|pg||

nt|vugraphzkv: sure :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i cant see alegitimate line here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: must not cover to make|pg||
nt|garnetts: a @D and spade switch might do it|pg||
nt|garnetts: this same scenario|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kippari: 9 tikkiä|pg||
pc|cA|nt|danilo1: is it forbidden in Bulgaria for North to have @S after 2@D Dble, Bojan?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|tweety1: Ivanove did great 5 C bid by the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: a heart lead and this would be a diffeent story to tell|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fifee: no entry for east now. wd Andonov|pg||

pc|cK|nt|sybarra: I know W has a great hand,  but.....|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's what I meant with harder although the raise was BAD imo|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: if pd's @C A had been @S K but...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-way traffic so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes tough set for Shato R |pg||
nt|mmmakela: and previous yet to be scored|pg||
nt|sybarra: next hand will be half way thru this set, so maybe worm will turn|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS even got away with that 5 @D -3 -300 as push|pg||
nt|tweety1: EW arguing? :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Israel going to final in White House junior tourney beating Italy in semis|pg||
nt|mmmakela: cigarette break Silvia?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: yes :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: revoke in OR last hand I guess|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: a nice contract if hearts had behaved..|pg||
nt|kippari: Artun kyllä pitää heittä risteille kaikki hertat|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rhelle: absolutely! I like North's 3NT bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h doomed too this could well be fairly flat|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is amazing how demoralising bridge can be--after the self inflicted wound of the last hand the bridge Gods hit you hard|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|tweety1: seems he will make it|pg||
nt|fifee: one of the hardest things to do is to put the last hand out of your mind and think only of this one|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ppilot: andonov tryed them after the kik to finish them and sucsess is with the brave|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: break now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree--but this time EW were hardly to blame--lousy contract which was always likely to make |pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
nt|fifee: when in doubt, always lead a @S?|pg||
nt|ppilot: J@S was best return to make declace cover|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes it was |pg||
nt|fifee: true but perhaps hard for west to read as well|pg||
nt|garnetts: Then duck the spade back|pg||
nt|ppilot: not so hard but who knows for us is easy seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to admit that it is hard to think of a good lead by west--I might have led a @D |pg||
nt|ppilot: i should lead one of major aces to have a chance to recover but cant say which one:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: but with any of them this time will do|pg||
nt|fifee: brb|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: but west didn't complain|pg||
nt|finch: West is too polite to do so|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|maribelxx: good suggestion from a kib: cash J@c before @s -1?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Again 5 @H and a 5 card minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@h = 5@h 4other widde range|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: maybe West should have gone up with @SQ, as she doesn't really want a @D through - but after North's sporting 2@D opner, maybe she didn't think that South would have one |pg||
nt|finch: 2@D multi (weak two in a major or possibly some strong options)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: here we see the problem of using it with a side 4-card major|pg||
nt|finch: well, the EW save is 500 in 5@S against NS's 5m contract|pg||
nt|jallerton: if NS find it after you have bid up to 4@s, yes|pg||
nt|finch: after P 1@D hard to see North stopping out of game|pg||
nt|finch: South's 2NT the minors; an immediate 2NT would have been natural|pg||
nt|jallerton: Is it obvious to bid 5@d rather than defend 4@sx?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1D-(1S)-2D-(4S)|pg||
nt|projekt1: very variable and unpredictable weak 2-s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that N did not opt for the minor suit fit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcarroll: EW made 4@H in Open|pg||
nt|projekt1: as  I know it was a one-suiter 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@h=0-20|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: when east asked about points|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Not exactly a classic wek 2 then|pg||
nt|projekt1: trump promotion on the 4th @d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it has cost Italy 12 imps - and these days, that is not something you can say very often  |pg||
nt|shevek: NS lucky they didn't find their fit?   :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzpb: E ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: asking|pg||
nt|xenya: another 3N for NS, and declarer will feel more confident this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @s length|pg||
nt|projekt1: lucky 12 tricks in 6@c if no @s lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d-(1@s)-2@s-(4@s) start|pg||
nt|finch: I wonder what an initial double of 2@D would have meant?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: north should duck this|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: probably. Now if West had raised immediately to 2@h (as many would do playing 5-card majors) then North would surely be bidding spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|shevek: doesn't actually matter here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Lead changes hands again|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: I'm told it would have shown four hearts.  So not appropriate here.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: 35-31 to croatia after 10 scored bds|pg||
nt|shevek: north content she didn't overcall 1@s  :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: will this end in 3nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: not everyone will agree with S's choice to open 1@D...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South taking the view that eight-card suits are not meant to be put down in dummy unless they are trumps  |pg||
nt|finch: as NS play canape, 2@D could be longer than hearts|pg||
nt|finch: so North has no reason to give false preference|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: passive lead -- holding declarer to her contract|pg||
nt|xenya: still fewer people will agree with the 5@D bid -- i think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: It did in the Open|pg||
nt|maribelxx: north's hand wasn't enough for a strong club opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@h=6+@h 15-16 bad @h suit|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And they made it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S asking distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: West is prob. 6-4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: dont understand but north no doubt had her reasons|pg||
nt|projekt1: it looks better for declarer after trump lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The lead solves the trump position|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|finch: The Danish team are about to make 6@D on board 26 which will be another big swing for them|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2n response by east in the other room was the bonkers bid of the day sorry week maybe year|pg||
nt|garnetts: This should make next door too surely?|pg||

nt|kaapo: Vai tiputtiko Pauli yhden pois kun alussa meni hieman aikaa hukkaan|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: wonder what 2 S promised|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This was one of those hands where I think everybody would prefer 1nt opening to 1@s opening, even those who usually open the major if they have a 5 card one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: nice bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ppilot: break nothing interesting here|pg||

nt|tweety1: promissed a misclick|pg||
nt|olson: 6c  will  make here  but  4s  is likely  to be the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: hmm|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok 13-16|pg||
nt|tweety1: do EW play multi then?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1 @S must be 9-14 or alike|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 9-12|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: not multi|pg||
nt|tweety1: so how do they bid their weak 2s then pls?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes, it is getting more and more fashinable.|pg||
nt|tweety1: even the 5 card Maj  doesnt need to be that weah:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: East should maybe try Dble ... if not penalty ... 4!NT (if 4@DS Dble pen) I would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: now a more viable 4h available for e/w|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: hm i predict 3n by west down 1|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might panic perhaps and allow the 10@S to make |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure we know |pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: and poor West ... countein his @SK ... still, I agree with east's (unlucky) Dble|pg||
nt|ppilot: the other pair of ilko gains imp after imp on overtricks but need a lot of such hands to recover:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but probably a push|pg||
nt|jbgood: a question of cashing the spades|pg||
nt|daman: on a @C lead you need to find the @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: same in either contract|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must have been confident of 4-card @S not to investigate|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess play 4c majs|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed u have more time to explore in a heart contract not that declarer is likely t pick up enuf info to make the right guess|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@h is bettear as you can make a few discovery plays if @H are 3-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well must have had a friendly defence in open room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  make the @S guess straight way in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4h you will discover that south has the doubleton heart and u may therefore play south for three spades|pg||
nt|thegarve:  you can discover that south has KQ@C and did not open the bidding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a@d|pg||
nt|daman: a @C lead is the best|pg||
nt|lestergold: well jack of spades most likely to be placed on distributional considerations rather than as a high card placement|pg||
nt|lestergold: still all academical|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 4@H löytynee|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: 3-level I guess|pg||
nt|tweety1: dont think so:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so they pass them because 1 @S could be even (7)8-12 maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: they don't have weak 2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|ppilot: that is why i like andonov bid it drove to gain|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|tweety1: too mant rubish HPs in NS hand.|pg||
nt|tweety1: many|pg||
pc|c5|nt|baldfriede: Yes, would have been better to let E/W play in 3@h.|pg||
nt|lestergold: pure guess |pg||
nt|kaapo: NS:lla ei taida olla halpaa uhrausta|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: with the dim suit in dummy, there are limited defensive options|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defence have given themselves an outside chnace|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: wouldnt the 2 be better then?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: they are obviously not playing udca|pg||

pc|d8|nt|lestergold: he has comitted himself to the right guess|pg||
nt|fifee: Andonov has great instincts|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 9@S is right form us seeing and in with the odds too|pg||
nt|kippari: siis jako 4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ppilot: shall he make safety play of clubs or play for overtrick?|pg||
nt|daman: one-way finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: also it wouldn't have been right to bid 4@S without the 9@S would it?  :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|danilo1: safety is safety ... he does it |pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: probably because he was in dummy and that was the most convenient play|pg||

nt|mcarroll: seems like it|pg||

nt|projekt1: E-W plays also 11-14 1Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 4@H seems a bit keen looking at a down the middle limit raise in hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: E consulting CC for the leads|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|xenya: it was a tough hand to bid for sure|pg||
nt|finch: this may get a diamond lead, which helps EW by a trick, but that's not enough|pg||
nt|jallerton: but pass is an option once S doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: East had a @d with her @h|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: EW are kind of paralyzed from the awful start|pg||

nt|tweety1: i m afraid i dont agree|pg||
nt|tweety1: a good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, exacrtly, that's why it is not a 1nt. :)|pg||
nt|tweety1: its hard to rebid 15.|pg||

nt|garnetts: hard to make surely?  |pg||
mb|3C|nt|tweety1: yes specially W seems abondoned|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W should avoid getting too high here now that West has limited his hand|pg||

nt|lestergold: now will bid it i think|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: well 29 left so only 2,1 imps per board|pg||
nt|ppilot: sure you are right|pg||
nt|ppilot: didnt see vulnerability|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: do we show our NT before we show our potential @S fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Declarer would have to establish a trick in @s to make 1nt here.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  .......proof [fill in the name of your favourite poor declarer]|pg||
mb|4D|nt|viren169: Maybe not!|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has promised/impled spades wht isnt north showing them|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is also infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: even 6 @d would make |pg||

nt|kippari: voi vähän tinkiä kun on pelinviejänä|pg||
nt|kaapo: Kyllä määki avaisin 1NT :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ppilot: now this 2 he bid may get them too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d as cards lie easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: it seems EW play Puppat stayman over 1nt here|pg||
nt|viren169: pushy 4@H|pg||
nt|ppilot: wiht king @S wrong down 1|pg||
nt|viren169: some sort of try would have been rejected and kept them out of the 4-level|pg||
nt|ppilot: sry this makes it easy|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: but not the world's greatest contract in theory|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: i prefer 3 di bid intead of 4 @H if partner might be 4 cards|pg||
mb|6D|nt|thegarve:  double of 4@H = don't lead @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: nice convention to show heart support|pg||

mb|3H|nt|maribelxx: they surely know that something good has to come...|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: east looking at NS conv. card|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Probably making as E unlikely to find the killing @D lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|xenya: W should duck this|pg||
nt|xenya: and she probably can work out what is happening in @Ss|pg||

nt|finch: sorry Denmark|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|baldfriede: I doubt E/W will land in game here.|pg||

nt|thegarve:  hmm nice lead|pg||
nt|thegarve:  but West shoud get it right|pg||
nt|lestergold: will west get this right about 200 tricks difference|pg||
nt|olson: this should slow N down and play 4s  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 8 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not my idea of a 3@D bid--too much defence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ppilot: i like this opening|pg||

nt|ppilot: wonder since both teams dont need victory to continue next why they play with so many tactical bids and risky desisions?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: E: 3@h=4+@h|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|projekt1: friendly @d distribution|pg||
nt|finch: I suggest diamond ruff, heart ruff, diamond ruff, ace of spades|pg||
nt|finch: this is going to go badly if West has KJx of trumps, but otherwise seems fairly safe|pg||
nt|finch: if East has KJx of trumps you may be in trouble anyway|pg||
nt|jallerton: E is the one who will have @sKJx if anybody|pg||
nt|finch: or maybe queen of spades from hand now, followed by startig the cross-ruff|pg||
nt|jallerton: well could pitch a @d on @hA and play the @c for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|finch: indeed, although after the @C9 switch I'd be pessimistic about my chances of playing the clubs for three tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3-3 break?|pg||
nt|finch: it's not easy on the hand, as you need a late entry to dummy to lead towards the 10|pg||
nt|finch: at this point declarer can decide whether to ruff another diamond in dummy, or as Jeffrey suggests discard a diamond on the heart and lead the @SQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: W obviously did not like the @D void, and it is unlikely that Pd is 2-2 in the majors so there will be either a 4-3 or 5-2 fit but still I wonder |pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|finch: once West has turned up with the @DA, the @SK is very likely to be East|pg||

mb|3S|nt|sybarra: 2 @C, pick another suit pard?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's hand is not everyone's idea of an overcall with  two qxx holdings|pg||

nt|sybarra: sorry I do not know the system|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a poor bid--why not 3@C which makes 4@H unmakeable on that lead |pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H may be hard to make with east holding 4 pieces|pg||
nt|fifee: tapping declarer from the beginning with a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: exactly which is why 3@C was a better choice |pg||
pc|h5|nt|viren169: Now they will end up in the wrong suit...|pg||

nt|garnetts: I like his bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: south is very lucky here|pg||
nt|jbgood: hasnt been so far in the match - and 3 @c is beyond me:)|pg||

pc|sT|nt|tweety1: NS will be in 4 @s|pg||

nt|viren169: they should find Q@S is missing and only a 4-4 fit ending in 6@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c is a horrfiic bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: well they have arrived |pg||
nt|ppilot: good bids unhappy but let us see the lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: a@S here makes 4@H easy |pg||
nt|ppilot: that is why 3 clubs values +fit is better|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes I agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: but maybe it still gets beaten if a club swicth happens|pg||

nt|ppilot: but let us see the line he will chose|pg||
nt|fifee: @C now can tap declarer and in with the @D and tap again|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is still not happy about the next lead--a club is far from obvious|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 rounds of clubs ruf 2 spades discarding clubs from dummy and ace and diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: He expects his partner to hold four trumps for his bid--maybe five|pg||
nt|fifee: yes the @SAce killed defense|pg||
nt|kippari: 11|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: ha to lkose three dims or two dims and a ruff to go offin 2s?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  needs to plan how to make 3@d tricks in defence, locking declarer in hand|pg||

pc|h4|nt|thegarve:  nice one mike your wife doesn't know but thousands on BBO|pg||

mb|3N|nt|garnetts: I was slightly joking--but I prefer it to having too much defence |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Tony Reus|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello |pg||
nt|sybarra: Tony|pg||
nt|starkist: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that lead could be costly if E plays for the holding|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: Shato on scoreboard!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this vulnerability i find it ok|pg||
nt|viren169: Assuming 2@S is weak... it will be difficult for pd to judge later in the auction on other hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: east presumably said thx for the info i want to play 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s a little more awkward|pg||
nt|ppilot: needs just right guess of trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: A number of players play a more constructive weak two via a multi|pg||
nt|fifee: since @D break, should make with wrong guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: This time there is not much to tell West how to play hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: The best reason not open as South |pg||
nt|ppilot: cant make if misguess trump without defensive slip|pg||
nt|garnetts: will be tempted to lead a trump maybe?|pg||
nt|kippari: JJ sanoi että 8 sekä jaot 15,16|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: so martin and george they are giving us loads of work to do|pg||
nt|ppilot: lool|pg||
nt|kippari: eikös tää mee nyt kotiin?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ppilot: and partner seems to understand |pg||
nt|olson: d1  possible  with the  % play in spades  of  low to K |pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|garnetts: but will dec get it right|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that is hard|pg||
nt|ppilot: we may just wait to see|pg||
nt|garnetts: No point in doing a thing but taking a guess now |pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing will help|pg||
nt|garnetts: walk in defender's shoes is a heart from Jxx dangerous ?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: what about xx?  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|starkist: slam goes down on a finesse|pg||
nt|thegarve:  uderleading an ace through the strong hand is quite common and worked very well here|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this real or surresl?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hasn't cost|pg||
nt|garnetts: either way it is a sniffy lead |pg||
pc|cA|nt|olson: they are leaving the  H ace  as  entry  to  take the spade finesse  back to the  Q109|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: might be over reaching here|pg||
nt|starkist: hope for @d lead? ;)|pg||
nt|starkist: @clubs foul anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 @C not 6 @H here if it wasn't that club break|pg||
nt|mmmakela: possible I meant|pg||
nt|starkist: @d finesse off so no|pg||
nt|starkist: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: it has cost declarer|pg||
nt|ppilot: i would rather be dummy than declare here|pg||
nt|garnetts: me too|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: if clubs 3-2 and hearts 3-3 don't need dias hook in 6 clubs|pg||
nt|baldfriede: It certainly made things easier in @h.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: now kill that dummy dead|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hasn't cost tye defence |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: some days,....just not your day |pg||
nt|starkist: no double|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u think he shouldc have pl;ayed ten of clubs?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  dummy is going to be cut off|pg||
nt|thegarve:  10@c was a desperate play in a desperate contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: dummy is dead and one day in the future n/s are going to enjoy lots of pretty little diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: 6N+1 on the last in the other room...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kippari: 10 imppiä +|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ppilot: this spoiled all|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to X when thy might be able to run|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mmmakela: 6 hearts needs always the diAS finesse|pg||
nt|starkist: to what on this bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's or for all he knows nt |pg||
nt|starkist: scardie cat :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Barantiev is thinking|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: -1?|pg||
nt|tweety1: just extending the pain:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: inching their way back |pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: N said that game is -1 and ... ok for all|pg||
nt|garnetts: poor defence is all one can say|pg||
nt|ppilot: may be he read his partners 2 of clubs like club holding?|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 of spade sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: look at the biddiing partner can have nothing|pg||
nt|ppilot: smal club was better anyway still needs guess:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: now i take my words back love to be declare wit such shift:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I sometimes think defenders panic--rely too much on partner's signal and not enough on the logic of the game|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here it was obvious that dec could not discard much on what ever spades he held--so lead another trump--let nature take its course|pg||
nt|garnetts: But West did do well to lead a spade as it created a diversion|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: surely west was badly at fault had no rweason to bid 4s|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner wass in control of the auction|pg||

pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: this could be a double part-score swing to Hungary|pg||

nt|thegarve:  maybe East should have bid 5@h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe east will be looking for a new partner|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i've heard Mike sing - like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: east with his ax of spade had no reason to bid at the 5 level|pg||
nt|olson: 3n for  3w|pg||
nt|olson: EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a wicked hand|pg||
nt|kippari: kattokaas joku|pg||

nt|thegarve:  sorry Mike am tone deaf|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|viren169: I was wondering if N would open this! |pg||
nt|olson: perhaps  W can bid  2n  to show  6c and a max  |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmmmmmm|pg||
mb|3N|nt|olson: or 3c  is 6c and a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: this may get them too high|pg||
nt|viren169: Now they will get too high...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N? without a spade stop?|pg||
nt|ppilot: happyly non vulnerable and not doubled:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad shot at this vulnerbaiity|pg||
nt|lestergold: only one off against cold 5C|pg||
nt|olson: hand is in the middle range for  11 - 15  |pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: what wld N's 1nt over 1 'd mean by any chance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not if they finmd spade ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will perhaps find it against 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much space taken west with no aces or singletons is not bidding any sixes|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps pass (forcing) is debatable when you know prd doesnt have a positive hand?|pg||
nt|olson: now  easy  3n by W  and should make 4   or   5 on spade leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|viren169: pass... not an option opposite an opening!|pg||
nt|ppilot: i am amazed too good parnership understanding|pg||
nt|ppilot: nte good news is 4 spades cant be made too:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: East getting his own back from earlier |pg||
nt|kaapo: Moni väri on kiltisti tässä jaossa|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: fairly agressive |pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe they have a systemic meaning for a direct 1N over the 1@D (possibly short or|pg||
nt|mariner1: artificial not sure)|pg||
nt|jbgood: amazing - they dont play presicion they way I used to do - pass not forcing?|pg||
nt|lestergold: would they have beaten 5c? a heart lead and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  slam has play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u are tone deasf then how do u know i cant sing|pg||
nt|garnetts: club is best for sure |pg||
nt|kippari: täällä sanotaan että otettu valtit pois mutta onhan saatavissa 2 herttatikkiä|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: but likely to make now?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 18-20 N|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tweety1: so dbl  is instead of 1 nt then?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Maybe Raptor.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the DBL here probably shows @D lenght|pg||
nt|jbgood: E would be declarer - di is good enough - in on heart ace and a spade ruff|pg||
nt|daman: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|garnetts: clearly a singleton |pg||
nt|garnetts: unless playing low from xx|pg||
nt|ppilot: that is true they play small from xx|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have never though it was a good idea and now I know it isn't |pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe they should lead singletons with their left hand--that would do it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|starkist: 27 hcp|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I said that you sing like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: he couldnt sing|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Sinatra is my cat|pg||
nt|lestergold: not compared to Jose Carerras at any rate|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: hi all |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|tweety1: then 3 @s seeems an overbid|pg||
nt|viren169: It is a big call... |pg||
nt|viren169: They must have been having lessons from the Hackett boys!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this is also style playing light openings|pg||
nt|viren169: North will be very happy with the developments!|pg||
nt|olson: good swicth  to save an imp  |pg||
nt|olson: hi|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: Mind I think it would need to be alerted |pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 hands diif:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is the end of the defence |pg||
nt|ppilot: and if 4 spades are deffended well not big win|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to choose between the lines...|pg||
nt|viren169: best not to touch the trumps just yet|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: of course im asleep|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mmmakela: needs the 9th somewhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s very easy espcially on that lead prob make 6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|baldfriede: Really @h discard?|pg||
nt|mariner1: only the @D break beats 4@S here|pg||
nt|olson: s  played  W  to hold a spade stopper and knew  6c  and  2d|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed it gives declarer a small problem|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S did come in freely and N does have good hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: well maybe 5 6 maybe too much work|pg||

nt|daman: 3NT  -5|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I were East I would like to find a hole to crawl into--but then again it is better to make mistakes when it is of little importance|pg||
mb|1S|nt|olson: w could have  been   3226 with Kx of H and south now  sets the hand     |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand|pg||
nt|olson: he knows a spade back makes  3n  |pg||
nt|garnetts: case for 3NT here as South|pg||
nt|garnetts: Or even 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: y |pg||
nt|lestergold: well a disaster for e/w in closed on a spade lead against 3n hard to play the ten and block the suit|pg||
nt|daman: spade wasn't led|pg||
nt|ppilot: 1 seems possible:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|baldfriede: In the good old days this would have been passed out.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  many woukd do the same bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no trumps played by east will produce a big swing|pg||
nt|olson: 110 for  ew  |pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand may blow up in someone's face|pg||
nt|olson: n  could play  3c  when south  reopens  over  2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so waht happened George |pg||
nt|thegarve:  but declarer played j@d at trick 2 - thus going off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h 3 dims and a club adds to nine|pg||
nt|ppilot: this will get them at 4 spades may be?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: guess another spade before hearts would've worked|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL by N is aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: possibly meaning long @c here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Must mean that; else I see no justification for x.|pg||
nt|garnetts: slow pass makes it hard for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i see odd play in open room|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe there could be a ruling asked for here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would reopen but not if partner thought first |pg||
nt|ppilot: may be they are doing it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: any possibility of a slow pass being queried?|pg||
nt|ppilot: if he bids only 3 his partner will kill him:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: why on earth would anyone do that|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: can anyone X?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: D Q 6 blacks, DA-D|pg||
nt|thegarve:  pressure|pg||
nt|olson: depends  if  N  has  2n  availa ble as a scramble  bid  after  second  double|pg||
nt|olson: always  lucky when  N guesses the 4 card suit to bid  that south has  4 of :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may survive this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: I would too :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tweety1: this will hurt EW a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the DBL certainly seems to be working here|pg||
nt|ppilot: unfortunately hard to find diamond lead to make this game hard here|pg||
nt|viren169: b|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that 1NT by South would have bought the contract |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: compression pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they m ay simply cash the first 7 tricks here|pg||
nt|daman: Played the @D J to protect his @S holding and it blew up in his face|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: made now|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defending like that better not X |pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break|pg||

nt|mmmakela: I gotta go too, ty all and have a nice weekend!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have all been there (or at least I have) |pg||
nt|daman: might happen here too   but not down as many|pg||
nt|lestergold: need a very long neck to get this rite|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an ability to see thru screens to x ray vision|pg||
nt|daman: a peek is worth 2 finesses|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rubbedr necks do help|pg||
nt|olson: this can be set  if defenders  lead  clubs  after  spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south resist temptation?|pg||
nt|olson: he should  |pg||
pc|c3|nt|rado: at other room W played 4@H but again no @D lead and easy 11 tricks claiemd after @S lead|pg||
nt|olson: only 6 winners   and  4d  takes  10 tricks  to get a plus score|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|olson: plus he  expects  3s  is going  down  |pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: just because of the heart break|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: curtains|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: must be some special treatment of puppet |pg||
pc|d3|nt|tweety1: dbl is single suiter |pg||

nt|baldfriede: Yep, seems like it.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|viren169: good duck|pg||
nt|thegarve:  in theold days the wisened pro used the cigarette and drink trick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jbgood: 3@h usually shows a five card suit |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: and not much of a swing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: will only lose 2   they will be relieved |pg||
nt|thegarve:  cigareete on table to the left and drink  on the table to the right - so coukd lean over botyh sides |pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: Now @D|pg||
nt|viren169: but still 10 tricks...|pg||
nt|ppilot: yes ace adn new diamond |pg||
nt|viren169: all routes end in 10/11 tricks for declarer...|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best to exit with the trump...|pg||
nt|ppilot: then 11 taking safe side spade fin|pg||
nt|viren169: true...|pg||
nt|rado: every imp might be precious since the results among first 4 teams stand for next stage of the finals|pg||
nt|lestergold: three off intead of five off only fifities|pg||
nt|daman: 2 IMPs apart with 3 to go in this set|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: eventually someone will try @c|pg||
nt|tweety1: actually i didnt like E's 1 @h here.|pg||
nt|ppilot: 11 now|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|danilo1: Scan see 10 to 11 tricks, depending on @S guess ... actually 11 trick as safety is to keep south aut of lead , also after @D and @D (N does not have trump exit too|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tweety1: @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S sure seems obvious|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tweety1: W will be squezed soon|pg||
nt|tweety1: if ducks @s now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Then it is 3 down.|pg||
nt|mariner1: if he ducks he gets no more tricks|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here.........|pg||
nt|ppilot: interesting board|pg||
nt|thegarve:  at the bar last weekend - Mike asked for a pint of leffee beer - they wouldn't sreve them in pints (too strong) so David asked for two halves on his beahlf ...the staff looked confused|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is surely weak!|pg||
nt|roswolf: but n/s should still bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a rank overcall at red|pg||
nt|ppilot: 4 spade looks makeble but with very careful play|pg||
mb|r|nt|mariner1: S passing my stop that from happening|pg||
nt|mariner1: may|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably game forcing|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat 11 count--yuck |pg||
nt|garnetts: likely to get 4@H now|pg||
nt|jurekk: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@C precision style 5+ clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: another light opening we have lot bidders here|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting how E/W were able to play 3@D after a strong 1@C opening...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well after the recent excitement we can have a coffee/ beer for martin break+|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a flat hand    |pg||
nt|garnetts: AS specs are asking what should South do--one word --PASS|pg||
nt|ppilot: i will pass too but here they try to kill each other|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tweety1: is this the final segment or?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing @H? or @D and @H?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@d is transfer to @h.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north must feel like bidding and has struck oil|pg||
nt|roswolf: now north must resist going on|pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h goes down on a club ruff - but no ruffs in 3 NT|pg||
mb|r|nt|mariner1: well so much for shoving by anyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: eggsacterly|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks mostly like suicide so far |pg||
nt|ppilot: this can be made too:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: if club lead|pg||
nt|ppilot: let us see if karakolev passes:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|thegarve:  alcohol free zone today|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of course Martin|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever|pg||
nt|thegarve:  honest guv|pg||
nt|thegarve:  been in worse slam than this|pg||
nt|daman: West won't reach opposite a passed hand I would think|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland would be in this for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is routine really|pg||
mb|d|nt|tweety1: south is walking at the edge of cliff:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: wronghanded now |pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@c cue seems in order|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: no blood|pg||
nt|daman: Roland would be in 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: and so may they!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and theyll make it too|pg||
nt|ppilot: lool|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south wont be too happy until he finds out the club position|pg||
nt|ppilot: it looks like boxing :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I would employ the duck and jettison coup here---East should duck when West throws his cards at him|pg||
nt|ppilot: why pass at 4 clubs doubled when you can play 5 doubled???|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: saved by E |pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt look sadly if there is any legit play for 3n now|pg||
nt|jbgood: pity S didnt bid 2 @s - then a chance of N being declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4 spades to q, south may have felt that it was his place to bid the no trumps- its not unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it would be a match winner now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|danilo1: @H lead beats 4@S ... sa oftern, West opening bid is mal-treatment of system|pg||
nt|viren169: probaly die out in 3@H|pg||
nt|ppilot: 4 has a play but on open kards|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes going Martin|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rkb it seems|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tweety1: 2 @dx cld be  -2 on 'c lead= 500 EW|pg||
nt|starkist: easy double|pg||
pc|c5|nt|danilo1: not only , but indicated to play @CQ ... for 10 Dble |pg||
nt|ppilot: what a struggle for 2 imps|pg||
nt|jbgood: but S might have bid NT next time if prd doesnt over 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) now he is happy|pg||
nt|roswolf: well what is he thinking about?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: East isn't supposed to have the hand he has    they are supposed to open with any 11 and he didn't    sooooo trying for a salami doesn't wash with me|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh excitment no coffe break after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: no more silly predicitons todaty|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now its find the q@d on a @c lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim is to way but hell do it the simple conveneient way|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: Forquet said that was his lifelong dilemma    finding a missing Queen|pg||
nt|thegarve:  J@S leadwould suggest an honour in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: belladonna had no problem- u know the story about thyem putting th queen in both hands|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|daman: but I.m sure you will tell us|pg||
nt|lestergold: he said it was impossible theyu both had the missing queen he knew it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|ppilot: 3 di dobled was down 2 on trump promotions|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hope there are no potential weapons like an ashtray near by |pg||
nt|ppilot: come on ilko diamonds:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or guns or swords?|pg||
nt|garnetts: well there are pointed suits...............|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: (oops sorry)  but "we" thought they did well to beat 3 @C |pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: all this is true but i think 2n was a naturakl enuf bid|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|viren169: tough for South to pass...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|thegarve:  both discrding from length|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: east has to find 3 discards of course|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose the defence was the same |pg||
nt|sybarra: somewhat similar yes |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|thegarve:  clues about q@d|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|tweety1: NS is playing a sort of transfering system on overcalls.  The transfer everything:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: and west too|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|viren169: West playing pd for QT of @Cs|pg||
nt|ppilot: 170 now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: yes S convative yet reasonable pass and W's 2@C call slowed this down both ways|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|thegarve:  pressure told|pg||
nt|daman: will make this now|pg||
nt|lestergold: all room for clever stuff now out of the window|pg||
nt|daman: the defenders needed to cooperate     didn't happen|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this is a good example of why you do not make a passive lead versus a slam where declarer has a long suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will be thinking on the discards that the dim q is wrong and will breath the bighgest sigh of relief of all time when the q shows up|pg||
pc|c3|nt|thegarve:  Ireland 22 Scotland 15 9 mins to go in the rugby|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: only three dims left with the defenders now!!!|pg||

nt|mariner1: conservative|pg||
nt|baldfriede: strong hand*|pg||
nt|viren169: well deserved 3 imps!|pg||
nt|danilo1: has been allways 170 (or 620) ... actuallly, EW lucky that South had 4 Hcp in wrong suits ... so did not jump to 4|pg||
nt|skorchev: on a 20 board match, 18 imps difference converts to 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: no allowed declarer a cake walk|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very slow one admittedly|pg||
nt|daman: oh well   fortune favo(u)rs the bold    and the bold just picked up 11IMPs to take the lead with 2 boards to go |pg||
nt|ppilot: no he always blame his partners|pg||
nt|ppilot: he now i suppose explain as 2 way double pass or stay:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I understand that--but there are times when you should make an effort to ensure personal safety |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lestergold: well this board aint gonna reverse that lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have no doubt that partner should pass--in which case he clearly would not save|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: the weak NT in Open worked well here|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W could get into trouble now...|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the penultimate board in this room, and I want to thank the Bulgarian Bridge Federation and Stan Nedkov for letting us watch these interesting team matches. |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|lestergold: with west opting to upgrade his hand to a 1 club opener e/w may well reach a very thin 3n which may hVAVE CHANCES|pg||
nt|jbgood: And a big hand to our excellent operator, well done Silvia Isaeva!|pg||
nt|ppilot: hope atleast one flat board?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This does not play that easily |pg||
mb|d|nt|ppilot: let us see if they reduce or increase 2 boards left|pg||
nt|viren169: east pass by N|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt mean to press capitals|pg||
nt|lestergold: however n/s have offered an alternative source of points also offered in closed room but accepted here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: also thnk you Mike Gold, England, for devoting time to guide us through these hands:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@H probably used as catch all not promising @H though no alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East will be happy until he sees dummy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east ahsnt accepted it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: S will play 1 nt dbled|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a straightforward auction but the play might not be so straightforward|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: a guaranteed swing in one or other direction now|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 2 hearts a dim and two spades for the defence|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tweety1: Thank God nobody bet:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: unavoidable on this lead must go off|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: also tu BBO and Roland Wald for providing software and organizing live broadcasts for the enire world to enjoy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: double now will increrase thec kleasd|pg||
nt|daman: I like DOPI for Kings over interference of my 2@C openers     that way we can catch the opps speeding from time to time and still get to our normal contract if we don't|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch now?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: or even pass|pg||
nt|thegarve:  time to tickle 3d|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: a bit over the top |pg||
nt|mariner1: W finds a lead right into the Jaws as it were|pg||
nt|lestergold: a few more in in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a tickle would have certainly been my choice|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @S  lead helped |pg||
pc|d8|nt|tweety1: thats why E shld have dbled, at least for @d lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: not tragedy ... will grabble 6-7 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: There must be a temptation to take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: that may not allow dec to take advantage of a favourable @D position |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: though a red suit lead would have been kinder to S|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|daman: EW probably think they are ahead and are just protecting their lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ppilot: if they find club ruff =500|pg||
nt|lestergold: here here!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim finesse followed by a lot of tricks cashing and a claim for one off|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkv: See you after 45 min. for next match|pg||
mb|1D|nt|thegarve:  its round robin teams so you need the occasional 21-9 win or more to offest the losses so give it a double|pg||
