nt|sharkey: the level of the players in the field varies quite a bit; thus I think not allowing Multi is fair view defence agreements etc|pg||

nt|sharkey: i go on a limb and predict 11 tricks :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|robinswr: heart lead is -690|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ann Karin, the only lady in the field, is comfortably ahead after three rounds|pg||
nt|robinswr: hard to believe that a heart lead gives up a trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|robinswr: but switch partner's majors (give him KJxx of hearts) then a heart lead could beat 3nt|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hate opening lead problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: wonder if most E will lead @S or @H?|pg||
nt|robinswr: especially in an individual when the opponents are jumping to the final contract|pg||
nt|jvage: I was asked to provide first names, North is Per Egil and South Ann karin|pg||
nt|jvage: West is Dag, East Magne|pg||
nt|sharkey: -660 rates to score below average as some E will lead @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: some S may go for slam?|pg||
nt|robinswr: -660 will probably tie for bottom|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D by S|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess in hearts they can take 2 or 3 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: only four scores compared on each board|pg||
nt|robinswr: in a regular pair event, where pairs have methods over 2nt, they might get to 6diamonds but not here |pg||
nt|vugraphzer: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=dnof|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib suggests @H lead beats 6@D - and he appears correct|pg||
