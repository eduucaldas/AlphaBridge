nt|roswolf: there is a website but i dont have the details|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4h no prob for N/S|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s hand i think 4@H?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S here with bad split|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Welcome all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   to start of with n/s|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mafia13: Good morning. And welcome! :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: But we won't know for sure until the very end when Jim has no fingernails left|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Majors|pg||
nt|ahh: this is a great hand should be throw in but no    every player has a bid |pg||
nt|ady: close match|pg||
nt|ady: this the final segment?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Jon Sveindal|pg||
nt|jbgood: penultimate one|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3 of 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No 3rd of 4|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|ady: ok   thx|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on a bad day 4h goes well off today it makes with an overtrik|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL IN WE JOLLY WELL GO - MICHAELS STRIKES|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do not want to sacrificie|pg||
nt|lestergold: the cards all sworking like a dream for N/S|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly not on this layout|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s x 800 today|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Ed :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the conventional raise are full in all world |pg||
nt|othered1: Ew may get in here, as west has a normal to double of @S, if that's what double means, not just @H|pg||
nt|caitlin: I assume a X by West would show hearts not takeout|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a bad method|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: hi  Jon   Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D  10-15   4+  always unbalanced|pg||

nt|cindy:  hi marshall|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk4: 3@H invitational with 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: 2nt was lebensohl |pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 5 major it is important to distinguish between 4 and 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning all and welcome back to Copenhagen|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Goodmorning everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning Nadia and John|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: asking north to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 3@H is too high on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you don't always get that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mafia13: Hi Roland.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north not wasting any time|pg||
nt|roswolf: shortish and sweet|pg||
nt|lestergold: east had better take his violin away quietly|pg||
nt|caitlin: Why a bad method Ed?|pg||
nt|ady: 3H!   invitational I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, 6+@h and invit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|idc: It looks like 3@c was making|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Nu er vi klar|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: hm... diofficult to find the lead hdere|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Difficult lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: from AQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does S have enough to act? not much but nearly all of it probably working. with 4 hearts X obvious, but even so, i am wondering...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean over 1S|pg||
nt|dburn:  perhaps in this system clubs could be significantly longer than diamonds, hence 4NT and not 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I think 5@c in stead of 4nt would be @c-canape|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's it, David|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hi guys|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no bloodshed and therefore no fun for the specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Anders|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi anders|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume west's double was a  support double|pg||
nt|frm: 10 tricks. You will never find the @D-lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: agree:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henrik Røn|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 trick theft|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well 9 maybe|pg||
nt|frm: Ten!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Liz McGowan|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Convention cards from  http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=1374|pg||
nt|cindy:  this isnt a forcing pass situation is it ?    wonder why the double|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: well it was a noise:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so very dangerous on his pile of fester i know players who would have bid 4s as east|pg||
nt|othered1: because, first, since 2@H doesn't deny @H, when you double you better be able to beat them.  so double will be rare.  And how do you safely make a 3-suit takeout?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Can afford to cash @DQ, then the spade switch must come|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect the defence need a spade ruff soon to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ha|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 1@D can have longer clubs and 5@C would show that; hence 4NT|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yourself on a frisky day?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: always am|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think the methods are all good or bad - the important it ia to have agreements, memory, and find a reasonable way to do the more probable hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back everybody|pg||
nt|ady: really needs K@S onside   assuming a diamond dwitch|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzpf: a difficult contract|pg||
nt|ady: west might hope declarer has singleton small spade and 4 diamonds    then a passive defence might be needed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: i get paid so much kroner by roland to entertain|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: you know how much?|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol please tell me how to get anything from him except virtual cokes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i get a kroner for every slam he bids that makes|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: In Italy it is used 2@H 2 way : weak raise or natural|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Marshall|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: oh well|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: in other words Zilch|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double of 4NT should create a force, i think|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, with an ace West is happy to suggest defending - he can't have a lot for 4@s|pg||
nt|cindy:  i mean the double of 4N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is short in spades for a 4S bid. still, the rest of his hand is offensive enough :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  and since East doubled 4NT, West needed to indicate his own preference for defending as opposed to bidding on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh sorry cindy|pg||
nt|cindy:  im talking about the first double|pg||
nt|cindy:  E has no idea if he can beat anything|pg||
nt|dburn:  that was just "I think we ought to be defending"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but E   surely DOES know he wants to defend rather than hear 5S from pd|pg||
nt|cindy:  wouldnt pass say the same thing ?  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if he passes they can never collect 300 when they have it|pg||
nt|dburn:  not really - pass would say "I don't know what we ought to be doing"|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|idc: I don't know whether to be jealous or to pity you Roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: good odds then!|pg||

nt|idc: If I could choose a person in all the world whose mind I could read, it sure wouldn't be me :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know how Kenny envisaged thet she would beat the hand if partner did not have @SAK. @CA would not be enough|pg||
nt|ahh: not sure that that is a gift i would wish to have |pg||
nt|lestergold: because in Denmakrk they do not exist|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however the stop at 2@S is a perfect bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is short in spades for overcall, musch better chance of 2 tricks there than normally on this EW auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: overtrick goes begging|pg||
nt|lestergold: an overtrick disappeared somewhere|pg||

nt|frm: Six @s is on!|pg||
nt|lestergold: then  game may not even be bid|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, since 4NT is not going to be the final contract, East may as well express some opinion over 4NT rather than having to guess over five of a minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is pretty sure no overtricks and might get 300 against a phantom. i think the IMP odds make double reasonabl;e|pg||
nt|dburn:  and enlist West's co-operation in the process|pg||

nt|lestergold: ladns on feet with this bid slightly risky at unfavourable|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Not Bjarnarson, not me:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass by North it is a possible choice|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only problem would be a bad trump break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you claim copyright, Mike?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: If they had led & run the knave instead, hmmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because vuln|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i dont have strong feelings. if EW were red, then i think pass is better. in trhe actual conditions i have no strong feelings. for a change :)|pg||
nt|mollerjep: yes, in a few sec..|pg||
nt|ady: yes   with 3 card support|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: The N Irish are in 5@D|pg||

nt|lestergold: north maybe pl;ayed with pard before|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2NT conventional?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No alert|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding that N hand i wouldnt be that worried about 3NT making while there are 4 losers in 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you don;t really have a second spade stop and almost all your stuff is outside spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hearts are weak but you have great chunky stuff where it will do a lot of good|pg||
nt|ady: cant blame east  for the sign off in spit of singleton heart|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: sry|pg||

nt|ahh: 5@D better contract  but perhaps less successful |pg||
nt|idc: a @c was led other room by South, so defence can only take 3 quicjk ones there - 3NT may have been makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: declarer may be forced to duck a @D now|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead instantly attacks the entry |pg||
nt|roswolf: a slam is possible here in the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North-South wife and husband, Charlotte and Dennis. Liz may remember Charlotte from Venice 1988 when Denmark defeated Great Britain in the Venice Cup Final|pg||
nt|lestergold: good players know that in 4th seat their pards usually bid their hand for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be a flattie|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I like the bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: brb|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: if south had not been a passed hand then north would have made at least a try|pg||
nt|ady: looks though this will make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid reaps its very just punishment|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: safe enough contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Charlotte and Bettina, the very young Danish pair then|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would X with North hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would be pretty unbelieveable if this slam was not reached in a final of this nature|pg||
nt|cuttysark: @CJ is a big card: North worried about what to do with all his losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: he knows that the singleton diamond is enormous bound to find the solution to his losers in dummy one way or the other|pg||
nt|ady: north may duck the club|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: small @d to the knave could be ducked by SOuth of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes|pg||

pc|dK|nt|ahh: nice defence if she does |pg||

pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: 1984 I think it was|pg||

nt|ahh:  dec will be pleased 3 down is imps in |pg||
pc|dA|nt|idc: after the @c lead to the knave in other room - if East had led dJ, she has an easy duck if South covers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect they are well out of 6@C here - can be made, but you need to take good views|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Anders|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: on borderline 4333 hands (Pass or Double) it is not unreasonable to make the decision--if nothing else serves as a decider--based on whether or not your 4-card suit is spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because that makes 2S more likely to make and more likely to push opps to 3 level|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: so far the hands have been boring and sane|pg||
nt|lestergold: thinking about the biding another way is that north has made two minimum bids and his partner has made a slam try splinter- he has two bullets and a first round control and a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: supported second round control- its more than enuf|pg||
nt|ady: can make with the 3-3 diamon split|pg||
nt|ady: back with a diamond    draw   duck a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart was a very reasonable alternative to a trump. on this auction trump might blow a trick and a tempo, and in any event S can probably overruff at least one club.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome to Cindy Marshall|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: so South must duck and then declarer has a tough choice - running knave and perhaps losing 4 quick clubs is silly if @d were 2-2 all along|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes excellent sense to me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK caitlin you've convinced me :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Interesting 1nt system|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: another low level and safe contract|pg||

nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile NS had a likely 140 in spades, a virtually certain 110|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all finesses are good, so np for N/S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: 2 remarkable bids here: the vulnerable double with the disparate majors, and the 1NT with no spade stopper :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: you should not bid grands that depends on a suit breaking 4/3 or even on a 3/2 break according to the conventional wisdom|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes science doesnt exist in Denmark it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, easy slam, three finesses, what's the problem ?  :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead @C it is the best, but impossible to make after pass at 2@C by East|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however always 12 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would scoff, but it is not totally crazy for E to double 2C. even the times NS could in theory make you pay dearly, it will in fact happen only a tiny fraction of the time|pg||

nt|bridge_one: after pass pass pass 1weakNt np to overcall for west|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not that bad when the singleton is in diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, South has his values in the wrong places opposite a major 2-suiter|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could be a very good save|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to get a @D ruff in|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes it is hard to see how the 5th defensive trick arises|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hej VM|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: 9 @C and 2@C, so one is a false discard ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors if i passed the W hand i would not be that eager to overcall. i don't want E to raise, really, and meanwhile N might have a bad 6-count so declarer might go down ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: S was thinking in 2 seconds before playing @c2|pg||

nt|cindy:  100 maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: +110?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South has only 3 @H, so 1 down, not 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in general i don;t like to open a one-bid on a 5422 10-count when i have 100 honors in a suit other than the one i am bidding :).  in a way i would rather open 1D, but would settle ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for pass|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: these are good players and they expect us to tell it how it is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am told that GIB says a club lead lets the game through....|pg||
nt|lestergold: is GIB always right?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahh: i agree with all this about 4441 hands i generally feel they play a king below their point count |pg||
nt|lestergold: it does matter south has the losing option not now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: that west has rushed in|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: Probably more often than I am, Mike|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's always an advantage to open the bidding. Defensive bidding is not as accurate|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one advantage of this NS method is that when N and S each have one (different) 4-card major, the opening leader doesnt know whether declarer has the major that dummy ddoesnt have. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it makes the lead harder (and maybe the later defense) compareed to more standard methods|pg||
nt|othered1: endplay for an overtrick, but east may just take his tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: good method for me, because when i open 1NT i usually want to hide my hand also :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D a playable spot, though|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Probably by starting with a small heart from south|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahh: well if opps open your shortage you have a great defensive bid |pg||
nt|henryb: I think a king is excessive|pg||

nt|roswolf: again acion likely |pg||
nt|roswolf: action|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can make 4s if they guess the spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe N tried too hard to hide his hand. couldnt he bid 3D over 2S? |pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree, to open 1@S with all hcp out and 10 hcp isn't a good idea|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and no shortness|pg||
nt|cindy:  they never tried to shorten him|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Now 16+ clubsystem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, now we are awake|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no since the timing for the trump coup would be ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can handle 4@S if they get there, with careful play|pg||
nt|dburn:  Konow will need the dealing machine to be cranked up a notch if they are to recover a 38-IMP deficit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|idc: The auction in the other room seems a little surprising|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is not enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess they dont play that as forcing cindy :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: slam 50%, but here down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: transfer break|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Then you can ruff the third club in dummy and still maintain control|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s s hand here|pg||
nt|dburn:  still a dozen boards to go, but if they're all like these...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: e/w do not want to get too high in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: might not see game level though|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will supe accept|pg||
nt|mariner1: E has to like his hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has to too|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would bid 2nt here to show 4 trumps ++ max points|pg||
nt|lestergold: north must do something for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n may war oppos about hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: failing that, S might have tried 3D over 2NT. it is not as if the combined values are so thin that 3NT rates to hinge on the lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would we all Pass as W?|pg||
nt|cindy:  no|pg||
nt|cindy:  im a spade raiser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: uhmm, i don't no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm a straight razor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always go for the throat|pg||
nt|cindy:  heh|pg||
nt|cindy:  chic razor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would bid 3S before pass. that might work out badly, but it has a lot of upside. 2S seems normal|pg||
nt|cindy:  this is one where i would bid 3S   they are never going to stop and double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem it is to give informations at declarer bidding the raise in @S - and with zero can be bad|pg||
nt|caitlin: I like transfer overcalls over strong club and 2@C strong|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spades the only suit west could have opened but wiosely didnt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North-South obvioulsy of the old school where 11 points did not make an opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: north borderline for opening probably didnt like the fact that none of his meagre points were in his long suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And South, 3rd in vulnerable, does not have a god suit to bid|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  At the other table they will open  as they play precision|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even a good suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think notth's hand is for the above reason a hairs breath short of an opener altho not a hanging offence to open|pg||
nt|lestergold: the vulnerability is indeed very relevant|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: A short break. I told S that he is from the old school. He didn't like 10xxx in @c|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: I like 4@S much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N actully has 17+ so I do also|pg||
nt|lestergold: east is undeteered|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will bid 3s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and north will raise to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: or make a t/o double w|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, we should bear in mind that apparently one of the hands N can have is a strong NT, which lessens the attractivenss of 3S a bit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C may be could be any balanced hand without stop in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c was not alerted by S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: that heart suit in the S hand looks eerily familiar|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: It shows a strong hand because you don't pre-empt against a pre-empt|pg||
nt|ahh: so do i |pg||
nt|idc: Oh, it was a Benjaminised 2@c - even then, North has a little bit to contribute|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that N-S play Benjamin, where 2@c shows an Acol 2 bid and 2@d shows a gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes - they do|pg||
nt|ahh: even the great Albert (alleged inventor of it ) doesnt play it |pg||
nt|idc: EW have done well to limit the likely loss for Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 300, 4 IMPs to CBAI. Next hand Stephen, please|pg||
nt|henryb: is he still around?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: one of the minors will probably be useful...|pg||
nt|ahh: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: soth apparantly needed to bid 2@D, now will be interesting to see how well he candescribe his hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: This may come down to a diamond guess|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has done quite enuf|pg||
nt|roswolf: now for the play|pg||
nt|lestergold: so all on reading the spade position|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting K&R show it as 16.5 however DK = 18|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Denmark recently signed the treaty accepting the idea of a slam bonus, so NS were really carrying the "hide declarer's hand" principle too far|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can arrive at slam (:|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not now, sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought south would make the cue in @s over 3@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: superficially looks like a possible misunderstanding, but pairs who play strong club encounter the auction 1C-1S by opp with depressing frequency, so they should know their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bid i was expecting from S pver 3H was 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H by South it is intelligent - beacause more richt give the minimum of hand that the control in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right()|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S doesnt bid 3NT, they will never play there, and why shouldnt it be the right contract some of the time?|pg||
nt|jbgood: you asked for action - here you go!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: I guess K&R reduce it for AQ @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you if club not set up then long dims will take care of club loser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was a perfect choice, agree|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: his hearts are terrible and his minor suit help might mean 9 tricks in NT with 4H going down|pg||
nt|cindy:  uhoh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N wants to correct to 4H that is fine also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have a feeling that EW will be overcalling a lot in the rest of this match when NS open 1C :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is a squeeze cuebid - means control in @S (the suit where North don't bid control|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I think 3nt could be unserious/serious|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is perfect - 2 stop in @S, no shortness, minimum (otherwise 3@s)|pg||
nt|othered1: game in either major is normal |pg||
nt|dburn:  I guess that will do as well as any - once North showed stuff in the minors, South just bid what he expected to make without describing his shape for the opponents' benefit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mafia13: seemed like it would have been more fun to dbl NS here...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|mollerjep: what about Brøndum? Will he raise the stakes...no!|pg||
nt|jbgood: W tried - but E let NS off the hook|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mariner1: one obstacle down|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht discard of course of no value to declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N/S discussed board 2. S was not sure aff 4@h in N. That was wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: West think he is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: still early|pg||
nt|mafia13: well, Kasper is a very nice guy :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: A new leader in the match|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have made 6H, as it would be somewhat attractyive to E to lead a D, playing W for the queen. but S is doomed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: x was unlimited|pg||
pc|sK|nt|caitlin: that may be why South bid 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my opinion, what is "unserious" is playing 3NT as artificial when no more than an 8 card fit has been promised|pg||
nt|bridge_one: too much value in @h for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It is a (loosing) finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is right to think a long time|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume if north had bid a major over 2@D, south may have gotten more interested in a slower auction|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Club now for an easy set|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: hasnt even given himself the option of a spade finesse on the second round|pg||

pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Back to the diamond guess....|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: not difficult|pg||
nt|dburn:  one would think so - even a 2NT rebid might have seen South investigate a slam|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  2 could be a swing (doubt it though). it's a lucky make at 3NT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eoff is good bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks so much Soren for continuing to provide so much useful information :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Well done - nneded to play @SA other to avoid the endplay|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if South has th 9 in @S no exist chance for East, so A is correct|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|mollerjep: it's much easier to hook NS if S passes, so full marks to Brøndum for that strange 2h  |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn:  for whom?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: i think the play of the spade king at trick one conventionalkly signals "partner you bid too much" |pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only addressing the flatness of the boards, not the hope of Konow :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: another freakish hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C nice spot,,,,,,,, 6@S not so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: not right to play club because that would have given up the possibiklity of the club loser eventually going on diamonmds|pg||

nt|lestergold: nice?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|lestergold: one diamond for discard not enuf!|pg||
nt|mariner1: you play @S to q|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm slightly suprising line of play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have a comparison now - Konow mised the thin 3NT onBoard 1, losing 8 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: now how will north value this hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like it - I like aces :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: end up hopefully playing W for Ajx  not easy I admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: how double will give south a problem|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh right only one @D pitch here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so no 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: had he opened they would have probably socred a plus |pg||
nt|cuttysark: You are not supposed to quote us :) I shall have to be careful what I say :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 12 HCP in north, plus a fit, but is it worth a game force?|pg||
nt|dburn:  might be anxious to try for 3NT, with all that slow stuff in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4H  can be beatend on diamond lead  with 2 ruffs    but e/w  can make 4@S  on club view|pg||
mb|1N|an|0-6 3!H eller 6-9 2!H|nt|dburn:  but might be wrong to do so on this lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: Roland will give exact odds of 1 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even better news for Scotland now. NI -5 against Ireland|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: well difficult for n/s now not to over cook the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the raise here may be unwise|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c for sure being bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: south cant know who is making what here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well does S think N bid 5@C to make?|pg||
nt|caitlin: good Namyats hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem for North was to guess if AQ@d was 2 tricks or one - after 1@S overcall he choose the chance to find the K in West|pg||
nt|othered1: meanwhile, can ew find a good 4@S spot?|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure whether 2NT is natural or a heart raise|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW won't get their @S into the auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 card heart reai|pg||
nt|jbgood: raise|pg||
nt|jbgood: at least an invite|pg||
nt|dburn:  but East won't enter the auction, I don't think, and West certainly won't bid again, so 4@s unlikely to be reached|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: yes he should|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: np, they enjoy the comment|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a good spot, without west's @D bid.  With it, there's obvious danger|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability he is certainly on a guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would make the samew bis as south|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: ut I would not want to get too high with these breaks!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho we can see that double is thewinning bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|frm: A lucky slam in @H or @C is on!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like @S may be where they end up + west may have a flyinf hack|pg||
nt|lestergold: south delighted with the second bid!!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: found it|pg||
nt|jbgood: y|pg||
nt|othered1: This will be down quickly|pg||
nt|jbgood: quickly is a non-existent word ....|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, board 2 was a gain for Konow anyway when a weak two bid on @hAKJxx and a 5-3-3-2 shape, vulnerable against not, cost only 300|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that bid could be right, with a different shape and suit quality :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: hmmm wet by west|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Worth a thought when there are no overtricks - more tempting if NS were vulnerable|pg||
nt|jbgood: S's response: I find your suit prd|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c is two way its inmsurance again st vul opps makingh 5h and its slam if partner is good|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: now @C|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think @H7 signalling for diamond|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East will make the contract only discarding on @D and playing @D from dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a namyats hand in playing strength, yes. the problem with opening 4D is that you need specific stuff in specific places and it will be awkward looking for it at that level, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as there may be no safety at the 5 level. for slam purposes i would rather open 1S. with hearts, though, i would open 4C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: @cA, @cq and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but a club is best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is thinking at a hand like  @S@S@S@S@S@S, xxx @D Kx@C inEast|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this case must play @D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: plauing bridge it is very important to guess :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: 4S is a practical bid because NS may have a cheap save. also at these colors 4S cannot be chopped liver so you arent really underbidding by much|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: i f you dont axe with 3 solid trump tricks and pard making a free vul bid - when will you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes the result doesnt work out in ur favour|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.dk/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South has done very well to bids his time and buy the contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed didnt want to show overenthusiasm|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S had an awkward bid over 2D. pass, double, and 2H could all turn out best|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: that is why players preempt as west did|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true giorgio, but most people cant guess that i am playing bridge :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: E is asking about signals|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the call in @D by North, now become usefull for East|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: (The expression is 'bide his time'; the typing is abysmal, sorry :))|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5-3-3-2 is not generally a good shape for sacrificing|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  When playing with Nielsen it is usually right to show as little enthusiasm as possible|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: now no chance|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: but seems as if you are right!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: He had opened - and partner's raise scarecly improves his defensive propsects outside the trump suit :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was easy to defend just no one discard spades|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|roswolf: when the almighty gives you such a hand it is not wise to decline the present|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You sound like Confucius :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect he will go 2 down, and might escape for 1 down after a double....|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm yes i can - but one of my hobbyhorses is that doubling + redoubling for businees is a dying art|pg||
nt|cuttysark: She?|pg||
nt|roswolf: except qj doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west is not short of discards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: are they just thinking soren or is there a break?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: or stiff honour|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: i get the drift|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: it was not a totally hopeless slam actually better than a oland|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: Roland slams make though :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: I agree that players do not double enough - but there is little point if you cannot show a profit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: thinking|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: if they think any longer about a partscore we will have to ask them to switch to Goulasch :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i maybe incline toward pass, as it makes it more likely for us to find a 5-3 heart fit. of course we could miss a 4-4 spade fit that way, but it is easier for pd to have 3+ hearts ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: than 4+ spades |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d9|nt|lestergold: the spade duplication was very unlucky for n/s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the gallery is getting restless, they want to see something even if it is a revoke :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: no 6@C very reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: more big fits|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK fresh meat now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: A short coffeebreak|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Brøndum is born lucky, but he's also one of the most skilled players in Denmark...and born natural by the way :-)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think east has to stick his neck out and bid that excellent heart suit on the next round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like one of those things: nobody liked his spade holding |pg||
nt|ady: e//w   have dome well   not easy to get to-gether in spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also S is minimum & N could have just 5-8, which i think also argues for pass|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahh: she must be a liar as they never got higher |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a tricky defense available to hold N-S to eight tricks|pg||
nt|idc: Though Roland had never been barer?|pg||
nt|ahh: its not going to win any prizes is it |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: not impossible if E supports ?|pg||
nt|henryb: in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: my bidding advisor says that if you dont bid you dont get|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  West might have tried 2@H instead of 3@C, but after the 1@S overcall his @SKJ10 to do look like they are worth much|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S     needs a bit of luck|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|idc: true, back to the drawing board|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a tough 4@H here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but no games on for anyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe rob|pg||
nt|jbgood: and it is there|pg||
nt|ady: once the diamond is rught   can eliminate and get end play in hearts|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 4h may make i suppose |pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead club switch obvious no play|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the type hand N that if you open that S needs to have a 2@C tell me more|pg||
nt|mariner1: bid....... not that you would stay below game anyway|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok  3N  next|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: well, E has two more honors than she had on the last hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont think i would have kept quiet as S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: when i am S i believe the literature--i am supposed to become declarer--so i better start early in the auction :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahh: if the event was held elsewhere in Ireland we could do Knock Knock jokes |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looming|pg||
nt|lestergold: should beat this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i would not be that eager to balance with the E hand, especially with a big lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  heres a plac e to get some imps back|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: i think it is easier for east having made a negative double to tell his partner that he has more than a mere 4 card heart support type holding|pg||
nt|frm: Just made!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not much going for this contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Provided North leads an unbid suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h should not be strength showing after the double but maybe in their methods it is|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   a bergen raise  spec asked?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I guess|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb: I think E ahould lead the Q -- partner could show the J then|pg||
nt|idc: difficult problem for North first round - I quite like 2@s opposite a five card major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec says "S is a state of mind". ouch, guilty as charged|pg||
nt|cindy:  ya know thats funny   in real life i always sit S and never get to play the hands|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm south forced to game did he-- very optimistic|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: I think they have guaranteed a heart lead - fortunately the hearts are kind|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Are we thinking, or disconnected?|pg||
nt|ady: seems so|pg||
nt|cindy:  his idea of a 3 suiter is unique|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: needs to find the @c switch,,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a lousy game even with Kc favourable|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: we were thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: no prob|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Queen probably asking for reverse attitude signal|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|asig: Dinner time :) See you next session.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: at end of day north had a minimum opener south had a limit raise and north had a non acceptance|pg||
nt|mariner1: well N could easily have the K@S instead of Q@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so im not sorry for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ruff two diamonds a play club?|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably as good a line as any from here|pg||
nt|lestergold: west knows east had ten of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: so shouldnt allow himself to vbe endplayed|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK bon appetit :)|pg||
nt|mollerjep: I was beaten the first time by Freddi when he was 11 years playing with his granddaddy Herman Hansen...a great couple|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: natural play brings 9 tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, there was little point in putting it off - either there was a running minor or there wasn't :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sneaky @HQ - bu there is little to do bu play a top club|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (butttt - practising typing)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: even if endplayed declarer still has to guess the spade|pg||
nt|ady: heart problem solves on opening lead    now straight foward A@D needed with east|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frm: I think you are right! Missing showing the good @H-suit seems to have missed the game!|pg||
nt|dburn:  aggressive lead, but may have been reluctant to try a passive club since West could not double the artificial 3@c bid|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|dburn:  and no one leads trumps these days|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not unique, but non-mainstream :)|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is the preparation  is so transparent to the defenders|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: Bash on with diamonds, keeping South on lead, and he has his game|pg||
nt|lestergold: waity a minute not enuf hearts in the pack|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear declarer has fallen for the duck cant blame him|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He had 2 chances - spades coming in or diamond finesse. No special reason to play for diamonds 3-3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|lestergold: and it is|pg||
nt|mariner1: not to me...... N had a raise|pg||
nt|caitlin: with an Ace?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well Rob occasionally i disagree with u|pg||
nt|mariner1: you know your hand is worth a K or A more, and you have cards in between you|pg||
nt|mariner1: and S,,,,,, time to raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving the control of 3th round in @C (haveing 4 cards raise)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and hoping the @C arn't 3/0 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: got the idea across, and north seemed to rightly value his red controls.  BW does the rest|pg||
nt|cindy:  not good|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East led away from the @HQ twice|pg||
nt|henryb: its more problematic with a stiff K or Q, which may promote tricks and don't show up in Blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like declarer willhave 9 tricks, even if EW can drive the @DA early|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 4 of his 5 points not working too hard|pg||
nt|dburn:  but what with no majors having actually been bid, you'd expect North to lead a heart|pg||
nt|ady: easy without the unlikely diamond lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  or possibly a spade from @sJ10x|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn:  what he's not contemplating is a diamond, that's for sure|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, not terrible - may be only -500 against -480|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: one normally does not like to have stiff ace for a splinter, but here S esily has splinter values even without that ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: known 10 card fit South upgrades to show Queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Good bidding and a good contract|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this was an excellent auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would bid 3@S immediatly because East (after dbl at 2@S) could have cards to bid 4@S and after ii become all more difficult|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahh: which was twice too many |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 13 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: First time declarer played low from dummy, second time she could not avoid winning the 8 in hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do we all like that 1NT response?|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have been better to duck first dim|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont hate it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Well, what else. Not pas?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would have led @CK, trying to pin the queen with equal lack of success|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  W could have had @DK8x as they lead 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|lestergold: ebventually declarfer will try heart finesse as he cant set up clubs in time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even in partner's suit? |pg||
nt|dburn:  or even -980 - I guess East-West could make a slam in hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb: a heart switch on which declarer played the 9, and another heart whan in with the @sK. declarer got the second one right|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 91, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 81, IRELAND  72, CBAI 71, WALES 43 ****|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: the lead is correct, knowing sgl in @S in South|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: dianond back  a possibilty|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: now spade is the killer|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Also 2nd/4th in partner's suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me neither. the downside is wrong-siding a NT game. the alternative is a negative double--risky, but if it works out you will right-side|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not saying i would double, but it does have a significant upside|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 offski|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East might have inserted @SJ to make things clearer|pg||
nt|lestergold: west in tank|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Indeed. It is not that easy for E to discard a heart as he knows declarer to have @HA|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should know his partner has qs because his partner le a low spade showing an honour if thats how they still play|pg||
nt|lestergold: and cant have ace of hearts must play him for qs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well they play 2nd/4th, which means low from doubletons, so I don't think it is clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: that Liz is the problem i dont understand their methods|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  They continue to play 2nd/4th throughout so E knows very little about his partner's spades|pg||
nt|frm: But W is probably thinking of who has the J of @S |pg||
nt|dburn:  not that they were going to bid one, of course|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|nt|ady: but the spade position is so good for west|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: however on general ground east must play his pard for that qs|pg||
nt|lestergold: and by discarding his heart he has done so|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mollerjep: Diamonds are as good as it gets...|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: assuming a strong NT, it can gain for example when W has 18 with a doubleton S king. despite 27 HCP, probably a double stop will be needed as finesses through S rate to lose|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||

nt|ahh: no chance north plays this 1 |pg||
nt|henryb: its like the newspapers|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very favourable layout and south'shand on thelayout was worth more than his bids had shown in effect|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing a weak NT, the case for double is stronger|pg||
nt|henryb: if you are going to cue @s, undoubtedly 4@s would be better than 3, since 3 would, I think, be looking for a stopper for 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: well defended|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very unlucky contract - I shall never complain about my luck again|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 s makes for n/s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Not till tomorrow, anyway)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S is complaining:)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|ahh: so far as scotland are concerned run of flat games is all they need |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably S doubled because he thought a 4-4 heart fit might be the best strain. that might be true at the game level, but at the slam level clubs should be better. and S has slam ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: values. that is why I would bid 4S directly over 2S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulhac: They will do well to reach 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still risky though, obviously. the sort of call that would become genuinely attractive if a swing were needed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 4@s immediatly better that 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Henry|pg||
nt|caitlin: but North could have 4 hearts |pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Henry:)|pg||
nt|othered1: And doyou think 4@S -- using all t hat room, so it should be a very specific hand -- is better than the approach south took?|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, perhaps, but 4@s does not leave very much room for manoeuvre|pg||
nt|henryb: no; with all those high cards it is unlikely that they can preempt high|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tell him the old school never complains :)|pg||
nt|ady: part score looking hand     e/w  1NT|pg||
nt|ady: might play in spades now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: the problem is: 2@C 2@s dbl 4@s ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: bidding is easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If I open 4@H with that hand, my partner has @SQ, @HK and @DA|pg||
nt|ahh: i like 4@H until p turns up with @H  K and @D AK|pg||
nt|idc: pick the most likely game, bid it, then make it ... next board|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might have some play from S,,, how to bid that|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N bid NT here 1st anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is E held even the heart TEN he might well just blast 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: Not now:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do thinkl an immediate 4S is better, because NV  W might raise spades|pg||
nt|dburn:  since all partner can do over it is sign off or bid Blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: The loss of space would make me think twice before bidding it.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I will|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is life in this hand yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2h the normal spot|pg||
nt|dburn:  at any rate, West has a particularly vile problem in this auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me. no problem when you are compensating for loss of space by showing a very specific hand, and leaving RKC available|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w close to game in hearts|pg||
nt|frm: Yes that 9 of S! in the east hand is a guarantee for playing the suit correct|pg||
nt|dburn:  and GIB can make a slam in hearts on this deal also|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb: I suppose it is too much to expect that partner's KQ would be in @d and that she might hold the @hK in addition?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahh: so there are at least 3 hands to make slam easy |pg||
nt|ahh: Ian find a 4th |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@H nice and calm|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idc: life hasn't taught you to expect disappointment every time?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will find the grand slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn should be held to 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this will quietly go down two probably|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N unusual or to play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: not a good contract|pg||
nt|dburn:  he may have hoped that 3NT showed the minors|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Konow and Gjaldbæk playing their last season together after winning several championships.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: slam or down in 4?|pg||
nt|dburn:  fortunately for Schou, GIB is not handling the North-South cards at the other table|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|dburn:  because Askgaard may not even make a game on this lead|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulhac: It needed to be played by West to have any chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead at any rate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North would work in this hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: no alert|pg||
nt|dburn:  on the grounds that two hands tha could not enter the auction at their first turns could not want to play in 3NT, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: now n/s have found their fit|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 not the best HCP and EW cam to an early stop|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: it seems normal to win and lead D jack|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mollerjep: thats tough...|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N: Maybe I should pass 2@c|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like to bid majors. So I would not overcall 2@C with that West hand - I would double and convert spades to clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to bid vulnerable with his mpile of fester just as well because if N/S were to be pushed they make 4s on the lucky layout|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gotta find the heart fit, no atter how high the level :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: Except in the post-mortem, what makes you think that you're showing a specific hand?  and what are the specifics?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: right - I can't try for 6 or I'll be in 7 -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they dont fin d te ruff its an overtrick of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|lestergold: overtrick now unless east finds a gtrump|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should have overtaken what to gain he knows the position|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb: may have thought it was simply bridge logic!|pg||
nt|othered1: west made a winning play at trick 1, as it was possible north had led fromJx in partner's suit|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: is he hoping that east has Jxx of hearts and that there are three natural trump tricks?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frm: What does W´s RD show? Good cards? Then perhaps he shouild have introduced his @H-suit instead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And I will take my diamond ruff against 4@S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: xx Kxxx AKxx xxx|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that heart jack falsecard might work if E cannot count to thirteen|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn:  ...that was not clear to East, and I confess it would not be clear to me either|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: partner cannever be in to give hinm that dim ruff so trumps drawn dim loser away on heart and 4 made on the cross ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: however North can't dbl because south could have zero|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh they done a clever thing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: only explanation |pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is not going to play E for 8 hearts, after all...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: sorry missed it|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|othered1: I still like south's getting @H into the auction early, which made north's later decision trivial.  |pg||
nt|dburn:  North can't double because West will run, and he can't necessarily handle 4@d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: I win th club lead and switch to may diamond. Win first spade, give partner club ruff, ruff diamond. Very clever|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: the specifics are: 4+ trumps, shortness, first or second round copntrol of the 2 "off-suits", and serious slam-try values|pg||
nt|mollerjep: when he's doing wrong he still prevail :-)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||

nt|bridge_one: foe west the multi is a great information, having 9 cards very good in the majors :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now North is thinking the level to bid his @D|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  N will most likely make a slamtry (or two) in @C which S will reject|pg||
nt|lestergold: eaast happy to accept tho|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, South is  minimum and aceless, so will turn down all tries|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS play a quite complicated NT system devised by S, so let's see if N can remember it ;-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no hook needed the clubs take care of thrid dim|pg||
nt|cindy:  well|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulhac: It looks like a comfortable 3NT but it goes off on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They can't avoid getting to slam. Any bets?|pg||
nt|idc: plenty of scope for minus scores EW, 6NT West looks like the money contract but that's just on this layout|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must be Lapse-ing Soochong tea|pg||
nt|cindy:  my eagle eye said something iw weird with this auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or "Constant Comment"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: great hand for East after long in @d at opps - he know the p must be short|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, there is no arguing that 4S should show spades in this sequence...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, a great hand for her|pg||
nt|lestergold: now how does north show his hand|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I have no idea :-(|pg||
mb|2D!|an|GF|nt|paulhac: But surely West will lead a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: both ace clubs wrong and qd and its still infrangible|pg||
nt|lestergold: if its with 4c they will still be able to play in 4n or 5c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but north has a monster opposite an opener|pg||
nt|cindy:  hahaha|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c obviously strong in their methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably transfer to show weak minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: south rejkects and will north try again|pg||
nt|ady: will need a heart lead from QXX here   or possibly a spade lead and heart switch|pg||
mb|2H|an|3!H|mb|p|nt|idc: hmm, and West can duck the @sQ anyway, so maybe nothing makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to lead a heart against 2NT so opponents realise they may have missed a game :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so likely to be bid in both rooms for a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is surely an easy slam to bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they perhaps play 2Nt Gf |pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 3@c inviting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, the interference is helping the side with the cards, as so often happens. still, it is not like N can pass....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No, invit+|pg||
nt|ady: that is if n/s reach game|pg||
mb|3C|an|nat|nt|lestergold: much too easy for roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  actually, you could play pass to show hearts and 4@h to show spades, if you were worried about a diamond lead through partner's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: West couldn't work out how to intelligently decide on 7 and did the practical thing|pg||
nt|dburn:  but that may be carrying a sound principle too far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: W: Maybe I am to good|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally david, but if 4S is in the menu it is gonna have to show spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: invit + is better for West - easy call slam |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d anyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i hope its not encouraging whatevefr it means|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C Puppet   3@D at least one 4-card major   3@H = spades|pg||
nt|idc: no, in that case you can use North to reach the dummy|pg||
nt|dburn:  here, GIB has arranged for clubs to be 3-0 so that no one can make six hearts - six clubs, on the other hand, is an excellent spot|pg||
nt|cindy:  GIB is getting a bad rep :-)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|paulhac: Its not a gtreat game but vulnerable with 25 points many pairs would have reached it. Even on the heart lead it needs the A@D right|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ask Boesgaard - he invented the method|pg||
nt|lestergold: it obviously encouraged north|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And North can't remember enough of it - oh dear|pg||
nt|lestergold: east on lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: which bullet will he fire first|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S is thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: i love being on lead against a slam with a few aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u it usually means opps are void in one of them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And you lead the wrong one, establishign enough discards for all the losers :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Wonder if west's failure to make a suicidal double of 2@H will keep east from finding the killing double-dummy lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 6N is actually easy. say a minor suot lead. you win, cash the @dKJ and lead the @sQ|pg||
nt|ahh: 1 of my mentors always said never introduce poor 4 card suits in big auctions |pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: cant  be beaten with a viking axe|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a dabish one!? with superhuman powers?|pg||
nt|roswolf: danish|pg||
nt|lestergold: well neither can or will run away whatever he does so soptry is over bar the fat lady's siren song|pg||
nt|ady: settled for part score    not unreasonable |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I've left it till last, but 6@d is ok too but hard to see them getting to that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now he can safely double|pg||
nt|othered1: That wouldn't have been among my likely NS contracts, and let's see if it can be managed.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|paulhac: Good Pyschology Liz:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@c ask about 4@c.  1|pg||
nt|lestergold: south wanted tio show his qc prioritisd it rather than worrying about bullets|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@d is no. S: Mayde N does not remember.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this will cut their lead dwon by the odd 12/13 imps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Usual problem with complicated methods over 1NT - they do not arise often enough to stick in the mind|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N: NT gives more point|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only when it makes, unfortunately :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, he will realise that soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Konow needed this badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: how right that advice often turns out |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D presumably showed an unidentified major, perhaps in a particular strength-range|pg||
nt|dburn:  West might have just taken a shot at seven (perhaps bidding 5NT first), but his actual view is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Is 7 good?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|henryb: when S ducks, cash the @sA and the clubs and play @hA and another|pg||
nt|dburn:  and it is a bit surprising that East-West here have missed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes, piece of cake|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when you are a spectator|pg||
nt|ahh: and the hand written up in scotland on sunday |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@D  0 or 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that will be oyall|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|henryb: two high diamonds and the @sQ does not seem so hard|pg||
nt|ahh: now it will only be written up in the friday edition of the Scotsman   it deals with disasters|pg||
nt|roswolf: next|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: yes, 2@d was multi.|pg||
nt|dburn:  not bad - not cold, but not bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the grand slam it is near to be impossible - only finding sgl in @C or the K in @c - so 6@s is reasonable (5@D would instead to search grand slam)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S: Nice bidding. A litle bitter|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: moral of the story do not knock the old black|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure anyone would be too likely to get to 6H in the 4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: E/W are discussing the bidding..:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  what would you do with E hand over 4@d|pg||
nt|dburn:  I don't know what 4@d showed, but I imagine it said something about second-round spade control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont understand why W bid 4D. he has already shown that control. why not 4H?|pg||
nt|dburn:  and it may have denied the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: W: 4@d is @s control and 2 A|pg||
nt|dburn:  West was replying to 3@s, which is a Trelde asking bid in spades|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d8|nt|dburn:  worse on a club lead than any other (unless played by West, of course)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: With the fragile heart position, 6@s could have been better than 6NT, just one of those things|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it doesnt seem to me that W needed to give up on finding a grand. what could go wrong by bidding 6D? if E has club king & the spades we expect he will go on|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: konow not on the scoreboard so far this set|pg||

nt|henryb: 6N by EAST looks best|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: north avoiding trumps|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You can't be serious, Stephen|pg||
nt|ahh: another 4-1 @S break |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: mildly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West carefully holds declarer to 11 tricks - hard not to feel bad about that|pg||
nt|roswolf: big fits where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|roswolf: straightforward hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not quite a game here for e/w|pg||
nt|dburn:  but even then, you can pitch two clubs on the top hearts and hope to play a complete cross-ruff for thirteen tricks|pg||
nt|dburn:  during which, if @hQ or @cK puts in an early appearance, so much the better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean wheeling out blackwood|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  RÃ¸n-Zeeberg seem to be having a great set in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: score has just gone up i see for the leaders|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They just made 4@H on board 6 where our NS were allowed to play 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You really want to play the hand out in the hope that one defender revokes when you know you are 1 down?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@D looks good|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It was good then..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if you discover it hidden in your own hand|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont think E had anything to do but 5@c over 4@d|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Eneste krav|nt|henryb: we had one earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would not be bridge they way I know it|pg||
nt|ahh: we also had 13 penalty cards on friday |pg||
nt|ahh: leading just :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: just a thought - not a suggestion|pg||
nt|henryb: the operator had a problem because BBO would not permit a revoke|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@C must include a weak 2@D option|pg||
nt|paulhac: North south can make 5@D and it may be difficult for East/Wesr to realise they need to save|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid and off is my prediciton|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i might take a small piece of that|pg||
nt|lestergold: north only needs to lead Ac and see partners doubleton showing card|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead might confuse things|pg||
nt|lestergold: its only a small non vulnerable piece |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No, It did not show any strength range. Just not a 2suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe 5@HX ?|pg||
mb|2D|an|0-1 kontroller|nt|Walddk2: 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a lot to think about|pg||
nt|ahh: that tip appered in a book called 101 winning edges by a ruthless author |pg||
nt|henryb: double with the N hand would not cross my mind|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 91, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 80, IRELAND  72, CBAI 71, WALES 44 ****|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: very much so:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead wrong when  you have an ak that partner is never going to expect if you dont lead it|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c cash is the play though...... to see dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is sufficient - if East hold control in @C he would bid over 5@s, otherwise would bid 5@s, after 6@S by West and finish the bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that was a bidding error by Konow here was our consensus|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sin by ommision|pg||
nt|othered1: Here 3N is on, depsite lack of @H control|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@D also makes|pg||
nt|ady: they have to either reach 3NT with no heart stop    or 5@D will make with nice minor splits|pg||
nt|dburn:  and 4@d showed, apparently, spade control and two aces|pg||
mb|2N|nt|idc: agree, 2@d looks better|pg||
nt|cuttysark: -300 is not a big deal against -400|pg||
nt|paulhac: Rather too strong for a weak 2@D in my book|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Of course the defenders may not find their spade ruff...|pg||
nt|roswolf: AGREE|pg||
nt|henryb: or when they do not lead a trump and you find partner with 4(+) @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, you are going on to 6S whatever E does, so i think W should just jump straight to 6D over 4S, to let E know immediate;ly how close to a grand they are|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: full of all the coffeehousing tricks known to man |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not mine either but when she does, South has no problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: ommiting to tell hi partner tyhat he had 5 excellent hearts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: no error here|pg||
nt|othered1: redouble by south?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What is this 3@C all about?|pg||
nt|ahh: forcing |pg||
nt|ahh: in this tournament @S break badly i am not bidding them |pg||
nt|idc: to find a 4-4 @s fit, but then I'll bet she worried that 3@s wouldn't be forcing (it should be) |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: i have a 4c major and a @C stop and a good hand|pg||
nt|idc: 3@s after the 3@c 3@d continuation I mean|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nort has worked out what partner has - and now very difficult to save|pg||
nt|paulhac: Cannot critice East's X|pg||
nt|roswolf: that double will cost|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, the 4@H maybe suggests a lack of defence there, and what else do you have?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west mightsave the day|pg||
nt|paulhac: If West knew that south had opened a weak 2@D hhe would not have bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: to see partners card|pg||
nt|lestergold: no doubt uidca|pg||
nt|dburn:  it wasn't easy, though. There are matches where you'd win 13 IMPs just for being in six, though obviously this high-class affair is not one of them.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after all, the 4S call gives W about a one-loser hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: W and S is discussing board 10|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n|pg||
nt|frm: Only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess this is one of those Mult 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6n not that bad a contract better than 50%|pg||
nt|dburn:  so that East had a number of further options, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: does not think they have 25 hcp  and stopped|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, when trump is a minor (esp. clubs) there isn't room at the 4 level to distinguish 1st & 2nd round controls, even if elsewhere in your system you like to start with 1st ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: round controls|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|mafia13: catching partner with another boring dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: no double? no trouble|pg||
nt|paulhac: Great result for E/W|pg||
nt|paulhac: That will be 2 on the trot will N/S be reeling?|pg||
nt|cindy:  would you dbl second time with E hand or 3N ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is 16+ bal ? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and i don;t think it is clear at all that E would bid 6C over 5D every time he has club king. what if his spades are ATxxxx and he has no shape? and maybe E thinks the point of 5D ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was especially to fetch a much more convenient HEART cuebid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, seen - 15/17|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Better than the one onthe last board :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: either club finesse or heart break but it wont fight today|pg||
nt|frm: Yes two chances. Hearts 3-3 or @C-finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahh: this has better chances than 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good fro roland|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not a good board for Scotland|pg||
nt|lestergold: peter completed|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzpf: Ups|pg||
nt|cindy:  has a chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not keen on 3N with only one ace and non-flexible heart stopper|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: goodbye vienna|pg||
nt|othered1: Both north and south are at the top of the range for their actions, but I'd prefer south's redoubling 2@D to get across the extra values, not simply extra shape|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S might easily be on on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: will guess heart now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cindy:  should guess it|pg||
nt|cindy:  now she knows N has diamond ace should be easy to guess   and also S might have led a heart with Qx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also prefer 3H to 2H by N on first round, by a lot|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam doomed. if W opens a strong NT at other table, the final contract might well be 6C making|pg||
nt|henryb: this one should be less successful|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well 2nt was 14+ and UK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead beat|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: and off as someone predicted :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: copenhagen i mean|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 6s on the moysian has chances|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good switch - no chance fo a squeeze any more|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Strange doesn't W have 20 hcp?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes entry destroyed|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb: should make now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can't avoid making it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahh: running score 91 to 88 vps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond finesse comes next|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: UK is GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ty|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: By my counting = plus 2 10s and 2 9s. Far too good for 18-19 :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  as I say, 4@d was a codified reply to an asking bid, not some kind of repeat cue bid|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: so the effect of the negative double was to prevent them finding their 4-4 fit, with all the room in the world|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a great hand for NS's method|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps easier to guess, but not by that much since S is a passed hand and N has a lot of leeway. it's the non-heart lead that will drive the guess, and that does not depend on the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D ace|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes i agree  |pg||
pc|hT|nt|idc: bidding is contrary sometimes :)|pg||
nt|ahh: this closes game right up  getting exciting |pg||
nt|cindy:  just meant location of diamond ace was another potential clue|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Finesse in @c or @d|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Any fingers left, Jim?|pg||
nt|ahh: not sure its the negative double per se that did that |pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is the standard, invitational quantitative bid.  But @H9xx would preclude it for me, as I have an easy 1@d response|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5@C is where you want to be here, or even 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: this session the score is 19 all|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I agree, but he was lucky this time as 6NT was no go|pg||
nt|ady: an wasy 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i understand now. sorry, i was typing when that info was given|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in that case, surely W is worth 6C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: E/W are still talking about board 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E can make an asking bid, how could W not bid 6C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially when they have a sizeable lead so it is very likely slam will be bid in other room|pg||
mb|2H|an|8-11, 6+!H|nt|mariner1: 4@S EW?|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand e/w hav e plenty of long suits but its the4/4 spade fit that is i think their best spot for a game |pg||
nt|roswolf: relatively difficult for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy |pg||
nt|lestergold: the bidding could go pear shaped here very easily|pg||
nt|mafia13: Well, we are still waiting for those really big boards...|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w 4h straightforward hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Schou has begun to pull away in this set.  Time for NS to stabilize things.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Would you nt overcall as North?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: E bidding a @S here works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strongly disapprove of the opening lead. the auction makes it clear N has at least nine cards in the majors, and S does not have three entries. just lead a heart and hope.|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think S more likely to lead a heart if N had bid 3H ?|pg||
nt|mafia13: Schou is still picking up imps along the way though...|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs club behaviour but they behave|pg||
nt|lestergold: u mean comic nt?|pg||
nt|othered1: Easy, but weak NT can present problems|pg||
nt|ady: re-double commands 2@C I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: especially if east bids 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: not at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@H here will get to game immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: In other room, Scotland look to be beating 4@s - three rounds of @d to start|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, not this particular S. if he didnt lead a heart on this auction from this hand, probably he wouldnt lead one on any auctioin|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S said "sorry pd"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3NT a rather lucky make here|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3NT show a hand that would like to preempt, but has a good suit and perhaps a little extra and thus is afraid to bypass 3NT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy:  appropriate|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S: Semigood preemt|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wise decision by South not to bid 4@S as it would have been quite expensive this time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean 'not' (Must hit keys harder :))|pg||
nt|frm: I would not introduce my @S-suit with that lousy North-hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wow - I always bid spades, whenever I have them. What else are they for?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability it is not only dangerous it misleads partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak jump overcall possible but with the spade pips so bad that is dangerous at imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends on how dangerously u want to live|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: 2@S is cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should bid his 4 card major at first opportunity|pg||
nt|ady: I think 2@H now from north will clear the air|pg||
nt|dburn:  Sabine Auken remarked that she was not fond of Trelde asking bids, because they left you with no choice but to follow the system and respect your partner's decision|pg||
nt|dburn:  and I can see what she meant|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: and they found it|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a 4@D splinter was not out of placew|pg||
nt|othered1: don't you think south is underbidding, with a vul partner who's bid twice?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulhac: Interesting X|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South is checking the deck - a lot of good hands about|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A moment for discipline - forget the missed games|pg||
nt|paulhac: Will he be content with 3NT after the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it takes a big man to apologize. or maybe just a really bad lead LOL|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well he was prerpared to risk a reverse but on a ten count with a possible misfit it clould have been dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S and W was surprised that N had 7|pg||
nt|frm: You can take the risk and bid 2 @S (and later on you can take the blame, if it´s wrong)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahh: ROI still +4 v NI   so scotland just leading and no more |pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is interesting|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think acknowledging a mistake at the table helps the opponents at all ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@sX sort of gruesome, as is anything else|pg||
nt|lestergold: north found best lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead and west would have an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: should play club finesse and play to ruff a club high in dummy before drawing trumps tro allow for 4/2 break|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After bidding spades it is not tempting to lead them - another reason for bidding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt mater here as they are 3/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: but thats how i expect declarer will paly it|pg||
nt|othered1: I think north's raise was very aggressive, but he knows south better than I do.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but land on feet|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|mariner1: some times you have to stick your neck out|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: up with that pesky ace and play trump lose a club and one or two spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: win and run the J@S best here|pg||
nt|cindy:  i know the opps can feed off of a heated discussion at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it does a bit, perhaps, but it does a lot more good for partner than it does for the opps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idc: South had overcalled @d in other room, this is a tougher lead for North here|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats a good point|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb: 5@c is a MUCH better contract, and I think W should raise clubs over 3@s: partner must have only 2|pg||
nt|ahh: up to 3 imps is a draw |pg||
nt|roswolf: double from someone?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why E ran before getting doubled in 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now means 3/3 red|pg||
nt|ady: I think better for north to bid 2@H  2nd time round    would then be asy for south to raise to gaame|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in principle i agree totally. but surely over 3D, E has some bids that are NOT asking bids, otherwise the method is crazy. and so when E has CHOSEN  to make an asking bid, he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: couldnt possibly be off two aces AND the top two trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahh: so it cant really be any closer |pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulhac: Out of the frying pan.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will definitely be a minus score|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have very few thus far...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ideal is for N to head S apology off at the pass by saying the likes of "I would have made the same lead, pd"|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulhac: When North passed 2@D south should have backed off|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do not understand the logic of souths bidding - opposite 2 aces and the club queem he thinks slam is cold - wierd|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: North's hearts will be hard to promote|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cindy:  ahh|pg||
nt|cindy:  and then giving him hell later ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and then of course N is free to continue the sentence in his own head: "...if i had your brain, that is"|pg||
nt|cindy:  lolol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nice bid by East - immediatly 2@c don't work|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: rbl and after 2@c give the information to have 4 cards in other suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh now he doesnt need tghe ruff|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|idc: Victor Silverstone in spec has made the same point Henry, quite right too|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H to A and another @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: and make the rest|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry minus a club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: before the auction i was wondering if NS would get to game, and instead EW did :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: Looks like a nice hand - but if North habitually opens this tripe you have to be careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 making|pg||
nt|othered1: alternative to double at these colors might be for north to take major suit action immediately, but that's not clear.|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think that is best in the long run|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahh: i think i am right if both teams finish level then NI win on the tie break|pg||
nt|idc: I have the regulations open, will check but I expect you are right|pg||
nt|lestergold: or the risk of the finesse|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahh: @C back now hurts dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: and north could have only 1 ace!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 90, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 82, IRELAND  72, CBAI 72, WALES 42 ****|pg||
nt|henryb: best defense probably beats this 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sweet little cross-ruff?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: oh well 4 now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most of us are headed for hell anyway, no need for partner to provide a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N is a friendly pd|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Playing 14-30 that would be good :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder why he played a spade? I fancy drawing trump and conseding a trick to @CK|pg||
nt|cindy:  well...W knows where the @dK is    is there any other play but a low club ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  not that it really matters where the @dK is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: ? not a good view|pg||
nt|lestergold: decided to pin notional 9 spades in south hjand|pg||
nt|lestergold: making 4 kis an ok resulot they did well to find the 4s contract in the first place|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade was a guess not a bad play|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good play by S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: why ask for a club back?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can play @s knowing East don't have card to discard|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can play like seeing all cards now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: In case of the 4-1 break he is belatedly worrying about|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he must have had the passing thought that the ten of clubs was singleton playing north for 5 clubs along with the long spades- i suppose not impossible but i agree otherwise ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: play doesnt make sense|pg||
nt|frm: Now he must play for the @H 3-2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: and then he would need the Ks to discard a club possibly play shouldnt cost but it looks absurd|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: @S10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt seem that way|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: But she won't cover|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugraphzpf: A short coffeebreak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N/S talks about 4@sX 1100|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: seam correct|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since NS could not quite make 4H, they were right to defend this contract doubled instead of bidding the heart game :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW must hope their NS pair play in 3NT, for a small EW loss|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, no particular reason why East-West should not end up in something doubled at the other table|pg||
