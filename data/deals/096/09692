mb|p|mb|p|nt|asnuttyas: NS got a little too high in CR|pg||
nt|bobholl: equally high here but not doubled|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whatever 2@S is, it looks sensible opposite a passed partner|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H promised a little something - if 2NT would have been Lebensohl|pg||
nt|bobholl: it should otherwie 4@H is questionable|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: 4@H pushy here it seems from Bakhshi|pg||
nt|bobholl: otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: i would guess it has to, yes, otherwise 4@H was a very happy bid indeed|pg||

nt|sn00py27: some play that 2NT in that position is a choice of 2 places to play rather than leb|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would have thought so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not a Lebensohl situation in my book|pg||
nt|bobholl: you always can bid a bad 3@H after that also :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sn00py27: if 3@H was values they were rather skimpy values :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: yes, i like to play that the default for any 2NT bid in response to partner's double is scrambling...and then you just agree specifically which ones are good/bad|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: because you want to scramble more often|pg||
nt|jbgood: depends on the author, Roland, but agree that 2 NT for "pick a minor" is also fine|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that even if 2NT was scrambling here, 3@H can still be constructive, because with a weak 3@H bid you can go 2NT and then bid 3@H anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so you can get the best of both worlds when you happen to want to play in the highest denomination|pg||
nt|jbgood: if you use 2 NT for minors, then 3 @h would either be weak or constructive from responder - according to agreement|pg||
nt|bobholl: we still don't know wheather this goes -1 or -2 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't go less than 2 down|pg||

nt|asnuttyas: passing 2@C would be very wet|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: of course you would prefer to have 3 spades for the double, but it's usually going to work out OK|pg||

nt|jbgood: and right he was|pg||
nt|athene: partner will bid 2@H rather than 2@S with 4@S-2@H, probably|pg||
