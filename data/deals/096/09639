nt|athene: and if partner doesn't have a little something - 3nt one down on a heart lead might be a great score against 4major making by E-W|pg||
nt|athene: west has a problem now|pg||
nt|athene: he has lots of points and can see that the deal "belongs" to his side|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: but 3nt might roll home (heart stop and a million clubs)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so he doesn't want to double|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was a big risk butcaught a great dummy|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: bidding a 5-card suit at the 4-level looks foolhardy but west just didn't have any safe action and it was quite likely that his partner had a few spades|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: even if declarer doesn't get the hearts set up, north will get squeezed in the red suits anyway, so 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@S plays well EW here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|thegarve:  lebensohl 2NT from South ?|pg||
nt|xenya: from now onwards, we will have comparisons|pg||
nt|ady: Jagger in   with system bid for majors     - can make 2@H if they stop there|pg||
nt|thegarve:  West will bid up to at least 3@h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: running a bit behind schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 3N here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|finch: with good card reading, West can make 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|xenya: doesn't a @D lead beat 3@H?|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 2 level difficult for n/s|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: careful makes the 3N on any lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|thegarve:  IN the orther room - NOrth somehow stole 1NT+1|pg||
nt|finch: 3@C was forcing, I imagine, otherwise 3NT was a tad optimistic|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: goodcase for passing, holding the @HQ, but I think West will bid 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, he has :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: around the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of pressure on declarer, as he will have a god idea the @SK is wrong - so he won't want to lose two trump tricks |pg||

mb|1C|nt|athene: and north might perhaps double|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|athene: 3@H was quite aggressive|pg||

nt|athene: so even if he guesses clubs right, that's still one down, losing @S@S@D@C|pg||
nt|athene: you would expect him to misguess clubs quite often, playing the opener for the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but here he might get it right|pg||
nt|athene: basically east turns up with @SAK, @DK, @HJ|pg||
nt|athene: now if he had @CA that would give him a 1nt opener|pg||
nt|athene: this is quite a common theme in card-reading|pg||
nt|athene: if an opponent opens 1minor, playing standard methods (i.e. strong NT)|pg||
nt|athene: then what he has, most of the time, is a weak NT|pg||
nt|athene: that's your first assumption anyway|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: now @D10 ruffed, @HKQ, and club to the @CK, i predict confidently :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course west might go in with the @CA to be sure of taking the setting trick|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mariner1: not sure I believe Open made 6 there :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores it seems here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: EW can make 3NT on this layout, but they are unlikely to get there|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N very aggressive call from E with his 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems he is looking for the 8th and 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And it's very unlucky anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need @S6 as an entry to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: may not get a spade lead on this bidding, mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: I see 8th, 9th will be harder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: *lucky I meant to say|pg||
pc|dA|nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT is certainly a better spot that 5@D|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: sure seems E owes W a @S raise here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have tried one more spade there |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think over 2@H was needed as well|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, East might have done, with three trumps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|finch: while we are results-merchanting, East could have not opened a nasty 12-count with 3 jacks|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: east doesn't really have a game-force, if you use the losing trick count|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: but i doubt that will stop him with 12 hcp and 4-card support for partner's major :)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can get his @D4 away on a heart but the club spots mean he has to lose two tricks there|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: spade to @S10, cash @HAK, then run trumps, and north is doomed|pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes agression is paying off for NS mainly because EW are not that aggressive|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|ady: looks like 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  penalty shootout in the FA Cup semi final Man U v Everton, no goals at extra time|pg||
nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
nt|mariner1: so did not find the 8th then|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggression|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS have 6@H if they can find it|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the easiest bidding|pg||
mb|4S|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I missed a car, they have 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS playing inverted majors to 1@D? |pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW even find it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: card|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S good spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c hook off stops 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 1@S shows a 1N call|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows hearts in their methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, 1@D-1@h=spades and 1@d-1@S=hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: some use 1N as 4+ @S and 1@S and a 1N call to put the 1N in opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: no alert so its hard to tell which it is Mike :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Roland knows it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's the advantage of that, Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E may be pickled here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did not need much for slam......|pg||
pc|d3|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: again aggression goes to the front for NS|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: well NS can beat 4@S however it is not their top spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: a defense slip can allow 4@S also|pg||
nt|granguru: very unprobable|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: well, they may or may not play sound opening bids, and North might have risked a move anyway, but as I say, it wasn't obvious|pg||
nt|finch: Carol Cautious, surely?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

nt|athene: it's better to do it right away|pg||
nt|athene: because north might well not cover then, thinking you have maybe @CA109x in hand and are just trying to smoke out the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: so you can often bring in @C10xx / @CKJxx when you shouldn't theoretically be able to|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East was a bit too passive there.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: one problem with those type calls is they become considerably less effective as|pg||
nt|mariner1: the level of opponents increases......... they need to be fit well into the overall|pg||
nt|mariner1: structure of a system|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should force more in @D here than in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mariner1: EW are finding out if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of tournaments and|pg||
nt|mariner1: have flat hands............|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial EW.... game off best defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|4+!s 10-11p|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has no reall attractive call here,,,,,,, I do not particularly like 1N with KQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, all calls seem to have one or more major flaws|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike do you like the 1N? (2@C regrettable @c might be my call)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so EW must play some sort of forcing @c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with KQ stiff, and 2@C should really be a better suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes NS, hard to bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: and has to play @D the only way that works|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what do you bid with S over the 1@S?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: perhaps this is the unbiddable hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||
pc|sT|nt|finch: 3NT may not immediately appeal, but you have to compare it with the thought of playing 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: now a club should hold it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|granguru: But E can also go for the @CJ  finesse which is bad this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT from top|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: 2@C is regrettable to me...... just no other good calls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 3@S seems a bit chancy|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: although maybe 1NT is just practical bridge - I have x-y points and a spade stop |pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: operator says 1@D has different meanings based on position|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: and since S can see 4@C in dummy he will pitch a @H allowing 7 if declarer sees|pg||
nt|mariner1: it that way|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking if I consider 2N unusual with S, yes I do NV, the problem here is|pg||
nt|mariner1: RED you have no way to assess N's strenght and will pay a high prices if wrong|pg||

nt|mariner1: and PASS are not options|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2@D multi, showing a bad weak two in a major or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: good save by wales in OR  5@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should get to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  West is unlikely to save looking at least 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear to save over it - that West hand has some defensive prospects|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: looks cold in fact with the pointed Aces set right|pg||

nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rob |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: think South will have to get to 4@S herself|pg||
nt|dburn: so the Welsh West, Jean Hand, took a pretty good decision|pg||
nt|thegarve:  if she passes 2@s it would only be 50s - an old ploy|pg||
nt|finch: at the other table West guessed well, although I don't think that weak two was a 'bad' one|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S off, @H off, at lead @c are 3 3,,,,,, @D could be worse|pg||
nt|mariner1: has no real choice I think and the 3@D call helps define the play|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|finch: 5@H more of a 2-way shot, could collect x AQxxxx Qxxx xx and make on a good day|pg||
nt|dburn: no saves now - Seale adopting more of a Manchester United approach than an Everton approach to saving|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in N I think|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
