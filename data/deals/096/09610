pc|d7|nt|garnetts: Oddly 4NT is the worst action because it gives up on the possibility that 4@S was going off--that is double might work better--but of course pass is best|pg||

nt|fifee: if 4@S were making that is|pg||

nt|garnetts: 4@S should be off|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: looks like another easy 3N|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: Hard hand for east here--would love to pre-empt--but surely the wrong shape unless it shows hearts and a minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: welcome all! hope the technical probs have been sorted out|pg||
nt|panja: it seems they do...|pg||
nt|fifee: muideburg style hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT makes for NS|pg||
mb|2S|nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|fifee: now Karakolev is showing long @Ds|pg||
nt|garnetts: 500 best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: 6NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: lead singleton|pg||
nt|fifee: 6nt wont make|pg||
nt|garnetts: agreed unless west covers the Q@C |pg||
nt|fifee: unless East does not lead a @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: probably make ten tricks for another flattie|pg||
nt|fifee: right David|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: this is not a good bid by west surely|pg||
nt|fifee: Popov frustrated with all his values|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkv: yes, they do.|pg||
nt|panja: this will be an interesting 3Nt|pg||
nt|olson: S will be endplayed at trick 1  into giving up a trick  |pg||
nt|panja: South must avoid a Club lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Andonov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: East must be something like he is with longer diamonds so this makes no sense--if east is forced it will hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Bulgarian CS's semi, 2x20 boards|pg||
nt|wwalter: this could be expensive :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|olson: the best lead  is spade J  but this is impossible  |pg||
pc|c3|nt|fifee: 6@C is on |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure I would move as South---partner is almost marked with four hearts--otherwise west would have raised over 2@H |pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Friederike from Germany|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not bothering with dim finesse make more maybe|pg||
nt|fifee: east did well not to push them to 6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also agree that 6@C will make --should make even --maybe North should bid it|pg||

nt|maribelxx: Tervehdys kaikille!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: well, @S8 or 6 will work fine|pg||
nt|olson: both D and H leads  pick up those suits|pg||

nt|maribelxx: Lupasin hetken teitä häiritä :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|panja: ideally, the 6/5 rather|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kippari: jaossa 1 Arttu sai kaikki tikit seifti-pelinviennillään,hyvin pelattu|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|olson: declarer  has some work  to do|pg||
nt|panja: North should have ducked @HQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|olson: D a  play makes  it easy now|pg||
nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|fifee: with such a square hand, I would not bid 6 with north hand either on this auction|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: with four aces and the spade finesse marked ?|pg||

nt|lestergold: will make the rest i think|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|olson: ducking H Q  is best  since  N knows  H  4/2  and  declarer  has the  K|pg||

nt|djneill: I wonder if Kucinskas upgraded this hand, or if they play a special 1N overcall of a Polish @c, because in standard, simply doubling and rebidding a cheap NT would show about 19-21|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defence should stay with @D but they nearly always switch|pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot see any point is cashing the A@C |pg||
nt|fifee: dummy reversal the easiest line from here. sluffing the @S9 and ruffing a @S to establish the suit|pg||

nt|baldfriede: 9@d makes the day.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: sure :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a break from the monotony of 3n|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jon Sveindal from Norway|pg||
nt|panja: well, I should think that without @SA with West......there is simply not 3@S bid|pg||
nt|olson: E needs to count to 4 winners  to  beat the hand  and he knows  they are not getting a club  |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks a bit like 2@S all pass to me|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: a thin 4s looking like it shouild make if they bid it|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: this is another interesting hand..NS are missing 3 Aces..|pg||
nt|kippari: 3x3NT aloitettu|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tikkimäärä on laskussa|pg||
nt|kippari: tikit vähenee peli peliltä|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|sybarra: E may back in later? or wil S bid 5 @D?|pg||
nt|wwalter: good was not in red :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Jon :)|pg||
nt|panja: 26 HCP..they will just about make 3Nt because SQ is in|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tosin nyt taitaa olla paljon tikkej|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: ä|pg||
mb|4S|nt|danilo1: eventual overbid by West or East may be dangerous ... slam may be tried by partner than|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: But if they bid 3nt it's unlikely to be monotonous.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim |pg||
nt|lestergold: true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 16 seems ok for a srtong 1 @c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the spade fit land dim singleton with east makes this and an unlikely candidate for 3n|pg||
nt|danilo1: as it is happening ... East will probably try slam now|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the drawback of the multi--North should double now I think--partner is marked with spade length|pg||
nt|garnetts: IF west started with 2@S I doubt North would bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: South must deceide between pass and 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass looks a better bet as it is almost certain to go plus|pg||
nt|fifee: or 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4 tricks in @H, 3 in some minor, two in @S...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: this can be -1   |pg||
nt|panja: of course he could steal one more in other minor..|pg||
nt|fifee: likely to be some ruffing at a suit contract|pg||
nt|kippari: tässä luulisi silti riittävän|pg||
nt|maribelxx: virolaisilla on omansa, siellä merikotka jo pesii http://www.looduskalender.ee/en/node/2909|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: quickly or slowly |pg||
nt|wwalter: thay play prec, so under 15|pg||
nt|jbgood: som spade contract coming up? 4 is good - but the club split and the spade loser makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|garnetts: He will probably place his partner with four hearts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|danilo1: well, ad only 1 more Hcp (@CA instead K) and ... lay down (could be even 7)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand has tlo be managed competently to ensure ten winners|pg||
nt|santyclz: I hate to lead the suit of a splinter, but everything else looks worse here.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ristit vähän vinossa|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: with ace of dims onside that should not prove to be too much of a problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with the lead!!|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: no -2 if the carding is read well |pg||
nt|mmmakela: could've been -2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice of lead--it is usually considered best when you have a trump stack to lead a long suit to shorten declarer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: mind you every lead would help dclarer ex cept for a tump|pg||
nt|danilo1: maybe same lead in 6 :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: even so 12 tricks :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: not pleasant time for South now ... any card may be trick now ... |pg||

nt|kippari: kuka voittaa tarjoussarjan tässä|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: W might enter the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might open that N hand with 1 @H |pg||

mb|2D|nt|danilo1: opps ...srry, @S ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: this time 3 nt may make if they get there on the scattered values|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S will be a good spot here....|pg||
nt|panja: depends on @C guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|baldfriede: Goddess beware; definitely not a good idea to go for 6@d.|pg||
nt|lestergold: probbaly well settle in 4h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or he may try 3nt.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d we can see veryhazardous even ith favourable lie of red suit honours|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3 @s seems ok|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@D alerted is?|pg||
nt|danilo1: tr. @H, thanks|pg||
nt|wwalter: 4@c-4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: the vulnerability may induce them to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and after pd's 1 @S 2 @C?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Boian Halachev from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ppilot: hi all|pg||
nt|wwalter: hi Boian|pg||
nt|danilo1: I thk South should produce one more bid - probably 3@H, partner's 3@C was free bid|pg||
nt|ppilot: if peichev bids will drive them to vulnerable game:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|danilo1: Good morning Boian|pg||
nt|kaapo: Avaus 2@C olisi molemmat ylävärit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: good desision|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is better than 6@c , down :)|pg||
nt|panja: they need to find out @D weakness though, and typically, methods tell you only about Major controls|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normally that would show Dummy's first bid suit--and a decent hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tweety1: so that N can describe his hand better|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder if 2 NT would be forcing?|pg||
nt|olson: will depend on lead|pg||
nt|panja: not enough HCP for Nt, and @D suit open...still bidding does not seem out of the world...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm is this a serious stop?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess there is only 9 tricks in spades as well|pg||
nt|olson: chance for a pickup  now|pg||
nt|panja: and now...where should @CQ be placed..|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten Mirme joutuu avaamaan 1@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: communications dire apart from the pade weakness|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade weakness|pg||
nt|tweety1: with AJ in @s, S chose to bid 3nt which is not a bad option.|pg||
nt|ppilot: anyway at the other table they might bid 5 he sacriface so win 2 imps:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nothing wrong with souths bid- everything wrong with north's accdeptance|pg||
nt|danilo1: Guess they would not try 6@C ... West's bid over Dble is probably @S shorth|pg||
nt|panja: % is for E to have it..|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: declarer should play club K  since  the 4/1 split onside can be picked  up  |pg||
nt|panja: you assume he has 4 @D at most..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or then 1 nt?|pg||

pc|h4|nt|garnetts: Excuse me thought i was answering a private question|pg||

pc|hA|nt|kaapo: Mutta voimaa on vähän liikaa|pg||

nt|baldfriede: The @d allow somed communication, but not after playing 10.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Rob :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: it is a very lame and wounded chicken|pg||

nt|rhelle: nobody can make much|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might prove hard for NS--pass  2@H or 2@S--not an easy choice|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: 6d on the NS cards looks like a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|tweety1: which cannot be bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: being endplayed for a vulnerable game hurts - especially when you could have avoided the endplay|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H a likely spot|pg||
nt|fifee: affter the 2@H overcall, seems easy from there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|tweety1: EW!'s @h intervention will encourage N  for slam I believe.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 5 or 7 hand, can they diagnose it?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to bid it, and off if K@d wrongsided.|pg||
nt|ppilot: dont think they will find clubs and if find at bad level|pg||
nt|danilo1: what should be 3@C by South? |pg||
nt|ppilot: now popov as i know him will try 3 nt:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 diamond means pass or corect|pg||
nt|danilo1: if so agressive both, Dble is even more dangerous|pg||
nt|ppilot: limit 3 diamonds and ready for more at clubs|pg||
nt|panja: South should simply bid 4@S....and he did..good|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes--I think I prefer 2@S to 2@H  if were going to bid--in practice I would pass i think|pg||
nt|kaapo: Magicin 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Yes--not the worse slam I have ever seen but the trump break makes things awkward--needs care in game |pg||
nt|fifee: the pre empt makes it hard to find though|pg||

nt|tweety1: 4 @d or 4@h ?|pg||
nt|ppilot: hard for popov now:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess so, 3@C would be also pass/corr ... thk enough to bid 3@C, after all, it is free bid|pg||
nt|wwalter: in the first 2 rounds they made 49 VP from a posible 50 :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wwalter: this is also strange|pg||
nt|olson: ew are playing  negative free bids   2h  was not forcing  |pg||

nt|lestergold: which is?|pg||
nt|tweety1: @ds like North:)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Another slam on a finesse.|pg||
nt|santyclz: well playing grand slam's inm part scores is not match winning bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh am i to be immortalised for that gem|pg||
nt|tweety1: i hope they will bid @ds right this time:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: interesting board|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice layout for a nonbiddable 6 @d|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland and Markku M. Mäkelä|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all!|pg||
nt|daman: they started early on us     |pg||
nt|kippari: jaossa 1 Kalma Maastik tarjosivat 6D=9 imppiä|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten ehkä Kauko tosiaan ei voinut kysyä ässiä|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: rare as nowadays|pg||
nt|santyclz: We might do some editting first.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: appears so|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fifee: 4@H makes |pg||
nt|garnetts: They will probably bid it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: @d 2-2, @c finesse right ... no such a great slam :)|pg||
nt|daman: most of the Bulgarians play precision|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: heading to 3 nt|pg||
nt|tweety1: strong club system is very common in Bulgaria I suppose.|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be a club system with that 1 @D opening |pg||
nt|mmmakela: my estimate is that 4xp with today's aggressive bidding happens maybe 1/200 deals about|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no slam played by south due to the heart ruff|pg||
nt|ppilot: 5 clubs 4 SPADE|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess 4@S Dbled ... not probable West will get chance to mention @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even only be 11 tricks..|pg||
nt|daman: so they open any 11 point hand 1@D|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might have been a reasonable spot for EW here..but the 51 break will kill it|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|tweety1: 2 KC out anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, you need to ruff 2@s and 2@c ... and after 2 rounds of trumps you have only 3 trumps left|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h is an interesting bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: so only 1 loser - but also only 11 winners:)|pg||
nt|olson: not ewnough  points  |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Yes, @h ruff will set it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sensible spot|pg||
nt|tweety1: good judge by N this time:)|pg||
nt|kippari: ja ylitikistä 1 lisää jaossa 2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 3n was fine too but dont blame north wanting top lay in dims|pg||
nt|daman: forced to rebid his 4 bagger :)|pg||
nt|panja: y..but xxxx @H opposite @HA...and @C body working|pg||
nt|olson: declarer would also need to pick up clubs  for  4 winners  and this is  anti %  |pg||
nt|olson: since the  diamonds  are  2  losers|pg||
nt|kaapo: @C tasan joten tässä ei liene suurta jännitystä|pg||
nt|kippari: väh. 9 tikkiä näkyisi löytyvän tästäkin jaosta|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: just in case there is a hole in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|jbgood: should really be a big takeout 3 @h|pg||
nt|daman: this contract will be tough to make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 min won't fair but 3 nt has chance|pg||
nt|panja: y, not enough strength to bid any game..|pg||
nt|panja: @DT from JT9..I guess it promises Jack..|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: needs to duck the 1st @s to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: as it can be seen luck is with the brave|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C by South is much better bid than 3@S ... he is limited in precision, and hand is very good, esp. since 1S should be 5+|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances....slim and none|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ppilot: wonder how much time this will last ? no duplication at all and still many stones to be made|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: good lead director bid, needs to duck 1st|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mmmakela: and guess hearts|pg||
nt|tweety1: and also 2-4 leads are common too.|pg||
nt|rhelle: ouch ... why didn't south introduce his @d?|pg||
nt|rhelle: clearly didn't get the meaning of 3@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange he didnt want to play the 9 card trump fit..|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with 3-lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll declarer will have a high blood pressure momwent shortly when he leads a dim from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think e will have at least a mini tank and then run the dim in any case|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kippari: ruutulähdöllä ne on syytä nopeasti ottaakin|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: next time someone will lead their singleton holding Kx dims!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: but if North ducks 1 round of @h, he should get a fair way here|pg||
nt|daman: now return a @H and duck|pg||
nt|daman: then it is 2 down|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Chance of a reverse Grovesnor Coup  here--drop the Q@H under the A@H --the grovesnor coup involves playing the Q from qJx to annoy declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|nt|tweety1: @h ace must be in S to make.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|olson: S should  switch  to the  Jack of H   |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: if N has a 2 suiter - she would have bid the second duit directly - I think - so she must have @d also. Perhaps a redouble of 3 NT would have made it crearer to S|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I think you're right, Jon|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe South thought that 3@h just showed a very strong hand, and after 3@c a monster 2-suiter|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c, sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a XX over 3NT would clear it up|pg||
nt|rhelle: now North has blocked the @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this really how the @d suit has been played? The 6?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to go well|pg||
nt|jbgood: depends on what team you are rooting for..|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... I am impartial, so I'm just looking from declarer's perspective|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I unserstand why. Is he going to try and cut down on @c ruffs by returning a trump, or trying to get declarer trump short?|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps he thinks that N is 6-4 in the blacks (as S may think too)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  afternoon|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tweety1: blocked|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tweety1: sure|pg||
nt|tweety1: who said @d ace is in S:)|pg||
nt|daman: the Garve   welcome  |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Congrats on the Camrose win. Great stuff!|pg||
nt|daman: Popov has decided to let them make this one|pg||
nt|panja: note that because Declarer will get forced, he will make only 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|olson: called a  surround  play  incase  declarer has  q  or  AQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|thegarve:  thanks went to bed at 5.00 am and had a huge bar bill|pg||

mb|d|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 1@d probably shows @hs, and greatly reduces the chance of n-s playing this in @ss.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|djneill: now standard is that South's X is penalty of @h (to expose a psyche), but they probably use jassem's treatment of advancing 1@c-(X) like a 1@c opening|pg||

mb|1D|nt|fifee: yes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ppilot: i will never bid 1 @H seems i have to improove my biding|pg||

nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - sry|pg||
nt|rhelle: unless declarer throws a @s by cashing 3 rounds of @h first|pg||
nt|olson: this now makes  |pg||
nt|fifee: wow :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: and 6H is frigid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rhelle: tricky game :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|tweety1: S was conservative |pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south was worth 4c over his pards response|pg||
nt|ppilot: with everything ok easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|danilo1: probable will make 9|pg||
nt|rhelle: hmmmmm ....|pg||
nt|jbgood: one forced spade ruff is enough to give defense 2 trump tricks in 5 @d - |pg||
nt|garnetts: You are kidding me :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure how South managed the double though|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: we say 'playing under the table' :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an absolutely throw against the wall infrangible 6H|pg||
nt|lestergold: just lose a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade takes care of im|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim|pg||
nt|fifee: his pd bid game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: I am surprised E didnt bid ..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  many would not play 2@d as natural - worked well here|pg||
nt|daman: most Bulgarians play precision|pg||
nt|daman: so 2@D might always be natural|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tweety1: N wld bid 4 @d  if S bid 4 'c.|pg||
nt|danilo1: anc @C now ... maybe even 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ppilot: if they bid with like that playing later agg me will tear us into pieses:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: but guess, since 1NT ... will play safety ... @S10 from the table|pg||
nt|thegarve:  wonder why so many play strong @c?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: asm soon as north shows sign of life south will drive there- i think this was lazy bidding bu south|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, it's all academic now. I fins South 2@h bid with 9 points in partner's suits very timid|pg||
nt|kippari: jos tää lupas ruutuja ja kortteja niin ...|pg||
nt|kaapo: Onkohan NS:llä Lebensohl käytössä|pg||
nt|kaapo: Jos on niin 3@D lupaa kohtuulliset kortit ja ruutuja|pg||
nt|kaapo: Huonoilla tarjottaisiin ensin 2NT|pg||
nt|kippari: piti tarjota 6Nt|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mmmakela: 3 spades makes w right guesses|pg||
nt|sybarra: that seems a bit too good for 2 @C doesnt it?|pg||
nt|ppilot: nothing dangerous so will make lot of trick 1 im is 1 imp why miss it:)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  in Bulgaria you could call it "natural" as so many play strong @c|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not, good sys playing teams|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they usually play the cards well|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to attribute fault to that lead..|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|olson: NS had 4 winners  on a non diamond lead  but the  lead  was somewhat normal  with 2 aces|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mmmakela: yes if 15 upper limit|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tweety1: two Qs damages the beauty of the hand:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think he showed at least 18-19 of his points.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|lestergold: e/wcarding what would east have played if he had held qH?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: but 6-4|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I don't understand the @dK either|pg||
nt|fifee: now down 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the play was poor as South is surely marked with the A@H |pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|ppilot: wow dont believe my eyes:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to be a happy contract with the @h not breaking|pg||
nt|lestergold: main thing about a spade lead is it gives east the entries needed to pick up the clubs and enjoy them too|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Rugby about to start Scotland v Ireland|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tweety1: hmm|pg||
nt|ppilot: now if double ilko will show graet feel about cards:)|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

nt|garnetts: this same scenario|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kippari: 9 tikkiä|pg||
pc|s5|nt|danilo1: is it forbidden in Bulgaria for North to have @S after 2@D Dble, Bojan?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|tweety1: Ivanove did great 5 C bid by the way|pg||

nt|ppilot: well done andony!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: I know W has a great hand,  but.....|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's what I meant with harder although the raise was BAD imo|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mmmakela: if pd's @C A had been @S K but...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-way traffic so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes tough set for Shato R |pg||
nt|mmmakela: and previous yet to be scored|pg||
nt|sybarra: next hand will be half way thru this set, so maybe worm will turn|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS even got away with that 5 @D -3 -300 as push|pg||
nt|tweety1: EW arguing? :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Israel going to final in White House junior tourney beating Italy in semis|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|tweety1: seems he will make it|pg||
nt|fifee: one of the hardest things to do is to put the last hand out of your mind and think only of this one|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ppilot: andonov tryed them after the kik to finish them and sucsess is with the brave|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: break now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree--but this time EW were hardly to blame--lousy contract which was always likely to make |pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
nt|fifee: when in doubt, always lead a @S?|pg||
nt|ppilot: J@S was best return to make declace cover|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes it was |pg||
nt|fifee: true but perhaps hard for west to read as well|pg||
nt|garnetts: Then duck the spade back|pg||
nt|ppilot: not so hard but who knows for us is easy seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to admit that it is hard to think of a good lead by west--I might have led a @D |pg||
nt|ppilot: i should lead one of major aces to have a chance to recover but cant say which one:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: but with any of them this time will do|pg||

mb|2C|nt|tweety1: hmm|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok 13-16|pg||
nt|tweety1: do EW play multi then?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1 @S must be 9-14 or alike|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 9-12|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: not multi|pg||
nt|tweety1: so how do they bid their weak 2s then pls?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes, it is getting more and more fashinable.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm i predict 3n by west down 1|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: weak|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: or spades|pg||

pc|sA|nt|danilo1: and poor West ... countein his @SK ... still, I agree with east's (unlucky) Dble|pg||
nt|ppilot: the other pair of ilko gains imp after imp on overtricks but need a lot of such hands to recover:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but probably a push|pg||
nt|jbgood: a question of cashing the spades|pg||
nt|daman: on a @C lead you need to find the @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: same in either contract|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must have been confident of 4-card @S not to investigate|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess play 4c majs|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed u have more time to explore in a heart contract not that declarer is likely t pick up enuf info to make the right guess|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@h is bettear as you can make a few discovery plays if @H are 3-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well must have had a friendly defence in open room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  make the @S guess straight way in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4h you will discover that south has the doubleton heart and u may therefore play south for three spades|pg||
nt|thegarve:  you can discover that south has KQ@C and did not open the bidding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a@d|pg||
nt|daman: a @C lead is the best|pg||
nt|lestergold: well jack of spades most likely to be placed on distributional considerations rather than as a high card placement|pg||
nt|lestergold: still all academical|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaapo: 4@H löytynee|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3-level I guess|pg||
nt|tweety1: dont think so:)|pg||

nt|lestergold: pure guess |pg||
nt|kaapo: NS:lla ei taida olla halpaa uhrausta|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: with the dim suit in dummy, there are limited defensive options|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defence have given themselves an outside chnace|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: wouldnt the 2 be better then?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h4|nt|lestergold: he has comitted himself to the right guess|pg||

nt|garnetts: The 9@S is right form us seeing and in with the odds too|pg||
nt|kippari: siis jako 4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ppilot: shall he make safety play of clubs or play for overtrick?|pg||
nt|daman: one-way finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: also it wouldn't have been right to bid 4@S without the 9@S would it?  :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|danilo1: safety is safety ... he does it |pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: probably because he was in dummy and that was the most convenient play|pg||

nt|ppilot: 6 hearts is makable but hard to bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard to make surely?  |pg||
mb|3D|nt|tweety1: yes specially W seems abondoned|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W should avoid getting too high here now that West has limited his hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 3n no problem if they reach it|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess they reach it now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now will bid it i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: well 29 left so only 2,1 imps per board|pg||
nt|ppilot: sure you are right|pg||
nt|ppilot: didnt see vulnerability|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: do we show our NT before we show our potential @S fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Declarer would have to establish a trick in @s to make 1nt here.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  .......proof [fill in the name of your favourite poor declarer]|pg||
mb|4N|nt|viren169: Maybe not!|pg||

nt|ppilot: sry this makes it easy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: but not the world's greatest contract in theory|pg||

mb|p|nt|baldfriede: I doubt E/W will land in game here.|pg||

pc|c2|nt|olson: looking at XX  in H|pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder since both teams dont need victory to continue next why they play with so many tactical bids and risky desisions?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ppilot: must be something personel or just ego:)|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|sybarra: 2 @C, pick another suit pard?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's hand is not everyone's idea of an overcall with  two qxx holdings|pg||

nt|sybarra: sorry I do not know the system|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a poor bid--why not 3@C which makes 4@H unmakeable on that lead |pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H may be hard to make with east holding 4 pieces|pg||
nt|fifee: tapping declarer from the beginning with a @C lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: exactly which is why 3@C was a better choice |pg||
mb|4H|nt|viren169: Now they will end up in the wrong suit...|pg||

nt|tweety1: that is really hard to make|pg||
nt|viren169: they should find Q@S is missing and only a 4-4 fit ending in 6@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c is a horrfiic bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: well they have arrived |pg||
nt|ppilot: good bids unhappy but let us see the lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: a@S here makes 4@H easy |pg||
nt|ppilot: that is why 3 clubs values +fit is better|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes I agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: but maybe it still gets beaten if a club swicth happens|pg||

nt|ppilot: but let us see the line he will chose|pg||
nt|fifee: @C now can tap declarer and in with the @D and tap again|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is still not happy about the next lead--a club is far from obvious|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 rounds of clubs ruf 2 spades discarding clubs from dummy and ace and diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: He expects his partner to hold four trumps for his bid--maybe five|pg||
nt|fifee: yes the @SAce killed defense|pg||
nt|kippari: 11|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: ha to lkose three dims or two dims and a ruff to go offin 2s?|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: N choice of bidding the clubs rather than double might get them to 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's 2h i assume non forcing!! not my idea of bridge|pg||
nt|jbgood: S might have bid 4@h on the way..|pg||
nt|ppilot: bad vuln :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: 5c a bit of an underbid with a stiff heart and a massive trick source|pg||
nt|thegarve:  bid 4@C - the suit below the one that you have - hear a 4@H response and ...play there|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n 3h artificial presumingly 2n asking 3h good suit poor hand or whatever they agree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S call by N|pg||
nt|fifee: agree :)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: niinpä, vaikuttaa siltä, että näemme suurimman osan myös englanniksi :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|viren169: Even opposite p[assed hand... I think 1@S is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I was slightly joking--but I prefer it to having too much defence |pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Tony Reus|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: hello |pg||
nt|sybarra: Tony|pg||
nt|starkist: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that lead could be costly if E plays for the holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Shato on scoreboard!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this vulnerability i find it ok|pg||
nt|viren169: Assuming 2@S is weak... it will be difficult for pd to judge later in the auction on other hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: east presumably said thx for the info i want to play 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s a little more awkward|pg||
nt|ppilot: needs just right guess of trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: A number of players play a more constructive weak two via a multi|pg||
nt|fifee: since @D break, should make with wrong guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: This time there is not much to tell West how to play hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: The best reason not open as South |pg||
nt|ppilot: cant make if misguess trump without defensive slip|pg||
nt|garnetts: will be tempted to lead a trump maybe?|pg||
nt|kippari: JJ sanoi että 8 sekä jaot 15,16|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so martin and george they are giving us loads of work to do|pg||
nt|ppilot: lool|pg||
nt|kippari: eikös tää mee nyt kotiin?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|ppilot: and partner seems to understand |pg||
nt|olson: d1  possible  with the  % play in spades  of  low to K |pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|garnetts: but will dec get it right|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that is hard|pg||
nt|ppilot: we may just wait to see|pg||
nt|garnetts: No point in doing a thing but taking a guess now |pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing will help|pg||
nt|garnetts: walk in defender's shoes is a heart from Jxx dangerous ?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: what about xx?  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|starkist: slam goes down on a finesse|pg||
nt|thegarve:  uderleading an ace through the strong hand is quite common and worked very well here|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this real or surresl?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hasn't cost|pg||
nt|garnetts: either way it is a sniffy lead |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|olson: they are leaving the  H ace  as  entry  to  take the spade finesse  back to the  Q109|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: might be over reaching here|pg||
nt|starkist: hope for @d lead? ;)|pg||
nt|starkist: @clubs foul anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 @C not 6 @H here if it wasn't that club break|pg||
nt|mmmakela: possible I meant|pg||
nt|starkist: @d finesse off so no|pg||
nt|starkist: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: it has cost declarer|pg||
nt|ppilot: i would rather be dummy than declare here|pg||
nt|garnetts: me too|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if clubs 3-2 and hearts 3-3 don't need dias hook in 6 clubs|pg||
nt|baldfriede: It certainly made things easier in @h.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: now kill that dummy dead|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hasn't cost tye defence |pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: some days,....just not your day |pg||
nt|starkist: no double|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u think he shouldc have pl;ayed ten of clubs?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  dummy is going to be cut off|pg||
nt|thegarve:  10@c was a desperate play in a desperate contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: dummy is dead and one day in the future n/s are going to enjoy lots of pretty little diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: 6N+1 on the last in the other room...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kippari: 10 imppiä +|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ppilot: this spoiled all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to X when thy might be able to run|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: 6 hearts needs always the diAS finesse|pg||
nt|starkist: to what on this bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's or for all he knows nt |pg||
nt|starkist: scardie cat :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Barantiev is thinking|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: -1?|pg||
nt|tweety1: just extending the pain:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: inching their way back |pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: N said that game is -1 and ... ok for all|pg||
nt|garnetts: poor defence is all one can say|pg||
nt|ppilot: may be he read his partners 2 of clubs like club holding?|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 of spade sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: look at the biddiing partner can have nothing|pg||
nt|ppilot: smal club was better anyway still needs guess:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: now i take my words back love to be declare wit such shift:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I sometimes think defenders panic--rely too much on partner's signal and not enough on the logic of the game|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here it was obvious that dec could not discard much on what ever spades he held--so lead another trump--let nature take its course|pg||
nt|garnetts: But West did do well to lead a spade as it created a diversion|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely west was badly at fault had no rweason to bid 4s|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: partner wass in control of the auction|pg||

nt|benislovas: yes|pg||
nt|djneill: since this is a normal 1N overcall in standard|pg||

nt|benislovas: so we have 18 imps margin before last 16 boards|pg||
nt|djneill: kind of weird, in the other room, a natural 1N overcall allowed East to double a 2@d transfer to @h, which got West into the action to force them up to 3@h|pg||

nt|thegarve:  maybe East should have bid 5@h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe east will be looking for a new partner|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i've heard Mike sing - like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: east with his ax of spade had no reason to bid at the 5 level|pg||
nt|olson: 3n for  3w|pg||
nt|olson: EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a wicked hand|pg||
nt|kippari: kattokaas joku|pg||

nt|thegarve:  sorry Mike am tone deaf|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|viren169: I was wondering if N would open this! |pg||
nt|olson: perhaps  W can bid  2n  to show  6c and a max  |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmmmmmm|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|olson: or 3c  is 6c and a minimum|pg||
mb|d|nt|ppilot: this may get them too high|pg||
nt|viren169: Now they will get too high...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N? without a spade stop?|pg||
nt|ppilot: happyly non vulnerable and not doubled:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad shot at this vulnerbaiity|pg||
nt|lestergold: only one off against cold 5C|pg||
nt|olson: hand is in the middle range for  11 - 15  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|tweety1: what wld N's 1nt over 1 'd mean by any chance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not if they finmd spade ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will perhaps find it against 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much space taken west with no aces or singletons is not bidding any sixes|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps pass (forcing) is debatable when you know prd doesnt have a positive hand?|pg||
nt|olson: now  easy  3n by W  and should make 4   or   5 on spade leads|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|viren169: pass... not an option opposite an opening!|pg||
nt|ppilot: i am amazed too good parnership understanding|pg||
nt|ppilot: nte good news is 4 spades cant be made too:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: East getting his own back from earlier |pg||
nt|kaapo: Moni väri on kiltisti tässä jaossa|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: fairly agressive |pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe they have a systemic meaning for a direct 1N over the 1@D (possibly short or|pg||
nt|mariner1: artificial not sure)|pg||
nt|jbgood: amazing - they dont play presicion they way I used to do - pass not forcing?|pg||
nt|lestergold: would they have beaten 5c? a heart lead and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  slam has play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u are tone deasf then how do u know i cant sing|pg||
nt|garnetts: club is best for sure |pg||
nt|kippari: täällä sanotaan että otettu valtit pois mutta onhan saatavissa 2 herttatikkiä|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but likely to make now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 18-20 N|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tweety1: so dbl  is instead of 1 nt then?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Maybe Raptor.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the DBL here probably shows @D lenght|pg||
nt|jbgood: E would be declarer - di is good enough - in on heart ace and a spade ruff|pg||
nt|daman: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|garnetts: clearly a singleton |pg||
nt|garnetts: unless playing low from xx|pg||
nt|ppilot: that is true they play small from xx|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have never though it was a good idea and now I know it isn't |pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe they should lead singletons with their left hand--that would do it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|starkist: 27 hcp|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I said that you sing like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: he couldnt sing|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Sinatra is my cat|pg||
nt|lestergold: not compared to Jose Carerras at any rate|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: hi all |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|tweety1: then 3 @s seeems an overbid|pg||
nt|viren169: It is a big call... |pg||
nt|viren169: They must have been having lessons from the Hackett boys!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this is also style playing light openings|pg||
nt|viren169: North will be very happy with the developments!|pg||
nt|olson: good swicth  to save an imp  |pg||
nt|olson: hi|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: Mind I think it would need to be alerted |pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 hands diif:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is the end of the defence |pg||
nt|ppilot: and if 4 spades are deffended well not big win|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to choose between the lines...|pg||
nt|viren169: best not to touch the trumps just yet|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: of course im asleep|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: needs the 9th somewhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s very easy espcially on that lead prob make 6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|baldfriede: Really @h discard?|pg||
nt|mariner1: only the @D break beats 4@S here|pg||
nt|olson: s  played  W  to hold a spade stopper and knew  6c  and  2d|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed it gives declarer a small problem|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S did come in freely and N does have good hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: well maybe 5 6 maybe too much work|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: maybe lightner  double for a spade lead!li|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold:  cash club ace cross ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c2|nt|viren169: Declarer will not know the @Hs are 3-3|pg||

nt|viren169: interesting if the heart had lost to the T... |pg||

nt|garnetts: I would reopen but not if partner thought first |pg||
nt|ppilot: may be they are doing it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: any possibility of a slow pass being queried?|pg||
nt|ppilot: if he bids only 3 his partner will kill him:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: why on earth would anyone do that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: can anyone X?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: D Q 6 blacks, DA-D|pg||
nt|thegarve:  pressure|pg||
nt|olson: depends  if  N  has  2n  availa ble as a scramble  bid  after  second  double|pg||
nt|olson: always  lucky when  N guesses the 4 card suit to bid  that south has  4 of :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may survive this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I would too :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tweety1: this will hurt EW a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the DBL certainly seems to be working here|pg||
nt|ppilot: unfortunately hard to find diamond lead to make this game hard here|pg||
nt|viren169: b|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that 1NT by South would have bought the contract |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: compression pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they m ay simply cash the first 7 tricks here|pg||
nt|daman: Played the @D J to protect his @S holding and it blew up in his face|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mmmakela: made now|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defending like that better not X |pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if something can go wrong for W it has happened during this match, poor guy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I gotta go too, ty all and have a nice weekend!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have all been there (or at least I have) |pg||
nt|daman: might happen here too   but not down as many|pg||
nt|lestergold: need a very long neck to get this rite|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an ability to see thru screens to x ray vision|pg||
nt|daman: a peek is worth 2 finesses|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rubbedr necks do help|pg||
nt|olson: this can be set  if defenders  lead  clubs  after  spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south resist temptation?|pg||
nt|olson: he should  |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rado: at other room W played 4@H but again no @D lead and easy 11 tricks claiemd after @S lead|pg||
nt|olson: only 6 winners   and  4d  takes  10 tricks  to get a plus score|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|olson: plus he  expects  3s  is going  down  |pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: just because of the heart break|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: curtains|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jbgood: must be some special treatment of puppet |pg||
pc|c3|nt|tweety1: dbl is single suiter |pg||
nt|mariner1: so they play something like DONT over the 1N forcing|pg||
nt|tweety1: yep|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yep, seems like it.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|viren169: good duck|pg||
nt|thegarve:  in theold days the wisened pro used the cigarette and drink trick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: 3@h usually shows a five card suit |pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: and not much of a swing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: will only lose 2   they will be relieved |pg||
nt|thegarve:  cigareete on table to the left and drink  on the table to the right - so coukd lean over botyh sides |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|viren169: Now @D|pg||
nt|viren169: but still 10 tricks...|pg||
nt|ppilot: yes ace adn new diamond |pg||
nt|viren169: all routes end in 10/11 tricks for declarer...|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best to exit with the trump...|pg||
nt|ppilot: then 11 taking safe side spade fin|pg||
nt|viren169: true...|pg||
nt|rado: every imp might be precious since the results among first 4 teams stand for next stage of the finals|pg||
nt|lestergold: three off intead of five off only fifities|pg||
nt|daman: 2 IMPs apart with 3 to go in this set|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: eventually someone will try @c|pg||
nt|tweety1: actually i didnt like E's 1 @h here.|pg||
nt|ppilot: 11 now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|danilo1: Scan see 10 to 11 tricks, depending on @S guess ... actually 11 trick as safety is to keep south aut of lead , also after @D and @D (N does not have trump exit too|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tweety1: @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S sure seems obvious|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tweety1: W will be squezed soon|pg||
nt|tweety1: if ducks @s now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Then it is 3 down.|pg||
nt|mariner1: if he ducks he gets no more tricks|pg||
nt|tweety1: he wont duck|pg||
nt|tweety1: anyone bets?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is certainly considering it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cQ|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here.........|pg||
nt|ppilot: interesting board|pg||
nt|thegarve:  at the bar last weekend - Mike asked for a pint of leffee beer - they wouldn't sreve them in pints (too strong) so David asked for two halves on his beahlf ...the staff looked confused|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is surely weak!|pg||
nt|roswolf: but n/s should still bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a rank overcall at red|pg||
nt|ppilot: 4 spade looks makeble but with very careful play|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mariner1: S passing my stop that from happening|pg||
nt|mariner1: may|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably game forcing|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat 11 count--yuck |pg||
nt|garnetts: likely to get 4@H now|pg||
nt|jurekk: .|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 2@C precision style 5+ clubs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ppilot: another light opening we have lot bidders here|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting how E/W were able to play 3@D after a strong 1@C opening...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well after the recent excitement we can have a coffee/ beer for martin break+|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a flat hand    |pg||
nt|garnetts: AS specs are asking what should South do--one word --PASS|pg||
nt|ppilot: i will pass too but here they try to kill each other|pg||
mb|d|nt|tweety1: is this the final segment or?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing @H? or @D and @H?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@d is transfer to @h.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north must feel like bidding and has struck oil|pg||
nt|roswolf: now north must resist going on|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h goes down on a club ruff - but no ruffs in 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well so much for shoving by anyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: eggsacterly|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks mostly like suicide so far |pg||
nt|ppilot: this can be made too:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: if club lead|pg||
nt|ppilot: let us see if karakolev passes:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|thegarve:  alcohol free zone today|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of course Martin|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever|pg||
nt|thegarve:  honest guv|pg||
nt|thegarve:  been in worse slam than this|pg||
nt|daman: West won't reach opposite a passed hand I would think|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland would be in this for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is routine really|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tweety1: south is walking at the edge of cliff:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: wronghanded now |pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@c cue seems in order|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tweety1: no blood|pg||
nt|daman: Roland would be in 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: and so may they!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and theyll make it too|pg||
nt|ppilot: lool|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: south wont be too happy until he finds out the club position|pg||
nt|ppilot: it looks like boxing :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I would employ the duck and jettison coup here---East should duck when West throws his cards at him|pg||
nt|ppilot: why pass at 4 clubs doubled when you can play 5 doubled???|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: saved by E |pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt look sadly if there is any legit play for 3n now|pg||
nt|jbgood: pity S didnt bid 2 @s - then a chance of N being declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4 spades to q, south may have felt that it was his place to bid the no trumps- its not unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it would be a match winner now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|danilo1: @H lead beats 4@S ... sa oftern, West opening bid is mal-treatment of system|pg||
nt|viren169: probaly die out in 3@H|pg||
nt|ppilot: 4 has a play but on open kards|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes going Martin|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rkb it seems|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tweety1: 2 @dx cld be  -2 on 'c lead= 500 EW|pg||
nt|starkist: easy double|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|danilo1: not only , but indicated to play @CQ ... for 10 Dble |pg||
nt|ppilot: what a struggle for 2 imps|pg||
nt|jbgood: but S might have bid NT next time if prd doesnt over 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) now he is happy|pg||
nt|roswolf: well what is he thinking about?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: East isn't supposed to have the hand he has    they are supposed to open with any 11 and he didn't    sooooo trying for a salami doesn't wash with me|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh excitment no coffe break after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: no more silly predicitons todaty|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now its find the q@d on a @c lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim is to way but hell do it the simple conveneient way|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: Forquet said that was his lifelong dilemma    finding a missing Queen|pg||
nt|thegarve:  J@S leadwould suggest an honour in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: belladonna had no problem- u know the story about thyem putting th queen in both hands|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|daman: but I.m sure you will tell us|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: (oops sorry)  but "we" thought they did well to beat 3 @C |pg||

pc|dA|pc|s8|pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has to find 3 discards of course|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose the defence was the same |pg||
nt|sybarra: somewhat similar yes |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|thegarve:  clues about q@d|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|tweety1: NS is playing a sort of transfering system on overcalls.  The transfer everything:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: and west too|pg||
pc|cK|nt|viren169: West playing pd for QT of @Cs|pg||
nt|ppilot: 170 now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: yes S convative yet reasonable pass and W's 2@C call slowed this down both ways|pg||
pc|c6|nt|thegarve:  pressure told|pg||
nt|daman: will make this now|pg||
nt|lestergold: all room for clever stuff now out of the window|pg||
nt|daman: the defenders needed to cooperate     didn't happen|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this is a good example of why you do not make a passive lead versus a slam where declarer has a long suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will be thinking on the discards that the dim q is wrong and will breath the bighgest sigh of relief of all time when the q shows up|pg||

nt|baldfriede: strong hand*|pg||

nt|danilo1: has been allways 170 (or 620) ... actuallly, EW lucky that South had 4 Hcp in wrong suits ... so did not jump to 4|pg||
nt|skorchev: on a 20 board match, 18 imps difference converts to 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: no allowed declarer a cake walk|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very slow one admittedly|pg||
nt|daman: oh well   fortune favo(u)rs the bold    and the bold just picked up 11IMPs to take the lead with 2 boards to go |pg||
nt|ppilot: no he always blame his partners|pg||
nt|ppilot: he now i suppose explain as 2 way double pass or stay:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I understand that--but there are times when you should make an effort to ensure personal safety |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: well this board aint gonna reverse that lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have no doubt that partner should pass--in which case he clearly would not save|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the weak NT in Open worked well here|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W could get into trouble now...|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the penultimate board in this room, and I want to thank the Bulgarian Bridge Federation and Stan Nedkov for letting us watch these interesting team matches. |pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: with west opting to upgrade his hand to a 1 club opener e/w may well reach a very thin 3n which may hVAVE CHANCES|pg||
nt|jbgood: And a big hand to our excellent operator, well done Silvia Isaeva!|pg||
nt|ppilot: hope atleast one flat board?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This does not play that easily |pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: let us see if they reduce or increase 2 boards left|pg||

nt|lestergold: didnt mean to press capitals|pg||

mb|4S|nt|jbgood: also thnk you Mike Gold, England, for devoting time to guide us through these hands:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@H probably used as catch all not promising @H though no alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East will be happy until he sees dummy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east ahsnt accepted it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: S will play 1 nt dbled|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a straightforward auction but the play might not be so straightforward|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: a guaranteed swing in one or other direction now|pg||

pc|s8|nt|tweety1: thats why E shld have dbled, at least for @d lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: not tragedy ... will grabble 6-7 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: There must be a temptation to take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: that may not allow dec to take advantage of a favourable @D position |pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: though a red suit lead would have been kinder to S|pg||
