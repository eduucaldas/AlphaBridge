mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: hi all|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Roger Bryant|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|april7: good afternoon everybody|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: names n/s please?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that was predictable|pg||
nt|ady: an old fashioned sequence  go to 4@H  nice and quick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|thegarve:  opposite a limited 1@h opener you could bid 4@h and lure an unsuspeting West in|pg||
nt|werge: Is 3 @H forcing or pessimistic?|pg||
nt|athene: what do you do if partner bids 5@H over his 4@S? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed a cunning plan!:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: give up your 2@H and @c and out|pg||
nt|thegarve:  he does not he bids X saying I want to bid on|pg||
nt|athene: right the Zia double|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H shows this to me......... highly invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes declarer's play should be straightforward|pg||
nt|thegarve:  we use it all the time|pg||
nt|roswolf: price will take his time|pg||
nt|ady: limit raise  10-11 pts   3 trumps   and not likely to have any shortage    simple|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer may try @DAK, ruff @D small|pg||
nt|ady: not so clear cut as to how to play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: give Roger a moment,  |pg||
nt|thegarve:  afternoon all|pg||
nt|ady: over the top    even if hearts break|pg||
nt|sybarra: the players sometimes start before the operator is set |pg||
nt|lestergold: north possibly getting as little over excited by his er em two queens|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is th 3/4 mark,,, another session of 8 after this,,,,,, then the Allfrey, the|pg||
nt|mariner1: "Undefeated Team", can elect to add 8 extra boards if they are behind after 32.|pg||
nt|athene: the bad break in diamonds is made up for by Robson not having @H7 or @H10|pg||
pc|d8|nt|thegarve:  4@h on a defensive 3334 looks like chasing IMPS already|pg||
nt|april7: S can reach the dummy twice to play@H losing in each suit only 1 trick, but why 4@H from N??|pg||
nt|lestergold: Michelle wanted to take actrion again but her stiff Ks not pulling its weight|pg||
nt|ady: east's double could risk giving complete trump position|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: East has doubled because his partner showe extra when he redoubled|pg||
nt|ady: Robson did not want to switch to anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: showed at least an opening bid for his overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this may need trumps 3-2 which they are of course|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: yes    very fortunate the over ruff has to be the ace|pg||
nt|athene: robson might pitch a club rather than overruff|pg||
nt|athene: try to get a club ruff with the @h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would still have set up the clubs early|pg||
nt|ady: well the only card not likely to over ruff is the ace  so I am sure Price will read that|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed if west does not overruff i think this is off|pg||
nt|mariner1: I just noticed Allfrey is on the board,,,,,, was 30 - 0 last I looked......|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||

nt|mariner1: need Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|thegarve:  5D XX +1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|april7: 3@H would be ok,because 2 @S should already be down,but not easy to stay in 2@S X|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes last hand of the last set was a thumping +14|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: double risky but he knows dummy wont be bristling with entries for deep heart finesses and if u want imps you need to double|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

nt|athene: now @DA on which robson pitches @C10|pg||
nt|athene: @DJ sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: any diamond is good enough|pg||
nt|athene: defensive crossruff here we come|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed -2 beckons|pg||
nt|thegarve:  will discard the @C|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: yes   AS! was not good|pg||
pc|hA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps only -1|pg||
nt|thegarve:  j@h was the key card and had to assume a 33 @C break|pg||
nt|mariner1: The English Bridge Union wishes to express its gratitude to Mrs Helen Schapiro|pg||
nt|mariner1: in supporting this most prestigious event in this way, and in donating a trophy in|pg||
nt|mariner1: the name of her husband, the late, and truly great, Boris Schapiro.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: Alfrey ahead Micjael|pg||
nt|lestergold: John Holland obviously tought that Michelle would have a monser for the second double|pg||
nt|ady: Michael|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe she is normally a bit shy but who knows?|pg||
nt|sybarra: althought the pitch probably didnt matter, except  to save the trumps in hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer cant avoid 2 trump losers|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|thegarve:  pass over 2@s xx might have been confusing, to play or extras?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: good sluff, now 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: cash one top hear  and then ace and queen of clubs a nd another for down 1|pg||
nt|ady: can engineer a trump promotion Avram if reading it right|pg||
nt|april7: you are right|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: maybe another opportunity for Allfrey here|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: yes, hard to see any swing on this one|pg||

nt|ady: strange 1@D opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 count openersd??|pg||
nt|lestergold: new system|pg||
nt|thegarve:  after having the evening off as undefeated Allfrey's team are weel rested and that should show in the last 16 boards|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a 20/20 hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they have "we open light" checked on their card |pg||
nt|lestergold: Andy will bid 3c presumably|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think so|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they may well pull away for a comfortable win|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 1 IMP at stake, if South plays in one room and North in the other|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe an imp|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|april7: they will end up in 3NT going down a lot, because @D suit is dead.E might play 4 or 5 @D|pg||

nt|werge: I vote for "difference"...|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lestergold: easy to lose a trick on the opening lead|pg||

nt|april7: 2 level is max for both|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its not cricket|pg||
nt|athene: it's always a little frustrating when you carefully set up a squeeze position and then your critical suit breaks anyway so your menaces were just winners all the time :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 20/20 point count hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|ady: part score battle    n/s  can make 2@S      nothing any higher likely to make|pg||

nt|lestergold: showing minors very brave|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this is a weak NT, In the other room they will probably upgrade it to a strong NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d-1 undoubled is a gain|pg||
nt|roswolf: does west have a penalty double here?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: risky by Robson   North not limited yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: misundertanding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: michelle u must pass girl|pg||
nt|thegarve:  he gets away with these all the time - having a reputation of a top player really helps|pg||
nt|lestergold: Mr.Alfrey didnt understand thebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: S asking about the 2NT. East thinks it is strong|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well passed|pg||
nt|werge: Last word, I promise: East has set up the squeeze, not declarer|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: 3IMPs lost|pg||
nt|ady: not much on here     2@S   will go down      n/s  have a partial in diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: dummy is essentially useless to W|pg||
nt|athene: yes, hard to see the defence not taking two tricks in each side-suit|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Robson will take his time inducing a coma coup|pg||
nt|werge: Another one?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose south might have to be very mildly careful about getting endplayed|pg||
nt|ady: not sure of the wisdom of the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|athene: but really only the defence can make 2@S for Robson here|pg||

nt|ady: 2NT a limit or better raise in hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: why was it pulled?|pg||

nt|mariner1: Rodent Control!|pg||
nt|roswolf: but his playing it|pg||
nt|werge: Bad luck for South, that North has the @d Ace!|pg||
nt|mariner1: this has not made yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: well science would have helped there|pg||
nt|thegarve:  needs care in trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs care everywhere!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  on a H! lead likely to go off|pg||
nt|mariner1: has a lot of losers to take care of|pg||
nt|werge: @H-finesse seems to be enough|pg||
nt|athene: stiff trump will be Allfrey's last choice against this contract, i think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|april7: 4@H by W ,to strong for Truscott or is it forcing to game?|pg||
nt|athene: but it's the only killing lead, double-dummy, apparently|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the optimum lead for defense|pg||
nt|thegarve:  j@h won't fool declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: specs suggest exclusion blackwood or a void showing splinter|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is a GOOD PRACTICAL BID!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suggest not having to bid 1@S on N's cards, regardless if it makes or not|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer does have to finesse i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hans I agree IF N had a 1@S call :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think north actually welcomed the 1@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: it allowed him to show some values with a free 1@S call|pg||
nt|ady: dont thin will make  finesse or not|pg||
nt|athene: if west had passed, he would have had to jump to 2@S to show some cards - not ideal with that suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: double shows that hand to me.........|pg||
nt|werge: I only comment on South´s second bid, sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely robsons baby psyche wont catch price out?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  X-ruff after cashing a few winners|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: i think declarer will cash @SAK and go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: it has well done east!|pg||
nt|werge: He will also go down without cashing them...|pg||
nt|thegarve:  so j@h did fool him|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he might go off on a ruffing finess against K@H in W,,, which it isn't|pg||
nt|ady: I think will rely on spades 3-2 and go down     a little morfe difficlt now|pg||
nt|ady: difficult now|pg||
nt|roswolf: too difficult now i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: 17 was 4 more imps to Allfrey|pg||

nt|athene: i think declarer will trust Allfrey to be bidding straight down the line and hence robson to be messing about|pg||
nt|mariner1: on what we all thought was an easy 3N hand the Open Room is already at the 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: level and up|pg||
nt|werge: Worse is, that 6 @C seems OK|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 18 that is|pg||
nt|thegarve:  so the lead could shortly be changing hands|pg||
nt|athene: well, we have seen quite a few times already this match:- hands that look like a routine 1nt - 3nt, forrester-bakhshi manage to turn into 14-bid auctions|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 18 NS bis 6@C which should be off and a big swing to Mossop|pg||

nt|vugraphzqa: no, I did, sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt andy have a dim loser at the finish?|pg||
nt|lestergold: one on the club one ruffed|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: ruffed it earlier|pg||
nt|april7: y,but he could have made 12 tricks before|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Robson must have loved to see his bad psyche get opponents all confused and hit his Qxxx @s suit|pg||
nt|athene: if Robson had just bid an honest 2@D over the double, Price might have bid 2@S and been raised to 6 anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but allfrey's lead was magic as well|pg||
nt|thegarve:  but might have finessed q@h in that case |pg||
nt|athene: yes, true - it was the combination of 1@H bid and @HJ lead really made it tough for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: With these players, has it ever occurred, that spectators could not follow the play because of the speed?|pg||

nt|werge: 4 boards played, and we have allready seen two slams, where game was the right...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: board 18 in the other room is very interesting - i suspect that sort of disaster is why the italians don't like to put the 18-19 balanced into their 2+ 1@C openers|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the problem was the 18-19 balanced |pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: i said so|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems ok here|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H here|pg||
nt|athene: when 1@C can be so many things it's just overloaded and you can never unwind when there's competition|pg||
nt|roswolf: the team which copes best with the remaining boards of this set may well have the momentum t owin|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @H is OK, but a trump lead against 5 @H is a killer|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|thegarve:  I would be surprised if this hand is a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: explained as Majors|pg||
nt|werge: Has 2 of each...|pg||
nt|roswolf: if as north my system says i must open 1@C with that hand i ditch the system!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  that will do him nicely hitting the 5-card support|pg||
nt|athene: Simpson explained 2@C as majors? (i.e. he knows what it is and has psyched)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or Price explained it as such (i.e. Simpson just forgot the system)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: Price explained|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm interesting!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|werge: Excuse me - dis West PASS?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S is the LEB|pg||
nt|thegarve:  only 3@S|pg||
nt|thegarve:  maybe needs 6-card support for 4@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: leb = LOWEST ETHICAL BID|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not difficult to make 4@H, but need to call |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S looks a bit wet to me, facing 2@C for majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may go to the referee if passed out|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|mariner1: well NS steal on here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: 6+ loser's in North, 3@S is sufficient|pg||
nt|mariner1: one|pg||
nt|thegarve:  dodgy 3@s call|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@H by West over 2@C would need|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: TD called|pg||
nt|roswolf: fielded "mis-bids" are a very vexing matter|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, even the field/not field matter can be a grey scale|pg||
nt|roswolf: panel given the mis explanation what wouls you bid?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  seems "unusual" for South to pass 3@S too|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. price just takes a slightly conservative view to try to survive if his partner did forget / psyche|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @S is enough - @C´s are behind, @D Q is worthless|pg||
nt|athene: but he does't explain to opps "2@C shows majors, but we haven't played this long, and partner never remembers system after 7pm anyway"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree hans|pg||
nt|roswolf: are they playing with screens?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  no screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: no screens|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah then anything is possible|pg||
nt|thegarve:  tis true Colin told me that he rarely plays in the evenings any more|pg||
nt|mariner1: sun screen? :)|pg||
nt|athene: any regular partnership has to disclose psyching tendencies to opps - but what about system forget tendencies?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the rules are strange - if in CC 2@C means majors, no chance for E/W|pg||
nt|thegarve:  isn't dark yet|pg||
nt|werge: But why did West pass over 2 @C? He has an obvious 2 @H-bid, even if South has a lot of major-cards|pg||
nt|thegarve:  perhaps another Price (Vincent) appears at nighttime|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, the pass by West with balanced in front, is too much prudent|pg||
nt|thegarve:  he was probably working in a lab a late one night....|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 2@H by west over 2@C would be some esoteric bid showing both minors better clubs or something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well most of us mere mortals would bid 2@H as west at our first turn - therefore the thoughts of the tall one would be fascinating to hear|pg||
nt|athene: tuning your system too specifically for opps having their bids is a bad move, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: TD telling them to continue|pg||
nt|athene: or you need to have a lot of faith you can get redress from the appeals committee :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: He may adjust|pg||
nt|roswolf: reserving a ruling then?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: another 20/20|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|thegarve:  first swing of set moves the gap to 19 IMPS - once you hit 20+ IMPS its like having to get two tries at rugby to stay in touch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: and 2 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose the hand is valid|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2H would appear natural NF in this sequence|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree and is not that what he has got?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and 4@H would seem a valid call over 3@s so there'll be plenty of viewpoints|pg||
nt|ady: while it wont make on a bad day I think west should have bid 4@H after the 2@C bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|ady: 2 down  here     poor overcall by east|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: 4c by andy? seems a bit steep|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - i agree 2@H natural, because use 2@H to give inviting hand with stop in @H isn't usefull in this auction|pg||
nt|werge: West can - regarding BOTH his major-holding + partners 1 NT see, that South has NOT the major-hand!|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially if it is known that west is a solid citizen in the bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: east i meant|pg||
nt|bridge_one: uhmm, south could have 4@H, East 2 and north void|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|werge: YES - buit how about the spades???|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: east is at favourable|pg||
nt|thegarve:  routine to bid 1H and keep the aggressive and winning overcall style in action|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: u are allowed to overcall a six card majot at favourable|pg||
nt|ady: Jack high suit     just the way to get the wrong lead from partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think andy felt he was too good for a simple 3h he was between then devil and teh deep blue sea|pg||
nt|ady: was 5 card suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h could have just been  acourtesy|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I would have doubleded 1@c personally|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant count |pg||
nt|lestergold: still nothing wrong with theovercall|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|werge: West has 4, North is bidding, and South has about 4½|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i think that Robson might reasonably be accused of trying to take a 2-way shot here|pg||
nt|roswolf: i feel that there should be no adjustment on the hand|pg||
nt|thegarve:  those who use all 2M bids  as artificial lose out when You posses a long suit and an opponent holds xxxx in the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair points bill and martin|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Yes Bill cannot Pass throughout and make up a sequence in the appeals room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem for West is the void in @C, where the partner can have 9 points !|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: i am told they have just bid to 4H by west in the OR|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: very big board|pg||
nt|thegarve:  baord 20 unsurprisingly yielded 13 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: TD returning|pg||
nt|thegarve:  who is TD?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in board 20 in open room South call 6@S after 1@s directly|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the ruling............................|pg||
nt|athene: for any specs who are unfamiliar with the "2-way shot" phrase - the basic idea is, if you know opps have done something irregular, like misexplained or psyched, you might just take ...|pg||
nt|athene: a strange action in the bidding (or play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: David Stevenson|pg||
nt|athene: then if it works, you just take your good score|pg||
nt|athene: but if it doesn't work you call the director and ask for an adjustment because you were "damaged"|pg||
nt|werge: Better would have been to take 500 against 3 @S - double and lead a @C...|pg||
nt|werge: even 800|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I still feel 3@s is holding back a bit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 3@S dbl with lead @C is ok for E/W|pg||
nt|mariner1: match is close, one more session of 8 boards and then|pg||
nt|mariner1:  Allfrey, the "Undefeated Team", can elect to add 8 extra boards if they are|pg||
nt|mariner1: behind after 32.|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course we have 3 more boards to play in this session too|pg||
nt|roswolf: at present + 12 imps for mossop|pg||
nt|thegarve:  perhaps use 2NT as a good rasie of your forgotten @c raise or a good raise of your majors as North|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: TD asks whether 3S was alerted. No, says South |pg||
nt|mariner1: now the lead has spread again|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do feel that west passing twice was not optimum|pg||
nt|werge: Interesting - that South should alert 3 @S - must be a cue-bid or so|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure I would allow a severe adjustment here........|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: players offering to scrap the board|pg||

nt|werge: Right contract: 6 NT by West|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think they should scrap the bard, given where the venue is|pg||
nt|ady: yes  6@S   nice and easy|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and the level of competition|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@C 5 down, so not usefull|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must be a precedent somewhere for this sort of board, not that uncommon|pg||

nt|april7: or small @C lead and @D return 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south may be sandbagging|pg||

nt|lestergold: and andy having seen his pard's openers before has not doubled this|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a minus for n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: and the nice slam ....... easy enough|pg||
nt|werge: In my calculator, 7 @D D is a winner - 1100 against 1440|pg||
nt|werge: 7 @c D|pg||
nt|roswolf: competently bid|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this is very likely to be a flat board|pg||
nt|werge: By E/W - yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: why does it need a trump switch?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  expert  play is often middle encouraging and high and low = suit prefernce, with know long suits|pg||
nt|april7: at least 1 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade tricks cant run away|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 6@S only has to fail a very small % of the time to make a sure -1100 look less appetising|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@C you lose 2@D 1@C 2@H, so 5 down for 1400|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and if bid N would have 3 @D and 2 @H and a @S and go for the moon :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: 22 imps until a positive adjustment|pg||
nt|dburn: what is 55 minus 33?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ady: has to ruff with winning diamond as it went    trading tricks|pg||

nt|mariner1: what adjustment in IMPS would you guys give on that board?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT is off so that 600 looks a execellent tresult for more iMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: mossop wont lose much on this board if anything at all|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it was hard for North to lead the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: any takers?|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was played by West in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh yes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  in the other room they may well open that North  hand 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: a misfit for e/w|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: well i think it could be found especially if the auction is revealing|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes W should be playing 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: more likely that 3NT will be played by East in this room, if at all|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3@d has given them one more chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: then a club lead is automatic surely with a side ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: can W envision 3N now?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Mesbur pulled a fats one by showing long @c canape in the other room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  fast one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D seam a limit raise without 4 cards in majors - so 3Nt seam to be necessary to call|pg||
nt|athene: presumably 2@H = "i have some random hand" 2@S = "such as?" 3@D = "limit raise in diamonds if you must know"|pg||
nt|thegarve:  had two chances to play @c but the "canape" fooled Bakshi|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 2@H must anything like a 2 way bid (or more) |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this is the trouble with these artificial methods|pg||
nt|athene: come on robson bid 3nt! you know you want to|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: still 3NT not for sure even played by west |pg||
nt|roswolf: signposts the lead to a thoughtful defender|pg||
nt|athene: after all, it was discovered a few years ago amongst the expert community that Qx is actually a stop|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: the problem is what play: 3Nt , 5@D ? i|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: robson finish in 2 @S?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this set is designed for small swings - ideal if you are in the lead, few danger hands|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be the same position if it had started with a natural 1@D - 3@D (limit).|pg||
nt|athene: so stiff Q is the logical next step|pg||
nt|thegarve:  in other room got @d wrong on a @H lead and still made 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: 2H = D raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: well another huge swing here for mossop likely|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Robson was afraid to find 3 3 5 2 in the partner|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: might get away with this as hearts favourable and ace clubs on side|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  well fancied|pg||
nt|lestergold: can lose 3s a heart and a club|pg||
nt|thegarve:  (Un)foratuantely depends how you look at it we lost to Hackett by one IMP 27-26 in 32 boards|pg||
nt|ady: no heart loser Mike|pg||
nt|thegarve:  all other tables had huge turnovers|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is a heart loser unless he ruffs one with the J|pg||
nt|lestergold: or double dummy finesses north  for q|pg||
nt|lestergold: on first round|pg||

pc|c2|nt|werge: Never lead aaway from a Jack...|pg||

pc|c8|nt|athene: he has two tricks in his hand if he doesn't unblock|pg||
nt|athene: so throwing away the setting trick is asking a bit much|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|thegarve:  BBO had a problem as afater the first set Robson's team had scored nine IMPS but got fined 10 IMPS for slow play so he was on minus one and BBO could not handle that|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d5|nt|mariner1: I still think that protest should only result is a small imp score for EW at most.....|pg||

mc|6|nt|athene: on the 3@S hand, i guess they will let the result stand but perhaps impose a small procedural penalty on NS for not knowing their system and causing everyone hassle |pg||
nt|thegarve:  doubt it|pg||
nt|mariner1: and maybe an imp loss just not as much|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah the judgment of soloman|pg||
nt|dburn: that would be a little unlikely|pg||

nt|mariner1: making it a push board seems to penalize NS too much...........|pg||
nt|thegarve:  like a yellow card for a professional foul|pg||

nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session here in about 15 minutes or around that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: bakhski passed at 2@S in open room|pg||
nt|copeyj: bakhshi was opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: it could have got worse   3NT can make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so right pass :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S does not have the worst 8 you have ever seen|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: indeed but perhaps flat or an imp to mossop likely|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h has a lot of losers|pg||
nt|ady: will probably settle for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: against 15/17 i think 2Nt is obliged - the @s arn't so bad with 987 and 2 10 are better that nothing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mossop now has a huge lead,,,,, especially if the protest goes in their favor|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: 3c plenty of work|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|thegarve:  in the other match does anyone know if its been put to bed?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the dim suit seems to be the critical suit here|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C made in OR   but I dont think will make here|pg||
nt|april7: why not?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has to avoid more than onme dim loser|pg||
nt|april7: losing 1 trick in each suit|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy thats easy|pg||
nt|thegarve:  more chance of 10 |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh he has another winning option now|pg||
nt|athene: facing 14-16, you just rely on partner super-accepting the transfer if you have game on|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they oly had one real bad board in the bidding|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|april7: I know but how to play the @D suit other than it is?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Alllfrey team has lost a bundle in the bidding|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: might be ok now|pg||
nt|mariner1: The English Bridge Union wishes to express its gratitude to Mrs Helen Schapiro|pg||
nt|mariner1: in supporting this most prestigious event in this way, and in donating a trophy in|pg||
nt|mariner1: the name of her husband, the late, and truly great, Boris Schapiro.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: that qs switch seemed an unecessary panic play|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the overcall and non-raise says a  lot|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|april7: a present in @S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: spade would have gone on long diamond anyway|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: an intra finesse in dims for the overtrick?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  q@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: same difference |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: well he found neither winning play |pg||
pc|s8|pc|dJ|nt|april7: gave the resent back|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: just as well that he was helped with thespades|pg||
nt|ady: 9th appeared|pg||
nt|thegarve:  throw T@s and North was unusually squeezed|pg||
nt|mariner1: back in 10 -  15   thanks all!|pg||
nt|roswolf: see you soon|pg||
nt|thegarve:  bye|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: TDs ruling|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: Doesnt allow South's pass of 3S. Decides he will bid 4C|pg||
nt|thegarve:  so west will 4@h and a flat board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: ...and W will bid 4H, and N will bid 4S|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and that gets doubled?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: ....but not sure if S will bid 5C|pg||
nt|thegarve:  South cannot pull that to 5@c|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hasn't North alerted the 2@C bid and there are no screens?|pg||
nt|mariner1: are we guessing the result or is that what it is?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes saben|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: probably going to be scored as a flat board|pg||
nt|roswolf: split result then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: board 21 is the one in dispute|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that is a serious problem then, I would say. Very difficult to predict how the bidding would procede if south bleived North was bidding "naturally". Whatever that means.|pg||
nt|roswolf: so mossop will get 12 imps deducted|pg||
nt|thegarve:  there must be a precedent for this sort of bidding where a player bids 2C showing the majors inhibiting 4M|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - no one quite knows what 1@c-1NT-2@c (natural) - pass - 3@s means|pg||
nt|dburn: but South is obliged to proceed as though North thinks South has clubs, and must interpret 3@s in that context|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh David, so good to have you here! Finally someone who understands me! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: closing now... back very soon|pg||
nt|thegarve:  so pulls 3S to 4C|pg||
nt|thegarve:  undoubled|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, of course, West is entitled to the correct explanation of the NS methods|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however in a similar case i asked at Antonio Sementa, bec the director don't give me reason, but also Sementa told that if opps are a agreements and happen a misunderstand, no way ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to change the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: players returning|pg||
pg||
