nt|mariner1: hi all! Welcome to the Autumn National Open Teams 2009, Adelaide, South|pg||
nt|mariner1: Australia, Australia|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|mariner1: our commentators are Tony Wilkinson, Bill Frisby and I am Rob Brown|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Edgar Kapjan said the same thing. When great minds ...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Morning Henry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, when Edgar played Tim, ... well, you would want to kibitz that|pg||
nt|henryb: gm|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS may be playing Moscito|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|benjent: Afternoon Henry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are playing in Heaven|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like 1@D here was a transfer to 4|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure about the N-S system - will try to hunt it out|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes since @D are 3 3|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb: or commented together as they did in Perth in '89|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|benjent: vaguely possible to go down in 2@c here|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 1@C (semi-) natural, 1@D = hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I would not dream of rebidding 2@c, which shows how much I know|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: They were forced to - with the Acol base (1NT rebid = 15-18)|pg||
nt|benjent: 1NT for you Henry?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|athene: 2nt natural, 3@D = "i wasn't lying, i really DO have hearts"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb: you bet|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I didn't think N would pass below game here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lost the play sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: np ty Cricket :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: let's say the defence begin by running four diamonds and then play a heart|pg||
nt|athene: the blockages in both black suits are actually a bit troublesome for declarer - he can't take his 9 top tricks|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: In that case she should have opened 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: if he unblocks spades, he can't reach the @CKQ|pg||
nt|athene: and if he unblocks @CAJ first, he can't get back to the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: something has to be overtaken in a black suit and neither of them breaks kindlyt|pg||

nt|benjent: That's a Gallus favourite ... and Dilks played with Gallus fairly recently|pg||

nt|pitiful:  Roland would lead J@h|pg||
nt|henryb: but in Little Roman (Pabis Ticci-D'Allellio) it was their strong opening|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: No, low heart ducked and a diamond back|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It ends up making because the hearts can be held up|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the diamond ace is with the short hearts ... but declarer has to time it right|pg||
nt|athene: a heart would endplay the defence eventually|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: set up a spade and duck the heart return|pg||

pc|h6|nt|benjent: Just-in-time pass from Dilks. I reckon anything higher was getting cracked|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to believe east would bid 5@C - presumably pass or correct for his partner's minor|pg||
nt|athene: but that's very, very high if partner has 5@H 4@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C as Bill said mystifies me|pg||
nt|mariner1: why not happily pass 3N|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can lead to the @SK and set up a pitch for the @H2, but it's a question of reaching it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|benjent: So looks like Butler are finally going to get on the board in the last set|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|athene: perhaps del'monte thought that partner's 3NT had to show a long solid minor and so 5@C was p/c - but a) why shouldn't 3NT just be a balanced monster and b) even if 3nt was "source ...|pg||

nt|sybarra: I wonder what they bid 3 @H on?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: (also usually shows a bad hand)|pg||
nt|athene: west could have taken the opportunity to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is an interesting spot for NS to steal the board|pg||
nt|athene: west had a variety of options|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H over 3@C (michaels ish) or X 3@C to show clubs then bid 3@S over 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|patricck: that has avoided any possible misdefence, so 10 more imps to the lead, becoming significant now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|benjent: Absolutely spiffing timing for the 1@s overcall, and it's paid off big time|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What do we think of North's 5@H bid?  (in theory)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like DBL takeout of the @H suit as N will bid that anyway|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|athene: of course they may play a X of 3@C as t/o of hearts - it's a delicate issue at which point your doubles of artificial raises should become t/o of opps' anchor suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: most experts play that if the raise can be weak (as here) then X is t/o|pg||

nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of matches,,,,,,,,,, and have flat hands|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps South's 4@H bid, which is something of a "left handed transfer" must be examined as well|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: people often say "well, i have a void in their suit, so partner probably has a stack, and it's all a misfit, and they go down instead of us going down"|pg||
nt|athene: but this is just madness|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hT|pg||

nt|athene: partner hasn't got a stack just because you have a void|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjent: Well, I think we'll need to barack for a game swing back to Butler to keep it interesting ... but it's not looking like it for the next few hands|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: we are just taking a drink break here |pg||
nt|benjent: And a "change the luck" break as well I would think. If I were Dilks-Blakeman, I'd be trying to glue everyone to their seats|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they were the ones who opted for the break |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|pitiful:  good morning all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|an|Enquiry |mb|d|nt|Walddk2: enquiry? |pg||
nt|pitiful:  3NT looks the obvious spot|pg||
nt|benjent: I like seeing what Dilks does. I reckon his general style is to set himself a challenge in the cardplay, and then achieve it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Should double of 2@C be lead directional here?  I guess it depends whether it's a natural enquiry or an artificial enquiry|pg||
mb|2H|an|4+!H any strength|mb|p|mb|2N|an|minors min hand |mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: I'd say takeout of spades; it's always possible to just bid 3@c over an artificial enquiry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difficult lead for Smart|pg||
pc|cK|nt|benjent: The @c8 won't disapoint Blakeman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or the 9 in the dummy|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|benjent: I think I would play a @c back now, for the insult if nothing else, and then run @sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 clubs, 3 diamonds, 2 spades and 1 heart .... several other ways to get to at least 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Letting the @SJ ride is one way|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|benjent: Now that he has the 3rd @s trick in, playing a @c back is a lockup|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Shouldn't south cover @SJ?  You know: "always cover an honour with an honour"|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|benjent: And it sticks declarer in the wrong hand, although she wasn't to know that|pg||

nt|bridge_one: yes, this is possible Steve - but 2@s after isn't the best idea|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree about the final 2spade bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb: last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpq: yes, this is the last hand of the first segment, they are playing 16 more boards tonight|pg||
mb|p|nt|fcarioca: I'm guessing EW will bid 6@D here...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: depending on the bid by south|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to make 6@S need @H lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: 4@H would be more effective|pg||
mb|d|nt|ebrok: 3 tiere+ 9 hp=3 nt i nord|pg||
nt|robinswr: i'm guessing that 4hearts will make it difficult to bid slam (3hearts is insufficient)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpq: tomorrow we are going to broadcast the finals|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|ebrok: Bagefter med 39 IMP|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the difference betrween 3@H and 4@H overcall is very hight !|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ebrok: 41|pg||
nt|fcarioca: In fact any non @D lead allow 6@s to be made, due to singleton !K...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3@D asking about distribution (to know a sgl)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|werge: - og flere, hvis de melder 3 NT her...!|pg||
nt|ebrok: Udspil?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nw opps know fit and distribution|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: Den smule jeg kender til bridge, da er det ikke hænder som disse, man skal spille "all in" på!|pg||
nt|ebrok: Det må bliveru, ja|pg||
nt|pkl: Jeg forstår en opvurdering hos Nord, men Syd burde nedvurdere|pg||
nt|pkl: Enig med ruder ud|pg||
nt|fcarioca: singleton @CK allows it to make, no communication NS|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes. i haven't seen K sgl in @c in South|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ebrok: Ja, "floppet" var ikke en rammer|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 4@H is a old way to procede - normally Dbl means no interest in @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: This is Lerner's fault|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally is a advantage to know anythings about the hand of p, but there are the possibility to give informations very usefull at opps for the counterplay|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fcarioca: Congrats to the winning team, Fred, Mané, Vita, Gabriele, Leão, Aranha|pg||

nt|robinswr: will he lead a low heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C giving the chance to choise the best minor|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pkl: Men 3NT er stadig hjemme hvis man gætter klørfarven|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with A in @C rigth to choise @D (playing @C opps culd have A in @D and @D ruff|pg||
pc|d7|nt|werge: Man kan KUN gætte rigtigt|pg||
nt|robinswr: don't know why you would lead the ace against a slam you need count not attitude if Qxx is in dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|robinswr: now  he should play on clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|werge: Som jeg hele tiden har sagt: Det er hænder som disse, man skal gi´ den hele armen...!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|nt|robinswr: i guess if clubs are 4-1 he can play on spades|pg||
