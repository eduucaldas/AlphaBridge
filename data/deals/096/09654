nt|hedyg: the official site is : http://www.bboitalia.it/china/|pg||
nt|brolucius: This may be a lively bidding hand.|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.bboitalia.it/china/ for information about what this event is. |pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: wait a moment ...we miss the bidding boxes...:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hope they are not in Chinese|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1¤|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: it would be so difficoult to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is too good for 3@D but will not like to pass with such a suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@D looks OK.|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d is perfectly reasonable in a Precision style|pg||
nt|henryb: so 1@d-2@c-X-2@h-P-3@c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if he plays weak twos in diamonds, the hand is too strong, really. US players might choose 2@D, because they play them quite strong.|pg||
nt|lestergold: HI hENRY HI ALL mIKE HERE FROM uK|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - North should not pass a negative double with real diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: North will open 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: which is 10-15, 6+@D or other hands |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi David and Peter|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess OR out of bidding boxes as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ancora qualche minuto di pazienza, so no bidding boxes in the closed room either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: open rather|pg||
nt|henryb: I am told that 1@d would promise a 4 card major and 5+ @d, and that 2@d = 10-15 with 6@d or some other hands|pg||
nt|brolucius: It must be aggravating to pick up an interesting hand and then not be able to bid on it.|pg||
nt|petergill: Current World Champion Alfredo Versace plays Angelini's Strong Club system when he plays with Francesco Angelini. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 10-15, 6 cards or 5 cards +4@cs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Paulissen-Jansma are N-S against Fantoni-Nunes|pg||
nt|henryb: sorry, long in one of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Hedy|pg||
nt|lestergold: shortage of bids but not commentators|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi David:) and David..and David.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With Muller playing in this room there is a good chance that we will all the comparisons here|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D - 3@C - 3@D - 3@H - Pass, then 4@c or perhaps 5@C is my guess at the most likely auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini precision: http://tinyurl.com/4hsqy8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muller is in the Top 5 of the world's slowest players|pg||
nt|brolucius: That should be Bottom 5. |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: perhaps he will often be dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Top 5, who are the others, Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You see it already. He hasn't bid yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Grøtheim, Shenkin, Feldman, Aa|pg||
nt|hedyg: i hope they dont have to rush to a club to get the bidding boxes!|pg||
nt|hedyg: you forgot PO!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: here we go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Robson also right up there of course|pg||
nt|henryb: probably they are discussing system still. judging by the cards, both pairs play a lot of stuff that others do not|pg||
nt|petergill: Roland sees more top bridge than anyone else in the world, so would know better than the rest of us. |pg||
nt|vincenzo: Sorry for delay ... some technical problems ... we are starting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Henry|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: In the Australian Seniors Playoff that is currenlty taking place, all six teams have already been fined for slow play. |pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@d should deny a 4 card major here|pg||
nt|brolucius: The older you are, the slower you become.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a support double?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hardly|pg||
nt|petergill: A negative dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: take out|pg||
nt|henryb: you may have higher standards for a reasonable pace than many others|pg||
nt|petergill: Angelini - Versace played the first of the five segments, winning 59-3. The Dutch fought back to win the 2nd set 32-20. This is the 3rd segment.|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d opener promises a 4 card major; 2@d opener shows a diamond one suiter or diamonds and clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: In open room Versace-Lauria - so this round will be very hard for opps|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzbg: IT IS A TEST|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 11-15 |pg||
nt|mariner1: I sure hate to have to pass with S here|pg||
nt|petergill: NS system at www.tinyurl.com/4hsqy8|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantunes sitting out and Lauria finally playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone will getinto trouble on this deal|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly odd, that - the opening bid denied a four-card major, so one might have expected 3@d rather than double|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why david i ask if it was a support double|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 3@D looked obvious. Unlikely that North would be 4-6 with a major.|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes pd can bid 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: systemically North cannot have a major|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might think he is too good for just 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c=10-15, 6@c or 5@c + 4@D|pg||
nt|imp_jan: what to bid  now by east?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@D looks fair|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can even make 3N however that is not a likely spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well no doubt versace will show his diamond support|pg||
nt|lestergold: and nopw what?|pg||
nt|dburn: but double might have been a try for 3NT - the opening bid can be up to 16 or so|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is 10-15, so I think Hedy may be right that he is looking for a 3NT rebid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Current Top 8 list (slow play): 1. PO Sundelin - 1. Andrew Robson - 1. Bauke Muller - 4-8. Glenn Grøtheim, Barnet Shenkin, Terje Aa, Michael Rosenberg. Several players hoping to be ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: promoted next year|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC http://www.geocities.com/gerben47/conventioncards/jansma-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S and maybe slam here|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D, or perhaps 4@C to show a good raise to 4@D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW play the Orange @c?|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam EW|pg||
nt|mariner1:  grand in fact|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: not 3n|pg||
nt|hedyg: why can he not bid ? what would 1NT be?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: use of texas over 1@C open by E/W - so the DBL by North means @H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Fairly heavy for 3@D, with the singleton in opponent;s suit, might want to do more than 3@D, e.g. guide partner towards a 5@D save over 5@c on some other hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no idea what NS play now|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead kills slam though|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Close to Versace-Lauria|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: lauria-versace system|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Rob|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H = 4+@S 8+ points that i know :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: transfer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg:  http://tinyurl.com/539d3g|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3nt on a @c lead? i think not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H meant as comic here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Sergey|pg||
nt|hedyg: sort of|pg||
nt|dinos1: advanced sac )|pg||
nt|mariner1: well will it work?  sure eats up a lot of their room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 14 tricks for E/W, so the bid of N/S is ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c is 16+|pg||
nt|bobholl: double is (i guess) please bid on |pg||
nt|dinos1: pass to X means No 4cd @s?|pg||
nt|mariner1: true Giogio I like the 4@H call|pg||
nt|mariner1: Giorgio  left the r out|pg||
nt|bobholl: pass to double is relay |pg||
nt|mariner1: was 1@H only a count showing call?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|dinos1: if 1@c is 16+ then 5@d with 6-4 shape is better 1 Think|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H=@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East is thinking about the hand of W - he know East is very short in @H - so or a 3 suited hand or a 2 suited hand |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H = 4+@S 8+ points that i know :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9+, may have longer suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: a transfers which complicates this for E|pg||
nt|hedyg: something wrong when he can never bid his great 6 card suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open NS did not bid except to DBL @H at the 5 level..... auction still open|pg||
nt|bridge_one: passing at 1@H means no 4 cards in @S (i presume) so know can bid also 4@S without misunderstand about the 3 cards|pg||
nt|dinos1: well, @d suit is main value of the hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Muller is stronger than promised but he knows nothing about the W hand, could well have just the promised 9 hcps|pg||
nt|bobholl: i guess that the double means please bid on :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West could pass at 4@H , so the DBL means for sure anything of important|pg||
nt|hedyg: but why not bid 1NT over 1@HX?|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, it means, but it doesnt show the hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: pass is the relay bid :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well E has to consider W could lack the K@D and the Q@S @D|pg||
nt|vincenzo: 7@D are playing in open room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: becasue pass at 1@H means balanced hand ... 1Nt perhaps could have a different range of streenght|pg||
nt|dinos1: heady is typing faster :) 1N over X, or XX |pg||
nt|mariner1: claimed on the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: ciao Vincenzo :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW could win a couple or lose a bundle|pg||
nt|vincenzo: Ciao Hedy !|pg||
nt|bobholl: think bauke (muller ) will guess 5@H de wijs 7@D but also hoping :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Vincenzo - super event here :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: we are stuck or East is thinking ?|pg||
nt|dinos1: if pass is balanced why not bid 5@d then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: est's thinking|pg||
nt|vincenzo: Yes ! Great event in China Embassy in Rome|pg||
nt|hedyg: because he is too strong for 5@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because 5@D immediatly must be weaker|pg||
nt|dinos1: of pass then pull X to 5@d|pg||
nt|vincenzo: www.bboitalia.it/china  for details|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room they never bid @D until the 7 level :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: pass has same meaning as 1@S would have without the double = relay (meaningless)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in East i would bid 4@S now - what you bid friends ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: because 4@S in OR in forcing with @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bid 5@H  do not want to be less than slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh they play transfer bids over X|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: Simon de Wijs, lacking aces, did well not to pass 4@D. |pg||
nt|mariner1: well I was thinking @S lead,, true a @c works against it|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4n ok if keycard|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt is a good choise|pg||
nt|mariner1: or forward going|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: always nice to lead your partners suit, a good way to keep your partners..|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 11-15 usually 5 cards in one minor and 4 cards in a major, or 4441|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S o3c here asks for minor pass or correct to @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: so|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: South is trying to find out which 5 card minor North has|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: South's bidding might help East pick the 3-1 trump break|pg||
nt|hedyg: but only after the @s ruff|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i think is natural, not kcbw|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4N - choose yourself|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the 6@D shows it to be natural|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: well this is trivially off|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the trumps won't be 3-1 after the spade ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: but there are a lot of diamond losers to dispose of - a first round finesse might be needed to make 5@C|pg||
nt|henryb: On the otherhand N-S have the first three tricks: @d, @sA, @s ruff|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the friendly layout in spades and diamonds means 12 tricks are there but only played in spades or diamonds, and only by south|pg||
nt|hedyg: i expected to see Lauria playing with Giubilo|pg||

nt|mariner1: back in Rome now :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: wrong sided 6@D too so no slam makes with @H lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Angelini is not so sure that that was South's intention|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: nothing to the play since the Rabbi's Rule play is in effect|pg||
nt|petergill: Same auction at other table, until Nunes passed 4@D. |pg||
nt|imp_jan: or fantoni-nunes rested in 4@D only|pg||
nt|petergill: so 6 imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|imp_jan: same start of bidding, but over 4@D west passed|pg||
nt|petergill: which is reasonable - @Dk might have been offside for instance|pg||
nt|mariner1: Netherlands needs to stay in reasonable aggressive mode to catch up.... that|pg||
nt|mariner1: reasonable is the hard part.............|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably would have bid game if vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: de Wijs shows his cards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: " i make the finesse in @D"|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well with 47 brds ahead there stiil will be a lot of opportunities|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have @c +@d to bid like this else would not double but just bid 2@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: a Burn's Law violation here|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: got there the hard way|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have to guess and did it well :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: brave East|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Whatever redouble meant, West might have bid 3@H instead since that was the main part of his hand.|pg||
nt|dinos1: if X is stronger than direct 5@d then 7@d now is clear bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, agree Sergey|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: Play could be very interesting|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer wants to try to retain trump control while perhaps ruffing a heart in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: and claim|pg||
nt|dinos1: cant have less than @dAK and @sQ|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: Open Room also in 4@S here|pg||
nt|petergill: Cold now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: East correctly plays @SQ or @SK, anything but @S8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That book would be very heavy|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nunes-Fantoni did well to take a plus score at the other table.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and grwoing daily like my waistline|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think Paulissen could figure it out|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes even if he missed the explanation he still bid as if he thought he was right|pg||
nt|bobholl: very well guessed !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @H lead also on Open Room so a push|pg||
nt|mariner1: so bidding and explanation still coincide|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 16+  any|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: so Director not needed |pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess not|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: hard to beat 4@H last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And upgrade|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a mystery why it is easier to put on weight than to take it off. It should be symmetrical.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Precision-like 2@C, limited opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C precision style 5+ @c and could have 4 major|pg||
nt|mariner1: as Roland says, usually limited to 11-15 count|pg||
nt|athene: north would like 3@D to be fit-showing here|pg||
nt|bobholl: negative X so will reach @S|pg||
nt|athene: but unless they have firm agreements to that effect, he will prefer 3@H or 3@C i suppose|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL here neg showing @S cards|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@c here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: another slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: pass alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: 6-10 pts...maybe|pg||
nt|bobholl: another bounce now ? V against NV |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1NT would show 13-15. Muller felt he was too good|pg||
nt|hedyg: after @s to ace and @s ruff must underlead AK@D for another ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3way @c|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@h?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: pass may be any 4-7 or so, with double used to show 0-3|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 1 club promise?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c is strong|pg||
nt|athene: now versace will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C of course was a mixed @H raise|pg||
nt|athene: or he might be thinking about doubling perhaps?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or about pass|pg||
nt|imp_jan: strong club by east|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass of West is conventional|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: est pass is GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open in 6@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbg: 16+|pg||
nt|henryb: wow!|pg||
nt|petergill: 10's and 9's in 4+ card suits that have aces in them pull extra weight, hence the upgrade. |pg||
nt|lestergold: so muller borrowed a point|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump leads would leave 4@H rather short of tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: dbl alerted|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: Versace can see that the hand isn't going to play at all well for E-W|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting dbl by alfredo|pg||
nt|mariner1: N knows that is not a @S suit based penalty DBL.... so more of a game try|pg||
nt|henryb: stronger 1@h|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@d = negative, 1@h relay|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c=16+ any|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C = various hands, including most very strong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the clubs aren't running and if east tries a cross-ruff, both minors are getting over-ruffed|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=0-8|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H relay used to be able to rebid 1N with 19-21 or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11-14 balanced or 15+ with @c or any strong|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: not penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H=19+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but west doesnt know his clubs are pulling full weight|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N opposite a passing partner with S unlimited!|pg||
nt|dburn: that pass showed values|pg||
nt|lestergold: well push 9 tops spades 4/4|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n = made|pg||
nt|mariner1: so they play 1@S as forced?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Orange x has property a little similar to the Polish @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A high-grade push. Amazing that both pairs should write down +400.|pg||
nt|dburn: I think, as I say, that they use double to show a bad hand, pass to show a "negative double" type and bids as natural and game forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbg: fast board|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S might even make 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: impressive in a way especially since clubs were not available as a anatural bid for opener|pg||
nt|athene: but the layout which would make it bad for E-W, makes it good for N-S of course|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Jansma leads low from dblt|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@h?|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not 3@H?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: still a fair way from 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps and has restricted choice opportunity in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder how 3NT plays? 4@s is much easier. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: a fast bid, so no way to find the fit in @C|pg||
nt|dinos1: GF? why then quick 4@s?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: well 4@S was off in Open Room|pg||
nt|bobholl: think pass is 4-7 :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 4@H in OR as well|pg||
nt|athene: i'm sure he will make this|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarer shld refreign from restricted choice in the trump suit (otherwise no play with hearts 1-4)|pg||
nt|athene: a spade switch now means he has to play for @SK right|pg||
nt|hedyg: small from xx|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: now @H?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: favorite to make now|pg||
nt|athene: east has no reason to underlead in spades - he has the @SJ so he sees declarer hasn't got a guess|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarer will guess west's distribution|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may guess the trumps. He will place East with the @SA, because he has to - which doesn't leave much for West   |pg||
nt|hedyg: Paulissen must feel sick looking at the @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: he wants to play a @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N now shows more than 21|pg||
nt|henryb: probably 1@s = 0-5 and other bids show 6-8|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@h probably trsf to spades|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: y|pg||
nt|petergill: When I play Strong Club, we play 1@s over 1@h in this auction as 0-5, any shape. I don't know if that's what the Dtuch pair does|pg||
nt|imp_jan: with hearts 4-4 and diamonds nicely 3n will be made|pg||
nt|mariner1: the red cards behave so 3N makes|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems to be the same Peter|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer may chose 4@s with the @h weakness|pg||
nt|hedyg: else no need for the transfer over 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S must not be that easy...... not made in Open Room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if 2Nt was forcing would be batter, to know the distribution of West|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: E must be worrying about @H stopper|pg||
nt|hedyg: earlier they played 1@H=@S and vice versa|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5-8 I thk :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: E also knows W has 2 or less @H so no clear play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N does have play,,,,,, EW cards sit well for it|pg||
nt|mariner1: even with the 4 2 @S break|pg||
nt|hedyg: but there is no transport!|pg||
nt|petergill: Giubilo did not play 4@S well and effectively lost trump control|pg||
nt|mariner1: you stick the O's in and make them lead into you....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: probably a spade up|pg||
nt|hedyg: how does he know that?|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room after @c E returned a small @H|pg||
nt|athene: the diamond return is interesting - giving declarer the option of throwing a spade on @DK - but that would be silly i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: as a matter of fact E has 3 @hs|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: but W could have them|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S bid 2@H probably 5+ and he is looking at 6 so how many are left?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh E knows! yes !|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hedy I said E knows W has 2 or less :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: though I am perfectly capable of being directionally challenged :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: nono, you are right|pg||
nt|imp_jan: muller-de wijs somehow got thr system from donw under (metric relay i believe)|pg||
nt|petergill: @HKQ being on lead means the killing lead will be found|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is a little more difficult|pg||
nt|hedyg: why worry about @hs as long as there was no double over 3@H?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Very difficult indeed - like impossible - on the obvious lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Italy is in 3N here in Open Room|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni was not worried|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H lead|pg||
nt|henryb: because partner has fewer than 4@h, and S is on lead, and you may not be able to run @s in 3N|pg||
nt|petergill: A disadvantage of 4@s relative to 3NT is that the weaker hand plays 4@S. |pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@c even more|pg||
nt|petergill: That lead helps declarer. A low @h would have made 3NT harder, as the cards lie. |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb: with all primes that seems less of a problem|pg||
nt|bobholl: most beautifull 7 count possible|pg||
nt|dinos1: and 5-5)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: i will try turning on the light..|pg||
nt|mariner1: well either Netherlands will have a big lead or we have a close match.... a swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: will happen here|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a close match it is|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|athene: now Versace knows the exact distribution|pg||
nt|athene: east has to be 4-3-1-5 exactly|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room S ducked the @H so lost 1st two tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In this room we have Muller and Fantoni playing at the same table, so very unlikely that we get any comparisons in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muller and Fantoni are both in the Top 10 of the world's slowest players|pg||
nt|hedyg: E does not necessarily have A@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are tied 3rd|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 10-15|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1st PO Sundelin - 2nd Andrew Robson   but only by a whisker|pg||
nt|mariner1: so we could see a swing here|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other members of that exclusive club are Grøtheim, Feldman, Aa, Shenkin and Rosenberg|pg||
nt|henryb: East really has no lead-up-to values|pg||
nt|petergill: A very close decision for Bauke Muller - he guessed wrongly. Whenever partner (West) has a spade honour, 4@s will mostly be better than 3NT. |pg||
nt|henryb: and if he has @sKQxxx and out it will be much better|pg||
nt|henryb: or if his doubleton is in @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think it is all Henry's fault who suggested that he might worry about @hs :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the problem bid was 2NT. After 1@S, I slightly prefer 2@D - 2@S - 3@C - 3NT - that auction gets to the core of solving the @H problem, but it does clue in the opponents to ...|pg||
nt|petergill: lead @H's, so it's not clearly better. |pg||
nt|henryb: probably. My experience, for what its worth, is that 4@s frequently plays better|pg||
nt|petergill: Some experts say with with HH doubleton (where H = Honour), you should often prefer 4@S to 3NT on this auction. |pg||
nt|hedyg: Paulissen is the tank in the OR after making the Q@H. and switched to @s|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|mariner1: so Roland they are possible suffering from chronohodophobia|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: he can't play a club now|pg||
nt|imp_jan: indeed, ew still have spade communications|pg||
nt|athene: west could ruff and put his partner in with a spade|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he might play a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he can avoid that by playing a spade himself|pg||
nt|imp_jan: scissors coupe|pg||
nt|athene: if he cashes a top trump he will know the layout|pg||
nt|athene: since west is known to have two hearts, there's no danger of any Restricted Choice folly|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean, no restr choice here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubel dummy you can cash three trumps and exit with a spade   |pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk8: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||

nt|mariner1: hi Bill|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|petergill: 200 and 600 will be 13 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|henryb: 100 and 400 will be 11|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I will introduce the players to those of you unfamiliar with the world's best players|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: Jansma thinking to unblock Q@s|pg||

pc|s4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: but that won't happen in practice |pg||
nt|athene: it was unfortunate that both the trump honours were with the doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: that's certainly very much against the odds|pg||

nt|hedyg: Muller went 2 off btw|pg||
nt|mariner1: N opened a @D in Open Room so that froze EW it seems|pg||
nt|imp_jan: good save|pg||
nt|hedyg: there it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many of the what?|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@h is also makeable|pg||
nt|imp_jan: f pass by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: muller's pass forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he could have tried XX instead of 2@s?|pg||
nt|mariner1: best played in N I think as in @@|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: 2@H on their Convention Card can be 5 cards, hence the removal|pg||
nt|henryb: from the warm pot into the inferno|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: 2@s now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @D (on lead ) 1@C 3@H 3@S easy :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: saved|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He means knowledgeable I presume|pg||
nt|lestergold: however u spell it cogniscenti my spelinge not v goote|pg||
nt|henryb: and extricated|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely the double was penalty|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl of 2@S intended as Penalty but perhaps misinterpreted?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i do not see why he removed it|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: de wijs is laughing not so happy:)|pg||
nt|petergill: East's Pass = forcing |pg||
nt|imp_jan: a direct dbl might be conv: 'pls go on'|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D asking about a zeroes in South|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trump lead or switch best, but still 8 tricks via the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|imp_jan: some dutch pairs do play that|pg||
nt|petergill: I think EW play that if they bid a vul game and opponents save (e.g at fav vul), then Pass is forcing.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: what wd be direct 2N over 1@d?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: East is opposite a passed hand and worried that the Pen Dbl might be made on only 3 spades. |pg||
nt|lestergold: well always great when the oppos take over thye misfit hand and start bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 clubs and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 6 + 3 now|pg||
nt|athene: West ought to show a bit more fight than that, in my opinion|pg||
nt|petergill: Fulvio Fantoni and Claudio Nunes, sitting out for Italy, are ranked one and two in the world, partly because they won the World Pairs Championship, which is an event which some of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the other best players in the world play with sponsors. |pg||
nt|diumraid: ****  LIVE  IN RUNNING from LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 58, SCOTLAND 52, IRELAND 48, ENGLAND 44, CBAI 42,  WALES 26  *****|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: Simon are they using screens?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H did make at the other table. |pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muller declaring. Now is a good time to walk your turtle|pg||
nt|lestergold: amazing yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have been scrambled|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: screens as walls|pg||
nt|lestergold: but how manyh tricks can we estimate here will be scrambled in 2n??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We won't know until 19.27|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is declaring quite a complex hand to play, so Roland is right - this will take a while. |pg||
nt|dburn: not actually sure that East-West could have done much about 2@h at the other table|pg||
nt|lestergold: prob not|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit late since the 2nd segment starts at 18 30|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can get a spade away on the @HK, so will just go 2 down i imagine|pg||
nt|mariner1: Netherlands scoring quickly here to get it closer|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Details that won't bother Mr Muller|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I agree, w could risk 2@D over 2@C I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Took a trump lead to hold it|pg||
nt|athene: what's the point having a higher-ranking suit than opps', if you don't exert your authority!?|pg||
nt|petergill: That page I gave  as a link might open again later on. |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bboitalia.it/china/Teams.htm  - Teams (Players Bio's)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S means i have a little bit of points in @S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: @DQ switch - a smooth duck might make the defence tricky.|pg||
nt|henryb: why not play the @sQ?|pg||
nt|dburn: however, it is possible that North may give East some assistance here by attacking diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: less than 22 hcps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C 3/3 so 9 tricks for N/S probably|pg||
nt|dinos1: y|pg||
nt|bobholl: i can't think off a defence even double dummy :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: typical FanTune auction, slow and methodical and precise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: slow because they don't have a GF open, so each bid is a "hard work" !|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a @S or @H lead makes him play it himself|pg||
pc|hK|nt|imp_jan: unusual passive bidding by jan jansma (not bidding 2@d on second turn)|pg||
nt|mariner1: nto that E can find one of those|pg||
nt|mariner1: not|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: Nice play - great duck. |pg||
nt|lestergold: in 2h declarer can win his black tops ruff black smalls in hand exit with dims and wait for more trump tricks so probably scramble 8 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Difficult for North not to continue @D's|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, declarer can't do any of that|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H ducked?|pg||
nt|dinos1: block in @d's is helping|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: @D lead perfectly normal but helps declarer|pg||
nt|dinos1: now can try for overtricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Hard for EW to find 5@H, which is a lucky make. Dbl'ing 4@S is normal.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d looks good too|pg||
nt|hedyg: in both cases needs to find J@D|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why is it difficult not to continue diamonds when partner discourages with the deuce?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: best switch well done|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: had to give something away but with club he gets back one|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room made 2 :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: overtricks |pg||
nt|dinos1: df has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: E led Q@C in Open|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1 IMP for NETHERLANDS|pg||
nt|dinos1: E knows W has nothing|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and he should have a good idea where his nothing is|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he plays small @D Fantoni will duck|pg||
nt|dinos1: so will set @d trick|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dinos1: E sees @c3-3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: must duck to save 1 overtrick|pg||
nt|dinos1: deserved 1 imp :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|henryb: North has to pitch a winner|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play natural count and odd encourage, so @D2 put North off the @D continuation - well done|pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch saying "kruimeltjes zijn ook brood " small gains also count :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: crumbs are also bread?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has discarded well so far.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: east knows from the bidding that north has 6-4 in the minors, so there's nothing to lose in trying to cash out the spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: less well done|pg||
nt|brolucius: I spoke too soon.|pg||
nt|dburn: all round|pg||
nt|bobholl: rigth hedy :)|pg||
nt|mariner1:  true however while the lead in Open Room gave up an imp or 2 they often win|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big swing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: er em  a fall from grace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Giubilo has the communication he needs in hearts now, so will just play safe for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 2IMPS for N|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb: still only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: North played for a squeeze @C/@H versus West, but @C are 3/3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: it froze up my computer|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|nt|dburn: well, that was because East pitched his eighth|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: but still one off|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
mc|11|nt|brolucius: East must have felt sorry for North.|pg||
nt|dburn: "sorry, partner - played too quickly"|pg||

nt|mowen: hard to go wrong|pg||
nt|snorris: a rather lucky 4 @s this one|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: of course they have to bid it|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|snorris: but not so bad at imps..|pg||

nt|petergill: well as playing, and this system which NS are playing is his bidding system. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: bd 34 *|pg||
nt|henryb: I thought South was supposed to hold good cards. He is always declarer in the newspaper|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could end up in an unfortunate @H contract here|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: only make slam by not bidding one.......|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb: Miss Fit seems to be infesting the dealing program|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this scoreline is a bit of a landslide at the moment|pg||
nt|petergill: EW play First Discard odd/even - odd e.g @H7 just then is encouraging|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 2N shows the minors which also warns EW|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2n shows minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: 8-13|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C EW here?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: EW CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8-13?|pg||
nt|petergill: EW play UDCA, 1st Discard odd/even, lead 1/3/5 suits, lead attitude to NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: good contract in OR|pg||
nt|bobholl: doubt wheather it is reachable in their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: pass alerted|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S 3 down ... |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Being a passed hand, 2@H has some appeal|pg||
nt|athene: west, with a choice of splinters, picks the more economical one :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C or 6@D also comes home...... not that these should be bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: that allows a 4@D last train from partner|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty, CC says 8-11|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: South's 1@S was 11-15, so he tries 3@D, not forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite what North was hoping for, that|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is limited by 1@s opening to 15 hcps|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Peter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As one would expect as visitors to an embassy, all players are wearing ties|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a starin that must be for bridge players|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is a little unusual for most bridge players|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT seemed wiser on the North cards. He needed a heart rebid to go anywhere.|pg||
nt|dburn: these days, one would expect most of them to be wearing bombs|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: maybe they change the system:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: 3@D suggests 5-5 and 14-15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even a 4@D cue|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 @c splinter , one of twp|pg||
nt|mariner1: two|pg||
nt|hedyg: might pass this|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: hence the preference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough, takes a club lead to beat 6. Not so easy after the splinter|pg||
nt|henryb: isn't W in a forcing auction?|pg||
nt|dinos1: could E bid 3@c over 2@s?|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass may work best for S here,,,,, can he pass?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: 3@S shows 2-2 or 2-1 in @S and @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s kickback?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S kickback?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that echo..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c 3way, 1@d 0-8, 2@c natural 15+, 2@d relay|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i assume he would have if he could have|pg||
nt|bobholl: he can :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: its misfit heaven oday|pg||
nt|mariner1: slow typing :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i play 2n opening as both minors, 5-10 or 20+|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: North responded 2@H at the other table too, but South rebid 2@S.|pg||
nt|mariner1: W did well not to mention @H here|pg||
nt|petergill: Jan Jansma almost always has a beaming smile on his face and is one of the most pleasant of the world's top players. Like his three teammates, he is part of Team Orange, a ...|pg||
nt|petergill: privately sponsored arrangement in Netherlands which has lifted Netherlands into the top five countries in world bridge. |pg||
nt|mariner1: Kibbers say these are Roland Slams........... not sure they are up to the 12.86|pg||
nt|mariner1: threshold|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12.89 is the Roland slam so maybe its ok..|pg||
nt|dinos1: uc?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c was forced bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass at 2@S with Q QJ and 5332 is possible ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a new leader|pg||
nt|bobholl: 10 imps and almost even :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: Francesco Angelini now regrets the reasonable 2@H call, would rather have bid 1NT, in hindsight. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT preempted EW out of their bad @H fit. |pg||
nt|henryb: looks like two down|pg||
nt|hedyg: N has a great hand for the systemic 2NT bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit too strong imo|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: 2@S looks a better rebid to me, opposite a passed hand.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet South leads @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: 5@C 3 key-cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: well it is a 50% slam|pg||
nt|athene: very aggressive from West to bid slam off two keycards, if it was an RKCB sequence|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry only off one keycard|pg||
nt|athene: but the @SK is pretty important too|pg||
nt|dburn: well, one key card and one card that will turn out to be key|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c seems to be an answer to 4@s showing 3 keycards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you are 60 imps down, you need these slams to make |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The position of @SK doesn't matter if Versace leads anything but a club|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed not|pg||
nt|mariner1: I wonder if all the Rolands use the same level of % ?|pg||
nt|athene: with real diamonds, west could have bid 2@D directly over 1@C, surely? so he has to have something like this hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: well i dont understand these sequences|pg||
nt|dburn: and he didn't|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: We are at the Chinese embassy in Roma. His Excellency, Sun Yuxi, is a keen bridge player and has invited the two teams to play this match at the embassy. Very nice initiative!|pg||
nt|petergill: West's @S3 = UDC, shows an even number of spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the first pass of West at 1@S probably depending on agreements (of sure 2@C natural would help E/W)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think if Claudio had bid 4@S then W would have bid the game|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s leads to nowhere|pg||
nt|hedyg: Claudio already bid his hand...twice|pg||
nt|dinos1: either they X or bid game|pg||
nt|hedyg: Claudio= Nunes|pg||
nt|mariner1: totally agree with Sergey and Hedy :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h by passed hand 3d high reverse with void in pards suit looks like asking for trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 way to play this|pg||
nt|henryb: perfect if S has 5 or 6 spades don't you think|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|petergill: With partner likely to have only 5 hearts (no weak 2@H opener) and 1 or 2 spades, North was thus likely to have 3+ @D's, hence South's 3@D, playing Precision. |pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky that spades 3/3 and opps not able to double this|pg||
nt|dburn: "trouble" will occur only when partner is precisely 2=5=2=4 - he cannot have six hearts, and 2@s could lead to a ridiculous 5=1 fit instead of potentially a 5-4 diamond fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: duss tricks coming|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 finesses on and @hs 3-3..|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: at least West's bidding gave no sort of clue as to the nature of his hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: sometimes War Game Slams come home :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S would be a present - DBL and 5@C both good|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: partner did not double 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: 3@D is not a reverse in Precision, 3@d is a descriptive bid to show 14-15 HCP with 5-5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: well, west forced to slam as a passed hand so he has to be very shapely|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not double 4@c either|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c 3 - 2 and @D 3 3 with Q in pocket too|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: i guess you draw trumps and then try the diamond finesse first?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller, at the other table, won the Silver Medal in the Bermuda Bowl (i.e World Championships) as far back as 1993, and like his teammates, has frequently come between 3rd ...|pg||
nt|petergill: and 9th at World Championships playing for Netherlands, not 1st or 2nd due to Italy, USA and Norway dominating the top two medal positions. |pg||
nt|athene: the tricky part of the hand is making sure you can take advantage of 3-3 in either red suit (or the @H9 becoming useful)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: but do you agree with the 2h response in the first place?|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a strong club system, remember - North can pass 3@d if he wants to; there is no such thing as a "high reverse" playing Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I agree with David, who plays Strong Club himself|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1,900 spectators at the moment, a very good turnout on a weekday in the daytime|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure david but they are oveboard on a simple hand basically and we all want to understand why|pg||
nt|brolucius: I still don't see why one would respond 2@H on such values, facing a non-1@C opener.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (I know it's evening for you, Peter)|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h is marginal, but OK by a passed hand - 1NT might result in a final contract of 1NT with 4@h playable in a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is i think the key point david|pg||
nt|petergill: The event's website is http://www.bboitalia.it/china/|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 2h response|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you not have bid 2@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think most of us would as passed hand|pg||
nt|henryb: I would not, for what it is worth|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you do, you should pass 2@S in my opinion|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT from me. I would have thought it was normal, not a matter of debate.|pg||
nt|dburn: he could not pass 2@s, since his partner did not bid it|pg||
nt|petergill: East might have overtaken @S10 to play a @D through|pg||
nt|lestergold: Iam capable of bad bids and perhaps i have done such but i do not think it is sound|pg||
nt|petergill: West is not well placed now|pg||
nt|henryb: would have been better than leaving partner endplayed|pg||
nt|petergill: A heart gives declarer a free finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: they open 1@H with 11+ so i think 2@h by a passed hand is normal for them with this hand|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ = -1 is what he will do I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can have maximum 1 hcp more than he does|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer will go down whatever he does|pg||
nt|petergill: 200 to EW|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: maybe|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: in OR Lauria is in 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: "maybe" was supposed to be to a kibber|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: E is Zuhzwang now|pg||
nt|mariner1: Zugzwang|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: imagine partner with such as @sAKxxx  @hJxx  @dxx  @cAQx|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|mariner1: fancy name for no way out|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: 1NT gives partner the chance to pass. 2@H may carry the bidding to an awkward level, which is what happened.|pg||
nt|dburn: now, 4@h is a very reasonable vulnerable game, and 1NT is a stupid contract|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: but down two will flatten the board down one gains imps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: Zugzwang - German Chess term describing a situation where one player is put|pg||
nt|mariner1: at a disadvantage because he has to make a move - the player would like to|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass and make no move. In "Game Theory" it specifically means a win is|pg||
nt|mariner1: changed to a loss.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|c7|nt|mariner1: probably a push there,,,,,,|pg||
nt|athene: north is likely to open in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: discarding @d on @s..|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room Italy is in the Moysian 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: so the auction will be very different - it might be much harder for E-W actually|pg||
nt|petergill: Lorenzo Lauria is by far the oldest of the Italian superstars, aged early 60s. He won World Championships for Italy about 30 years ago, took a break from bridge in the late 1980s ...|pg||
nt|petergill: when he joined a huge cult in Oregon, and returned to form a partnership with Versace which Americans would describe as Europe's best pair and some Europeans might describe as the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: world's best pair.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: so Italy should make an imp or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is playing to make 4@H of course, not worried about overtricks|pg||

nt|snorris: 1 nt east anyone?|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems making 5 easy too|pg||
nt|daman: every time|pg||
nt|mowen: not exactly opportunities for brilliances are there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|daman: single dummy plays mostly|pg||

nt|hedyg: missed the grand in OR|pg||
nt|dburn: a 5=3=2=3 14 count is not a "perfecto", just an ordinary hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well what an overwhelming hand here|pg||
nt|henryb: one should be able to reach 7 with 37 HCK and 13 tricks in top cards|pg||
nt|athene: and with a club void he might not bid rkcb|pg||
nt|athene: so i guess something like 6511 or 7411 was a lively possibility|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H NS seems normal here|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that will act as a shot of Dutch courage, so to speak|pg||
nt|petergill: I like Henry's comment - I don't like systemically opening 2NT opening on those cards. |pg||
nt|bobholl: !Next (joey says)|pg||
nt|mariner1: could we have a closer match.... nice|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: 1@c 16+ any|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to reach the grand, I suspect.|pg||
nt|lestergold: grand available in er.....4 denominations|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@S would not have been redoubled - it was a key-card ask|pg||
nt|mariner1: an abreticular comment, mine|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S here in Open|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: why not 5?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @CJ is very helpful and difficult for North to visualize if he does not receive club support at some stage.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh not spades|pg||
nt|dburn: you can't quite make seven spades - West has a long trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 7s almost qualiies for a roland grand i suppose|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT 13+ balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but still, good for the match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H also reached in Open Room|pg||
nt|athene: when East passes over a strong @C at these colours, you know he's balanced :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like it will be a push though|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S seems too much|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dburn: but three of the partnership's four jacks are working very hard - still, as Henry says, they do have 37 Miltons|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n it must be|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N good spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N I think here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: 3@d surely some relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 15 playing tricks 16 with the spade finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, that @hJ isn't necessary - declarer has 1=3=4=5 in terms of tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another three rounds of bidding, ending in 6NT, is my prediction.... (not sticking my neck out, really).|pg||
nt|petergill: Angelini already knows they have 36+ HCP|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry miscounted only 15 with the finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: they will end up in 7NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: in suit contract ruff out spade for 16 tricksw|pg||
nt|hedyg: great dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H 11-15, 5+ @H's|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@S gf relay ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s???|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told 1@S is GF here|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: i think so|pg||
nt|petergill: Our BBO operators are Simon and Robin Fellus, who have played in junior World Championships representing Italy, but both have a long way to go, to reach the World Champion status ...|pg||
nt|petergill: of the players we have been watching. |pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = 8-12 balanced, apparently|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead won't trouble declarer unduly|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: thank u peter:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: an elfce, duss, or baikce of tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: very long way to road:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Jan Jansma often plays with Louk Verhees - they both are in big demand at America's three Nationals as popular pro bridge players - I don't know if EW here is an occasional ...|pg||
nt|petergill: partnership or a new partnership. |pg||
nt|hedyg: new partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hard to see any swing here - @HK, @C, @D to lose|pg||
nt|dinos1: 24pc with good intermediates|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass of North is a forcing bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think over 1 year now|pg||
nt|mariner1: the mirrored red cards hurts,, though W has all the missing goodies except Q@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@S relay, GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: also told 2sp shows shortness in spades and 1 suiter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl by East is takeout|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: yessss!!!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yikes!|pg||
nt|dburn: good prediction, David|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...that is 1 way to get there|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a bushell of imps|pg||
nt|hedyg: but i dont recommend it|pg||
nt|lestergold: wheelbarrow needed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 13|pg||
nt|brolucius: My prediction could hardly have been more wrong. Only one more bid and they ended in seven. Well done!|pg||
nt|dburn: as the great Murray Walker once remarked, "I don't make mistakes. I just make prophecies that immediately turn out to be wrong."|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to ensure he ruffs a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT Relay|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 6@C might not hold ....... E seems to have the killing lead|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D is the spot :) put the non-@SAK on lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d never entered the picture|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers saying E should DBL,, no way he should|pg||
nt|petergill: If you want to see the players records, go to http://www.worldbridge.org/people/ and follow the instructions there|pg||
nt|mariner1: E can't be sure those @S will cash|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb: I think Mike should return to school for remedial counting and spelling|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there it is|pg||
nt|dburn: will be concerned about 4-1 clubs, but not much he can do about it|pg||
nt|mariner1: now E might DBL|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure you even double this|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzbg: versace's claim|pg||
nt|dinos1: X = 2/3 cards?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D is exact 2533|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = 2533 |pg||
nt|henryb: so this is a relay, and 2@s presumably shows a @h one suiter, 2N relay, and 3@d = 2-5-3-3 distribution|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the evitable final spot|pg||
nt|athene: suppose they then run to 7@D and partner starts thinking hard about his lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: big hand sitting behind S should slow this down, though it did not in Open Room|pg||
nt|bobholl: things are getting worse for dutchmen :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: i think 2@s shows a maximum hand|pg||
nt|henryb: similar to symmetric relay or "Ultimate @c"|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: with @C lead?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: W in never land now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: i am certain you do, both showed balanced hands|pg||
nt|athene: they could very easily make 7@D on a heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: and you know partner has nothing and will have a guess between the majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: no way E if on lead was not trying a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: For an interview with Lauria, ref http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Paris.01/Bulletins/24WedPg5.htm|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but you aren't on lead against diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H X C is never nice to compare :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 2@H is more difficult :) made are game !|pg||
nt|dinos1: ))|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no DBL|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems pass of 2M isnt forc|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not 2@s by S?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb: a @c lead would have been more effective|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@s is fine if K@D is in N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't know - |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: actually welcomes the @H back|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: and that is where it seems to be|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: or by N|pg||
nt|bobholl: they make 4@S in the other room so dutchmen :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4 @S made too so a huge board for Netherlands|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @D in East, or Qxx in @S in East and 4@S was down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: as bridge players we all have to be a little Harpaxophobic|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey studied good and bad leads against 3NT and concluded that AJxx, K10xx, Q9xx and J8xx tend to be losing leads. |pg||
pc|c2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting|pg||
nt|mariner1: with @c lead you "could" duck 1st @c, win 2nd @c, duck a @S, win 3rd @c and run 5@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: watching them squirm as they have to hold the Ax and Kx of @D,,,,,,,, not that|pg||
nt|mariner1: this line would be found.........|pg||
nt|petergill: You'd have to buy Kit's software to find more info about his studies of thousands of possible hands, from which he drew that conclusion|pg||

nt|brolucius: I don't see that 3@D can have told North what he needed to know. Perhaps the VG operator is playing a joke on us.|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table's bidding is hard to understand - perhaps 1@C Dutch/Swedish style, 1@D = 4+ @H, 2@C = GF, the rest = even harder to guess the meanings. |pg||
nt|lestergold: but i successfullyu taught others to...|pg||
nt|mariner1: with the caveat that those lead issues change often with the auction including|pg||
nt|mariner1: what was not bid...........|pg||
nt|athene: i think that was a terrible double at imps, to be honest :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 13-15|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see a little action here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: taught a chap called townsend to count to 13|pg||
nt|dburn: it may be, uncharitable though it sounds, that North was unsure of exactly how to conduct the remainder of the auction according to his methods, so simply bid what he thought he ...|pg||
nt|dburn: could make|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knows they needs the imps and as Hedy said sound like NS are|pg||
nt|mariner1: balanced........|pg||
nt|bobholl: fearless :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt for N/S are made with this distribution|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C of course for Majors|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|an|Fité|nt|henryb: or rather what he thought his partner could make|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: you mean he punted it david i think!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South in 3@D in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|athene: once E-W bid and support spades, north can come to life with a double|pg||
nt|mariner1: not everyone's 1@C opener in W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D ask the longer of Mjors|pg||
nt|bobholl: 65 come alive but with passed partner :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: X now?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl now depending on agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if you need to find an extra trick from somewhere, you could do worse than put Versace in charge of finding it|pg||
nt|henryb: that is what I was thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: even versace would have had difficulty if the extra trick was robbed by being cashed on an opening lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: yo all like the 2@s bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: you*|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting hand to play - win @DA, perhaps a @H next?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the W hand was unlimited when he bid it..|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind it - 2@h if Michaels would be OK, but may not be on the menu|pg||
nt|athene: pass? wow|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 16+ any shape|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here,,,,,,,,,, someone shoved too high maybe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: tempting to double 2@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this dbl at second round may be is penalty|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 3@D here in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: straightforward 2@h contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: 1nt = 16-18|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d transfer|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 16-18|pg||
nt|petergill: For an interview with Alfredo Versace, plus a photo of him (a few years ago) and info about how the Angelini team came into existence, go to http://www.clairebri...|pg||
nt|petergill: dge.com/textes/versace.pdf|pg||
nt|mariner1: no shoving,,,, very polite :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps you need the agreement that if they run to 7@D in that situation, you pass with hearts and double with spades (or vice versa)|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/versace.pdf|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: 2@S is bold - I doubt if he would have bid 2@S if he were vulnerable. |pg||
nt|petergill: Ducking @DK is fine|pg||
nt|hedyg: all his points are outside his suit|pg||
nt|dburn: double, if takeout of hearts, would not be wrong either, but you can't just pass with a five-card spade suit and an opening bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: last bd OR stopped in 3NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: N will lead @d - from honor|pg||
nt|mariner1: defense is all about the lead here,,,,,,, and/or a timely switch|pg||
nt|bobholl: doubled part scores trump :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: so much for my action :(|pg||
nt|athene: when people open these nebulous clubs (and diamonds, in strong club systems), it's important not to get talked out of competing, just because you hold the minor they bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@S has little play|pg||
nt|athene: the hand can still be a big fit or double-fit hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the killing lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: if my pd opens NT I lead from honor ;-)))|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: It's not a strong club system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They open all 11-13 balanced hands 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very much like Polish Club|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|petergill: East might now play something that helps you. |pg||
nt|brolucius: It's the second deal onwhich Angelini has chosen to bid a five-card spade suit, rather than a take-out bid. Perfectly reasonable when spades is the only suit in which you can play ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: at the two-level.|pg||
nt|athene: sure, but the same idea often applies after a nebulous Precision 1@D opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And is known as Orange Club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: if you balance later, partner will never play you for that much|pg||
nt|imp_jan: just try to keep low on this one|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: Good play of @SQ, with East fairly likely to have @SK on the bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT showed maximum and fit|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT max bal with @H support |pg||
nt|henryb: overbidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D re-transfer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: too high it seems|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: the more honors you have the more likely he is to have in the other suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not the best lead, but normal - @D with the K seem more right, but remember they play weak NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: lead didint lose a trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: now N can score his trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: nothing "seems" right except when we see all cards|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: Not home yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: was the 5cl a better play than the ten?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 4@D does set up in W|pg||
nt|petergill: If the match gets any closer than 23 imps, for the last of the five segments in this match later today, I would expect to see Lauria - Versace and Fantoni - Nunes be Italy's ...|pg||
nt|petergill: lineup. |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: 10 imps the margin now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb: I suspect that when the clubs were so friendly, declarer should have played trumps|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: when?|pg||
nt|henryb: I really do not think with only three trumps opener should be aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: after ruffing the 3rd one|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: @C10 would be ruffed and leave him with 5 more losers, - but anyway after @C5 the defence can and should get the defence right. |pg||
nt|dburn: right? what can they do?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mariner1: so it turns out the DBL won no extra imps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

nt|henryb: with only 8 trumps you do not want to push; with 9 you do|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see a dbl part score swing there....... or a make set|pg||
nt|mariner1: so another lead change|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11 imps back|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West's 2@D transfer meant that his last two cards were hearts, so the diamond should have been run.|pg||
nt|henryb: remember the LAW|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS nice spot,,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: can NS make 3N here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D here?|pg||
nt|dinos1: nice match :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: I;m probably wrong - he was probably cold after the club ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here......... aggression does not work this time|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace played @C5 then @C4 then @C2, which is why Angelini switched to @S's not trumps. |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: NS system is at http://tinyurl.com/4hsqy8 |pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@s still ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has an interesting problem over 5@C|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@h is -4|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS stopped in 5@D here  in Open Room|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 14+ f1|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Versace could have opened 2@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: many would open with W|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb: No, that was Versace|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could, but first in hand vulnerable it is easy to see why he did not|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10-15 6@c or 5@c+4@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: When vulnerable? With those major-suit honours...|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 4+@ds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzbg: 2@D alerted|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: solved,, he did not want to defend|pg||

nt|hedyg: dont you love spotcards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c gf|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|henryb: passed up 800 for 650|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry - oddly enough, despite what everyone thinks, that's not what the original book by Larry Cohen on LoTT says - I was reading that very book last night .|pg||
nt|athene: now the diamond finesse first keeps the hearts protected|pg||
nt|mariner1: the line means a lot here.. needs to attack @D 1st|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|mariner1: knock out E's entries before @H are setup|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: @H lead, take @d finesse into safe hand - East might duck @d to try to preserve his entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: what else could he play from dummy?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT= even nr of keycards?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|dburn: good stop - just three aces to lose on the face of it, but a diamond lead might have led to loss of trump control|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead?|pg||
nt|dinos1: turbo?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: awkward hand for West|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but passing 2@S may prove more prudent|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes passed over 2@s, no 2NT bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces and a renonce ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: i don't know if they play turbo|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: @H4 by West  = upside down count, lowest of 2 or 4 cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: he might be a Clubophile :)|pg||
nt|athene: now East knows he can't drop declarer's @HA|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d back? passive?|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in Open Room are in 2N here|pg||
nt|petergill: so East can tell from @H4 that West has only two hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: duck the @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: too late for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: sure:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: i think it was better:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: E is now in that famous Zugzwang postion|pg||
nt|athene: he might try something like the @CK, trying to force an entry to partner's hand |pg||
nt|mariner1: position|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really think he did not duck the @D cause did not what to play later|pg||
nt|athene: or @SK with the same idea|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|dinos1: and no @sK rite?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: then 2 key :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 2 key without control in @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 4@H keycards|pg||
nt|bobholl: fear 13 to italy :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: might have done better to pass 2@s - that would probably have made, but it wasn't so easy with his values|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: and there is the @H shift,,,, not that 2n had much chance anyway|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: If 2@D showed hearts, then diamonds was the unbid suit and might well have been led.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well some restarined bidding here but defence have to do well to beat 4 of amajor get dim forcfe going in time|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: and there are other ways in which the defence can come to a fourth trick|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = any minimum in Angelini system|pg||
nt|mariner1: Zugzwang for bridge is constantly being endplayed|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is NOT endplayed|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|athene: declarer getting cute with the "unblock" from dummy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: hedy he is zugwanged though close as it gets|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of club to nine. |pg||
nt|hedyg: well we asked for exciting boards|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and we got them this session :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: we got them)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes these sort of poker plays can cause over-imaginative defenders to switch hastily|pg||
nt|athene: in one book Terence Reese says that if your LHO lays down the ace of a suit where you have Kx in dummy and xxx in hand, you can try unblocking "gravely" with the King|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bboitalia.it/china/  Tournament website|pg||
nt|petergill: NS system card is at http://tinyurl.com/4hsqy8|pg||
nt|petergill: Francesco Angelini playing this well. |pg||
nt|athene: declarer might lead the @CJ, playing for 3-3?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @S @C ?|pg||
nt|dinos1: just fin|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mariner1: Bill so Reese was offering a play of randominity?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence seems to have been deterred at least temporarily from playing any more hearts - that diamond might have been a bad idea if West had QJ9x rather than QJ7x|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: How were they meant to find a heart fit, in that case?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten cold tricks now|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|petergill: William makes a good point|pg||

nt|petergill: This is the vital moment|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|nt|athene: usually in this situation you look at the OTHER defender's pitches|pg||

nt|bobholl: nicely bid but was 4@H RKC or 4NT rkc ?|pg||

nt|mariner1: best defense does get 5@C for 800 however 500 was  a real possibility too|pg||
nt|mariner1: so it closes the match up nicely|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Some pairs play that a responsive double (see auction at the other table) denies four cards in the unbid major. Seems that Fantoni-Nunes do not play that.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: no no|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: i had to go to the bathroom:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: Jansma will rebid 3@c i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: A@H on side helps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: he is super maximum for his opening|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c will almost certainly be insufficient|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT isn't a bad shot, given the scoreline|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cute 1NT|pg||
nt|dburn: sinc Versace is unlikely to allow West to bid at the three level at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT=transfer to @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubt it|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N is an interesting comic bid|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose he might try 2@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Simon|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might actually help versace now - he might envisage the @SK onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: confusion bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace might think @H's 2-5 so clubs 4-2 the other way. Not a bad idea at all. |pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: sorry|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: 1NT? Crumbs|pg||
nt|lestergold: so italians need a plus score to maintain their lead|pg||
nt|dburn: or even 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure he will brush it contemptuously aside and show his normal spade raise anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: 2nt= @S support|pg||
nt|hedyg: might confuse his partner..|pg||
nt|dburn: which will leave Jansma wondering exactly what is going on|pg||
nt|dburn: but may mean that the final contract (whatever it is) will be doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: an unusual opening|pg||
nt|athene: jansma can guess that 1nt is creative but he doesn't know if it's based on diamonds or hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes W is wondering if he picked up the right hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either way, 3@C looks ok...not sure what double is|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N NS works here in S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 12-15 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW it seems here|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Perhaps he has a heart in with the clubs.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 12+ to 15|pg||
nt|henryb: will Versace balance with 2@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the system describes that as "good 12-15"|pg||
nt|hedyg: "balanced or semibalanced"|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i would prefer 3@C over 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL = do something intelligent|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S= normal Michaels (@H+minor)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: y|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not 6@D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: np :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: mixed up a spade with his club|pg||
nt|dburn: still, North doesn't have to have as much as he does for a non-vulnerable 1@s overcall, so the aroma of rat will not necessarily have reached the Western nostrils|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace's clever play was a discovery play to find out if West has a singleton heart as early as possible|pg||
nt|imp_jan: dull 3n|pg||
nt|hedyg: from N and from S!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S now super call|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: so I guess he has the right number of points, but...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Dbl = take-out|pg||
nt|henryb: back to weak hands for Versace. He did not maximize when he had values, so Brigidda does not trust him with good cards|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: this isn't the auction East was dreaming of when he tried 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now the doubling will start |pg||
nt|Walddk8: Maybe East can escape for 300 in 5@DX, although it can be seet 500|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs saying 6@h makes too, but 6@d far better|pg||
nt|athene: normally you wouldn't be happy to hear about a void facing your @CAK|pg||
nt|bobholl: kib says : 4@H cue, 4NT= 2 or 4 key cards, with 5 aces|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d shift for trump promotion now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: a couple back here|pg||
nt|dinos1: if not then -1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: more takeout doubles|pg||
nt|lestergold: is the lucky angeline gonna land on feet again|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl by East also take-out|pg||
nt|henryb: lets hope he reads it|pg||
nt|brolucius: De Wijs is now wishing that he had not bid in the first place.|pg||
nt|dburn: but this may lead to a lower level of competition, so that North-South could buy it in 3@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C - 3@H I expect|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry David|pg||
nt|lestergold: blue murder if this is allowed|pg||
nt|dburn: why would he wish that? he has a decent hand for clubs - assuming he interprets Muller's double correctly|pg||
nt|henryb: what does color have to do with murder?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S was a very good bid,,, N might not have thought so though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: its an expression derived from mists of time so i dont honestly know|pg||
nt|brolucius: Would he think so long if he had read the double as for take-out?|pg||
nt|dburn: but there is trouble now - 5@d will not gladden Jansma's heart greatly|pg||
nt|bobholl: could be 2 back to holland :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: 1@C 16+, 1@D 0-7, 1NT 16-18|pg||
nt|mariner1: where is Roland's Slow Play list.....we have Muller and the Open is 3 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Stayman|pg||
nt|mariner1: back,,,,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, remember about leads from AJxx!|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, 1@D 0-8 or 9 if less than 2 controls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume 2 down|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: North can justify 3@H now. yes, he had bid it.|pg||
nt|hedyg: can still consider all possibilities|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 3 it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Maybe not|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of auction is why it's surely better to show the side-suit FIRST with the West hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace knows what is going on|pg||
nt|athene: and then double later to show extra values if you really must|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but it is not so clear for Versace not to lead the ace of spades|pg||
nt|arrigo: 2off|pg||
nt|mariner1: true takes perfect defense to get in -3|pg||
nt|Walddk8: It's 3 off on a heart lead|pg||
nt|arrigo: or 3?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I thought Roland included Muller in his list of very slow methodical players......|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he is in the top 5|pg||
nt|athene: but Versace can see the clubs might be very useful for fast spade discards|pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, Muller as South bid 3@S directly over 2@S |pg||
nt|mariner1: well 5@D reasonable, is the door open though?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: promotion of 10 in @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: with @C lead migth make :(|pg||
nt|dinos1: @c or @s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: K@s best here, hard to tell|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think N could have bid 4@s showing controls in @C, @H and @S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|petergill: Simon De Wijs might be wondering why Bauke Muller (renowned for slow play) has been playing so fast today. :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: schön geburstag!|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like italians are dancing on air- opening one of thebentest no trumps ive ever seen and then finding a nine card heart fit afterwards|pg||
nt|henryb: No masterpoints or money at stake!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry priv|pg||
nt|dburn: but the three of clubs is OK - a heart was not vital at trick one|pg||
nt|imp_jan: previous brd fantoni went down in 3n after heart lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 37 Fantoni went off in 3NT on a @h lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: that was 10 imps|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing fast has not added to his IMP total appreciably.|pg||
nt|dburn: however, a trump is vital now, and that is perhaps also not so easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: in the 1st session I thought the Netherlands lost it because of a lack of|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggression (or a slow start as they say) since it seems they have stepped it up a|pg||
nt|mariner1: notch and are coming back|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will have to trust the @cs coming in and play another @s|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 37 against weaker opponents, Fantoni would probably have tried a low spade from dummy at Trick 2 (smooth duck by N needed), but against this opposition he preferred to run ...|pg||
nt|petergill: his long suit. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1st session I 59  N  3, 2nd I 20  N 32, and here so far I 11  N 23|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, dodging the trap of 3NT by North. If the red suits are unfriendly, 6@d would go down. |pg||
nt|dinos1: now pull @s and sqz E|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs didn't do a wise thing :(|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh, no sqz sry|pg||
nt|dinos1: just 10 tricks)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the declarer don't see the cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can play for A in @D in West and finesse in @S ....|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl may rely on fin !f@dQ and @sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: W cannot have A@D|pg||
nt|dinos1: W showed @hAK so @dA is rather on E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or Q in @D in West|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is totally impossible that W passed with AK@H and A@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be it was muller who should have played J of @H on 2nd round ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to play AK in @S is winning only finding Qx in @S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|henryb: I don't think the Dutch here have been playing badly|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: @H lead allowed them to split their trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 38 they stopped in 2@H|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer needs to draw trumps before ruffing @D's - which looks best play to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a trump and an overtake by S also not easy|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|dburn: especially since South will need to overtake it with the ace in order to play a heart|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb: the big loss was the grand, and that was certainly not within their control|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Defence can prevail now|pg||
nt|lestergold: my distinguished etymologist pal mr. Graham informs me that the french word morbleu has given rise to the english play on words blue murder|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes - decided for 2 fins|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Not any more|pg||
nt|dburn: that is one possibility, certainly|pg||
nt|petergill: Needed to duck the club, play @D ruffed by @HQ, exit in @H - then no squeeze on East I think|pg||

nt|brolucius: Looking at the trump suit in isolation, the low switch from @HQ-x set up a possible losing finesse for declarer on the second round (if he read Wesr for @HQ-10-x).|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@H does play well here as in Open Room|pg||
nt|imp_jan: partscore battle now|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pretty good on the NS cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: type of slam you might bid in MP needing a good score...... if STOM called for it|pg||
nt|mariner1: in IMPS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: North have the minimum of the open of 2@H - 9/12 hcp|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5+@h unbal|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: upgraded|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one argument against slam is that the other table might be down in 3nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: Angelini never even gacv that popssibnility a tank did he?|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S 11-15, 5+ spades|pg||
nt|dburn: normal result from the other table, though not a bad one for the Netherlands - 4@h is not a wonderful contract, but likely to be bid and unlikely to be beaten|pg||
nt|athene: so you might do just fine in 5@D anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: now EW have a slam|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|mariner1: interesting that S in Open Room bid 1N and not 1@S over 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c was 16+|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S DBL would work here|pg||
nt|bobholl: imps back :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: over-cautious of north to pass 1@S, in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 56 OR in ................5@d|pg||
nt|athene: he has a great suit, NV, and didn't open a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H isn't going to be hurt and might inconvenience opps|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: Borderline double, vulnerable and with only three cards in the unbid major.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT may have shown spades|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, if South tries 3NT and North trustingly passes - or if South passes 3@h...|pg||
nt|hedyg: that might show @s|pg||
nt|dburn: which isn't absurd in a non-strong-club context...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7411 is not a no-trump shape|pg||
nt|mariner1: N can't sit for 3N I do not believe|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Not only may have, 1NT did indeed show 4+ spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a shape known as a swan |pg||
nt|Walddk8: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: not usually, no, but 3NT is a firm statement of opinion, and South did bid spades, and North does have plenty in the minors and non-great hearts...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...so it would not be utterly ridiculous to pass 3NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D has play, 6@S not so much|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is the best - 5@D are down with the ruff in @S|pg||
nt|dinos1: clear bid by E|pg||
nt|dinos1: again match is close :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but a man who could open 1nt on that suit oriented hand plays his own game|pg||
nt|hedyg: E lying low|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1NT and 2@C both natural in Angelini's system|pg||
nt|henryb: as E isn't that exactly what you want to hear from partner? a takeout double when you are 5=3=3=2|pg||
nt|dburn: and he did, and I can't say I blame him all that much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently a 7411 hand is known as an eau de cologne hand in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT would be a firmer statement if south had more room to probe subtley|pg||
nt|bridge_one: standard lead by italian|pg||
nt|mariner1: back to a 2 imp match|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: of course slam not really the right %|pg||
nt|petergill: Italians tend to bid more on shapely hands, and bid conservatively on 6322 or 5332 i.e. flatter hand shapes|pg||
nt|bobholl: we see that @D are not 30 but he :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: N wd bid with void|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can duck to make 10 tricks ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so means Muller isn't tired :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: that is 4711|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: certainly East will be pleased with the course the auction has taken|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - North has given a pretty fair description|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk8: 4711   a perfume brand I believe|pg||
nt|athene: if partner bids 3NT when he has lots of other 3-level bids, then you are much more inclined to pass it|pg||
nt|mariner1: no convenient entry to W to use the D as a pitch|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Known as Kölnisches Wasser (whater from Cologne)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: but south didn't have that much room over 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Good auction to the best contract|pg||
nt|athene: the @C10 looks strange|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes correct spot|pg||
nt|athene: is that some sort of extremely cunning card?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well this doesnt look like a happy fightinmg chicken|pg||
nt|dburn: I was concerned for a moment that he might end up as declarer in 2@h|pg||
nt|henryb: If N had passed, he might have ended up defending 2@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: all those who never played in a 3-3 fit raise their hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: but playing on clubs might generate a little help for declarer with clubs acting as surrogate trumps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk8: water even|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c now?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play odd encourage|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: both on partner's lead and as 1st discard - ODD ENCOURAGE|pg||
nt|hedyg: odd and low|pg||
nt|petergill: even suit pref - so @C10 suggested the heart singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: Muller bid 3@c over 1@H-p- and is playing there|pg||
nt|petergill: so Netherlands is about to take the lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|hedyg: http://www.bboitalia.it/china/|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller played @SQ (not @Sx) so that @S9 might become an entry later |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, Versace might have bid 4@h himself, since one of the side suits was likely to be a problem in 3NT, but...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|hedyg: oooooops|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: good switch|pg||
nt|petergill: EW lead 3rd and 5th versus suits, so West cannot count the @H position yet|pg||
nt|mariner1: well there is the pitch anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: NS system is at http://tinyurl.com/4hsqy8 |pg||
nt|mariner1: lack of aggression put Netherlands in a big hole early in the 1st session,|pg||
nt|mariner1: reasonably strong aggression has brought them back into the lead it seems|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: well, he may take the view that East would have bid 2@h over 2@c with a few values and @hQxxx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk8: But 4 spades 7 hearts 1 diamond 1 club is the genuine perfume hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he played 6 and 8@D, cannot have a doubleton|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: I think North missed that South played @D6 then @D8, so did not have a doubleton @D|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a top class Netherlands team, so the scoreline is quite remarkable. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: It is Francesco Angelini's system, which Versace plays when he plays with Angelini|pg||
nt|hedyg: or was it lack of aggression by Italy?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|dburn: ...I can't truthfully say I would not have duplicated this auction|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|dburn: not really - the Italians aren't bad either|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 tricks the limit|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 100 not so bad considering|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|petergill: yes, 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: could Versace have ducked the lead?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: but no swing|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: Versace isn't having a good set...slam through on a difficult lead guess; makeable 4@H down on a reasonable wrong view|pg||

nt|hedyg: would that have made sense?|pg||
nt|dburn: he could have ducked the lead, but a spade return and a diamond shift would set him anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW straight ahead|pg||
nt|dburn: so he had to hope to lose a heart to West, not East|pg||
nt|hedyg: 200 better|pg||
nt|petergill: North will be happy that the contract went down anyway, after his little lapse. |pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL even worse :)|pg||
nt|petergill: only if South passes the Dbl. |pg||

nt|mariner1: EW in 2N here in Open Room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb: and they have 10 opposite a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: some kibbers saying 6@H however I do not see that being bid|pg||

nt|hedyg: 9-13 unbalanced|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: entirely different auction in Open Room however they bid it easy enough|pg||
nt|dburn: and no, it would not have made sense to duck the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@H is pre-emptive. West would bid 2@S with a sound raise of hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: they might play 2@d showing 5@hs and 2@H showing 5@H +@s|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H preemptive|pg||
nt|lestergold: childs play for versace doing well to stay out of failing 4s|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H+2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on that lead childs play for even me|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Even with clubs 3-3, the @D lead skewers 3NT as long as the defence is careful in clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: don't EW use 1@C for all balanced hands up 13 and below?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT=invite+|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: still, good to see Netherlands launching a recovery |pg||

nt|petergill: Heading for 6@H now|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh he is awake :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: the problem is, that having doubled 4@D, north will have to pass 6@H rather than Lightner double it|pg||
nt|athene: so he will only get 200 rather than 500, on the diamond lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: how sad|pg||

pc|cA|nt|hedyg: Lauria in 4@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Paulissen must be wondering what  Angelini's Dbl was all about|pg||
nt|mariner1: should E have picked up on the @D DBL being a void?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@d preferential for @s return|pg||
nt|petergill: Great Dbl by Francesco Angelini to re-take the lead|pg||
nt|diumraid: ****  LIVE  IN RUNNING from LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 58, SCOTLAND 50, IRELAND 49, ENGLAND 43, CBAI 42,  WALES 33  *****|pg||
nt|athene: normally it's pretty obvious what to return, but here, north might sometimes be playing south for a club void|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he would lead his smallest @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: he led his highest for @s|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps East underestimated Angelini. When Angelini played for Italy in the European Championships last year, he was not at his best, so the other Europeans might underestimate his ...|pg||
nt|petergill: craftiness. |pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: With trumps 4-1 and clubs 6-1 offside, making 6@h was going to be very hard anyway|pg||

nt|hedyg: you missed the fun|pg||
nt|dburn: remains only to see whether Paulissen plays for a swing by cashing @sA and running the jack|pg||
nt|dburn: his actual percentage shot (on a diamond return) is low to the jack, in case of @sQxxx in North|pg||
nt|hedyg: well what else would you call a system played by Wijs-Muller?|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead there|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: but he may choose to go the other way, given the state of things|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Gert Paulissen probably thought Angelini had something like Q109xx in @D's which would not be much of a Dbl, would it?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: J of @C but not easy|pg||
nt|dinos1: if @cJ then @cA next|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mariner1: Jungle|pg||
nt|athene: south's bidding on this board in the two rooms highlights a real difference in philosophy between the two teams - the italians tend not to make 2-suited overcalls unless they think ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: orthree|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT=14-15 short @c|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT = various hands, 3@C relay, 3@H good raise with short clubs I think|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: E describing hand, strength and shape|pg||
nt|petergill: My guess is that by now East has shown 4333 with 4 spades, 9-11 - or something like that. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s is no longer relay|pg||
nt|imp_jan: after 3@d fitshowing there is a case for east to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: several lines,,, and 3 3 @S means they all should work|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: Hard to imagine that they can eventually discover about the @CJ. Thanks heavens I never had to learn a system of this sort.|pg||
nt|petergill: All this thinking by West (about a slam?) suggests that East has shown 11-12 or 11-13 with 4333|pg||
nt|brolucius: In most such systems a bid of 6NT means 'We went off the rails somewhere but this may be an OK spot.'|pg||
nt|dinos1: signal)|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: that's one way|pg||

nt|lestergold: but stayed in nice safe spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Chinese ambassador has perhaps promised a prize for the longest auction.|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 4@D forced 4@H as a prelude to a signoff|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland will be very disappointed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: I've played about eight different relay systems, and two of them used 4@D as a trigger to sign off in game. |pg||
nt|hedyg: at least after 4@H if not before|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if they carried onm to slam it would have won the pize for sure ... hands down|pg||

nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: W had bid his hand already|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe even more than his hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 4@H here in Open Room|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5 boards, and only 8 imps diff|pg||
nt|mariner1: we finish with board 80|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: 2@S played well on the Moysian, will they find it here?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: previous brd ew had no chance in cr after south opened with a 14-16 nt...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT or not?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: And 8 aspirins afterwards, to get rid of the headache.|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: An "intra-finesse" would have been posslble in trumps anyway - finesse @H9, then run the jack. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D Precision|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S in Open Room here|pg||
mb|r|nt|hedyg: 1@d=@H|pg||
nt|petergill: 11-15 short in @D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: 4@S here too now|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H was an alternative to 3@S i think|pg||
nt|petergill: Bridge is a funny game - in a way, Muller won Bd 57 by bidding more than Versace, then lost Bd 58 by bidding more than Versace. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C fit showing I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: time for Muller to slow down so we can get comparisons|pg||
nt|lestergold: Angelin has opened a normal no trump heavans above|pg||
nt|dburn: up to a point, Lord Copper - but 3@s ought to have some meaning other than "I hope they don't bid 4@h because I won't know what to do over it"|pg||
nt|hedyg: or not........|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably negative|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: 1NT 12+ -15, can be offshape occasionally|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he mis-sorted his hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably thought that one of his clubs was a spade|pg||
nt|dburn: may need to view this well|pg||
nt|dburn: if he runs @c9, for example, should West duck it?|pg||
nt|petergill: No fussing about - Vercsace goes straight to the obvious game, opposite 12 -15|pg||
nt|petergill: @HK or @H8?|pg||
nt|petergill: so Alfredo Versace expects about 4 spades on his right|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11-15 hcp, 3-suiter, short .. (4414, 4/315, 4405|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: and he knows that @d's are 5-1|pg||
nt|henryb: he will be content to go down 1|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D either 4414 or 4315 or 3415 or 4405. |pg||
nt|hedyg: good lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: some now play 4@d over 3@H as in leaping Michaels, giving up on the @d 1suiter|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|hedyg: lol David|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: it's more use when opps open 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 5 boards to go with this line-up, then for the last 16 boards of the match, we expect Italy to play their four superstars Lauria - Versace and Fantoni - Nunes.  |pg||
nt|athene: if they open 3@H you do at least have 4@H which stays below 4@S|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@h=|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a possible p/u for Netherlands her|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Whenever the opponents open a 4441 bid, you have to bid carefully, since your trumps will break 4-1 or worse. |pg||
nt|mariner1: on 41 in Open Room Netherlands is in a spicy 3N NS,,, here it was a close 2@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: -100 Netherlands playing|pg||
nt|petergill: South wants to make his little trumps by trumping @H's |pg||
nt|petergill: Muller would play @CQ next if he could be sure that South is not void in clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well NS have the majority of the points but RED stops their calls|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is w bidding the same hand we see here?|pg||
nt|dburn: instead, it ought to mean "if everything you have is in spades and diamonds, you should bid 4@s, but if you have other stuff, maybe you should not"|pg||
nt|dburn: sure he is|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller likes to mull over awkward problems like this one - he has played fast throughout this event - we have to allow him one slow play|pg||
nt|henryb: only @sAK and a third @s would allow this to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is working out off 1 or is there a chance to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@c multi-way, 1@d shows hearts, 1@h shows support, etc.|pg||
nt|athene: but if they open 3@S it's certaily worth while playing 4minor as non-leaping michaels|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: and it works over 3m as well|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C aimed to get partner to save if EW had a double fit in @c and @H|pg||
nt|dinos1: if W had 3@d and 3@c then S shd open @d now|pg||
nt|dinos1: I meanag 4@h|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: @HK = good play|pg||
nt|hedyg: could the lead not be from J10?|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellhe mut play KH now  and then he ha guessed well|pg||
nt|petergill: EW usually lead 3rd and 5th vs suits, but West didn't want to waste @H9 at trick 1, making it hard for East to picture the whole hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: that 3NT was -3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brolucius: Angelini has played pretty well so far. If he manages to make this, he can be well pleased with his session.|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries to dummy are awkward|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly it could - not so clear to go up with the king, but a good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: niow kill point on second club lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: is east thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: he cant bge|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, East needs to consider the possibility that West actually has the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: he cant afford to think|pg||
nt|petergill: Muller has to consider if 4 @H's and @CA are running|pg||
nt|lestergold: must play low in tempo|pg||
nt|petergill: They play low encourage|pg||
nt|hedyg: but maybe he does not have Q@H and that @c is his 9th trick?|pg||
nt|dburn: of course he can be - how would declarer play with @sAKx  @hxxx  @dAKJ10 @cxxx ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East is running out of time to play low in tempo.|pg||
nt|lestergold: need to have done his thinking before the cluib was playede|pg||
nt|lestergold: never easy these thinghs|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to play smith echo|pg||
nt|petergill: Partner could have @HQ107 ot @HQ97 or @HQ1097|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Peter|pg||
nt|hedyg: no smith on their CC|pg||
nt|petergill: EW do not play Smith Signal|pg||
nt|hedyg: i find it a very useful tool|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would have been here for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: certainly|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might have a running @D suit and be trying to sneak one @C trick through|pg||
nt|lestergold: recdent debate in eng bridge magazine about the merits o otherwise of smith peters|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the result was?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It scarcely matters here, but usually better for declarer to play the J when finessing with A-K-J-10, since this gives less information away.|pg||
nt|petergill: West's D6 at Trick 2 did not help solve East's problem. |pg||
nt|hedyg: we might not be starting the 2nd segment on time..|pg||
nt|petergill: Smith Signal is at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_signal|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bobby Wolff views the Smith Echo as an unethical method. A point that was raised in the English Bridge debate that Mike mentioned.|pg||
nt|hedyg: why unethical?|pg||
nt|petergill: If East ducks, then @D to jack, then wins next club, then almost endplayed ... has to try low @H and hope declarer mispicks how to play the ending|pg||
nt|lestergold: east obviously worried that a club trick would be nine in the bag when the hearts were unravelling for 4 tricks |pg||
nt|brolucius: So doea Hamman, I am told. The point is that you have an obvious echo with certain holdings, a readable slower echo with others. Not that I have any opinion on the matter. |pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, from most holdings that include the queen of hearts West should actually play it (Q1097 or Q107), but not Q97|pg||
nt|petergill: but Bobby Wolff regards most things as unethical, or so it seemed to me when I was reading his book|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: since when declarer plays the king, he almost certainly does not have the jack, so that the queen and the ten are equals|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to imagine what further insight another two minutes of thought will bring.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|mariner1: so this session is a 1 imp affair so far|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: moreover, in this case declarer probably does not have the ace either, or he would have kept the king in dummy as an entry to the clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: CC says 1@d is relay, 1@s would show @h..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: David Burns' point is a very good one - with @HJxx declarer would not play @HK at Trick 1, and the rest follows by logic|pg||
nt|hedyg: they might take up smith echo ..........|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 42 when a good heart lead put declarer in the wrong hand, unable to easily take the club finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 41 I mean |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the stiff @S in N caused the hand to fall apart|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did take the finesse, but Fantoni ducked the ace|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: actually, 1@h probably just shows a weak no trump, otherwise 2@h would be a bit odd|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess they dont play that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n hard to reach.. and rather lucky|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might not have an agreement to handle these transfers|pg||
nt|dburn: OK, sorry - in that case 1@h was a response to a relay and 1NT showed both majors|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dburn: no need, provided they take up playing the queen when West has it|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: and a lot of tricks to declarer in a contract whichad a few oprobs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: the thing about Smith Echo is that not only is it a cheat's charter, you need it rather less often than you think you do|pg||
nt|dburn: apologies for temporary failure to remember that this is the Orange Club, and not the Bottle of Guinness Supporters Club|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: The @h at Trick 2 marked @HK with West, so South could tell from the bidding that @SAK are onside|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: Very good defence by Fantoni on Bd 41 then|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: not J@H?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Versace the master worked out from West's 4@C bid that East the preempter probably had @DK. |pg||
nt|hedyg: did not want to make 12 |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|d4|nt|imp_jan: jansma is addicted to coca cola and paulissen to tea..|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: but whatever it is, two of either major will handle OK, whereas the same could not be said of 1NT, so well done to both pairs|pg||
nt|hedyg: no beer?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Pity, the defense started so promisingly.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|d7|nt|dburn: having said that, 2@h here appears to be handling rather more OK than it might have done|pg||

nt|brolucius: I know the inventor, Geoffrey Smith, and he was a very ethical player. A retired schoolmaster now.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes should have been -2|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a few might change hands there also|pg||
nt|petergill: I think declarer was going for an unlikely make, so went 2 off in the effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW in some @S here.........|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: The contract of 3NT would 99% for sure have made, no matter what East did|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 12 in Open Room was very good here|pg||
nt|mariner1: who plays their minor here?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|lestergold: yes as the cards lie he could not really go wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 11-15 either 5minor/4major or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D the typical "catchall" bid you get forced into with a strong club and 5-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: a dull 3n, but an exciting 6n|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: but he wasnt due for three ovetricks tho|pg||
nt|petergill: Once North found the good play of @HK at Trick 1, the defence was badly placed|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: 3@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D= 4M+5m or 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: well someone has to bid something to get there EW.........|pg||
nt|hedyg: N could have bid 1@s :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems nobody|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 11-15|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has a double fit but expects to be outbid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: very tempting|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H 11-15, hence North;s Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@S - clearcut playing Precision, where 1@D was 11-15|pg||
nt|mariner1: we could see action now, W and N both perked up|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: impossible to bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: 2N seems a bit much on the N cards|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt was minors perhaps|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 3@C here in Open Room|pg||
nt|athene: let's have a look at their CC|pg||
nt|hedyg: not much there|pg||
nt|mariner1: told 2N = bid you minor, not a strong hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is not on the CC|pg||
nt|petergill: The responses to 1@D are meant to be natural, but Angelini might have intended 2NT as "please bid your minor"|pg||
nt|mariner1: so S decided to gamble maybe?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: best lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he plays A@s..|pg||
nt|petergill: The play of the spade suit will be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: holding this to 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 missing @s control?|pg||
nt|athene: south decided he was red at imps|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace of course sticks to exactly what the System Card says|pg||
nt|hedyg: responses are Nat, weak jumps, 2@c=GF|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: well if he plays spade ace as he probably shoulod he will make 4|pg||
nt|imp_jan: therefore exciting|pg||
nt|petergill: Only 8 trumps (spades), so West does not bid 3 over 3|pg||
nt|mariner1: this looks off 1 however defense could help|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: this is all artificial stuff - maybe South is checking on the spade position or some such|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: In 3@S, @SA seems to be a safety play - or perhaps not so safe if East is void in @S. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 12 opposite 16 too :)|pg||
nt|dburn: unless he is aiming at a club contract, in which case he will reach an exciting 5@c|pg||
nt|imp_jan: south, afraid for a spade lead, is investigating a mini-moysian|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to play NT on these NS hands you would much rather south was declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: i.e 2NT = 11 count or 12 count that was reluctant to open 1NT vul, from South's point of view|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: setting up J@S for a pitch helps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|imp_jan: i.e. 3-3 fit heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: not recommended|pg||
nt|athene: Meckwell use 1@D - 3@C as both minors|pg||
pc|s8|nt|imp_jan: 3-2 fit is over the hill i would say|pg||
nt|mariner1: off to see the Lady, winder if she has a horse :)  by all|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3@C in Open Room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: especially in no @D through now|pg||
nt|mariner1: if|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, we saw North pass a 12-count earlier (board 52)|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room it went 2@D in S showing stiff @D and 3@C N|pg||
mc|13|nt|brolucius: It was a good game, in truth.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Rob|pg||

nt|dburn: even so, he might have grabbed the king of spades anyway - West might have had @sAJ10, and could scarcely have an entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: so off 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: decided to play 2-2|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bboitalia.it/china/  -  Tournament site|pg||
nt|hedyg: Simon?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: yes sorry:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but he was minimumstrength and the 3s bid was preemptiv in nature rather than strength showing|pg||
nt|petergill: systemically North knew South was 4441 or 5431, so if he visualised the singleton club, bidding 4@s was not impossible. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: still, he got his trick in the end|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have @S partial......... NS might shove them up too high (best defense)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: good point Peter so maybe i think north should have gone?|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 2@H asking for minors and 2NT 4 4 , 3@c asking more and 3@s 3 cards..|pg||
nt|imp_jan: looks like a preempt: 3@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: 1@d systemic for South with this shape - all unbalanced hands with a four-card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: u think i meant to say|pg||
nt|mariner1: well can NS even get in the auction now?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D 11-15 4414 or 4315 or 3415 or 4405|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 4 imps now|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: again 1@D= 11-15 5m+4M or 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely 3@S wasn't pre-emptive? South had a good hand.|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d therefore natural|pg||
nt|imp_jan: looks like a spade slam, but 4-1 trumps as we can see|pg||
nt|hedyg: last 3 boards now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so who is for bidding 4s with north and wil the dutch have got there in teh open room?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: E could bid 4@S...3@S it's not limit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S nice spot for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: apparently italioans played in 4c|pg||
nt|dburn: and Versace has the somewhat odd experience of opening the bidding in diamonds and then doubling diamonds for takeout at his next turn|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had enough for a negative double of 2@D, it seems.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT now, anyway.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes strange pass|pg||
nt|henryb: are we sure that the board is correct?|pg||
nt|petergill: This match in the Chinese Embassy in Rome ref http://www.bboitalia.it/china/ is mainly a friendship match, but the players would be feeling like they are in a gripping World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Championship Final right now.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: Dano says, by PH 2NT=bid your minor, by UPH=11-12 no majors I wrote down|pg||
nt|mariner1: angelini's system|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H a bergen type raise|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: can you tell when you have a moment what was said?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: crikey he floated it!!|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North was out for blood - maybe he thinks he has three trump tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: which wouldn't be a totally unreasonable expectation, of course|pg||
nt|petergill: Defence will have to be careful, to ensure they beat this. |pg||
nt|lestergold: well he is going to b very disdappointed|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will have to switch to @H quickly|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@h = spades, some values; 2@c = good hand, 2@h = hearts, I think|pg||
nt|imp_jan: you are close david|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS can get to 3NT somehow played by North (impossible), the bidding has told NS to take the deep finesse in @D's |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Dano!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: last correction : natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhhhhh ok|pg||
nt|dinos1: constructive with 4-fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: cards sit well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: over 1@S playing bergen is usefull invert @C and @H - so 3@C = 6@H |pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: pity his trumps are so good, in truth - if he had AK5, declarer might well finesse the nine on the first round and lose to the singleton @d10|pg||
nt|petergill: The aim is a plus score = plus 100 will do nicely, if they switch to @H in time|pg||
nt|lestergold: they must quickly unravel 2 heart  trikcs before one is parked on the KS|pg||
nt|petergill: Best (from a deception point of view) not to play off @SQ until later.  |pg||
nt|lestergold: hen west plays qs it will be obvious |pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@c must be kinda relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D still means 11-15 5minor/4major or 4441 - even after the last hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a problem with 4 - 1 trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C = 5@C/4@H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|hedyg: looking at his hand it is natural and strong|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well natural and strong wld be 2@d reverse|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@s isn't the best contract in the world, but it's not the worst either - luckily East-West didn't push for it on this occasion|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: hence 2@H = weak preference and 3@H = really good hand, given that my upper limit is 15 HCP|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone needs to lead a trump before NS can set up a cross ruff|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is very aggressive NV|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: facing 15 at most with only a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma has a natural @H lead with those @cs|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 4@H seems to have no chance now|pg||
nt|petergill: Jan Jansma thinks "4 hearts and five clubs in dummy- I have clubs too" - hence his terrific trump lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dinos1: here's problem with entries |pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: and west has cunningly postponed that|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|mariner1: that "Short Break" broadcast is for the Lady Milne Vugraphs|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's @S2 has exposed the spade position.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: why 9H|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of @DQ, in case South had a bare @D honour. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: To West, South appears to have @DA and @CA, so he might play @S to king - reasonable play I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: play going well so far|pg||
nt|dinos1: but cards lay good|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: implying no help in hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: rolls in now|pg||
nt|petergill: @H9 seem to have misled South|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9h a poor card|pg||
nt|hedyg: better then to play AK@D and @d|pg||
nt|petergill: Precision was invented by a Chinese man in China, and the Italians are playing bridge here in the Chinese Embassy in Rome, but fortune has not smiled on the Italians' Precision ...|pg||
nt|petergill: recently.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: although I expect GIB would have made it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: maybe some confusion in North's mind - the nine would be systemic from H98+ against notrump, but not against suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: with Kx in !x and KJ@H no problems|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: To South, North's apparent lack of interest in @H (due to @H9) might mean that North has spade ruffs coming up.  |pg||
nt|petergill: hoping for a cover|pg||
nt|petergill: well ducked by Angelini on @SJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Angelini probably has an inner feeling of satisfaction right now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
mc|6|nt|dburn: still, it would be odd to shift to hearts at all from four to the nine, so maybe Versace could have returned the suit anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: and maybe an imp :)|pg||
pg||
