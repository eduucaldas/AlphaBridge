nt|hedyg: hello :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi Hedy|pg||
nt|ady: only 2nd hand    first was a throw in|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 4 matches: AIDA 64, Kannavos 59, ONYX (Romania) 58, POLINA 58, Papakyriakopoulos 57, Zipovski 54 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: missed the announcement . sry|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s with their combined 17 pts  can make  4@C   but will they find the club contract after a no-trump opening from west|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@h limit in EW, 4@c NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure I believe Open made 6 there :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores it seems here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: EW can make 3NT on this layout, but they are unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   very duplicated   can only make 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a tool to show a 3 suiter|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: can double 2@H for t/o now|pg||
nt|ady: north may well re-open with double|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: may have to re-open at 3 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: W should pass with QJx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand the long @hs..|pg||
nt|ady: but nothin much lost if letting e/w play 3@H  should be down 1|pg||
mb|1N|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N very aggressive call from E with his 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems he is looking for the 8th and 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And it's very unlucky anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need @S6 as an entry to take the club finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not get a spade lead on this bidding, mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: I see 8th, 9th will be harder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: *lucky I meant to say|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pls disregard the score, it has NOTHING to do with this match|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT is certainly a better spot that 5@D|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: sure seems E owes W a @S raise here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have tried one more spade there |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think over 2@H was needed as well|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, East might have done, with three trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|finch: while we are results-merchanting, East could have not opened a nasty 12-count with 3 jacks|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|d3|mc|9|pg||
qx|c19|st||md|1SQ8654H7654DT8C52,SKJT7H32DJ97CQ743,SA2HQT8DA6CAKJ986,S93HAKJ9DKQ5432CT|sv|e|nt|thegarve:  its unlikely that you would have a shortage in a major , as opponents often bid the suit|pg||
nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes agression is paying off for NS mainly because EW are not that aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  penalty shootout in the FA Cup semi final Man U v Everton, no goals at extra time|pg||
nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
nt|mariner1: so did not find the 8th then|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggression|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: NS have 6@H if they can find it|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the easiest bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: just stay out of grand..|pg||
mb|1D|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I missed a car, they have 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS playing inverted majors to 1@D? |pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW even find it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: card|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S good spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c hook off stops 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 1@S shows a 1N call|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows hearts in their methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, 1@D-1@h=spades and 1@d-1@S=hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: some use 1N as 4+ @S and 1@S and a 1N call to put the 1N in opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: no alert so its hard to tell which it is Mike :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Roland knows it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's the advantage of that, Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E may be pickled here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no reason to go for the grand anyhow|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did not need much for slam......|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d splinter|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  could bid to 7@H      but  4-1 break  bad     6@H may get swing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: again aggression goes to the front for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well NS can beat 4@S however it is not their top spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: a defense slip can allow 4@S also|pg||
nt|granguru: very unprobable|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a QUICK 4@h bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, they may or may not play sound opening bids, and North might have risked a move anyway, but as I say, it wasn't obvious|pg||
nt|finch: Carol Cautious, surely?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|ady: North worried about wastage in diamonds opposite shortage    but north obviously bidding on|pg||
pc|h4|nt|finch: If clubs were 5-1 we'd be saying 'well stopped'|pg||
nt|thegarve:  doubt it|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some English pairs use this major suit inversion over 1@D, but I can't see any major theoretical merit (or else I'm too stupid)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: maybe that 2@d overcall was a good idea after all, although I confess it doesn't look like one|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 4@s is kickback and 6@c shows 3 keycards..|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: because normal action for N to ask keycards after 4@H|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|mariner1: 1@S here alerted because EW play some system that limits the point count  I|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mariner1: THINK :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: have stopped in 6   North perhaps being cautious after the sing off after the splinter|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|ady: sign|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs help in @C and asked for it with 6@c i guess|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|ady: fuff 2 clubs  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: another 7 to england|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: fuff indeed :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: disc @s?|pg||
nt|ady: does not really matter will just make 1 trump tgrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: slowly disc a @s?|pg||
nt|hedyg: very slowly?|pg||
nt|ady: flat result|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: well, maybe only six|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: yes |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: another think?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: yes........|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: well it has a "Gimic" value as seen here, Opponents have to deal with it|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: now just spades |pg||
mc|6|pg||
qx|c20|st||md|2S952H763DAKJT4C42,SJ4HAKQT8DQ85C975,SA73H952D9632CKQ6,SKQT86HJ4D7CAJT83|sv|b|nt|mariner1: EW may find themselves in a tough slam here.........|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East was a bit too passive there.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: one problem with those type calls is they become considerably less effective as|pg||
nt|mariner1: the level of opponents increases......... they need to be fit well into the overall|pg||
nt|mariner1: structure of a system|pg||
nt|hedyg: might be difficult to avoid 4@h|pg||
mb|1H|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should force more in @D here than in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: EW are finding out if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of tournaments and|pg||
nt|mariner1: have flat hands............|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial EW.... game off best defense|pg||
nt|ady: a partial in hearts seems the best on this hand    only 3 top losers   but with the 4-1 trump break  game seems to much|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has no reall attractive call here,,,,,,, I do not particularly like 1N with KQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, all calls seem to have one or more major flaws|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike do you like the 1N? (2@C regrettable @c might be my call)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so EW must play some sort of forcing @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: now we find out whether 2@d was gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
mb|2H|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with KQ stiff, and 2@C should really be a better suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes NS, hard to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: it wasnt|pg||
nt|ady: not|pg||
nt|ady: trump leads look best|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: and has to play @D the only way that works|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what do you bid with S over the 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @H in case pd has a stiff high honour|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: perhaps this is the unbiddable hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: borrow a @H from last deck..|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||
pc|s4|nt|finch: 3NT may not immediately appeal, but you have to compare it with the thought of playing 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: now a club should hold it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|granguru: But E can also go for the @CJ  finesse which is bad this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT from top|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: 2@C is regrettable to me...... just no other good calls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 3@S seems a bit chancy|pg||
nt|mariner1: I find pass even more regrettable :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one-and-a-half clubs, perhaps|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: when north wins A@C   ace and another trump|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a spade and  discard last spade on K@D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: although maybe 1NT is just practical bridge - I have x-y points and a spade stop |pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: operator says 1@D has different meanings based on position|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: and since S can see 4@C in dummy he will pitch a @H allowing 7 if declarer sees|pg||
nt|mariner1: it that way|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking if I consider 2N unusual with S, yes I do NV, the problem here is|pg||
nt|mariner1: RED you have no way to assess N's strenght and will pay a high prices if wrong|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: cash 2 clubs pitching @Ss|pg||
nt|thegarve:  amusing part-score hand|pg||
nt|xenya: @Ds, sorry|pg||
nt|thegarve:  east is now in on the secret|pg||
nt|ady: oh gone differeently|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: down in 3?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|ady: $@H OR    also down 1|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but 4@H|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|nt|mariner1: I am very disciplined in my 1N overcalls,,,,,, I like to have what LOOKS LIKE 2|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
mc|9|nt|mariner1: am told last weak NS and EW joined to play Cayne Team here on BBO and|pg||
nt|mariner1: won,,,,,,,,,,|pg||
