mb|p|nt|Walddk2: you?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: e/w only down 1 in 3@C |pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 2@D bid showed a sound club raise at the other table. I always forget the name of the convention. Same for 1@D - 3@C to show a sound diamond raise.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: I only see 4 losers in 3@C, so there is a little interest at the 3 level|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 1NT not alerted presumably some balanced 8+ with no major|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That's normal, David E, playing a strong club system. Most open all 11 counts|pg||

nt|brolucius: had already shown the playing strength for such a level.|pg||

nt|hedyg: W should pass with QJx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand the long @hs..|pg||
nt|ady: but nothin much lost if letting e/w play 3@H  should be down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N very aggressive call from E with his 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems he is looking for the 8th and 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And it's very unlucky anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need @S6 as an entry to take the club finesse|pg||

pc|cA|nt|hedyg: pls disregard the score, it has NOTHING to do with this match|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: sure seems E owes W a @S raise here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have tried one more spade there |pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think over 2@H was needed as well|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, East might have done, with three trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||

nt|ady: nice 5@D to reach n/s|pg||

mb|4N|an|Both minors or strong with !c|nt|ady: assume 4NT  minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Since 1@D is always unbalanced, Tundal knows that they have a fit in one of the minors; hence 4NT, pick a minor|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   might play 5@S   |pg||
nt|brolucius: South is taking a long time to choose his better minor.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he shows two aces instead, West must be careful with his opening lead.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: He can see North's spade void ... the position is awkward, but I think he will get out with a club|pg||

nt|mdgraham: what's the advantage of that, Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E may be pickled here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no reason to go for the grand anyhow|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did not need much for slam......|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d splinter|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  could bid to 7@H      but  4-1 break  bad     6@H may get swing|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: again aggression goes to the front for NS|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mariner1: well NS can beat 4@S however it is not their top spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: a defense slip can allow 4@S also|pg||
nt|granguru: very unprobable|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a QUICK 4@h bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: well, they may or may not play sound opening bids, and North might have risked a move anyway, but as I say, it wasn't obvious|pg||
nt|finch: Carol Cautious, surely?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: North worried about wastage in diamonds opposite shortage    but north obviously bidding on|pg||
pc|c9|nt|finch: If clubs were 5-1 we'd be saying 'well stopped'|pg||

nt|mdgraham: some English pairs use this major suit inversion over 1@D, but I can't see any major theoretical merit (or else I'm too stupid)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: maybe that 2@d overcall was a good idea after all, although I confess it doesn't look like one|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 4@s is kickback and 6@c shows 3 keycards..|pg||

nt|brolucius: Indeed. In some situations, you might double to stop partner from sacrificing but that was not relevant here.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: coffee time|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chessmaste: This will not be exciting methinks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: West bid a weak 2@S at the other table. That's a bit good. Perhaps they play something different. |pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6 is the last board in this room|pg||
nt|brolucius: They did not bid the heart slam on Board 7, at the other table, so 13 go back to Irens.|pg||
nt|ady: if North leads a diamond against the likely 4@S    west wi;; neeto play low to make 11 triccks   unless he gets 2 heart tricks|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@H artificial for spades, so South can double for a lead.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Depending on the scoreline, we may (and most likely will) switch to the other semi-final at some point, Allfrey vs Hackett|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, one shouldn't forget those little minuses for all these transfer methods|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South took the opportunity to make lead directing double - never clear to me whether this is a good idea allthough no difference here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: heart lead gives 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: club lead gives 12|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club gives 12|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had spotted another way to concede a trick with the opening lead.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East was a bit too passive there.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: one problem with those type calls is they become considerably less effective as|pg||
nt|mariner1: the level of opponents increases......... they need to be fit well into the overall|pg||
nt|mariner1: structure of a system|pg||
nt|hedyg: might be difficult to avoid 4@h|pg||
mb|2S|an|8-11|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should force more in @D here than in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: EW are finding out if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of tournaments and|pg||
nt|mariner1: have flat hands............|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial EW.... game off best defense|pg||
nt|ady: a partial in hearts seems the best on this hand    only 3 top losers   but with the 4-1 trump break  game seems to much|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has no reall attractive call here,,,,,,, I do not particularly like 1N with KQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, all calls seem to have one or more major flaws|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike do you like the 1N? (2@C regrettable @c might be my call)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: so EW must play some sort of forcing @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: now we find out whether 2@d was gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|c2|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with KQ stiff, and 2@C should really be a better suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes NS, hard to bid|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: it wasnt|pg||
nt|ady: not|pg||
nt|ady: trump leads look best|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: and has to play @D the only way that works|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what do you bid with S over the 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @H in case pd has a stiff high honour|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: perhaps this is the unbiddable hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: borrow a @H from last deck..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||
pc|sA|nt|finch: 3NT may not immediately appeal, but you have to compare it with the thought of playing 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: now a club should hold it|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|granguru: But E can also go for the @CJ  finesse which is bad this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT from top|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: 2@C is regrettable to me...... just no other good calls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 3@S seems a bit chancy|pg||
nt|mariner1: I find pass even more regrettable :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one-and-a-half clubs, perhaps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: when north wins A@C   ace and another trump|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|ady: ruff a spade and  discard last spade on K@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: although maybe 1NT is just practical bridge - I have x-y points and a spade stop |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mariner1: operator says 1@D has different meanings based on position|pg||
mc|11|nt|mariner1: and since S can see 4@C in dummy he will pitch a @H allowing 7 if declarer sees|pg||
nt|mariner1: it that way|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking if I consider 2N unusual with S, yes I do NV, the problem here is|pg||
nt|mariner1: RED you have no way to assess N's strenght and will pay a high prices if wrong|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It takes a long time for the hand to travel to the pocket?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: could take 10 tricks in defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Or 5 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: but probably contract will roll home|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Who would find the heart switch?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not me!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Would you find it at double-dummy, Bill? I think I might.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe it's findable at single dummy as well, but it's a tall order|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well, you lead the club honour that asks partner to unblock - he drops the jack - now you have to switch to something|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The tall player might be up to the tall order?|pg||
nt|ady: nast business vul  if best defense|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Why not the card that gives the biggest reward if partner has the right cards - as here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|odysseus69: right mark- the heart ace is the one that provides most|pg||
nt|ady: now 7 tricks   rather than 3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's certainly a technical argument ... you need partner's entry to run 5 clubs, and to take two more, the simplest route is via partner having @HA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually the convention 'unblock' lead at NT asks for 'unblock or count'. So that West can tell if declarer's honour will fall. So there is no opportunity to give a suit-preference ...|pg||

nt|hedyg: score is 3:3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  look destined to play either 1NT   or 2@S    both likely to go down|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|mariner1: now over the 2@S by E in Open Room I would have to bid 2N with S,,,,,,, DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: and PASS are not options|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2@D multi, showing a bad weak two in a major or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: good save by wales in OR  5@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should get to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets try again  |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|thegarve:  West is unlikely to save looking at least 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear to save over it - that West hand has some defensive prospects|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: looks cold in fact with the pointed Aces set right|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need the @H guess |pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rob |pg||
nt|sybarra: a likely 3 nt for n/s here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think South will have to get to 4@S herself|pg||
nt|dburn: so the Welsh West, Jean Hand, took a pretty good decision|pg||
nt|thegarve:  if she passes 2@s it would only be 50s - an old ploy|pg||
nt|finch: at the other table West guessed well, although I don't think that weak two was a 'bad' one|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S off, @H off, at lead @c are 3 3,,,,,, @D could be worse|pg||
nt|mariner1: has no real choice I think and the 3@D call helps define the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: unfriendly hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west  could lead a top spade  and then decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c in EW|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4 imps in a 6 - 7 match is huge....... lead vs being behind|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: South missed an inference there - if North was strong, he could have bid 2@S for take-out a round earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  maybe not if West cashes a@h v 4@S and underleads the @ds|pg||

nt|mariner1: scheduled this weekend! -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: in 8 bd matches,  tough to lose a hand lke that and recover |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: n/s play a club system (perhaps orange club)  and 1 @D =07 |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might make 4@H here,,,,,,,, 3N has an issue|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: more plausible is one top diamond first|pg||
nt|ady: it is a possibility|pg||
nt|thegarve:  switch to q@d to get an enc/disc signal|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so there is an inference that North is just protecting with good shape  |pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   save to much if they find best defence|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|finch: if diamonds are 5332 with partner having the doubleton you look a bit silly underleading the first round|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: am told its a sort of polish club with variations |pg||

mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: Gretheim -Tundal have lots of relay sequences where one player asks and partner describes his hand - this results sometimes that defence knows either nothing or everything about ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Norway/Groetheim_Tundal.pdf|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H doubtless shows spades and we can expect 3@H - 4@H.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@H looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C 16+, 2@H showing 8+ and spades after interference|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H is transfer to spades we can assume? no alert?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North will not let the bidding drop below 6@H, once he has heard a squeak from South.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: assume 2@H shows spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: We might also see 3@H-4@H-6@H :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you happen to have Carroll's hand and hear a pair such as this open 1 big Club, then there is only one rule:  YOU MUST BID|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Read above pls|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 5-3-3-2 I guess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: more relays to follow|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that Groetheim cannot yet be sure whether East holds majors or minors.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqb: Nothing's been alerted...|pg||
mb|6H|nt|brolucius: If East has hearts and spades, North might fear a heart loser.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North can find out by... bidding 6@H. |pg||
nt|chessmaste: he does not fear ghosts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose 6@H was a sort of a relay Victor ... relays to West to make an opening lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obviously not, during the day. It will be different this evening.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the other other semi-final we have Allfrey (the one undefeated team) against Hackett|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Seeds 2 and 3.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Seed 1 is always the holders.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Alfrey had pick of opponents as the undefeated team. The team that is picked always feels slightly offended|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
