mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|shevek: west would dbl anyway|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|jallerton: potential canap√©?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I think so|pg||
nt|jallerton: quite popular in Austria|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: E asked about 1@s ? natural ?|pg||
nt|shevek: so they might duplicate the result at the other table|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|shevek: everything is friendly, @s 3-3, @h 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: there is no canape from @Cs to @Ss available for S here as the 1@C opening would show a strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the answer was: yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|maribelxx: Some unfortunate technical difficulties...|pg||
nt|finch: 4-card majors makes it hard for South to raise to 2H as partner could have 8532|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: from @Cs to @Hs i meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very annoying for East, that 2@S bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcarroll: Low from doubleton leads?|pg||
nt|finch: East's 2@C shows a good hand, but West wants to get out while the going is good|pg||
nt|jallerton: nothing wrong with a 4-3 fit at 2-level NV.  Makes life difficult for oppo|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: unlucky evaluation  of souths hand ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: y|pg||
nt|finch: but as NS I'd be very happy to be defending 2@C on this layout|pg||
nt|jallerton: ....if they can't be certain of your fit size|pg||
nt|projekt1: 2-way stayman  2@c the weaker |pg||

nt|mcarroll: 3NT rightsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|maribelxx: she took her bid seriously :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I doubt it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- popular in Poland i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: asking leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2./4.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Does 2@c imply interest in other strains?  If so, W should try 2@d|pg||
nt|finch: I wouldn't mind playing 4@S EW here.  Particularly if I could see the NS diamond cards first.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW know there is no 8 card Major fit so 3NT seems the obvius continuation rather than giving more info to opps|pg||

mb|p|nt|projekt1: unusual in Poland :)|pg||
nt|xenya: EW doing their utmost to stop NS from reaching it?|pg||
nt|shevek: depends how much he wants to be dummy :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: horrible problem for South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you hate to defend with a trump void, and also there is the considreation that slam chances must be good |pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately, no-one has bid hearts yet |pg||

nt|maribelxx: Ty operator for the names @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: your are welcome :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah. 3@S showed hearts.|pg||
nt|xenya: yet, if N's double is basically business, S has every reason to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed, North might (on a good day) have three trumps tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: which he did -- a lucky decision|pg||

nt|roswolf: missed a good penalty here|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Peter Eidt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she didn't see west 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass stands, 2@s also|pg||
nt|xenya: seems they are going to end up in 2@C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: not a happy contract|pg||
nt|mcarroll: probably 2 down|pg||
nt|projekt1: @c opening lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 4-0 spade split renders this unmanageable, I think. Just a question of how many off |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W: asking 1@d opening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be happy to see @CA in dummy - if 6@H is reached at the other table, it may very well go off |pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 1 off at worst|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: Yes trump best lead|pg||
nt|xenya: stands out on this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: NS have balance of power, so lead trumps|pg||
nt|projekt1: discussing here why 2@s,,   why not 2@c?|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@s more discouraging|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: @C 10 lead, ducked, 3@H tricks and then no more?|pg||
nt|jallerton: needs to pick up @s for no loser and avoid a @d ruff to make 4@s.|pg||
nt|jallerton: with the @s layout a @d ruff won't be an issue|pg||
nt|finch: the percentage line in trumps is to play for the 10 onside|pg||
nt|jallerton: indeed, small to J on 1st round picks up @sAK10 with N as well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: ugh|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: Now could get out for down 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: er..|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jallerton: (tripleton)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, W might decide to lead a @S against 6@H...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of permutations.If South is declarer, East may double for a diamond lead |pg||
nt|shevek: north doesn't want a conversation|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|xenya: on a trump lead, declarer can get 1@C, 3@Hs and 1@S, but that's all -- 3 down|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: Not sure why South played C!K there |pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: yes, i agree|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will certainly be interesting to see what happens in the other room|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|finch: North would have thought hard about rising on the spade, because South's switch looks like a singleton|pg||
nt|shevek: Ctr C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|finch: However, declarer would be unlikely to start with a low spade away from AQxxx knowing there is a risk of a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate - especially as S made 3NT in Open|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice defence|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c6|pc|h2|nt|xenya: that @C return was not best|pg||

nt|roswolf: well concentration is required to play international bridge|pg||
mc|8|nt|projekt1: swinging between 1  and 2 down  ..|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see why she didn't ruff that @D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes, it is possible that EW next door may not get into the bidding, or, if they do, not find spades  |pg||

nt|xenya: but of course the defence might have some problems with their discards on the @Cs run|pg||

pc|s6|nt|roswolf: running scores are at  http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj|pg||

nt|mcarroll: HMM playing in a 3-3 fit not to be recommended|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpb: east looks twice on the dummy|pg||

nt|finch: do you agree with not passing out 2@D?|pg||

nt|col3435: well, 1@s can work out too - can get you to 2@c or 2@d when that's right|pg||

nt|xenya: S can see what's going on here?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|finch: I assume North could be 4=3=2=4 which makes 2@H more attractive than 2@S|pg||

pc|sK|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: can we not claim at this point|pg||

nt|projekt1: lucky 12 tricks in 6@c if no @s lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d-(1@s)-2@s-(4@s) start|pg||
nt|finch: I wonder what an initial double of 2@D would have meant?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: north should duck this|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: probably. Now if West had raised immediately to 2@h (as many would do playing 5-card majors) then North would surely be bidding spades|pg||
pc|sK|nt|shevek: doesn't actually matter here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Lead changes hands again|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: I'm told it would have shown four hearts.  So not appropriate here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: East asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: both minors answered N|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|shevek: NS had 24 hcp and didn't make a bid in bd 9!|pg||
nt|shevek: bd 8 sry|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|xenya: brb -- will get coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: on the fourth @d can pitch @c both hands|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|jallerton: still I suppose a @h lead was required to defeat 6@d|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, and they were right, too :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|shevek: it worked well, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E asking how NS discard|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: On bd 9 NS playing in 4@Sdbl - so that is probably the first double digit swing in the match|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
