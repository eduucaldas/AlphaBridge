nt|Walddk2: 4@S is cold|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is a good idea to have your convention card enclosed in plastic. Not only does that keep it clean, it prevents you from tinkering with the system every time you have a bad ...|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Or a fan|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: I believe the correct description of East's double in the CR is "asking for it"|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: In the CR, it was the hearts|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Both sides are wrong|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: I think they play pass by N as semipositive or better (at least they used to do that)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes but this side is wrong if hearts 4-2 as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's why we grab the notrumps as South, eh Vic?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may take a while. Gr√∏theim is not the world's fastests player. In fact, he is in top 5 among the slowest|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well that's what would tip the balance in favour of an NT rebid by South for my|pg||
nt|oliverc: money|pg||
nt|brolucius: The hand demonstrates the disadvantage of having a singleton (club here) in partner's main suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A doubleton opposite king sixth gives you some chance of setting up the suit.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Do you think North should think about passing 2@C?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No.|pg||
nt|oliverc: not opposite a strong club, no|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|jbgood: no - it is forcing against a 5+ hand'|pg||

nt|bjacobs: The No's have it|pg||
nt|brolucius: But it would have been a good view to take.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps we all answered No too quickly. although a game might be there, there are many, many hands where 2@C would be just the right spot.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I thought that's what you were getting at David, when you were talking about the singleton being such a bad holding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it's gotta be a deep position to pass 2@C|pg||
nt|jbgood: if i do remember correctly, N's pass shows 5-6 + hcp. So 2 @c is just natural and forcing 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: So perhaps North was genuinely forced to make a bid, South being unlimited|pg||
nt|jbgood: right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are correct, Jon. Double would show 0-4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 2@C is forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even so, 16 poitns is more likely than 17, which is more likely than 18... So, you might take a view.|pg||

nt|xenya: who is to blame here? S for trying to find a few specific cards with N for a slam to be good, or N for converting to 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  an exciting board |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|finch: you would do well to bid to 6@D. You would also do well to make it; it's not obvious what the right line is|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  should make 6NT by playing q@s from hand without releasing a@S to attempt to create an entry to dummy |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they can duck|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: but I agree, it's not at all clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  you can play a 3@S reponse to 2@C as 4@S and 5@D|pg||
nt|finch: obviously you can make double dummy after the @SQ holds by enplaying North. |pg||
nt|thegarve:  or 2@c 2@d 3@s as 4!@S and 5@d from declarer too|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|finch: maybe you should do... win the lead, queen of spades winning, ace of spades, oops, what else is there to play for?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|finch: 6@S however is not going to make|pg||
nt|ady: can then cash all clubs  and try diamonds    and end play North|pg||

pc|hK|nt|xenya: well looking at EW's hands, 6@S doesn't look all that bad|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: There is a similar endplay here, but declarer has to read it|pg||

nt|bjacobs: South issqueezed at trick 3|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not much chance of ducking a diamond into the safe (South) hand.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South has to release a diamond on 3rd club - which allows declarer to cash 2 diamonds and 3 spades and the heart king before exiting with a spade (cashing in right order)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, spades might be 3-3.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: In the double dummy chair, we all lead a minor, but ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if 3S is shortage then South has AQ - if 3S is feature then still dont fancy spade|pg||
pc|s7|nt|asnuttyas: there was a X of 2@H in the CR, which made the @S lead more attractive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even here, who wouldn't lead a spade?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True, even so I think a spade is a natural lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: This will be another high-class push, making game on these values.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: but not (as here where I am told that 3S is shortage) when South bids 3NT facing a known shortage|pg||

mb|5H|nt|bjacobs: Woops sorry, Roland already noted that|pg||

nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Yes, full credit to Carroll for making it hard on Tundal|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: If 4@S is making (10 tricks), then 5@H is 2 down ... |pg||
nt|brolucius: But South has a poor hand. There was some chance that North would bid 6@H when 5@H was the right place to be. |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If 5@H is making, then 4@S is 3 down |pg||

nt|odysseus69: defence cant get second club trick - never could- so 2 down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a close decision ... but on the whole, the LOTT tells you to defend|pg||
