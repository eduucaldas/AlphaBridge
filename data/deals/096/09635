nt|Walddk8: It's a tournament for women only|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Does that explain it?|pg||
nt|jallerton: This one is, yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good morning|pg||
nt|col3435: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: NS play precision 12-15 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Our operator is Tobias Förster|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: EW play acol-based|pg||
nt|shevek: hello again|pg||
nt|shevek: here we go, close match, only 12 boards left|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the live score link is: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj|pg||
nt|col3435: 1@d slightly unusual even in Precision  - they must have some special meaning for 2@c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Martin, David and Nicoleta. Have fun!|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: West feels pleased to have a 20-count, followed by worry at being fourth in hand|pg||
nt|shevek: hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And a Multi opening to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the NS convention card misses the 2@d opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@d=weak2 in a M|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk7: I can guess where your heart is, Josef :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Josef Harsanyi originally from Hungary|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: Tobias, are they using screens?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: EW may easily get overboard here -- a trappy hand for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no|pg||
nt|finch: with the opponents NV, you never get first crack in fourth seat|pg||
nt|Walddk8: 2@H, and then 3@H by Cilleborg is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: W has a huge hand, and will probably support @Ss but the 5-1 split is merciless|pg||
nt|shevek: ok then we know where your @h is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H makes but will it be bid?|pg||
nt|shevek: but what was 1 @d  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W asking 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk7: True Nico|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: to play|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W asking what N showed|pg||
nt|shevek: martin :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Obviously no problem for this NS|pg||
nt|projekt1: after a strong 1Nt and 2@d transfers superacccept  and south decides|pg||
nt|shevek: strong 1@d opening maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: NS are likely to end up in 3N here -- probably going down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@d probable the "convenience diamond opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: 1@d doesn't say anything about @d|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: with clubs 4-4 there are eight tricks - and where's there's eight...|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead, but anything would work here it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk8: I don't think the hand is good enough for 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: well the auction is a bit cramped, I can understand 4@h|pg||
nt|jallerton: some case for 2NT to show the values|pg||
nt|finch: if the @SQ were in diamonds I like 4@H more|pg||
nt|Walddk8: It's a 6-loser hand opposite a partner who was asked to bid on a zero count. Surely 4@H is too much|pg||
nt|jallerton: opposite @sJxx 3NT could be the only making game|pg||
nt|jallerton: should duck the lead|pg||
nt|finch: ..smoothly|pg||
nt|finch: see if you can tempt South to continue them|pg||
nt|Walddk8: If partner can't raise 3@H to game, you won't have missed anything|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I wondered why N did not open 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they play variabel NT i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Looks like a standard game making either 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|projekt1: they open 11-14 hcp 1Nt|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|jallerton: apart from maybe 3NT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: so they did get too high, but not by much, somewhat surprisingly|pg||
nt|xenya: except an unrealistic @D lead of course|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: 9 tricks can be easily made|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jallerton: desparately hoping for @cQJ onside - not much else to hope for|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|jallerton: @dKQ doubleton I suppose|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj  for the results (i hope)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hQ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|dT|nt|mcarroll: Can actually make 4@S, 2@C, 4@D, 3@S and a @C ruff|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good spade switch. No endplay chances now |pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: i've got a feeling there was a 10th lurking somewhere -- but not now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Either 10 or 12 sorry - depending on @D finesse|pg||
mb|1C|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|col3435: would have been in danger if the @d finesse was wrong - could take @d, @h, @c and a @h ruff|pg||
nt|projekt1: 6@c ?   a nice contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: terrorist 2@h|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
nt|projekt1: multi style|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
mb|1D|nt|finch: That was a good hand for opening as South, otherwise she would have defended an opening 2NT making|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|mdgraham: this looks like a fairly straightforward 4@H for NS |pg||
nt|xenya: or 3N|pg||
nt|jallerton: still might have done had W chosen 2nT over 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the link to the live scores is:|pg||
nt|shevek: south shouldn't be afraid to show a 1-suited if available|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: canape to @Ss by S?|pg||
nt|projekt1: schönen Tag aus Bad Griesbach|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Yes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzpb: N: 5@s 4@d 15-16|pg||
nt|shevek: pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzpb: http://tinyurl.com/cvw3zj|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 1N=forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s=17-19 bal.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: leads? attitude|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N asked|pg||
nt|finch: lead will give the heart suit for four tricks|pg||
nt|finch: unfortunately that's only 8.  I wonder if there's a ninth somewhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: E has time to switch to @c|pg||
nt|jallerton: but then W might be endplayed|pg||
nt|finch: I think declarer can make it double dummy by playing on spades, but it's natural to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: as W's red cards will be stripped|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: W asked|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or 5@h 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: -500 not terrible|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3 down not bad|pg||
pc|s7|nt|finch: The 'obvious' line is to win the heart in hand and start on diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: probably @SK then @DQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: no can start with @d and switch to endplay line when @d turn out to be 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Seems so|pg||
nt|finch: that 9 of clubs is also a good card|pg||
nt|shevek: NS need to take a @c ruff...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|projekt1: Kriftner - Reim play Blue Club - 1 @C 17+, canape openers else, 1 NT 15-17|pg||
nt|projekt1: Jörg Fritsche, NPC of Germany sitting here too|pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H was relay, 2@S showed 15-16 with 5+@S, 4+@D|pg||
nt|projekt1: club lead kills,  every other allows to make it|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: E has a choice betwwen @Cs and @Hs here -- seems N's 1@H was not natural |pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H could be 11-12 balanced without @H, so the choice was between @C and @H|pg||
nt|xenya: and she has found it|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: @c now|pg||
nt|shevek: misguess in @d though... can go for -800|pg||
nt|projekt1: would you bid instead of 4@h double 4Nt for the minors?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E wanted to pass but took the wrong card|pg||
pc|dA|nt|finch: East has to duck the first diamond.  Looks very very silly if West has singleton @DK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|shevek: too late now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|finch: On the second diamond it is tempting to duck to make communications more awkward|pg||
nt|finch: but against that East might be worried she'll never make it|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|finch: with the clubs doubly stopped declarer can also make just by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: @c are not necessarily double stopped.  E could switch to @cJ from AJxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: and restricted choice and lack of @cJ lead might persuade declarer to play for that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: now the defence should be easy|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|finch: declarer now will now worry about losing 2 spades 2 diamonds and a club if she sets up diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|nt|finch: so may now start on the spade suit, knocking out the K, 10|pg||
pc|sK|nt|finch: ... although possibly not having ducked the first spade|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: True but it seems counter intuitive that the hand with a singleton trump is the threat of the vital ruff|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cashes @HAK just to avoid any nonsense|pg||
nt|shevek: north knew south didn't have @dsg or !K |pg||
pc|d8|nt|finch: Jeffrey is confident declarer is going to make via an endplay.  I am worried she's going to try and endplay the wrong hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: East passed originally|pg||
nt|finch: Anyway, she can now go back to setting up diamonds... cash the heart discarding a spade and concede a diamond trick|pg||
nt|finch: the actual spade position looks quite plausible|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: Still needs careful play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: anyway, easy when we see all hands|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jallerton: Did she need to play for @hJ to drop?|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  But the attitude lead should have given the heart position away.  |pg||
pc|d9|nt|finch: Unless the lead was from 832, but that looks an odd lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|shevek: lucky the short @c hand doesn't have trump left|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N very aggressive call from E with his 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems he is looking for the 8th and 9th trick|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: may not get a spade lead on this bidding, mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: I see 8th, 9th will be harder|pg||
pc|d6|nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT is certainly a better spot that 5@D|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|finch: while we are results-merchanting, East could have not opened a nasty 12-count with 3 jacks|pg||

nt|shevek: 3NT looks like the normal spot here|pg||
nt|projekt1: if the Hungarian caan manage that South plays in 3 Nt?|pg||
nt|shevek: not sure Josef, pass would be resonable|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|shevek: west would dbl anyway|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: I think so|pg||
nt|jallerton: quite popular in Austria|pg||

nt|shevek: so they might duplicate the result at the other table|pg||
mb|2C!|an|min hand|mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|shevek: everything is friendly, @s 3-3, @h 3-3|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: there is no canape from @Cs to @Ss available for S here as the 1@C opening would show a strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the answer was: yes|pg||
mb|4N|an|choose suit|nt|maribelxx: Some unfortunate technical difficulties...|pg||
nt|finch: 4-card majors makes it hard for South to raise to 2H as partner could have 8532|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: from @Cs to @Hs i meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very annoying for East, that 2@S bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mcarroll: Low from doubleton leads?|pg||
nt|finch: East's 2@C shows a good hand, but West wants to get out while the going is good|pg||
nt|jallerton: nothing wrong with a 4-3 fit at 2-level NV.  Makes life difficult for oppo|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: unlucky evaluation  of souths hand ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: y|pg||
nt|finch: but as NS I'd be very happy to be defending 2@C on this layout|pg||
nt|jallerton: ....if they can't be certain of your fit size|pg||
nt|projekt1: 2-way stayman  2@c the weaker |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: N asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sorry, I had to shut down due to open rooms conn problems|pg||
nt|maribelxx: They seem to have points but can they get 10 tricks here, I wonder|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT rightsided|pg||
mb|5S|nt|maribelxx: she took her bid seriously :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I doubt it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- popular in Poland i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: asking leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2./4.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Does 2@c imply interest in other strains?  If so, W should try 2@d|pg||
nt|finch: I wouldn't mind playing 4@S EW here.  Particularly if I could see the NS diamond cards first.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW know there is no 8 card Major fit so 3NT seems the obvius continuation rather than giving more info to opps|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: E consulting CC for leads|pg||
nt|shevek: MUD|pg||
mb|d|nt|maribelxx: if it was lead directing or not....  she found a good lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: 2@C has a fairly easy 8 tricks by ruffing two hearts in hand and cashing winners|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: if the safety   ( technically correct play play ) in @c will be choosen?  YES|pg||
pc|h8|nt|maribelxx: it gave nothing away in the minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: always|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like one or two down - no great deal, as EW can make eight or nine in hearts |pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpb: same as NS do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, as a correspondent points out, 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: looks more than just 1 or 2 down to me, Mike -- i would bet on 3 at least |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that they were all that likely to bid it, though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, North can't get any club tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: really tough for declarer|pg||
pc|h9|nt|finch: the main thing to avoid is finessing into one of South's diamond honours|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|finch: discarding a heart from dummy is showing confidence: that's the stop for their suit|pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|ady: looks like 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  penalty shootout in the FA Cup semi final Man U v Everton, no goals at extra time|pg||
nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
nt|mariner1: so did not find the 8th then|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: NS have 6@H if they can find it|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I missed a car, they have 5@H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: card|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c hook off stops 6|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well NS can beat 4@S however it is not their top spot|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: W: asking 1@d opening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be happy to see @CA in dummy - if 6@H is reached at the other table, it may very well go off |pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 1 off at worst|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|mcarroll: Yes trump best lead|pg||

nt|jallerton: needs to pick up @s for no loser and avoid a @d ruff to make 4@s.|pg||
nt|jallerton: with the @s layout a @d ruff won't be an issue|pg||
nt|finch: the percentage line in trumps is to play for the 10 onside|pg||
nt|jallerton: indeed, small to J on 1st round picks up @sAK10 with N as well|pg||

pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, W might decide to lead a @S against 6@H...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of permutations.If South is declarer, East may double for a diamond lead |pg||
nt|shevek: north doesn't want a conversation|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: on a trump lead, declarer can get 1@C, 3@Hs and 1@S, but that's all -- 3 down|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not sure why South played C!K there |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: yes, i agree|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will certainly be interesting to see what happens in the other room|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|finch: North would have thought hard about rising on the spade, because South's switch looks like a singleton|pg||
nt|shevek: Ctr C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|finch: However, declarer would be unlikely to start with a low spade away from AQxxx knowing there is a risk of a diamond ruff|pg||

pc|s3|nt|xenya: that @C return was not best|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|projekt1: swinging between 1  and 2 down  ..|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see why she didn't ruff that @D|pg||
nt|projekt1: yes,  2@c and after any 2 red bid promises 2@s more|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I assume screens are used if she claims "not having seen the bid"|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no screens|pg||
nt|maribelxx: oh...|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure this is an optimum defence, but NS will think they are playing with house money, given the 6-1 club break    |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: NS have rather given up control here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: yes, swinging between -200 and -500 -- quite a difference|pg||

mb|1C|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 3NT may not immediately appeal, but you have to compare it with the thought of playing 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: now a club should hold it|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: But E can also go for the @CJ  finesse which is bad this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT from top|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: and since S can see 4@C in dummy he will pitch a @H allowing 7 if declarer sees|pg||

nt|thegarve:  Scotland marginally in the lead now  as NI are only winning by 3 IMPs comapred to Scotland's 14 IMPs|pg||
nt|finch: North to be accused of fielding the psyche?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmp: 1H not alerted as showing longer clubs and could be 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzmp: east would have given west a ruff but assumed out of trumps|pg||
nt|finch: difficult to say how many tricks it would have made on a club back, as declarer dropped a trick later anyway|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and then 3@h would have made by default |pg||
nt|finch: also, if it 'could be' only 3, does that mean it could not be 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmp: at least 3|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they got their best possible result|pg||
nt|finch: again, if double denied 4@S then East knows West is 3262 or 3172 (or has 8 diamonds)|pg||
nt|finch: and didn't open in first seat|pg||

nt|finch: club lead against 4@H is not very pretty|pg||
nt|finch: but I think you can still do it|pg||

nt|mcarroll: On board 15 the @C play  found here was missed in Open and so 3NT went down|pg||
