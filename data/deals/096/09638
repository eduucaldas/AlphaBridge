nt|sharkey: preempts makes bidding difficult, as they're intended to, thus S was forced to guess when bidding 6@S - not unreasonable I think|pg||
nt|jbgood: South had a clear 6 - more doubtful about 5 by N|pg||
nt|jvage: He reasonably expected a bit more from North|pg||
nt|sharkey: Drude also had to take the bull by the horn after 5@D - some players may have elected to pass I guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: *Grude|pg||
nt|jbgood: Quite a number of excellent players (headed by Tor Helness) didnt make it to the final|pg||

nt|jvage: Even that may be in problems, at least played by south on a diamond-lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: 2@S will probably fail if N ducks @D lead from dummy|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jbgood: the reason why the result page is not up and going may be due to difficulties in counting the carry-overs|pg||

nt|sharkey: hard to underlead @DAK when on BBO I guess|pg||

nt|robinswr: Keep it simple stupid|pg||
nt|jbgood: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=dnof for results, http://www.kristiansandbk.org/ for Snorre Aalberg's web page|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Is there a system you *must* play, John? With very few gadgets?|pg||
nt|jvage: There are 2, one simple and one more advanced|pg||
nt|jvage: You have to choose between these|pg||
nt|robinswr: polish club and blue team are probably the two systems|pg||
nt|Walddk3: hardly :)|pg||
nt|jvage: And may agree to play some "advanced" gadgets with the simple system|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Norwegian Standard 1 and 2 I suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: they play basically a simple system alas SAYC - a few gadgets allowed in advanced - like checkback stayman etc|pg||
nt|jvage: If I remember correctly the advanced inculded RKCB, multi and some other stuff, both basically natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: http://www.kristiansandbk.org/SIB%202008/system%202008.pdf - unfortuinately Norwegian only|pg||
nt|robinswr: amazing multi is allowed in an individual but not allowed in ACBL pair games|pg||
nt|sharkey: Multi not allowed I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzer: multi not allowed....|pg||
nt|robinswr: in slam auctions i would make use of rkc|pg||

nt|sharkey: the level of the players in the field varies quite a bit; thus I think not allowing Multi is fair view defence agreements etc|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|robinswr: never make a bid that you would not be sure that you would be 100% about|pg||
nt|sharkey: easier said than done Steve|pg||
nt|jvage: Agreed, also because even among those who play Multi the continuations are different|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jvage: Offshape NT-bids are even more popular in individuals...|pg||
nt|sharkey: i go on a limb and predict 11 tricks :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|robinswr: heart lead is -690|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ann Karin, the only lady in the field, is comfortably ahead after three rounds|pg||
nt|robinswr: hard to believe that a heart lead gives up a trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|robinswr: but switch partner's majors (give him KJxx of hearts) then a heart lead could beat 3nt|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hate opening lead problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: wonder if most E will lead @S or @H?|pg||
nt|robinswr: especially in an individual when the opponents are jumping to the final contract|pg||
nt|jvage: I was asked to provide first names, North is Per Egil and South Ann karin|pg||
nt|jvage: West is Dag, East Magne|pg||
nt|sharkey: -660 rates to score below average as some E will lead @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: some S may go for slam?|pg||
nt|robinswr: -660 will probably tie for bottom|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D by S|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess in hearts they can take 2 or 3 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: only four scores compared on each board|pg||
nt|robinswr: in a regular pair event, where pairs have methods over 2nt, they might get to 6diamonds but not here |pg||
nt|vugraphzer: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=dnof|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib suggests @H lead beats 6@D - and he appears correct|pg||
nt|jbgood: each board is scored against the average of the field |pg||
nt|robinswr: but 6diamonds rates to be played by north|pg||
pg||

nt|Walddk3: There is MP and then there is bridge|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Takes time to play 15 boards of indy. All the waiting between rounds|pg||
nt|robinswr: seems like a strange movement one board per round|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The idea is that everyone plays with the other 15|pg||
nt|jbgood: they have been playing qualification sessions all day, Steve, and each player has a carry-over|pg||
nt|robinswr: but the fewer boards you play the more random the results|pg||
nt|robinswr: also fewer comparisons make results random|pg||
nt|jvage: North is Tom Høiland, a very strong local player with some international experience|pg||
nt|robinswr: take board 5 you get off to a great lead and get a bottom|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is the charm about it - gives outsiders a better chance of winning|pg||

nt|jbgood: we all have Steve:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzer: Fuglestad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and lead @S beat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no, finesse in @C win also against lead @S (2 discards)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: prbably 4@H made bec no entry in the dummy, so must play the finesse at first round|pg||

mb|3S|nt|sharkey: only if E visualize the PERFECT hand with pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with 14 in West problaly stop at 4@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hope 3spades is some simple bid|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|h3|mc|9|nt|jbgood: game is difficult to bid after E's inbid. I think S should try 3 @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H isn't forcing, so 3@C can be a reasonable choise|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - if he wanted to force he had to double first|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Now for North a big problem ! 3@H 3@S 4@H ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: doesn't 2hearts show six?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think bidding spades 2 times is enough with a NT on your back|pg||

nt|jbgood: often Steve - but...|pg||
nt|vugraphzer: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=dnof|pg||
nt|sharkey: this hand also shows how powerful the Aces are in bridge|pg||
