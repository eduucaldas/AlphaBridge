pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  destined to go several down  if east switches to diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: the W card will be hard to read|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 2n undoubled not vul off a couple or so no disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why one must make these courtesy raises with the west hand|pg||
nt|ady: might go down 5  on diamond switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have 1@s with the W hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: however diamond seems the odds on shot|pg||

nt|mariner1: stoppers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, South has gained 5 imps, but rather lucky really|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Chinese overcall 1N and open 1N and 2N with a stiff|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice stop on that hand |pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: 16 opposite a pretty good 8 though cards are not sitting well for them......|pg||
nt|arel1: 1@d 11-15 bal|pg||
nt|hedyg: score is 3:3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  look destined to play either 1NT   or 2@S    both likely to go down|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: now over the 2@S by E in Open Room I would have to bid 2N with S,,,,,,, DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: and PASS are not options|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2@D multi, showing a bad weak two in a major or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: good save by wales in OR  5@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should get to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets try again  |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  West is unlikely to save looking at least 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear to save over it - that West hand has some defensive prospects|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: looks cold in fact with the pointed Aces set right|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need the @H guess |pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rob |pg||
nt|sybarra: a likely 3 nt for n/s here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think South will have to get to 4@S herself|pg||
nt|dburn: so the Welsh West, Jean Hand, took a pretty good decision|pg||
nt|thegarve:  if she passes 2@s it would only be 50s - an old ploy|pg||
nt|finch: at the other table West guessed well, although I don't think that weak two was a 'bad' one|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S off, @H off, at lead @c are 3 3,,,,,, @D could be worse|pg||
nt|mariner1: has no real choice I think and the 3@D call helps define the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: unfriendly hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: west  could lead a top spade  and then decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c in EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: but no way to bid it|pg||
nt|ady: yes    e/w could make 2@C   but could not really get into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: you got there ffirst Heddy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a miracle in @D and there is no such thing|pg||
nt|ady: wont go down if they dont play a card|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: making at least 4 |pg||
mb|3N|nt|finch: 5@H more of a 2-way shot, could collect x AQxxxx Qxxx xx and make on a good day|pg||
nt|dburn: no saves now - Seale adopting more of a Manchester United approach than an Everton approach to saving|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in N I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: undo please operator :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H tough spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: can cash for 10 tricks |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|vugraphznh: sry the connection is very bad|pg||
nt|hedyg: still waiting for the @D spots to change|pg||
nt|ady: could make if spade position favourable    but not that difficult hand to play   |pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like connection problems, he really does not have that many choices|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk5: Good morning to David Edwin|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: well the @D now look better for NS,,,,|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|finch: passing out 2@S is much more tempting if South has shown 16+, but I doubt it would work here: 4@S is still natural over it|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S return is good for defense|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: now making +2 |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: E has to resist cashing the J@S|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think he will not be able to affor a @S up |pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks for e/w|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: 8 back for wales|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|finch: of course, if you play very random weak twos you can't bid 5@H after 2@D (4@S) because there could be a nasty accident|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: 9 available with @H @H @H now|pg||

nt|sybarra: 5 of a major that is |pg||

nt|mariner1: yes they were lucky there is this close a match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 imps in a 6 - 7 match is huge....... lead vs being behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South missed an inference there - if North was strong, he could have bid 2@S for take-out a round earlier|pg||
mb|1C|nt|thegarve:  maybe not if West cashes a@h v 4@S and underleads the @ds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@s  a make for e/w   |pg||

nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: in 8 bd matches,  tough to lose a hand lke that and recover |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sybarra: n/s play a club system (perhaps orange club)  and 1 @D =07 |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might make 4@H here,,,,,,,, 3N has an issue|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|finch: more plausible is one top diamond first|pg||
nt|ady: it is a possibility|pg||

nt|ady: 5@H   save to much if they find best defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: are they bidding the board we see?|pg||
nt|ady: something wrong again|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: this cannot be right|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator?|pg||
nt|hedyg: stuck again|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: sry  we just ive te result|pg||
nt|hedyg: but surely not 2@c played?|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls enter all results|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also those who helped bring this Bridge Festival to BBO  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: the NS aggression may backfire here - East may raise 2NT to 3NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have Norway and Indonesia and many many more coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, he has passed|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|ady: 16 is entered as 2@C -2|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you have the results for 13, 14 and 15?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then my bet is 1@c-1@H-1NT-2@c-p (forgot that 2@c is checkback)|pg||
nt|hedyg: can you pls enter the results?|pg||
nt|ady: yes   could be|pg||
nt|hedyg: or give us the result of the match|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Angelini seems to have won the Italian team championships|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: ok we will be  back from reece in 10 min i hope without con. problems this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to the specs, who are always helpful.  I enjoy your comments |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: looks like 2@d  is the limit  n/s|pg||
nt|ady: I think 1NT better 2nd bit by east    |pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: yes and not the easiest play,,,, is possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: good to see a player that knows an invitation can be refused|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: easier now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|finch: I admit I'd have led my AK suit. Dummy is known to be short in diamonds|pg||
nt|thegarve:  why not a@H?|pg||
nt|granguru: establishing the @H might also help|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately (or rather not, as it is a flat board) this is an occasion when it would be a good time to accept |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|ady: dont like A@D lead    why not A@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bad news in clubs, but good news in diamonds  |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes now has a couple of ways to make it and both work|pg||
nt|granguru: to avoid losing @Cs..the @C return made things much more easy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: so a push.,|pg||
nt|granguru: so it is a tie..in this board|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all!|pg||
nt|granguru: tks all|pg||
nt|granguru: see you soon|pg||
nt|mariner1: many many more vugraphs coming up!  Roland has been busy!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: assume the dbl showed at least 1 major  better not to commit west to another bid and limit with 1NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: this hand comes tumbling home |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d8|nt|xenya: actually the @D continuation might have defeated the contract?|pg||
nt|finch: that's a nice play in clubs. gains with Ax and also on this layout|pg||
nt|ady: spec has requested address to find previous results|pg||
pc|sK|nt|finch: although from South's perspective, if North's 5 was a true card it's either a singleton or J95|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: the pitches on @S will be difficult for S |pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: well this is one of those STOM hands..... and could decide mathc|pg||
nt|mariner1: STOM - state of match|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might just bid at other table if they think they need it |pg||
nt|mariner1: well a 16 imp lead "should" be safe|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all!|pg||
