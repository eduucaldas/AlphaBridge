nt|Walddk2: only 3 or 4 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: this hand blew up on NS in Closed Room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: looks like a take-out double left in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: with a trump lead he can cash red aces and lead a trump back to dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|2C|nt|ady: well North has done well  to pass   so n/s should avoid the expense in CR|pg||
nt|robinswr: sometimes responding on nothing gets you in trouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: may take out to 2@H|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play, 3N has play, any @S not so much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Ed discovered a very rare backwash squeeze on the last hand. In the end game East was squeezed in three suits, including trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: king of diamonds is not worth mucg|pg||
nt|mariner1: with the 10 it blocks the suit though|pg||
mb|3H|nt|robinswr: no he just had to ruff high and lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: no entries to N is key here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this should make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3 2 @H help a lot even  with the bad @S breal|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: break|pg||
nt|ady: maybe trump leads best|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: @c lead should make this easy|pg||
nt|ady: still seems ok   4 spade tricks   1 club trick  5 heart tricks including a ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: or 3 @S and 6@H and a @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: would be easy for W to tangle up their tricks if not careful|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers pointing out a Scourge of Scotland lead would have been interesting|pg||
nt|mariner1: 9@D is the Scourge of Scotland|pg||
nt|ady: they will lose even if making   as their team mates  lost 800 CR|pg||
nt|ady: dont think the contract can be beat on 9@D lead  unless declarer goes wrong|pg||
nt|robinswr: just cover with the 10|pg||

pc|d6|nt|robinswr: the 9 of diamonds could have cost the contract|pg||
nt|robinswr: good advertisment for upside down signals|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think the kibbers meant that the 9@D made it easy for declare to go wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: decalrer|pg||
nt|mariner1: declarer even|pg||
nt|robinswr: declarer can't go wrong now|pg||

nt|Walddk4: what tourney? that was last Sunday|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we have a shootour between N. Ireland and Scotland....... CBAI closed it up|pg||
nt|mariner1: on last 4 boards of the last session and put Scotland in 2nd place|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh Hedy thought u were running one this sunday|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Roland|pg||
nt|mariner1: shootout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2 VP's is not a huge lead though|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|viren169: It will be interesting to see how West copes with 2@H from South|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S will not be great success |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi all - Hi Shirley  John Comyn here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello John welcome |pg||
nt|jcomyn: dfidnt recognise the new caps on the NI team|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Martin.|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make a lot here |pg||
nt|mariner1: well we start with a makeable yet unbiddable slam imho|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score battle here between hearts for e/w clubs for n/s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb: a slam. should not be hard to bid: the problem, I think, will be to avoid seven on power|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: h partial |pg||
nt|thegarve:  scores update please operator|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: hi all again|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big match this - both well in contention|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 76, SCOTLAND 71, ENGLAND 61, IRELAND 59, CBAI 58, WALES 31 ****|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Your commentators are Ian Crorie, Cliff Gillis, Sarah Teshome and myself.|pg||
nt|viren169: Much easier route to 4@H now|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming 2@C was majs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Morning John, Peter and Gad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an ouch already|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 19-20 NT onbviously|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and on cue...|pg||
nt|sybarra: its pretty magic to bid the slam |pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S will make with the lucky Kx @S in pocket|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h the likely limit for E/W |pg||
nt|mariner1: @H win this battle|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|idc: NS are playing 15-17 NT, 5 card majors, 3 card minors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good contract but...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wish I were you lovely day here and me watching bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N makes in S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 6 nt off with the @C k off |pg||
nt|mariner1: someone has to bid @H though :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jallerton: England have brought in a new pair.  Catherine Seale (West ) is playing her first Lady Milne|pg||
nt|pkl: Why 2@D if 2@C was majors? I believe 2@C must be something else.|pg||
nt|pkl: Morning Roland|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like they all have something to say here...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had just said not a success, but could it be done?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will test N in a big way|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi ralf  John Comyn here|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hearts coming into the picture now...|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @c lead kills 6N in N|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm im not sure about that|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no sinecure|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely @D lead not |pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
nt|mariner1: reasonable spot and making 12|pg||
nt|mariner1: well could make 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably only 11 |pg||
nt|mariner1: declarer is worrying about 9th trick,,,, if she attacks @S that worry disappears|pg||
mb|d|nt|pkl: After a club to the ace and switch to diamonds, declarer might well fail.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning Roland|pg||
nt|pkl: But 5@C is a very cheap save|pg||
nt|viren169: North is likely to switch to the J of @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi again John and John|pg||
nt|lestergold: how do u lose more than 2 dims a club and a heart played in 23d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d|pg||
nt|mariner1: well them coming in so late means they might have not competed at the 3 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 ruffs i see|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H has play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they do not fiund spade ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|mariner1: no dbl so no trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: cthis hand should certainly have been competed to the three level|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is too easy a ride|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|jcomyn: C switch |pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 13 tops, but 15 with the @c finesse.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 11 now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: now down  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|capercliff: 11h is not so easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: naw|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should venture 3d she knows partner has fivwe|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: well that solves the defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: why not pitch a @H there?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think she wants 3 ht tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: or thought she did |pg||
nt|sybarra: so easy for us to see,  not easy at the table |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tihas: so this is the last match in the championship, and 4 teams are rather close at the end of round robin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lively start anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... -2 for a (probable) par result! |pg||
nt|toobad: yeah lol|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: jeepers NS playing this|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: the 2H overcall should warn her|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have a wish to play golf in Ireland rather soon|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: Monte Carlo had a good win in the last round.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Aivar Tihane from Estonia|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@h|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: even 1 isn't :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and at least 8 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now N is in a spot of bother|pg||
pc|c8|nt|capercliff: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: should be ok though|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant give up 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: any idea where|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NSE or W|pg||
nt|mariner1: now in danger of going off|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: as she has already passed and limited her hand there is no danger of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mariner1: now @D loser can disappear though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: needs to stay away from the @c plays and there goes another @S|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think the @s9 mislead N|pg||
nt|thegarve:  So this match looks buried unless Wales perform the Lazarus coup|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: so is W with that play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pkl: Perhaps only down one, viren?|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 93, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 78,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 67,  WALES 46  ****|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tihas: un summary, monte carlo has a 13.5 VP lead over Druva, so for Druva to have a chance for the gold they must win at least 22-8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CK is (almost certainly) marked, so draw trumps and play a club towards the queen - may be a problem if trumps 3-1 and clubs 5-1|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like all the players are keen to make their mark early in the match!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely this is a CRTFH hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no idea at all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no forgot the H10|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pkl: Pender hoping for more clubs at East. This was not to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: except that...short in hts and not much esle to ruff |pg||
pc|d2|nt|tihas: then there is another match, where Roheline Lammas plays Ekspromt, and the former has basically the same number of VP as Druva|pg||
nt|mariner1: N more likely to have K@H so @H to A@H, A@C and ruff @c and cash Q@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcomyn: one down could be a good start for wales|pg||
nt|sybarra: *else|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 89,  N-IRELAND 89,  ENGLAND 78,  CBAI 73,  IRELAND 71, WALES 46 ****|pg||
nt|mariner1: sometimes the spots you have are more important than the number you|pg||
nt|mariner1: have,,,,,, she had 7 great @S and only 8 mediocre @c|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|idc: not sure I liked that 2nd round of @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true I suppose|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: too late now|pg||
nt|santyclz: This hand is not going to help.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|toobad: afternoon all|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this works as well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb: drawing trumps does not look right, although not fatal on this layout|pg||
nt|jallerton: W has control now|pg||
nt|chick: nor I, no reason not to repeat the finesse missing that many trumps|pg||
nt|capercliff: down now|pg||
nt|sybarra: now sorry she pitched the @S's|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: if N play Portrush or Royal Co Down ; W Rosses Point; S Killarney or Tralee and E  European club|pg||
pc|cT|nt|idc: seemed to stake everything on 3-3 hearts when there was no rush to commit yourself|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ruff hgh and then low|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi John|pg||
nt|mariner1: unless she hooks the @H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: hmmm, even 3-3 @h might not have been enough|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s was best after first @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi John!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: so making 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: could lose an imp or more there|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: now d guess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: think we might be making this one now |pg||
nt|sybarra: think she might just take her 9 tricks now |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two rounds ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: u beginning to hope?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: thats well done|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|viren169: well done|pg||
nt|pkl: One down - nicely guessed ;-)|pg||

nt|capercliff: so 3-3 @h was unlickly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: great to see clubs come into their own at last|pg||
nt|pkl: I've heard that winning the Lady Milne Cup is almost as important to the Irish as winning the six nations, but that might be overdoing it|pg||
nt|pkl: Will East open? Would you guys?|pg||
nt|viren169: just a bit!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this spade suit would be easier to play :)|pg||
nt|toobad: when Ciara and Diane have the cards and are on form, anything possible!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But in fact - with Q10s on dummy and 19-20 on the opener, a @h cannot be right|pg||
nt|thegarve:  West had a huge hand on the bidding and 4@s is lazy|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandable that the opening bidder may have had 13 points!|pg||
nt|mariner1: misfits abound here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2 nine card minor suit fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: unlikely even|pg||

nt|idc: I was remionded of some dates I've been on years ago|pg||

nt|jcomyn: sure is, but Ireland will NOT be winning the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|pkl: Do you have the standings, Bjorling?|pg||
nt|viren169: Bal'd 11 counts are looking for swings!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think NI has every chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! once I had contact with Golf & leisure Ireland. They sponsored a tournament at my club once a year|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but now it´s bridge....|pg||
nt|toobad: sorry folks, Ciara Burns and Diane Greenwood ........... in the open room, i hope!! lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont care for that S suit lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makes things difficult|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you are right John - always 4@h + 3@d + @sA = 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad breaks abound tho|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes she should have cashed the A@H early as either k drops or has to ruff Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: with it|pg||
nt|lestergold: east opening light here pard is gonna do a lot of bidding now |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|mariner1: part score special here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pkl: Pass - really must be a question of style|pg||
nt|viren169: The Hackett boys would have opened East's hand in their sleep!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Northern Ireland 1, Scotland 2, Ireland 3, Ireland B 4 England 5  Wales 6|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: better to defend 2@s as EW and play it|pg||
nt|toobad: it will keep them out of trouble and 3/3 break |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N swish likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile hjard for vul opps to get into auction and find their club fit!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: some of them were unlickly too :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  evening Cliff Jeffrey and Ian|pg||
nt|toobad: is that leb?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: S aggressive opening bid mught get NS to 3NT|pg||
nt|tihas: which actually makes on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: 41s is a practical bid here|pg||
nt|jallerton: can N avoid partner's suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|capercliff: Scots better cash their tricks|pg||
nt|idc: hi Martin|pg||
nt|mariner1: a rounded suit works best|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s need to get the @H suit right (not sure that is easy)|pg||
nt|mariner1: now do we see action here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I ment instead of play it..|pg||
nt|toobad: at least the vulnerability is in their favour|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree John, but points in is better....|pg||
nt|toobad: this isnt a speedball then?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who wants to play in S?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should wrap up 9 quick tricks in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  missed the first set and it looks to be  a close match|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I would open the E hand if I were dead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a real crunchy 11 count Not Vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whatever it is TROUBLE|pg||
nt|toobad: here we go|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: Intersting this 2@C bid... seems like it can be used for any hand!|pg||
nt|sybarra: who lead k of @H  (nobody) |pg||
pc|d8|nt|toobad: cutting down the ruffs early|pg||
nt|thegarve:  North took no risks with a 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u come in with t count vul holding two suits one of which has been bid by opps?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: but off on a heart lead - all up to East now|pg||
nt|tihas: so rather fortunate 11 imps for Monte carlo|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 2@C is? single suiter?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D or both majors I imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure where we are going here |pg||
nt|jcomyn: neither are they|pg||
nt|ralfwil: from a small trouble to a bigger|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pass 3D anything is better than this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NI new pair setting out stall early|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ante|pg||
nt|viren169: Makes sense now...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: 6count|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S lead kills 3N,,,,,,, not sure it can be found|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n is the only game that has the vestige of a prayer|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: this might be best |pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead likely and some play now|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead if club opener was natural is absolutely off the scale|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pkl: Could 2@C be four spades and another?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont think so, they play ante|pg||
nt|sybarra: sp taps and what does W do? |pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idc: Ace is for reverse attitude, so they should cash out|pg||
nt|capercliff: udca|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: I cant figure this bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: here |pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I must bid on S I had prefered 2nt (15-17) before D|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: wild boards in 1st half, lots of slams|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is tap  1 |pg||
nt|mariner1: she is removing her own transportation, so its good that @S will break for her|pg||
nt|mariner1: sort of an oops on the @D suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a funny kind of way the l;ead was successful|pg||
nt|lestergold: east didnt dare safety play the dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an oops Rob east is expecting a club thru and the falling in of the roof|pg||
nt|mariner1: well since 3 2 @D also put it in jeapardy the safety play still had value|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: can knock out @DA for nine tricks |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a small @h had been better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think a player at this level ould not make a safety play otherwise when they ar in a thin contract and delightwed to make it|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops 3 - 1 @D I mean|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: as spades are 4-3 |pg||
nt|viren169: I guess we will have to wait until next hand to know for sure...|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: 3 - 1 @D was 50%|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|pkl: Ah - sorry. Did stare a bit at that word. I don't know that convention ;-)|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice defence...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ante is 2C=D or both majors; 2D= H or S and a aminor; 2H H and a minor ; 2S=S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes the trump attack is good and works well|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|idc: in one with perfect fits and 3 grand slams available for NS, england reached game & scotland 4@d :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck! no exit card!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pkl: Ah... makes sense|pg||
nt|viren169: Thks|pg||
nt|sybarra: no rush on the @H  we know those cash |pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back now|pg||
nt|sybarra: k of @C or a @D? now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a @D we know that will be there also |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 - 0 @D is 10% so 60% for the play once S followed|pg||

nt|capercliff: 1N?|pg||
nt|viren169: Good hands for opening weak NT|pg||
nt|pkl: It looks like the limit is 2@S EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt n/s?  have she handle it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont like 5-4 twos I believe it should always be 5-5|pg||
nt|santyclz: We get spoiled playing on bbo where that would have been claimed at trick 3.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  N/S should save in 5@d over 4@s - no guarantees though|pg||
nt|lestergold: when does it gain ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it is 100% the best line, whether it works or not :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: disagree on this occasion|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: nothing she does was a 100% so you opt for the best line|pg||
mb|d|nt|tihas: otherwise it would have been very dangerous play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these are again very tricky boards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c on W but how?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N ... about only game that makes either way best defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: an we open what with N hand?|pg||
nt|mariner1: we pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: E will open|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hope I have a 2 suited bid in my arsenal actually |pg||
nt|mariner1: if you open N you will never get both suits in and show as weak as you are|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes if you have that then its works here|pg||
nt|mariner1: a two suiter by N would possibly lead EW into 3N though|pg||
nt|sybarra: true also Rob|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|capercliff: 2@h will need a bit of luck|pg||
nt|pkl: Kelly knew that ;-)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: notice that excellent hand to start was a mere 2S in open room - jeepers|pg||
nt|viren169: Now North may roll back in with a dble...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|toobad: d trans coming up|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 3nt likely e/w|pg||
nt|mariner1: so does that|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has an interesting problem..... pass, 4@H or DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H would be my call though.........|pg||
mb|2D|nt|thegarve:  East will protect with a double|pg||
nt|viren169: and E/W will take the push to 3@S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|idc: just about to suggest the same thing|pg||
nt|idc: it isn't mandatory at teams, but just about worth it I think|pg||
nt|jallerton: giving W a decision|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@s will need even more luck|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant imagine W floating it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and they mat even play in the 33 @s fit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@c to show a good @h weak 2.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tihas: it would be tempting to pass on 2@s with E hand|pg||
nt|tihas: but you have to be fairly certain that partner would balance also with 6 hcp|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East goes for the vulnerable game - might even have bid 3NT |pg||
nt|jallerton: in which case East did well to pass out 2@h|pg||
nt|idc: 3-3 fits are good for you, they often play quite well|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like Knight got their 1st!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and interesting hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: even I wouldnt bid 2S on that rubbish|pg||

nt|lestergold: if either opp holds singleton q its a losing play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H makes here|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: for one thing, the fdefenders rarely realize what's afoot|pg||
nt|capercliff: might make 2@h on this lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'd still prefer to defend 2@h that play in the concealed 3-3 fit vulnerable|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the 33 fit often plays rather well|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes because you normally have a 9-card side suit:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 3nt on W with a @h lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and in the only case it helps it needs an error from the defence |pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: South might have led the @SJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: dble by S is a bit risky with West still unlimited|pg||
nt|viren169: and only 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Cant see any line to make this...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a trick she didnt have |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and a really bad lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with @dA on N always 9 tricks in nt|pg||
nt|toobad: i prefer 2nt rather than 3d from W|pg||
nt|sharkirl: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|mariner1: look at it later without worrying about being off,,,, consider only making it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: the 2@s opening actually got NS out of the trouble with bad @h break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: was 2D a transfer?|pg||
nt|toobad: doubt it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then why did E bid 2H?|pg||
nt|toobad: prob dont play transfers to minors over interference|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at last they were. but I don´t think they were agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi michael|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats what i am considering|pg||
nt|mariner1: this will play easy enough|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: partner's suit, and all that|pg||
nt|tihas: they probably would have arrived in 4@h if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|henryb: gee. I would get to 2@h|pg||
nt|tihas: 2@s opening promised a minor, too, so the logical thing would be to look for this minor|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i suspect more IMPs out here and at this rate for CBAI to clock up a century soon|pg||
nt|santyclz: The w hand has 2 strikes against it for a weak 2.  4 cards in the other major and a side ace.  Either one might be ignored, but both is iffy.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  FWIW I wiuld have opened the South hand 1@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pkl: So any possiblility to win 3@S? There's no legit way, but could Pender perform some kind of magic? I dont believe so|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks cast-iron - north's overcall was somewhat light- hearted|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|toobad: 3d and a s it looks like|pg||
nt|toobad: tick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: w will make|pg||
nt|thegarve:  or 1@s playing my strong @C system showing hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: how can it rbe right to play the J when its never right for defenders tio cover and its never right to run it either|pg||
nt|mariner1: no you are hung up on N getting in without considering the highest % to make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|henryb: 1@c-1@d-1@s-1NT-2@h all pass|pg||

pc|c5|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|tihas: basically he was hoping that ops would cash their 5 club tricks and there would be pressure in the end to create the 8th trick|pg||

nt|idc: the garve is late, as usual :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm for system cards|pg||
nt|idc: I'm afraid we don't have published systems for the English team, so we'll either need to guess|pg||
nt|steshome: A slam to start with!|pg||
nt|jallerton: or some of them anyway|pg||
nt|idc: or use the encyclopedic knowledge of Sarah and Jeffrey |pg||
nt|viren169: Now a great hand...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4H  normal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah minor slam good|pg||
nt|roswolf: slamtime|pg||
nt|mariner1: -50 seems like a great result for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could get too high here.......|pg||
nt|mariner1: we all can be at times :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: wow, grandy time|pg||
nt|henryb: 13 on top with no finesses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always interesting to see how pairs cope with this kind of deal|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think the play exchasnges a genuine technical chance for a psychological chance uits got nothing to do with percentages|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and a c lead to cause problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: Yes - 4@H looks like a nice contract. And no problems with both majors behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D would have made it difficult for Kelly!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that got what it deserved|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3NT or 4S?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I like 2@d on E. I have seen many players bid 1@s on E here om BBO|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes awful isnt it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@H looks to be fairly easy to bid|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may find it difficult to get there with @D concentration|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C is my call with S..........|pg||

nt|sharkirl: positive bid in @Cs would make it easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: well both n +s have some extras but the splinter wont excite north|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: What about 3@s on W?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: south must go on now|pg||
nt|mariner1: she has too much for 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Due to normal first round start-up glitches, we've missed a few boards, but with luck|pg||
nt|jallerton: I believe that EW play 5-card majors, strong NT, possibly also 2@d opener 18-19 balanced.|pg||
nt|capercliff: do they have more than one way to show? If not 2@h is pretty tame|pg||
nt|thegarve:  looks a bit too defensive and no ruffing value for a vul 2S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT is the best chance of game EW|pg||
nt|idc: East hand is borderline try I guess - playing with me it's not but lots of vul weak twos will give play for game|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2NT hre surely?|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would have thought|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think they may be playing 2 ranges of weak 2|pg||
nt|jallerton: this being the weaker variety|pg||
nt|capercliff: so this is the rubbish one?|pg||
nt|pkl: You are contemplating the fourth club by N? Will it cause problems?|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes an advantage that 2/1 has|pg||
nt|roswolf: mid you south should cue now|pg||
nt|roswolf: mind|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is not bad too on this hand|pg||

pc|dA|nt|sybarra: Wales probably just picked up a nice score on the last hand |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done competent bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and without a @c lead, E must not find @dQ - @hJ is falling|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 3-0 is annoying though|pg||
nt|sharkirl: certainly worth a 4@S bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: E-w seem to be playing weak nt's not vul and strong vul (see bd 18).|pg||
nt|lestergold: and of course they are can only lose 2c and a spade|pg||

nt|capercliff: partner has to have something to open 2@d, if not a lot|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes E could bid 2 if not 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s my girl |pg||
mb|1S|nt|petepunt: fav vul,  1st or3rd.  but still tempted in 2nd|pg||
nt|roswolf: and south may try a transfer to clubs|pg||
mb|2C!|an|transfer|nt|tihas: still, N had described balanced hand and driven to slam, so there was a case of adding one more for the road, because S actually hadnt shown a lot in the bidding|pg||
nt|tihas: but its tough at the table to do so|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d = less than 16 points, no 5 card or longer major|pg||
nt|tihas: I think N with balanced hand should have constrained to showing his values|pg||
nt|sharkirl: will they compete?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its the 4th match of six on a 25VP scale and this is the second half of a match|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets non vul opps in and puts pard under too much pressure|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does not need much for slam here....... KQx @c might do it,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: and A@D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jallerton: strong NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Border line for me... |pg||
nt|lestergold: how will pard know that her qj to 4 clubs is worth three tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: NS play Acol, weak NT, Multi 2@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont criticize the bid, its just not my style |pg||
nt|thegarve:  5th match|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: that was the danger - 2@H might be just a balancing bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: wonder what 2@H specifically shows?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: a bid showing both majors gives a second chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: h and s|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: too difficult - if partner jumps to the six-level, he should know what he is doing |pg||
nt|steshome: I thought E/W were playing a weak NT, but we might have a chance to find out soon|pg||
nt|jallerton: S had an interesting decision: pass, double, 3@h or 2NT|pg||
nt|idc: Fearless protecting at teams, vul v not|pg||
nt|petepunt: south had tough bids,  final pass seems about right|pg||
nt|sharkirl: Irish girls are off to a good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have been in now having failed to find a preempt on thefirst round|pg||
nt|mariner1: no chance slam tried here now....... 4@S and out soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is give ur opps free reign to walk all over you bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: my sentiments - that leaves D out of it God gave us 12pts to open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: okay SK but 4-card H|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed Mike, E holding 5 pts and NV vs RED in 3rd needs to JAM as soon as|pg||
nt|mariner1: she can|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless they walk all over themselves that is|pg||
nt|mariner1: wow|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: now S has to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|toobad: with only 2 clubs and no diamonds, South would have 11 major suit cards!!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too true|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 or more here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the result on 4?|pg||
nt|mariner1: bid mistake here|pg||
nt|lestergold: nlow shell balanmce!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: big|pg||
nt|mariner1: they must not play 2@C forcing to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: no she has maintained a consistent silence absurd on the first two occaqsions worth a brilliancy prize on the third!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe she is having an attack of lock jaw or lost her bidding box|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Oh yes, I think you are right, Sarah.  Their 1NT rebid is 15-17!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats what the 2S did - keep opps out of trouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why 3S by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: could only get in so much trouble in @D |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and didnt bid over 2D so bound to have a relatively balanced hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahh, those are the vps not current imp standings.  Duh.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H making 2 I think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pkl: God does not play bridge - according to Niels Bohr, he doesn't even roll dices|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Its a shame that noe of the British Isles countries have any decent software to show hand records and boards - other countries such as Norway do it easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: in which case east might have bid 3@H as i play over a strong nt that 2@H promises good values|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jallerton: trump switch now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the minors well placed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with this bidding. As I play N has shown a minimum|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still has a squeak - not a loud one but a squeak|pg||
nt|sybarra: just pesky that @h are 3/1 |pg||
nt|mariner1: she only needs one ruff in dummy so can lead @H tp hand and @D to dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is why you have to open 4s with this tupe of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes you go down thats life|pg||
nt|mariner1: meanwhile ROI has won the 1st 16 imps vs NI|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: 2d was art semi-positive|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not as bad as not bidding an infrangible throw against the wall icy idiot proof game|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Stockdale might have put a red card on this, but she may have been worried about getting blood on her dress :)|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I was wondering if double was a possibility.  Still time for a trump switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: looks as though E is trying to put W in to get a ruff (or two if partner has @sK10x|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 3 @S to keep n/s out of minor suit partial '|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now N has got a chance. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no ralf the other way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or S!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|capercliff: was the 10 from J10 or K10|pg||
nt|viren169: No... but Gad does!|pg||

nt|ralfwil: My lead had been a @s|pg||
nt|toobad: CBAI are also in 3h EW on board 18|pg||

nt|jcomyn: The Lady Milne is for LADIES only|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wow a vul NT on that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: have you seen the lead?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh sorry didnt see the opoening bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you don't overcall 1@h, don't complain when your pd doesn't defend as well as possible.|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb: 4N would not occur to me|pg||
nt|henryb: 1100 I stand corrected|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Scotland in the lead though last hand may change that|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: would you double as West?|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I would|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3@h is pre-empting yourself|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5-9|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass?!?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed in the main to stop both opps + pard from bidding/suggesting leads etc|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 6@H looks likely to be bid in the other room on Board 4 - 1@H : 3@C opening sequence|pg||
nt|sharkirl: probably difficult to stay out of 6 here now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|idc: If 1@c could be 11-13 bal, probably not|pg||
nt|jallerton: No, sorry to mislead you earlier, 1@c was natural or 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|idc: but since that isn't what they play, i probably would|pg||
nt|steshome: Is that lead right?|pg||
nt|capercliff: ive never understood playing 1N natural here, but I suppose these days opp open and respond with anything|pg||
nt|capercliff: and N certainly has @h stopped|pg||
nt|thegarve:  as East was a passed hand|pg||
nt|pkl: Ouch. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 matches tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17, 2@C c/b|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 1nt-opening both hands have a @d lead in defence|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no penalty X any more|pg||
nt|roswolf: on another day north would pass this and they would miss a game|pg||

nt|lestergold: well there is nothing here FRob to give us an opporunity to have a good old public debate about odds|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: West consults system file for "Interference over Blackwood" section |pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a logical lead; E thinks that declarer has @cJxxx and partner may have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: A lot like to play 2H natural there, so that would be an option|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and made|pg||
nt|sybarra: best to play from W?|pg||
nt|mariner1: should get this right as if S has A@C then she is always off so has to play N for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: in desperate times like these, E might actually consider bidding 7@h all by himself after partner launches blackwood|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes reasonable shot|pg||
nt|capercliff: could it hurt to get count in @c first?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not a great success here, however.  I think a top club would be found by most people (rightly or wrongly)|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I agree|pg||
nt|capercliff: good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|petepunt: may have upgraded S to 18-19 an drebid 2n|pg||
nt|thegarve:  will build a 9th trick in @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: well easier to play in E however should make anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: not easy for E to bid 3N though|pg||
nt|mariner1: rise Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: or duck just do not win in hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Aussies call that "punting" :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n or 4h sldegehammer proof two bullets only to lose|pg||
nt|mariner1: in US when you "punt" you give up :0|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: good thing declarer doesnt have 7 top tricks now|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, Cliff, is partner has a singleton club|pg||
nt|viren169: Wales are giving Eire a ahead strart before they get going... |pg||
nt|mariner1: Oz punting = betting on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: for me 1nt on W is too weak 11 HP and two 10|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they might be thinking of the 6 they missed on B 4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: yes too stroing with two bullets|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this is not nice at all|pg||
nt|toobad: EW off in 3nt played from the west hand on board 19, so another plus to NI|pg||
nt|roswolf: now we are in dangerous territory since north has cuebid clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: 6@H+1 may be EW's best result. NS likely to save over a seven bid|pg||
nt|jallerton: she can finesse in @H|pg||
nt|capercliff: but will still roll home with 3-2@h and 3-3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: should be OK with @s 3-3 and @dA onside|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: suits dont break well|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||

nt|sharkirl: Hi Joe|pg||

nt|mariner1: now she has it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jallerton: and W cannot get in to lead a low @d|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sharkirl: as predicted |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: the best possible result, rather than the best result possible :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If you are in 4@h and @s is lead, you will make!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely cant pass 3H bid thats bold Mary Madden|pg||
pc|h5|nt|thegarve:  East cannot get West in to play the pressure low @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: W figures to hold at least 5@D here so may guess @Hs right (vacant spaces)|pg||
nt|petepunt: however, may prefer to play on @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: choices choices I hate them|pg||
nt|petepunt: if @S a @C swith will defeat i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west has no other lead but a top club|pg||
nt|lestergold: u mean north should have considered slam possibilities he was pretty close to thinking about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: shde|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|jcomyn: musthave found the C lead against 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh my:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Still a trick short if defense is careful.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Cliff Gillis|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|capercliff: hello again|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: with hts not breaking ......|pg||
nt|toobad: 2d was going for a number, wires badly crossed|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I wonder why all weekend Ladies seem to have such problems with their leads, when lead looks standard|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is lucky that there arent 12 tricks on top - this should still go -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Cliff,  glad you arrived as I have to leave |pg||
nt|mariner1: just needs to not set up those losing @D tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|capercliff: chances of stiff @c are less than giving away the contract no?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now the H should be played right|pg||
nt|sharkirl: not if east lets go a @D on run of @Hs|pg||
nt|capercliff: ahhh|pg||
nt|mariner1: no I was speaking to the odds statement you made :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no bullets no singletons|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: no slam tries N here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|santyclz: It would still make 9 tricks with a @h lead in this case.|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Cliff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkirl: and they only got to 5 on Board 4 in the other room|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: but "right|pg||
nt|petepunt: odds still close|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi Rob|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: but "right" is a gentle term,  E  has a ht trick coming |pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: 1@S 4!g 3@D 1C is ideal but tough|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt: 4@H,  1@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: declarer thinking|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sharkirl: only chance is to play 3 more rounds of @Hs and pray|pg||
nt|mariner1: N pitching a @D helps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: Q@H now strangles N|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: well both defenders should know the position and in particular that no trick can be ducked to rectify the count|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jallerton: time for a concession|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting ropey|pg||
nt|petepunt: small will guarantee|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh well it was a thoughtful lead as you say Jeffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: prayers coming|pg||
pc|hK|nt|viren169: If 4@C is NF... North has to start with a dble...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I  noticed this in the first session - there are no penalty doubles on lower levels today!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as I mentioned earlier whats wrong with leaving 2D X in - it is not a disaster if it happens to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 3 or 4 now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: Not easy...|pg||
nt|santyclz: It may be hard for e to imagine the @cak in w.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pkl: North has a fantastic hand after 3@D. If anything, she could bid 4@H as slam invitational.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|toobad: on that bidding 2d dble is clear penalty|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|3C|nt|mariner1: type hand where you make slam only if you do not bid it|pg||
nt|icecold: might go down in the game|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D multi or a weak 2 major|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you bid it in spades you would probably make it|pg||
nt|ady: seems 4@s  shhould go down  on heart lead  mad 13 tricks  in CR|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|robinswr: jack of spade probably didn't get covered |pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|icecold: hard for S to see it|pg||
nt|ady: you can make because south has 3 clubs     draw 2 trumps   and run clubs     south has to follow 3   so that allows 4@S to make|pg||
nt|icecold: H switch not unreasonable|pg||
nt|robinswr: ns must be playing a from ak and not ace is the power lead|pg||
nt|icecold: rite|pg||
nt|ady: if ace is their stong lead  north should p lay the Q@D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|icecold: test|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I admit that I hate the 1@S overcall, but on that hand it certainly worked|pg||
nt|idc: I suppose the Scottish protective bidding is getting sounder|pg||
nt|idc: -5 last time, that one was only booked for -3 at most|pg||

nt|viren169: 4@D at least|pg||
nt|sybarra: guys  I have to leave for team match |pg||
nt|capercliff: possible slam here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H likely NS  3N makes too|pg||

nt|lestergold: i was saying that we had no complex debate about odds on this dull hand available|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS and out|pg||
nt|Walddk4: whose sister is playing in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Adam|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Alex|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good evening, at least it will be for either Scotland or NI.|pg||
nt|lestergold: joining us for the coffee hands session|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jallerton: undo|pg||
nt|sybarra: so cu later |pg||
mb|3C|nt|capercliff: funny little hand this|pg||
nt|idc: we're being made to pay for the exciting hands in the first half|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s looks pretty routine after stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ok Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H@H!  thx all |pg||
nt|capercliff: but that would be ambitious|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam makes that I see|pg||
nt|lestergold: if e/w were not vulnerable then there might be some interest here possible sacrifices barrages but at this vulnerability east will pass quickly|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and it is very close now I think|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I sure the dealing machine, or the players, will have some excitement for us.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: this lot are a lot flatter|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 3N by e/w perhaps|pg||
mb|4S|nt|capercliff: 7@h on 2 hooks anyone?|pg||
nt|steshome: Another reasonable slam.  |pg||
nt|jallerton: Roland, maybe|pg||
nt|viren169: brave dble|pg||
nt|petepunt: by, shirley good luck|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored @c and no place to put a @S from S means no slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can not afford to miss another game|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they have shown a little propensity to do that unfortunately|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D might be the call here,,,,, though that might be too strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@D transfer?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 2@d = 6@h and I think 8-11 points|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT = 4-card raise, 3@S = shortage, I think|pg||
nt|steshome: The 3@S bid should get them to 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.cbai.ie/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 60 series England has won on 46 occasions, Scotland on 9, Wales won three times and Northern Ireland twice. The Republic of Ireland, joining the series in 1998, has yet to win|pg||
nt|idc: i prefer 3NT by North after a 15-17 NT |pg||
nt|thegarve:    4@Sor 3NT - looks like all the hands with singleton and voids were used up in the last set|pg||
nt|capercliff: my predictions living up to the bill|pg||
nt|idc: SHould make on power when a bad trump split might doom 4@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmm|pg||
nt|petepunt: interestin what u should play 2@s as here|pg||
nt|mariner1: can't set up @D to pitch enough @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think double followed by another spade bidaltho 2s should show almost these values|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL 3@S 3@D all reasonable|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Hope N/S have a way of showing values here - Lebensohl or similar.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S could be a great suit with less values I thihnk|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: For the first time we have six teams taking part. The sixth spot goes to the host, this year Ireland. They are represented by two teams: Republic of Ireland and CBAI (Contract ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bridge Association of Ireland)|pg||
nt|jallerton: not with 5-3 clubs...|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, if @c weren't 4-4 I'd be wrong but that wouldn't be the first time :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2H and leave it there|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is not 3-card drury|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jallerton: Maybe, Sarah, although the minor suit jacks help to make 6@h so good|pg||
nt|steshome: Roland you heard your name being taken in vain! We think you would be in 7@h on this one|pg||
nt|pkl: Oh - that D is obvious with my glasses on|pg||
nt|pkl: Ah - perhaps not.... *shining glasses*|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@d by w anyone?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@d natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a 2s bid north would have no excuse for not inviting game|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: or 3@D cue?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now 3s and they are thwere|pg||
pc|hA|nt|capercliff: I would rather be in 4@s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a safe part score|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Without any doubt|pg||
nt|idc: EW or NS?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I confess I would pass in 4th seat if 1nt weren't available.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 2s is a slight underbid and this sequence is a slight overbid|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like N/S are on their way to 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: CBAI managed to bid 4@H on Board 5 after a 1@C opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unless you paid my debts!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: NW|pg||
nt|santyclz: Response to 1@h, not opening.|pg||
nt|capercliff: but I believe they are playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the right spot and should make 5|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Phew.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: In the Camrose Trophy and Lady Milne (women), the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland play as separate entities, unlike other international competitions where the Irish Bridge ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Union sends one team to represent the island of Ireland|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting is that you kinda need both finesses to make 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many times did you win the LM, Sarah?|pg||
nt|capercliff: but 8x@d is helpful|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe she lost count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You using your toes too?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|steshome: I don't know Roland.  I think six?|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@H is enough with Marray's hand, 2@S seems to be over stating their hand...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good to play 2@H as about 8-10 and 3@S and 2@S as 5-7 ?|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s 5-2 doesnt help|pg||
nt|lestergold: well good ladies they are where they should be|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: true Mike and I like to err, most times, on the side of aggression|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb: tricky thing is not to touch @d and keep E from getting endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: six is correct|pg||
nt|capercliff: is West worth another try?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Ah, so Roland was just testing!|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe 4@s?|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if they have agreements over the dbl - would pass by East have been more serious try for example?|pg||
nt|idc: maybe it would just have shown some sort of control and 4@c denies one|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if not playing 2/1 maybe but the suit is too poor imo|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant even see 5 now that I ook at it|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are right Rob |pg||
nt|rednaxela: The NI lead over England is now down to 3 imps.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: pass might just sho interest with no convenient cue|pg||
nt|jallerton: show|pg||
nt|viren169: Now a @C leads is marked...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|steshome: On this layout, yes - but both contracts cold so no problem|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I have two ways  of raising to game opposite 1Nt with 4M  - one for hands with Qxxx or worse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nooooo|pg||
nt|viren169: same colour!|pg||
nt|pkl: Whatever bid by N, I guess a game would be bid. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: s lead cant be right|pg||
nt|pkl: What is the meaning of 2@S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: daresay asking|pg||
nt|viren169: Only 8 tricks available on a @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: often these hands fall between two stools|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb: they will not succeed|pg||
nt|henryb: on defense|pg||
nt|idc: my opponents don't even need solid stuff outside - last weekend they had Qx opposite Txx|pg||
nt|pkl: Also, I don't understand Kellys first pass.... would have bid 2@C|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now is is 12|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: General force looking for 3N I guess... not sure why?!?!|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H seems right to me... after redble and 2@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|capercliff: cant set up @d and cant ruff 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|idc: I've missed lots of better slams than this one, so no shame in playing game|pg||
nt|idc: but they seemed well placed until the end|pg||
nt|capercliff: either way, the 4@c bid made West's hand huge IMO|pg||

nt|icecold: who is on lead -)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ady: it may not on this hand    but south will be worried when north bids sspades at a high level|pg||
nt|icecold: 3N pass 4S and a lot of imps|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would have overcalled 2diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: yes     south should give up     |pg||
nt|icecold: I prefere 2D overcall |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@D here too|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|icecold: S is not comfortable   serves him right -))))|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree|pg||
nt|ady: he must give up   and hope hsi strong  hand will be enough|pg||
nt|emre kaya: he will bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: of course he deserves to be opposite KJxxxx instead of 8 solid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H was a transfer here I assume|pg||
nt|icecold: 5C ?  or 3N  correcting to 4N to play  -)))|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|icecold: he did it !!|pg||

nt|jcomyn: NO |pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: well done to them|pg||
nt|idc: I see some of the missing scores are up - Board 2 is quite funny|pg||
nt|thegarve:  no|pg||
nt|pkl: What will Marray bid? 1NT looks sensible|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah 6D |pg||
nt|mariner1: could see action here,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good spot here|pg||
nt|capercliff: but that might not stop 4@s being bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: I predict EW in 3@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: N/S doing need many reasons to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 5@H DBL so mistake is minimized to some degree|pg||
nt|mariner1: that in Open Room on 21|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: hmm this will be a lottery 7@S is possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe in 2@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: they are aggressive players|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: +190 is not a score you often see|pg||
nt|idc: NS can make 3 grand slams, but England gained 10 for reaching game when Scotland here|pg||
nt|thegarve:  you can choose to ask for a weak doubleton with declarer qX or worse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: similar to first half slam|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes a great contract 6@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now that 2S is ok non-vul |pg||
nt|petepunt: i suspect 4@h will be result|pg||
nt|sharkirl: probably will do well to bid 4|pg||

nt|mariner1: well I that opening changes things :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a coup-le of clubs or nso vs a couple of diamonds|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: could only reach 4@d :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2NT-3NT ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a part score battle between the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@D = good raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|idc: hard to avoid 4@s now - but it does have some slim chances I suppose|pg||
nt|thegarve:  or show a weak doubleton major|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h direct now?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like only part scores here|pg||
mb|4N|nt|othered1: was east going to pass 2@HX for penalty?|pg||
nt|capercliff: Im assuming S passed what N thought was a forcing bid|pg||
nt|jallerton: a good method to play transfers from 1NT upwards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not 1D by S?|pg||
nt|pkl: Okay... 1@C looks sensible too - especially if your NT range doesn't comply ;-)|pg||
nt|pkl: They play Welsh, perhaps?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why bid this way?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: u are right|pg||
nt|sharkirl: unlikely to get to 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome: Level now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @d2 from W E must trust her P and play low!|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn not high ones either a short auction i expecvt|pg||
nt|mariner1: well EW could play a @S Moysian but will not be found|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has valued her hand on the slightly optimistic side|pg||
nt|lestergold: the two jx dont count up to 2 worthwhile points|pg||
mb|5C|nt|henryb: 3N has good chances|pg||
nt|petepunt: strong NTrumpers may get to 6@D though|pg||
nt|petepunt: after 1D opening!|pg||
nt|mariner1: and NS cards are well situated over EW|pg||
nt|capercliff: needs to pick up the @h, there goes the @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the @c problem is solved|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 4@s has none|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT = 3-card raise?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  50-50 decisions.....|pg||
nt|idc: CC says bergen raises, surprised they can have only 3 card support|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2@d must have been @d and a major|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Agreed, but AQ109xx is worth more than 6 points.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3d is probably too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: Soctland only lost 4 imps on 21, dodges a BIG BULLET|pg||
mb|6S|nt|idc: the supplementary notes are missing, so no more detail|pg||
nt|jallerton: this needs a lot going for it to make|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2N is prob natural with 3@s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  intra finesse in @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: but the cards are well placed|pg||
nt|capercliff: sm@d to the 8|pg||
nt|jallerton: in @s, @d and @c|pg||
nt|idc: @dT lead was perhaps one chance, as long as declarer ducked first round|pg||
nt|viren169: Now they will reach the poor 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would bid 3@S FORCING and then over 4@S (which west shoul bid) bid 6|pg||
nt|sharkirl: should be able to take @H finesse for 11 tricks at least|pg||
nt|santyclz: 12 tricks available, but not expected.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Scotland|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have bid 2d and then come to life if my parner made another noise|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: my wife is a beginner and I would slap her hand if she bid 1H over 1C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: difficult after some jump by E|pg||
nt|sharkirl: sounds reasonable Geoffrey|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open made 3N where 4@H was off here so 12 imps on board 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: why?|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb: just has to hope @d are 4-4|pg||
nt|henryb: and @s 3-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It seems that South does not like leading his partner's suit|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it is against the rules in Estonia based on observations yesterday and today|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this lead will worry declarer, until he sees the 4-4 split|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with xx and await developments|pg||
nt|mariner1: that was board 6 sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: ROI has overtaken N. Ireland! so Scotland in the driver's seat now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: one has to remmebe that a neg double doesnt promise the earthso when rebidding one should only jump with a full monty kind of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: This is a good game to reach, some chances of it being missed in the replay|pg||
nt|viren169: That's why she would bid 1@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: more imps coming in|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ha ha ha|pg||
nt|jcomyn: into a bid suit weird|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh sorry through one|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: now it cant make|pg||
nt|pkl: Oh - I believed wife-beating to be forbidden during bridge tournaments|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I thought 1N rebid showed strong NT?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: difficulty counting her tricks?|pg||
nt|capercliff: uh oh|pg||
pc|cA|nt|thegarve:  still has chances if @h are set up|pg||
nt|capercliff: not enough entries|pg||
nt|thegarve:  @h now to help|pg||
nt|jallerton: or @c switch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: purely a hypothetical slap|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well if there were any doubt about the location of the @dq...|pg||
nt|mariner1: well maybe NS play this as invite|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkirl: surely claim coming up|pg||
nt|sharkirl: scotland v R.O.I. have just bid 6@c on this one|pg||
nt|lestergold: the kind of hand in whioch you had a jump rebid when partner responds at the one level- north hand did not qualify for that|pg||
pc|c8|nt|capercliff: 4@s is a good save but tough at these colors|pg||
nt|thegarve:  where's Frazer - "we;re doomed"  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: What can @d2 be? fourth best or what else?|pg||
nt|capercliff: down 1 now|pg||
nt|mariner1: CBAI can pick up on 7 too to close this match up|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: perhaps N felt her hand worth a strong NT rebid|pg||
nt|pkl: Hypothetical slaps seems proper for hypothetical auctions|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I must admit that the South hand would be too weak for me to double at the 2 level on.  Only 2 points outside their suit.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petepunt: claim time|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3 slams available, but that isn't one of them.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: under different circumstances, ducking that diamond may have been very dangerous |pg||

mb|2N|nt|capercliff: is there something on E/W?|pg||

nt|sharkirl: no 3nt6|pg||

nt|mariner1: I would have bid this same way|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is fast for here i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome: Surely only if you could remove 3@c to 3@D without showing extras?|pg||
nt|capercliff: then I bid @d|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland only reached 3@h in other room on last hand, so a swing coming for England|pg||
nt|idc: It started 1@h Dbl 2@h, a big underbid, and that was that|pg||
nt|viren169: More imps headed to Wales here |pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 3@C by East|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 4S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have heard that it rains once a day on Ireland!|pg||
nt|toobad: i would open the N hand 24/7|pg||
nt|lestergold: better go up with that q and finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: a one entry dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it needs to be used now|pg||

nt|lestergold: many dfangers mlost of which you can do nothing about|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  11 for us Jeffrey?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes but that would require playing @d before trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thats that|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: 64 imps in eight boards, with one flat. Not bad |pg||
nt|othered1: with kind splits, this is no problem|pg||
nt|henryb: no. South wins @s, leads @d to A and N cashes 2@h tricks|pg||
nt|tihas: sry, correct, the switch at trick 2 beats it|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: looks good to me too, but that may not be much of a recommendation|pg||
nt|petepunt: may well lead j@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a part contract in @h on NS and 3@c on EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand for EW here........ W has no easy entries if E plays it|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C is a good spot|pg||
nt|capercliff: hard for E to stop here|pg||
nt|mariner1: in fact 6N has a problem|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 6 Clubs and Diamonds make too.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This will be a swing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont matter much|pg||
nt|petepunt: save 2imps with the lead potentially|pg||
nt|mariner1: well if EW played Lebensohl over reverses this would be easier|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Or maybe not.|pg||
mb|6D|nt|pkl: Switch to spade now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think you are a better golfer than I and also younger - 70 yeard and hcp 9|pg||

nt|capercliff: i was just going to say that|pg||
nt|capercliff: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 6@C has issues|pg||
nt|lestergold: in all othetr contracts there are entry problems to easts hand as dimjs break 4/3 you cannot overtake|pg||

nt|mariner1: maybe best to avoid slam here :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ralfwil: years..|pg||

mb|d|nt|steshome: What's wrong with 2@H? |pg||
nt|capercliff: nothing|pg||
nt|jallerton: No, this is their only way to open a weak 2|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx Jeffery|pg||
nt|jallerton: some prefer a decent suit, vulnerable|pg||
nt|idc: there isn't a lot between the three possible games, but 4@s is the worst and on this layout, it may fail|pg||
nt|capercliff: if you turn the @h into @s it would be an easy pass no?|pg||
nt|steshome: How quaint ...|pg||
nt|jallerton: I don't know the meaning of 3@S (it was alerted) but if natural it sounds more like 3-card support|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WRONG on both counts Ralf older and higher|pg||
nt|capercliff: but if they dont play reverses GF, then a bid back to partners original suit is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: but E has a very good hand here|pg||
nt|capercliff: even if partner bid @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  Zia used to sit down and ask  oppo's 1NT defence in case they did not have a penalty double|pg||

nt|vugraphzme: luks left for a moment|pg||
nt|othered1: price for doubling 3N, losing 50 points if they manage to run to 4@D, seems fair to pick up large swing when they don't.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, if you make a habit of overcalling on Jxxxx and a king, partner is going to be reluctant to double 3NT with "only" two aces|pg||
nt|othered1: of course, my partners have overcall values when they overcall|pg||

nt|thegarve:  lets see if they reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: CBAI bid 3N on 27 in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: wild breaks here|pg||
nt|rednaxela: CBAI in 3NT on 27 and favoured with a Club lead into the AQ.|pg||
nt|lestergold: an exciting looking hand a simple 5c conjtcat tho or e/w seems the only possible game|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-15|nt|mdgraham: yes, general,principle, not pointing the finger at anyone|pg||
nt|idc: and I suspect she is right, since a @d can go on the @hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 5@C nice spot|pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: they did well to stay low at any rate|pg||
nt|viren169: 4N should be quantative (unless agreed otherwise off course)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: both could play in H again|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|idc: Scotland stopped in 3@h on Board 10 when 4 was makeable, but enough for 6 IMPs and a tied match|pg||
nt|thegarve:  depends which finesse you take|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi.  Not one to show to the children|pg||
nt|idc: true, but I suspect the likely leads are @hA or @d7, both of which might suggest the working line|pg||
nt|thegarve:  bids like this 2@D often push oppo into a thin 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but u do that and the d suit vanishes - I hate quantittive whatever it means|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2@S likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting - EW found 5@s on board 8 instead of a @h contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no she cant be thinking|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s is on|pg||
nt|rednaxela: interesting!|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs accurate bidding here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N made on 27 so its all close|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 10 tricks here on a spade lead....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jallerton: yes, S was very close to raising|pg||
nt|jcomyn: phew|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will play in one of Wests minors or ahve their throats cut|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 5 is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: I can understand not raising, maybe N should X first?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hard to play a low@h and freeze the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Scotland is probably in a tie or close with NI now|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Anyone know what happens if the teams end up on the same VP total?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n might be klet tthru its true but 3n played by east would fail to the obvious qd lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and why should west end up bidding it with 2 small ims|pg||
nt|mariner1: probably a head to head tie breaker???|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: EW seem to have stolen this one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2NT-3C then 3D and bobs your uncle simple game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why wont they xX anyone tell me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where do they go for tricks|pg||
nt|toobad: no source of tricks|pg||
nt|toobad: 7 on top|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot find any D on S! do you agree?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: do we bid on the S hand and if so what?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: I very much dislike opening 1nt without a 3+card major.  This might be an exception.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb: presumably all interference is 2-suited so N could not introduce his @c|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess you look at the 5-card suit and upgrade west hand to 11, ignoring that some of the 10 is junk.   But it worked just fine here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd that North didn't try 3@C|pg||
nt|petepunt: nice discipline|pg||
nt|lestergold: well second best game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb: N was in a live position and vulnerable. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: when vul and caught stay caught|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: oops...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: against vul opps you never know|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s my opinion|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: with a @c lead from N 10 tricka!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could be an easy 500 for all you know|pg||
nt|thegarve:  live a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: this might be a break for NS|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5 lead was a highish pip|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why does the 12-count make the final decision in any case?|pg||
nt|petepunt: Ace for aatt Kfor count is needed here|pg||
nt|santyclz: In 1st-3rd, I'd open 1@d, but in 4th ... well ... 1nt.  but I wouldn't like it.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toobad: i would just pass ......... some hands u just get shafted and have to pass|pg||

nt|thegarve:  in recent times England have had many new players or partneships playing|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2@C or 3@C is a nice spot|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: ok, 3@C can cost, but it can also cost to keep silent. You pays your money and....(etc)|pg||
nt|othered1: 3 games make here|pg||
nt|henryb: Edgar Kaplan used to say that it was partial swings that were the bulk of the gains for strong teams|pg||
nt|viren169: u will find out about 3 key cards and Q of trumps... what more do you need to know?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: 500 mind you so no big deal|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s is not a bad game let alone sac|pg||
nt|steshome: I was wondering about the difference between 3@s and 4@s - didn't consider pass|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was thinking 41s myself|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s|pg||
nt|jallerton: What's your idea of a bad game, Cliff?|pg||
nt|idc: agree Sarah - it might look daring but much less dangerous than some of the protective bids they *have* been making|pg||
nt|idc: and a much bigger potential upside|pg||
nt|steshome: I see that Fiona gained 4 for passing the transfer on the previous board|pg||
nt|capercliff: well we can see all hands, after 1@h the K@d has a good chance of being right|pg||
nt|capercliff: also 2-2 @s not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jallerton: but you need both and even then need to get a trick out of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: director called to table, dummy put hand down before n made bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: that reuires the Q with West |pg||

nt|capercliff: or A@c with E|pg||
nt|capercliff: but regardless, do you really want to defend 4@h?|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I'm told 1N is a game force.  If it demands defined rebids, possible 31H would show that shape.  Then 3@S might be another relay.|pg||
