nt|wilkinsona: it seems declarer can make 10 tricks by careful play|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: tough hand to play, it seems|pg||
nt|irwinbo: very tough he almost will have to reverse the dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or setup clubs and leave trump alone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well if no trumps are lead by the defence, it seems there are 10 tricks on a cross ruff and..|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: on trick 7 now a the table, lost 3 already, waiting for a lead from De Livera, I think|pg||
