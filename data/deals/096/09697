pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: this is not an auction you see every day|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not feel obliged to re-open (a) because he has three spades and (b) because East is a passed hand.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Anyway, when I mentioned the strength of the 2NT rebid I was thinking of 1@H - 2Cx or 2Dx - 2NT. If this is weak, what is opener meant to do with 16 points and 5-3-3-2?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: fit and shape than because of raw high-card values. there are hands on which he would pass 1NT where 4H has play|pg||

nt|jcmax: I could see another advantage on the previous hand. It would have worked :)|pg||
nt|dburn: Mesbur using lebensohl to bail out into clubs, and a question now of whether North competes in spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, good. East does have 13 cards.|pg||
nt|ady: North there with 3@S?|pg||
nt|dburn: if partner is prone to overcall 2@c for the majors on hands such as this, then competing may be unwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: but Forrester's action may have to do with the scoreline as much as with his actual cards|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|ady: this likely to drift down 1|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: yes    does not want to sit to quiet|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: can ruff 2 hearts now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can declarer apply pressure in the majors on South, informed by the bidding?|pg||
nt|dburn: pressure? not really - but he can certainly cash @hA and run the jack, which he might otherwise not be able to do|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: N may try to stop a low ruff by ruffing in and condense the NS defensive prospects|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: or at least, not otherwise have known to do|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, had it not been for the overcall the final contract would probably have been 2@h rather than 3@c|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|jcmax: If the Jack and Ten of @H were reversed declarer might be able to arive at a squeeze postition in the end. But as it is it looks pretty hopeless|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: hopeless? how can he go down?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: as long as he does not play a trump at any stage, and he is hardly likely to do that|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s5|pc|c7|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cK|nt|dburn: now, though, he had better...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: not do that|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|dburn: instead, he should have ruffed a spade and advanced the king of hearts|pg||
