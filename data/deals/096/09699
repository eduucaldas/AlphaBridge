mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|jbgood: but 2 @c and later 4 @s is perhaps better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: sorry about the undos am trying to enter results from other table|pg||
nt|jlrice: if partner picks the shorter suit  i always have doubts on which suit would be better to play in|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - how many of you would bid 1 @h on that collection?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jlrice: i know i wouldnt|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Not vul I would better now and finish|pg||

nt|jbgood: next round should be coming up as soon as comparisons have been made - I have no time schedule|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I will keep the table open and enter results from other table as they come in|pg||
nt|jbgood:   5 was really expensive for the Faigenbaum team, they would have won 6 instead of losing 5 if N had passed 3 @c|pg||
nt|jbgood: an 11 point swing is BIG in short matches|pg||
nt|jlrice: especially using the 30 point scale|pg||
nt|jbgood: still 1200 looking at nothing here - impressive!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: So only one imp in this match but three missed slam chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: On the board on the screen the CR are playing 3NT so that should be a push perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The scoring for this tournament is punishing. A loss by 10 imps is a major loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I will do better next match and not press the wrong button - s-o-r-r-y|pg||
nt|jbgood: you do fine David!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Out it down to old age and Vegas intoxication|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: so all scores in and that should be the final result|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: see you soon|pg||
nt|jbgood: the latter I can understand - the former is surely not valid:)|pg||
