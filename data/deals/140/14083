nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: It's hard to say how much N should bid in this position.|pg||
nt|kfay: They can be almost certain that E/W have a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 1@d or 1@h would be a question in post-mortem|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bebechira: wow.... fantunes is a good syystem'|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see if they stay out og game here|pg||
nt|jane22: All 1-openings forcing, 2-openings 10-13|pg||
nt|kfay: But no spade honors must be a bit disconcerting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: We apologise that the N-S team name is incorrect. The proper name is Chinese Taipei. We can't correct it at this point, but we will get it right for future matches|pg||
nt|kfay: I think it's very popular these days to respond 1@h and bypass a long diamond suit unless you have a game forcing hand, or a hand that's basically only worth one call.  |pg||
nt|hoffers: Can make 6S, but only because clubs are 33|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Any to fight for there parscore at level 4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non will be able to X.|pg||
nt|jaheim: close to 5 @C|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs cl 2-1, and a friendliy @D lay|pg||
nt|kfay: W in there with 5@h may get East too excited.|pg||
nt|mwigor: with @c 3-3 and trumps 2-2 can make 12 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: only a low spade lead and a diamond return beats 5clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I was juect checking but I suppose 3D confirms NS are playing a strong lcub system|pg||
nt|jaheim: 3 @D prob. showning @C and @D|pg||
nt|kfay: I bet he'll take the push.|pg||
nt|kfay: S had better double to prevent a sacrifice.|pg||
nt|kfay: Which N would certainly take after this bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: undo|pg||
nt|jane22: we would probably all bid game?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nickf: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|nickf: welcome to Barbara Travis, many times Aust international player|pg||
nt|bg: I just agre3d to play another match sry|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the 4@C it seems as 2@C was game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 2/1 in a strange way:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't even try @DK as lead now|pg||
nt|kfay: Whether or not the double explicitly asks for a @c lead after this auction is a quesiton, I believe that it should not be so.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bebechira: probably yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Hi Bruce:) Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|jane22: no need to go 2 off; could save a bit here|pg||
nt|kfay: Although I'm sure there are some who would disagree with me.  But generally after preemptive auctions a seemingly out-of-the blue double may be interpreted as 'lightner' requesting ...|pg||
nt|kfay: an unusual lead.  Here, though, I believe partner can reasonably take it as 'please don't sacrifice, partner!!'|pg||
nt|kfay: Best defense will set this 2, but that won't be found I'm quite confident.|pg||
nt|kfay: N is probably debating between a trump lead and a @c.  The opponents are quite likely to be prepared in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say South in with @c A, easy to switch @d? perhaps that's the question|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Apartplay at 2@S?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d a tad ambitious overcall|pg||

mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: or at least you can have that understanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jane22: do CT play precision?|pg||

nt|bebechira: to be honest...i do not know|pg||
nt|kfay: with 3 cards in the majors and a vulnerable opening on their right, W must feel that preemption is indicated.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bebechira: but I can tell you that NS play Fantunes|pg||
nt|jane22: nice lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes'|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: No tempo given so fare.|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@d after a 1@c opener and 2@c after a 1@d opener are both highly effective preempts.|pg||
nt|kfay: Possibly the most destructive calls in the game.|pg||
nt|kfay: Takeout doubles by partner are extremely difficult to interpret.  Everyone plays them as takeout, but do they promise both majors?  Focus on spades?|pg||
nt|mwigor: only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|hoffers: Many now play that a jump shift in other suit of same rank shows a good raise, leaving a double raise as preemptive|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kfay: These are issues that partnerships must address.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaheim: he did  :)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|bebechira: 8 quick tricks now :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be 7|pg||
nt|kfay: It is entirely different than the auction 1@c-(1@d)- where double promises 4-4 in the majors, playing standard methods.|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: How to find 8 tr here??? OK Im blind|pg||

nt|bebechira: yes... that is 3 imps to Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kfay: At the higher level, you would be overloading the double too much to enforce that requirement.|pg||

nt|davidstern: SO that pick will go ok|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rodal f: A read color.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kfay: Most play that it generally promises 2 places to play, if you can't tolerate whichever major partner may respond in, then you can fall back on supporting partner's minor.|pg||

nt|mwigor: doesnt really want to play for penalties with five low trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: I've had people suggest I play it, but I'm more into having consistency of bids - 2NT works fine for me, and also denies the opponents the opportunity to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: much better to allow opener to show his shape with some scheme|pg||
nt|kfay: I agree with the double by Mok.  Probably some would wonder why that might be the decision with a 5-card major.  There are several factors to consider|pg||
nt|mwigor: but doesnt have a 4 card suit and his side is at the 3-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: 1) partner is a passed hand and you have minimal values so you just want to find your best fit if you're going to compete|pg||
nt|kfay: 2) your @s suit is much more stacked than your @h suit|pg||
nt|kfay: the biggest downside is if partner bids @c, but you don't rate to compete very much in the lowest suit anyway.  Hopefully the opponents will come to your rescue by outbidding you.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: here pass was possibly the winning action but partner had an unusually good hand defensively|pg||
nt|davidstern: Poor contract as the cards lie|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaheim: @C  the best lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kfay: And if not... unless you're doubled it's only 50 a trick.|pg||
nt|kfay: Redouble is an interesting choice by W.  There is so much to talk about on these hands!!!|pg||
nt|kfay: I dislike it.  He has no real interest in defending against any suit by the opponents save @c, which I guarantee they will never bid when looking at that suit.|pg||
nt|kfay: But if their partnership has no other way to show these values unless starting with redouble, I suppose there's nothing to be done.|pg||

nt|kfay: This looks like a matchpoint auction!|pg||

nt|hoffers: This will go off before Smolanko gets in|pg||
nt|mwigor: although maybe 2NT was scramble not lebensohl|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kfay: S was probably considering and expert 2@h over 2@d, offering partner the choice to play in either contract and suggesting 4-5 shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c in vul may hard to find a parking place for 3rd @s to @c lead|pg||
