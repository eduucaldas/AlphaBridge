pc|hK|nt|nickf: still, they probably have 5 pages of systems notes on this sequence|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d7|pc|hT|nt|babs59: neither of which happens|pg||

pc|cK|mc|10|nt|fabsayc: he actually had squeeze chances also|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: right but if you run the diamonds sometimes u learn enough to change the odds|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|babs59: admittedly the face he still had the spade entry gave different options|pg||
nt|babs59: fact*|pg||
nt|babs59: 2@S must be their Jacoby over 1@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|babs59: space saving |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but if partner can rebid 4h then you have lost the space back|pg||
pc|sT|nt|babs59: I've had people suggest I play it, but I'm more into having consistency of bids - 2NT works fine for me, and also denies the opponents the opportunity to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: much better to allow opener to show his shape with some scheme|pg||

pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: yes some accept transfer with 1 or 2 hearts also|pg||
nt|babs59: really - I have yet to experience that|pg||
nt|babs59: my opponents usually rebid 1@S (with 4) or 1NT|pg||
nt|nickf: yes, some play skipping the transfer to rebid 1NT shows 18-19|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it all depends on how you treat unbalanced versus balanced hands and your no trump range|pg||
