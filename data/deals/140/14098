mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||

pc|c9|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||

nt|sybarra: but alas a push|pg||
nt|janm: It will be interesting to see whether the other room manages to get the ruffs to beat either of these first two contracts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||

nt|friggi: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
mb|1N|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
pc|s9|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
pc|hA|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: 3@D helps opps more the p|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and E  does not have a good cue here   qx of @H's not easy |pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
pc|s5|nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|henryb:  He can make this, I think. @h to Q, @d|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|gambit: cl already 6 or 7|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|janm: I was wondering about that too - I don't see how he could have done that, but does declarer really have time to set up a club? Say he leads the club Q, now what? North has better ...|pg||
nt|janm: club spots than declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
pc|d5|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@D or 4@s by West?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: with the opening bid,  not easily |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
pc|h9|nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|cascade: well they get to a similar situation after 1@c 1@h; 2@d 3@d ...|pg||
nt|janm: So making 5 or 6 depending on whether they cash the heart A now|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case South might go down at the five level when the opponents were down in 4@s|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|janm: Somewhat similar I suppose, but the S hand would have shown a better hand at that point and N could then bid 3@s to pattern out. I don't know, I just hear comments about how much ...|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||

nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||

pc|sK|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
pc|s9|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|pelu: EW play Low as come on (and even)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Roland!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|janm: Your partner, maybe :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 232 VP - 223 - 218|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janm: Best now is for N to lead a club and get his ruff |pg||
nt|cascade: but a diamond works too|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: I dont play 3/2 well with no high cards LOL|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||

pc|c7|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||

pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
