mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: East would like to bid 2@H again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  i'd be tempted to bid 4@h with E hand after pd's 2@s bid|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: surely PASS doesn't do justice to 4@H and filling @SK|pg||
nt|brgpro: if pd has 64, he would bid 4 himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4@H a bit rich|pg||
nt|brgpro: he can see 4 possible losers in the minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  depends on whether W was telling or asking with 2@s bid|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think EW have judged well here|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, very well|pg||
nt|pelu: very disclipined by East|pg||

nt|alsze:  EW got a good stop at 3@h in the other table for this hand.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: as good an opening bid as any with N hand |pg||

mb|d|nt|joshs: yeah, but 4D is deifinitely not my style witho nly a 7 bagger and 3 defensive tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for a runout mechanism to use 2@C as 4+@C & another suit  2@D as 4+@D and a major  leaving 2@H/@S as 5+ natural|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he pictures @dAQJ and @sKQ by E, then he knows all he rest shd be with W|pg||

pc|sA|nt|joshs: good defense!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: winning the diamond is necessary if spades are 32 and a duck would expose declarer to a third round club ruff, or second round ruff when spade king is on|pg||
nt|alsze:  nicely done|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kelvin yim: well done|pg||

nt|jrssd: I thought the Precision 2C opener on the last hand was very effective at shutting the opps out of the bidding|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jrssd: there is a theory that if you would have overcalled at the one level, you should overcall at the 2 level|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it was, but just looking at the EW hands it is not clear you would thirst to declare rather than defend|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jrssd: and Robinson being short (2) in Clubs pointed towards overcallng 2@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: debatable, bad suit, no shape, mediocre values|pg||
nt|jrssd: Miller-Stout play a very simple form of Precision|pg||
nt|jrssd: Their 2 over 1 is NOT game forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that theory has its clear limitations. for example, most of us would risk a 4-card overcall at the one level routinely on certain holdings in certain situations, but never at the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: two level|pg||
nt|kelvin yim: after the @SK, open room E shifted the @DQ|pg||
mc|7|nt|joshs: for the specs, souths club holding was known by inference of the play at trick 1, thus west was marked with 2 of the HA, HK, DK and SA|pg||

mb|p|nt|jrssd: I would THINK EW can bid to 4@H, but who knows?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jrssd: a spec was asking how many teams are in the tourney - 13; all from different countries|pg||
nt|jrssd: thanks to Al Hollander for the info|pg||
nt|joshs: lets see if they play garbage stayman (2C then 2H=both majors weak)|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|nt|sybarra: some part score here,  |pg||

mb|2H|an| |mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @d or 2 @S preference? |pg||
nt|joshs: wow, I think passing 2H is a clear error|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jrssd: I just can't see many pairs missing these games|pg||
nt|joshs: south should correct to 2S with longer spades|pg||
nt|joshs: it is at worst also a 7 card trump fit (if partner has 4S and 5H) but might be better|pg||
pc|dA|nt|beauch:  btw 2@D showed 4 @H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: oh|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|pelu: why not 2@S = F1 with @hs and 4@H = opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many play conventions that would allow East to bid more|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  I'm not disagreeing with the bidding... I'm trying to guess what N thought when dummy came down.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he thought --- @SA wasn't my best lead|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|alsze:  welcome to the PABF 2010|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: folks may have wrong pards here for fitting hands |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: one more or less will double on the S hand, but it is not without flaws at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  3@s seems to be an invitation here|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: if a 2S or 2N bid forces pd to bid at  3 level, esp hearts, you could be cruising for a round number against nothing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a slight compensation, double somewhat increases the likelihood of scoring spade Q on defense, and the most likely outcome is probably a final contract in spades. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: on the third hand, with this many aces and kings the opps are not likely to bid a spade game, so the number of IMPs likely to hinge on whether or not you score spade queen on ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense is limited|pg||
nt|sybarra: can W handle 3 nt ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be able to  to handle it all |pg||
nt|sybarra: but will E sit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  with both @c AQ onside, 4@s is cold|pg||
pc|d7|nt|alsze:  Philippines shall start with a good board|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: another plus of double is that when opps have a heart fit they sometimes shy away from it due to your vul double|pg||

nt|andyv:  and a good result again for NS|pg||

nt|alsze:  welcome here...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N already close to a 4S bid on his own after the double, but presumably downgraded club and heart holding|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably wrong to downgrade hearts once the suit is supported -- heart lead probable, ESPECIALLY because you have the club king....because that means E wont have an AK or KQ ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: combination in the alternative lead suit and thus is a huge favorite to lead a heart|pg||

nt|alsze:  1NT would be good enough, if Chin got @d J right, as he did just now.... |pg||
nt|joshs: in general, I beleive a balanced hand should always say that he is balanced as soon as possble (especially 4333) that was responder can show shape and the balanced hand can ...|pg||
nt|joshs: evaluate honors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|alsze:  and that's the only way he could do, since @d Ace could not be with 3 cards, otherwise no entry.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joshs: that way|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|alsze:  NS had a safe 3NT here, when @d is 4-4.|pg||
nt|joshs: lucky 3N here, so they will survive even if they do not get to the correct game|pg||
nt|joshs: yes|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|marlowepi: heart partscore is par, many pairs could not get to one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: forcing club gives a good chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  the correct game is 5@c ??|pg||
nt|joshs: yeah 5C is much better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kelvin Yim|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: but E needs to  rebid 1N to make that likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N works when W has 5 hearts, 1S works when W has 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with a doubleton heart, E should bid 1S as less to gain from 1N|pg||
nt|kelvin yim: Hi all|pg||
