pc|c7|pc|d8|pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jrssd: and Robinson being short (2) in Clubs pointed towards overcallng 2@s|pg||

nt|jrssd: Their 2 over 1 is NOT game forcing|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: one more or less will double on the S hand, but it is not without flaws at these colours|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if a 2S or 2N bid forces pd to bid at  3 level, esp hearts, you could be cruising for a round number against nothing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a slight compensation, double somewhat increases the likelihood of scoring spade Q on defense, and the most likely outcome is probably a final contract in spades. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: on the third hand, with this many aces and kings the opps are not likely to bid a spade game, so the number of IMPs likely to hinge on whether or not you score spade queen on ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense is limited|pg||

nt|marlowepi: probably wrong to downgrade hearts once the suit is supported -- heart lead probable, ESPECIALLY because you have the club king....because that means E wont have an AK or KQ ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: as there is not much on this hand 2@SX is interesting on a club lead and low spade switch from west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using all fingers and toes to ensure no relay mixup -- but 2@S took them out of relay mode :)|pg||
