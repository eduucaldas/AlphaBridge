mb|1D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: not really fun to watch and good way to destabilize your partner|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S!|an|4H, unbal|nt|hedyg: 1@h is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|gambit: Very dangerous 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: hi all|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Adam|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|gambit: Hi |pg||
nt|buffytvs: I guess South will convert any heart slam to NT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: when this was played in the closed, commentators said the trailing team will surely try a slam here|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H relay...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c over 1@d would have been a gf relay without majors.........|pg||
nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, S presumably knows his partner's shape, and that he has a minimum opener|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i assume 2NT asked for shape, 3@D = a singleton maybe somewhere|pg||
nt|sundiszno: but they play realtivey sound openings|pg||
nt|vugraphzmj: harangozo explains that N showed 5431|pg||
nt|gambit: I guess buffy was right -shooting to try the hail Mary - no touchdown this time|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he almost has that |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: still I wonder why S chose diamonds over NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmj: and 3@H was ORKC|pg||
nt|hedyg: meaning optional roman keycard|pg||
pc|d8|nt|buffytvs: If N were 4-3-5-1, then the slam is a reasonable shot -- again, it's not really South';s fault|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT = 3 and no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have just started with 2@c|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but not clear diamonds would be better than NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmj: szalay is not happy seeing the hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not surprised :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: neither one of them has the hand he bid|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|h2|nt|hedyg: yes if @ds are 3 3|pg||

nt|ralfwil: NS have 32 P together but as I can see it - no slam|pg||

nt|sundiszno: 2@d 4@h, 4+ @d|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: well they are playing a form of forcing club with relays.  1@D promised 2+ diamonds and less than 17|pg||
nt|lml: points|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in my opinion are these 4441 (with 3 aces) weaker than they are in points|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: and a very good stop in 3nt|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that they dont have any 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|lml: they did very well to stop in game|pg||

nt|rodal f: But as the cards lay it's only down 200 and a gain.|pg||
nt|ady: not so sure this will go down|pg||

nt|ady: yes  3NT should make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "but which system precludes opening 2H"|pg||
mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|lml: they are playing Polish club|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D may well be multi and 2@H hearts and a minor or something else|pg||
nt|udo: and they are playing weaktwos ( or multi),,,|pg||
nt|lml: so they could have opened a weak 2|pg||
mb|d!|nt|udo: so 3 @H just a decision from Gotthard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i doubt they are playing normal weak 2s if that hand opened 3H|pg||
nt|lml: yes except for the alert|pg||
nt|lml: 1@C strong and forcing|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|lml: 1@d likely 5-7 or so|pg||
nt|lml: after the double|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: pass with less|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Only one interesting thing at this board. Will NS try for slam and end at level 5? |pg||
nt|udo: X = majors for EW,ag. strong club|pg||
nt|lml: that can only help N-S|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if it is worth entering the auction with a double vul vs not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|lml: 1NT showed 15-17 so this auction should really show 18-19 maybe 20|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: this is a pickup for Harangozo|pg||

mb|4C!|an|orkc|mb|p|nt|gambit: No lead (trump maybe) is attractive from the E position |pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think he has to lead a spade to beat it -- on a turmp lead, when W wins the @DA, he cannot play anotehr trump|pg||

nt|marlowepi: worth thetry|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: main probem for me waqs, that South 20count with ADJxx in @D s is more a 21-22 than a 18-20|pg||
nt|lml: that board might give east-west more confidence|pg||
nt|udo: was|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ady: east might bounce with 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|udo: NS can make 3 @s|pg||
nt|lml: once south was conservative and it was right and once it was wrong|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|an|GF|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i mean, to rebid 2N if available|pg||

nt|lml: that is the type of hand that I used to fcause fights with my husband|pg||
nt|lml: both could have got there so we could blame each other|pg||
nt|udo: when thats all....:)|pg||
nt|lml: 2@C shows 6 and limited hand|pg||
mb|3S!|an|void heart|nt|nigel_k:  3@d should be one down with 2@h a likely make for E/W|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe down two if East can discard a club and get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4-1 slit in @H is 28.3% if 3-2 in @H EW are in for 9 tricks. Push now it seems.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks in spades the limit for n/s|pg||
nt|udo: this should be an easy down 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|lml: this time they could get too high|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|ady: this is down for 100  so little swing|pg||
nt|udo: 5@C still ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the comment was made earlier that S was conservative twice, once right & once wrong. but that means 1-and-1 as the cards lay. we should also comment on general startegies--there is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a big difference between the two cases....the first case involved being conservative about slam, which is fine. but being conservative about game is generally not the winning ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: approach at IMPs|pg||
nt|lml: yes but 6 is going to need a lot of help from the defense|pg||
nt|lml: no spade lead and no trump lead|pg||
nt|udo: 6@C makes only with lead ace of @H ´s?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lml: might make on cross ruff if no spade lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also with a @d lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: By 9-8@D at W it's only -1 I belive. Small @S now and @D110 etc.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1D 10 etc.*|pg||
nt|udo: yes,no @S lead|pg||
nt|udo: means=|pg||
nt|lml: well west would know what to lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: maybe. if he didnt double 2S, maybe he doesnt think he wants a spade lead|pg||
nt|lml: north south did well to put east on lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: didnt have much choice did they?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it´s easy. Discard a @s on @d and crossruff|pg||
nt|lml: east has one too many diamonds too|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|udo: would somebody reopen with North ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thgeir only slam hope is in clubs and the opening bid was 2C. in other systems it would be 1C, so always E will be on lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|udo: or X with South ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i fault W for not doubling 2S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: but also with a trumph lead N will make with that stiff @c9 on W together with @dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: chance that double-digit IMPs will hinge on a spade lead greatly exceeds the chance that 2SX or XX will become the final contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: they didnt get to the slam in the other room after a relay auction|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|rodal f: A balance from E?|pg||
nt|udo: 1NT ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: must be 100 percent  forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shooting like in the Wild West:)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  E/W have seven tricks but cannot take them all|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Due to the heart position|pg||
nt|lml: pass is possible opposite a limited partner|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lml: I would probably do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: we all make a lot of bids we dont really like....almost as many as our partners don;t like:)|pg||
nt|lml: just at that vul|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rodal f: Look at the @H EW. 4@S +1 if N or S lead @C. Then slam is possible.|pg||
nt|udo: still unusual with some many HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|udo: agree: pass is second choice|pg||
nt|lml: game is very unlikely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but that just gives opps a free run AND tells thgem they probably have a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3nt is the only game here|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes its okay to let them bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at least 3C can do something for your side|pg||
nt|lml: when you are at unfavorable|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|udo: so many|pg||
nt|ady: likely 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not if EW play strong club as they do:) 1NT=force.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: ok so i collect my 50, i havenot gained very much. meanwhile the preempt might porevent them from getting to game, or get them into the wrong game. the chance that you are going to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pay out a bnig penalty after it goes 1D-PASS is tiny compared to what you stand to gain|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|lml: its not that you collect 50 its that you get a plus score|pg||
nt|lml: and bidding 3@C doesnt may or may not get them to the wrong spot|pg||
nt|lml: I just think you have to careful V vs NV|pg||
nt|lml: and save the gymnastics for any other v|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is no reason why partner cant put down a dummy which makes 3C cold. once in a while when he opens 1D he doesnt have a stiff club|pg||

nt|buffytvs: playing a spade -- if the aces are reversed, he just went down|pg||
nt|buffytvs: of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he didnt want to touch @c and risk a ruff? and @c is his only entry to hand to discard a @d|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hard to find best spot here. Slam in @C and NT|pg||
nt|lml: so far the swings are almost equal each way |pg||
nt|udo: and again North hand is more 21 with the nice 5carder|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D would be a reasonable gamble on W cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neither hand has bid naturally yet, and it is worth the risk to jam them in this situation|pg||
nt|udo: still NS are cold for 4 @S|pg||
mb|2N|an|nat|nt|rodal f: Check back or pass?|pg||
nt|udo: very lucky slam,,,:)|pg||
nt|lml: here 1@D doesnt promise anything and I assume the normal system bid is 2NT with or without the interference|pg||
nt|lml: now south should transfer to spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Or 2@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|ady: poor slam   |pg||
nt|udo: 3NT ist the place to play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially because W has ace of diamonds, which greatly increases chance that a D lead will defeat 3N. bidding 3D could force 3N from the N hand when they belong ion spades|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|nigel_k:  If I know partner cannot have a singleton I would bid 2@s otherwise pass|pg||
nt|lml: and north will bid the spade game|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: bidding 2D achieves almost nothing. you might as well just say double|pg||
nt|lml: I think he should just bid 4@S he cant really have slam opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: Better having 6 @S then.|pg||
nt|udo: otherwise, when u make 3 NT , u make also 6:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the diamond bid should put him off any thoughts of notrump|pg||
nt|ralfwil: it must be up to S to bid 4@s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nigel_k:  If this is an invitational sequence they risk getting too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: na, in 3 NT dont need the @C s coming in|pg||
nt|lml: North should bit 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as now via 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why cant he have a slam? |pg||
nt|udo: south can have zero points,,,,so 3@S enough|pg||
nt|lml: yes south could have 0 your right he shouldnt bid 4|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: If W had 1-4-5-3. What to bid at 1@S?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4@s is not a terrible contract but it is anti-percentage and the bad spade break dooms it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Axxxxx  and club queen gives adequate play|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Some people would bid 2@d or 2@c with 1453|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: a cue from N had solved that question, so S cannot be interested|pg||

nt|ralfwil: @hA and clean trumps and exit in any major|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Shold 1@C been alerted as 16+ then:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Belive 3 last bid from E is relats.|pg||
nt|udo: East shoudl win the trick then, and exit with @C queen,,so declarer hat still a guess|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: of course he gives up on the tiny chance of QJ of clubs doubleton|pg||
nt|lml: which would let him make it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E hadn´t started with @dA, W had an exit card|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,good point|pg||
nt|lml: or even a stiff q or j with West|pg||
nt|lml: that isnt all that unlikely|pg||
nt|lml: so play for making or play for 2 down instead of 3 down|pg||
nt|lml: your choice|pg||
nt|lml: what would you do!|pg||
nt|udo: interesting decision,,|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but play always with the odds. splitted @c Q and J|pg||
nt|udo: u know that opps are cold for 420|pg||
nt|lml: yes but -500 or -300 isnt bad|pg||
nt|udo: so 300 is a fine result|pg||
nt|lml: and you could have +550|pg||
nt|lml: it could 5 imps if you are wrong I think if I read the table right|pg||
nt|udo: u know west doubled with stiff @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you cannot discard all major losers on @c|pg||
nt|udo: East,sorry|pg||
nt|lml: yes that makes it a bit more likely west has a stiff club|pg||
nt|lml: its more than 12 imps to go for it|pg||
nt|lml: so the odds have to be no better than about 1 in 3|pg||
nt|udo: and West doubled 5 @D,,, when he would have stiff @C, he has 5-5 majors,,,would he really double than ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: relays* but was wrong:)|pg||
nt|udo: so ,,,its a favourite @C s are 3-2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lml: but being up this much in the match is a factor|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: best available game  requires 3-3 spade split |pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  Maybe Polish club? Since West opened 1@h with 17 HCP earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzmk: yup, polish club|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have 2@D on so can be the first IMP for EW.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: but N can have a count on E @dA, 5@h after the lead and with 55 in majors 4@d so....|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: he took the safe path and he was right at least this time|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||

nt|lml: I am not so sure it is with the imp odds.  I am going to actually calculate it later and write it in a blog|pg||
nt|lml: you have to factor in the number of imps you win or lose and whether you actually save a trick or not|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes you dont|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nigel_k:  Defence can take the first six tricks against 2@d I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: when u think about that clubs are most of the time 3-2,its with the odds, because only QJ doubleton helps|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess it is not the right imp play|pg||
nt|lml: no sitff q or stiff j|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|2S|nt|lml: yes I think it is moer likely with west who was in a pressure situation 5-5- in majors or no|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: easy spade game for e/w   as they lie 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but on the defence and the biddibg tiy can see that E has  4@s and 5@h why! with 5-5 E had bid 4@d over 3@d, and with 4@c W should have a 6-card @h and doubled:)|pg||

nt|sundiszno: good solution|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17hcp|nt|buffytvs: notice on a heart lead they can actually beat 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: A count signal must be most critical, or perhaps leading patner's suit trick one |pg||
mb|2C|an|stayman|nt|buffytvs: I think he envisaged his partner with maybe a singelton diamond -- win the @CA and give him a ruff maybe|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: if 1Nt was strong, I wonder why West didn't simply bid 3NT first time|pg||

nt|buffytvs: maybe that's a bit pushy...|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: they duck a @c and then no sure entry to dummy|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|buffytvs: so do we all play this double as 'they're going down' or can it mean 'don't lead a heart'?|pg||

nt|lml: this north south pair has been conservative throughout ... likely influenced by the score|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: and now last @D |pg||
nt|lml: but it is early to play defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1D!|an|C+H or D+S|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Not to many boards with a litle bit dynamit. Hope some will come.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Probably 2@c is Drury|pg||
mb|2D!|an|at least 3 Sp and 18+ p|nt|nigel_k:  Promising a fit so East can just bid 4@h directly|pg||
nt|vugraphzmk: W: I can solve everything myself|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: 2@C drurey I belive.|pg||
mb|p!|nt|lml: 1@S was positive but here apparently only showed 4 spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: re all|pg||
nt|lml: some (me!) would bid 1NT on west's hand|pg||
nt|lml: rather than 1@S which shows 5|pg||
nt|lml: but the disadantage is that you get notrump form the wrong side|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no squeeze is needed! He knows that with @cA on S he could rise and play another @h. therefore it´s easy to play another @c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Will EW stop at partscore by the comming relays? 4@H is on.|pg||
mb|d|an|penaulty|nt|lml: so I actually play 2@D to show the balanced hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry board 42:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: intervention by S atthese colors, particularly via a call that takes up no room, has to show a somewhat serious hand. moreover it is a priori more likely to be diamonds and spades, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because otherwise it would be unlikely NS would buy the hand, and then the 2-suited bid would give away a lot of information|pg||
nt|lml: hi Marshal|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is true that he should have played another club but he missed that so he needed the strip squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: another poor fit e/w   but 4@H makes   may end in 3NT also should make|pg||
nt|ady: cant see them stopping short of game |pg||
nt|udo: i guess relaisbidding is always gameforce|pg||
nt|udo: missunderstanding ?|pg||
nt|udo: north bidded 2 @h as Pass / correct, i assume|pg||
nt|lml: I guessed when south doubled diamonds north thought he was showing C+H|pg||
nt|lml: this could end badly for somebody|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N has another call|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: N knew it was diamonds all along|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with you he was toying with the opposition|pg||
mb|p!|nt|lml: well east can afford to bid 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|lml: I dont like pass|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt want to penalize them I dont think|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 3@H looks normal with his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can only go down playing ace and queen of hearts after this lead|pg||

nt|buffytvs: so overall, which is the better contract?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2D|nt|buffytvs: depends on your attitude to neg dbls -- I like to play them as offering two places to play at low levels, so I wouldn't have 4 diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: 2@c= 10-15, 6+ @cs or 5+@c +4M|pg||
mb|3C!|an|!D raise or GF|nt|hedyg: so you would pass with 9 hcps and 4 @ss no 4@cs?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 5@d makes here, and they're heading there|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: depends on the hand -- I might be able to bid notrump for example|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 9?|pg||
nt|pisoy: da..a zis 2h=1100|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well you have a choice -- you can pass and do something when partner reopens, or you can get into the auction with 8-9 and not be sure of having any place to play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think neg dbls are much abused, and at low levels should be very well defined|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i just mean that you dont always have the perfect hand|pg||
