nt|bebechira: hello Jane|pg||
nt|bebechira: the brothers are doing well|pg||
nt|kfay: I can't attest to their personal abilities, but I've played against Miura-Kido in the Open room and they are very very good.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jaheim: 1 @H from E again?|pg||
nt|jane22: hello - it's not often players have a commentary by their mother|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems easy 4@s for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I always know that u have a good meaning behind ure words. But was unchure by ure comment at @S 7. I was blind fore shure.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lets check any competition available for EW|pg||
nt|kfay: Matchpointers might be tempted to overcall 1@s with the south hand.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: some would open 1s some 1d, i think was good enough for 1d|pg||
nt|bebechira: feel free to give us an insight into their system|pg||

nt|bebechira: weak NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: THEN URE ON URE road go give them now mama:)|pg||
nt|jane22: they discovered most of it on the net from Fantoni - Nunes (Italian Team)|pg||
nt|kfay: No need to worry, partner will come to the rescue.|pg||
nt|kfay: But i doubt that E will sell out to 4@s, Hamdi.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kfay: It's hard to say how much N should bid in this position.|pg||
nt|kfay: They can be almost certain that E/W have a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 1@d or 1@h would be a question in post-mortem|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bebechira: wow.... fantunes is a good syystem'|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see if they stay out og game here|pg||
nt|jane22: All 1-openings forcing, 2-openings 10-13|pg||
nt|kfay: But no spade honors must be a bit disconcerting.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk5: We apologise that the N-S team name is incorrect. The proper name is Chinese Taipei. We can't correct it at this point, but we will get it right for future matches|pg||
nt|kfay: I think it's very popular these days to respond 1@h and bypass a long diamond suit unless you have a game forcing hand, or a hand that's basically only worth one call.  |pg||
mb|5H|nt|rodal f: Any to fight for there parscore at level 4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non will be able to X.|pg||
nt|jaheim: close to 5 @C|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs cl 2-1, and a friendliy @D lay|pg||
nt|kfay: W in there with 5@h may get East too excited.|pg||

nt|jaheim: 3 @D prob. showning @C and @D|pg||

nt|rodal f: By the 4@C it seems as 2@C was game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 2/1 in a strange way:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't even try @DK as lead now|pg||
nt|kfay: Whether or not the double explicitly asks for a @c lead after this auction is a quesiton, I believe that it should not be so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: probably yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Bruce:) Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|jane22: no need to go 2 off; could save a bit here|pg||
nt|kfay: Although I'm sure there are some who would disagree with me.  But generally after preemptive auctions a seemingly out-of-the blue double may be interpreted as 'lightner' requesting ...|pg||
nt|kfay: an unusual lead.  Here, though, I believe partner can reasonably take it as 'please don't sacrifice, partner!!'|pg||
nt|kfay: Best defense will set this 2, but that won't be found I'm quite confident.|pg||
nt|kfay: N is probably debating between a trump lead and a @c.  The opponents are quite likely to be prepared in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say South in with @c A, easy to switch @d? perhaps that's the question|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||

nt|kfay: small number gathered defending in @s.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 5@s off one, 6@h also down..would be a nice theme for team coaches|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|s3|nt|bebechira: he has to guess the clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kfay: Initially W might not suspect this, due to their own shortness in spades, but when S shows support it's likely that E has 2 @s at the most so felt they were also short and the onus ...|pg||

nt|bebechira: to be honest...i do not know|pg||
nt|kfay: with 3 cards in the majors and a vulnerable opening on their right, W must feel that preemption is indicated.|pg||

nt|rodal f: No tempo given so fare.|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@d after a 1@c opener and 2@c after a 1@d opener are both highly effective preempts.|pg||
nt|kfay: Possibly the most destructive calls in the game.|pg||
nt|kfay: Takeout doubles by partner are extremely difficult to interpret.  Everyone plays them as takeout, but do they promise both majors?  Focus on spades?|pg||

mb|p|nt|babs59: I've had people suggest I play it, but I'm more into having consistency of bids - 2NT works fine for me, and also denies the opponents the opportunity to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: much better to allow opener to show his shape with some scheme|pg||
nt|kfay: I agree with the double by Mok.  Probably some would wonder why that might be the decision with a 5-card major.  There are several factors to consider|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kfay: 1) partner is a passed hand and you have minimal values so you just want to find your best fit if you're going to compete|pg||
nt|kfay: 2) your @s suit is much more stacked than your @h suit|pg||
nt|kfay: the biggest downside is if partner bids @c, but you don't rate to compete very much in the lowest suit anyway.  Hopefully the opponents will come to your rescue by outbidding you.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jaheim: @C  the best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: And if not... unless you're doubled it's only 50 a trick.|pg||
nt|kfay: Redouble is an interesting choice by W.  There is so much to talk about on these hands!!!|pg||
nt|kfay: I dislike it.  He has no real interest in defending against any suit by the opponents save @c, which I guarantee they will never bid when looking at that suit.|pg||
nt|kfay: But if their partnership has no other way to show these values unless starting with redouble, I suppose there's nothing to be done.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: club is best lead for defense to make 3nt declarer has to guess the jack of spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: How to go down in 6@S if @S is 1-2 or 2-1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sr. And @H hook was on|pg||
nt|kfay: This looks like a matchpoint auction!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kfay: S was probably considering and expert 2@h over 2@d, offering partner the choice to play in either contract and suggesting 4-5 shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c in vul may hard to find a parking place for 3rd @s to @c lead|pg||
nt|kfay: E was probably considering bidding 2N over 2@s, suggesting that the partership may well belong in @d rather than @c.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: they could play to cut a @s ruff by table|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaheim: 5 loosers now?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: note on these hand if the only issue is hearts you should play ace first, since can only handle one 4-0 break|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: probably 4s, which will need careful play|pg||
nt|rodal f: A hard one to come for NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We got a Roland but not 4 on this time.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2c by south??|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: In 3rd seat the S hand is a mandatory opener in modern bridge, for those who may think it doesn't mesh with Tham-Mok's generally cautious MO|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|rodal f: 2@S can't be revers as we see it. By me it would have been.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: low heart towards dummy is a possibility|pg||
nt|fabsayc: puts a player with qx or kx in north to the test|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, making 9 tricks shouldn't be too difficult, 10 tricks would havebeen very interesting tho|pg||

nt|vugraphzks: Hu reads the system card to fill in time|pg||
nt|kfay: A normal auction.  With the @hKQ and @sH10 onside game can make, but it's less than 10%.  Even 3@h is not very good.|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only an entry to table and 1st round finesse to @c J, i believe that's not my cup of tea|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|kfay: W can now claim after N follows to the 2nd @h, setting up a @c trick.  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|bebechira: Delmonte-Prescott won the open pairs in a cliffhanger|pg||
