mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26.aspx|pg||
nt|hoffers: 3NT is the likely contract. However declarer will worry that she needs two entries to North to lead diamonds|pg||
nt|mwigor: these days you rarely get an uncontested auction - and with 2-2 in the Majors partner will do the wrong thing frequently|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Belive it will end 5@H.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kfay: It's hard to say how much N should bid in this position.|pg||
nt|kfay: They can be almost certain that E/W have a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 1@d or 1@h would be a question in post-mortem|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bebechira: wow.... fantunes is a good syystem'|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see if they stay out og game here|pg||
nt|jane22: All 1-openings forcing, 2-openings 10-13|pg||
nt|kfay: But no spade honors must be a bit disconcerting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: We apologise that the N-S team name is incorrect. The proper name is Chinese Taipei. We can't correct it at this point, but we will get it right for future matches|pg||
nt|kfay: I think it's very popular these days to respond 1@h and bypass a long diamond suit unless you have a game forcing hand, or a hand that's basically only worth one call.  |pg||
nt|hoffers: Can make 6S, but only because clubs are 33|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rodal f: Any to fight for there parscore at level 4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non will be able to X.|pg||
nt|jaheim: close to 5 @C|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs cl 2-1, and a friendliy @D lay|pg||
nt|kfay: W in there with 5@h may get East too excited.|pg||
nt|mwigor: with @c 3-3 and trumps 2-2 can make 12 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: only a low spade lead and a diamond return beats 5clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I was juect checking but I suppose 3D confirms NS are playing a strong lcub system|pg||
nt|jaheim: 3 @D prob. showning @C and @D|pg||
nt|kfay: I bet he'll take the push.|pg||
nt|kfay: S had better double to prevent a sacrifice.|pg||
nt|kfay: Which N would certainly take after this bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: undo|pg||
nt|jane22: we would probably all bid game?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nickf: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|nickf: welcome to Barbara Travis, many times Aust international player|pg||
nt|bg: I just agre3d to play another match sry|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the 4@C it seems as 2@C was game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 2/1 in a strange way:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't even try @DK as lead now|pg||
nt|kfay: Whether or not the double explicitly asks for a @c lead after this auction is a quesiton, I believe that it should not be so.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bebechira: probably yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Hi Bruce:) Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|jane22: no need to go 2 off; could save a bit here|pg||
nt|kfay: Although I'm sure there are some who would disagree with me.  But generally after preemptive auctions a seemingly out-of-the blue double may be interpreted as 'lightner' requesting ...|pg||
nt|kfay: an unusual lead.  Here, though, I believe partner can reasonably take it as 'please don't sacrifice, partner!!'|pg||
nt|kfay: Best defense will set this 2, but that won't be found I'm quite confident.|pg||
nt|kfay: N is probably debating between a trump lead and a @c.  The opponents are quite likely to be prepared in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say South in with @c A, easy to switch @d? perhaps that's the question|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Apartplay at 2@S?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d a tad ambitious overcall|pg||
nt|mwigor: 3@c presumably some sort of @d raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: or at least you can have that understanding|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jane22: do CT play precision?|pg||
nt|kfay: Certainly the choice is between 1@d and 2@d, Hamdi.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to believe it's worked, blocked @s fit of NS|pg||
nt|hoffers: This is a criss-cross raise in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: hi everyone|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indonesia running 4th and New Zealand 8th before this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: if 2spades showed spades and a minor east could guess trumps|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: hi babs|pg||
nt|nickf: hi barb|pg||
nt|bebechira: to be honest...i do not know|pg||
nt|kfay: with 3 cards in the majors and a vulnerable opening on their right, W must feel that preemption is indicated.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: but I can tell you that NS play Fantunes|pg||
nt|jane22: nice lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes'|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|rodal f: No tempo given so fare.|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@d after a 1@c opener and 2@c after a 1@d opener are both highly effective preempts.|pg||
nt|kfay: Possibly the most destructive calls in the game.|pg||
nt|kfay: Takeout doubles by partner are extremely difficult to interpret.  Everyone plays them as takeout, but do they promise both majors?  Focus on spades?|pg||
nt|mwigor: only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|hoffers: Many now play that a jump shift in other suit of same rank shows a good raise, leaving a double raise as preemptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: These are issues that partnerships must address.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: he did  :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: E had for the 1NT but max 2@S. Any for pass at 2@S?|pg||
nt|jane22: reverse att & count|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bebechira: 8 quick tricks now :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be 7|pg||
nt|kfay: It is entirely different than the auction 1@c-(1@d)- where double promises 4-4 in the majors, playing standard methods.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: How to find 8 tr here??? OK Im blind|pg||

nt|davidstern: Possibility of going down if Viv mispicks both majors|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|jane22: 1 off seems obvious|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... that is 3 imps to Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|kfay: At the higher level, you would be overloading the double too much to enforce that requirement.|pg||

nt|davidstern: SO that pick will go ok|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|rodal f: A read color.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kfay: Most play that it generally promises 2 places to play, if you can't tolerate whichever major partner may respond in, then you can fall back on supporting partner's minor.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|babs59: these heart spots work nicely for Bob Richman|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Turn the hand by NS and u get.......|pg||
nt|kfay: Many European players get around the problem faced on the last hand by playing negative free bids, where the a direct 2@s by Tham in the last sequence would have been non-forcing.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bebechira: can be trouble here|pg||

mb|p|nt|bebechira: i see...|pg||
nt|bebechira: S does not have a bid then|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if i can force with reverse i would, otherwise 3nt|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nice music u served. U2:)|pg||
nt|pinkrobin: :):)|pg||
nt|mwigor: doesnt really want to play for penalties with five low trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: I've had people suggest I play it, but I'm more into having consistency of bids - 2NT works fine for me, and also denies the opponents the opportunity to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: much better to allow opener to show his shape with some scheme|pg||
nt|kfay: I agree with the double by Mok.  Probably some would wonder why that might be the decision with a 5-card major.  There are several factors to consider|pg||
nt|mwigor: but doesnt have a 4 card suit and his side is at the 3-level|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kfay: 1) partner is a passed hand and you have minimal values so you just want to find your best fit if you're going to compete|pg||
nt|kfay: 2) your @s suit is much more stacked than your @h suit|pg||
nt|kfay: the biggest downside is if partner bids @c, but you don't rate to compete very much in the lowest suit anyway.  Hopefully the opponents will come to your rescue by outbidding you.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: here pass was possibly the winning action but partner had an unusually good hand defensively|pg||
nt|davidstern: Poor contract as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: @C  the best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: And if not... unless you're doubled it's only 50 a trick.|pg||
nt|kfay: Redouble is an interesting choice by W.  There is so much to talk about on these hands!!!|pg||
nt|kfay: I dislike it.  He has no real interest in defending against any suit by the opponents save @c, which I guarantee they will never bid when looking at that suit.|pg||
nt|kfay: But if their partnership has no other way to show these values unless starting with redouble, I suppose there's nothing to be done.|pg||
nt|davidstern: Likely to lose 1-1-0-2 with handling charges|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|robinswr: club is best lead for defense to make 3nt declarer has to guess the jack of spades |pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr. And @H hook was on|pg||
nt|kfay: This looks like a matchpoint auction!|pg||
nt|mwigor: i like the way smolanko has bid his hand - 3@h cant really be more than a 4 card suit having bid 3@c the previous round|pg||
nt|hoffers: This will go off before Smolanko gets in|pg||
nt|mwigor: although maybe 2NT was scramble not lebensohl|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kfay: S was probably considering and expert 2@h over 2@d, offering partner the choice to play in either contract and suggesting 4-5 shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c in vul may hard to find a parking place for 3rd @s to @c lead|pg||
nt|kfay: E was probably considering bidding 2N over 2@s, suggesting that the partership may well belong in @d rather than @c.  |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|nickf: Indonesia made 3NT on the hand Australia played 5@D|pg||
nt|davidstern: This went -200 against 4@H making - usually the case when cards lie badly for you they lie well for the opps|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kfay: I suppose not now after the NT, if it's strong.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: transfer response showing hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: All exsept E feel bad honors here:)|pg||
nt|hoffers: On the hand where Bourke missed 3NT, they have picked up 7 imps when NS sold out to 2H making by West|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: acceptance is three card support|pg||
nt|h_karluk: balancing seat|pg||

nt|pinkrobin: interesting 1@c open?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mwigor: south is so much better placed if they overcall 1@d instead of X|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Still hard to stop at level one as long as one of them open.|pg||
nt|bebechira: the VG coordinator changed the contry name into the correct one and now we will have the results input manually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe the problem : lefty minimum 15, you hold 15, so where's the rest 10 :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: can double on the next round regardless of what happens|pg||
nt|mwigor: (on 21)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bebechira: 2 boards to play here.... open room finished|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kfay: The bidding here suggest to me that the double was, in fact, penalty.  Since if Tham were showing some spot to play and 2@c inquired, N would now bid something.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: played in 1st WORLD MIND SPORTS GAMES Beijing 2008 - Youngsters Teams|pg||
nt|kfay: 2NT was the lebensohl convention, showing a weak hand and requesting partner to bid 3@c|pg||
nt|kfay: Mok said 'I don't care if you're weak, I've got you covered'|pg||
nt|hoffers: In these sequences, 4D should be a retransfer, but NS have no agreement|pg||
nt|mwigor: by agreement you can play that 4@d here is a retransfer|pg||

mb|p|nt|hoffers: Needed a heart lead to threaten contract. Now Havas will play on cross ruff lines|pg||

nt|h_karluk: GOTODA Shunsuke new in the field|pg||
nt|kfay: a play by an opponent that gives you the contract... but then you give it right back because you would never believe them capable of it|pg||

nt|vugraphzks: reluctant passes by both Skippers|pg||
nt|davidstern: So a little light here provided West switches to club on winning diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now richman is having fantasies|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h was not even forcing, so as far as i am concern the rest is impossible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: he needs two aces and heart king for slam, i can not imagine klinger would pass that|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: undo operator|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you missed a pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: By open card slam are on. But I hope not will be bidded.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thus, the opponent likely ends up blaming himself for not taking advantage of the opportunity presented, even though to do so would have been irrational|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The benefit of the Grosvenor gambit is supposed to come on future hands, due to a loss of concentration by the player who was taken in by the gambit.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Many variants to talk abough by what I said. S still + at the lenght. Next board. |pg||
nt|mwigor: declarer needs to sneak a @s trick on the hand - not unreasonable to take the @h finesse|pg||
mc|7|nt|h_karluk: The gambit was named after Philip Grosvenor, a fictional character in a short story by Frederick B. Turner published in The Bridge World[1], who first discovered the gambit ...|pg||
