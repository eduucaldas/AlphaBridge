mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|caitlin: 4N is typically a quantative bid over 3N; however here it looks like 4N is control asking|pg||

pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: well, if N is allowed to jump to 3N on any old hand, before S had had the opportunity to unveil his intentions, it is better for 4N to be control asking. but of course the real ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: answer is to go slower, allowing S to bid out, after which raising 3N to 4N can indeed be quantitative as ideally one would wish|pg||
