nt|patricck: Both pairs are playing a fairly natural Acol based system|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|patricck: Lachman and Snashall are 4 card majors while Cartner and Palmer are 5 card @S and 4 card @H (I think)|pg||

nt|dburn: West might chance getting into the auction here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, I wonder if East can double 3@S or whether that would be responsive|pg||

nt|patricck: Cartner/Palmer in fact play (11)12-14, so East could even have opened 1NT but decided not to|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|dburn: in that case, maybe East should have bid game, since partner won't play her for this much|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

nt|patricck: If north has @HQ9xx you can pick it up, but not if South has the same holding|pg||
nt|dburn: well, she needs to ruff a club with one of East's trumps, which means that she might play South for the queen just for convenience|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, that's true|pg||

nt|patricck: occasion though I have hopes that New Zealand might have the edge this year|pg||
nt|dburn: could be a swing to NZ if South opens a strong no trump at the other table - they will bid 1NT-3NT and never know they had a problem|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: of course, in the old days of Acol they bid 1@s-2@d-2NT-3NT and never knew they had a problem then either|pg||
nt|patricck: Aah, Shirley Newton and Jenny Wilkinson in the other room, they play Moscito, a strong club system with submarine openers|pg||
pc|h8|nt|patricck: Their 1@C is in fact 15+, so their bidding could well reach game, North will probably be unable to restrain herself|pg||
