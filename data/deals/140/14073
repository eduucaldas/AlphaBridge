nt|alsze:  EW got a good stop at 3@h in the other table for this hand.|pg||
nt|alsze:  so, if EW here got overboard, they will lose IMPs.|pg||

nt|janm: E to overcall 1@s, after which your guess is as good as mine :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: as good an opening bid as any with N hand |pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: good evening all from New Zealand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Sitting S is my good friend and occasional partner and teammate Tadashi Teramoto. I hope to meet the other three players someday|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and we often have saying 4 @H's transfer to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|sybarra: all white  no reason to be hero here  |pg||

nt|marlowepi: not sure if double is diamonds, starting to look like it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone, hi Marshall|pg||
nt|janm: N-S must play that the negative DBL doesn't promise 4 hearts - nice on this hand for sure, but can cause problems on hands that do have hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 2@h was alerted because it was non-forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|joshs: the 3H bid might also do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|joshs: good dtop|pg||

nt|janm: Tough decision for N here - he really doesn't like any bid, but 3@d is the least of evils|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: correct or correct?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|joshs: in some ways he has a better hand, a 4'th trumps and loves the spade K|pg||

mb|2H|an| |nt|joshs: yeah, but 4D is deifinitely not my style witho nly a 7 bagger and 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|janm: 1NT weak, but I don't know if it's 10-12 or 12-14. |pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: likely to land in 4 @S here   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: How is Ithaca?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 2@h is presumably a transfer, and done here with only 4 spades because he doesn't want to pass 1NT with such a weak hand. Several pairs who play weak NTs take the position that ...|pg||
nt|janm: they don't ever pass without at least some values, and have to find a bid on a hand like West's|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and 1 @H is   either spades or value bid to "big club" |pg||
nt|henryb:  Warm, sunny, joyful because the Cornell LAX team reached the final four|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with a solid spade holding and favorable vulnerability, the slow approach of 1H is preferred to the buccaneer shot of 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bravo|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|alsze:  i found that, not everyone had the same definition on NAMYATS.....|pg||
nt|janm: Probably the DBL of 2@h showed values, rather than just hearts. Also a common agreement vs. weak NT's - DBL of a conventional response just shows a hand that would have DBL'd 1NT ...|pg||
nt|janm: if they'd been in direct seat over it |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joshs: for those who dont know, in namyats, 4 of a minor should a good 4 of a major pre-empt|pg||
nt|alsze:  the better way to handle is, Do not play NAMYATS|pg||
nt|alsze:  :)|pg||
nt|joshs: 4 of a minor shows a good 4 of a major |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Xu chooses +450 over a probable +460 |pg||
nt|janm: 2@s is a cue bid of the suit shown by West, asking for a stopper|pg||
nt|janm: This probably isn't going to be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  EW will lose a IMP if JChua put up @D K.|pg||
nt|henryb:  In my youth we bid 1@h-1@s-4@h with East's hand, which promised a spade fit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: but made so good enough|pg||
nt|janm: But it was difficult for NS to investigate everything and they had the values for 3NT, it's just unlucky that the opponents can cash 5 diamonds and the spade finesse is also off, ...|pg||
nt|janm: so 3NT is likely to be down 2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: have to slow selves down,  as 6 @S is not making |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: and not good to use blackwood with void |pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html  for standings after round 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what else did you do in your youth?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S showing restraint not saying X,,  better not to give the hand away |pg||
nt|henryb:  went to school, mucked around a lot|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: a rebel|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  dropped out from time to time|pg||
nt|janm: Looking at the NS hands, you wouldn't be unhappy to be in 3NT (although with the opening bid in E, you wouldn't be happy either)|pg||
nt|janm: If  EW are playing strong NT in the other room, E will presumably start with 1@d and NS won't want to play 3NT, but it's hard to predict what they will play|pg||

nt|sybarra: most of us would say,  "made too many |pg||

nt|janm: doesn't make his shape clear to partner). Still opening Jxxx with a side AKxxx seems a little off to me|pg||

nt|joshs: excellent result for NS in the other room|pg||
nt|janm: Now it definitely looks like -4. Not clear whether declarer could have taken another trick if he'd unblocked the @dK so he could win the third diamond in hand to play a club|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes and we knew he would overtake k of @H |pg||

mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|sybarra: pitch a club  etc |pg||
nt|fabsayc: that would have worked, but really if you cant bid over 2d you should not bid later|pg||
nt|janm: On board 1 where we saw what looked like a fairly normal result, NS in the Open Room has bid and made 3NT for a 10 IMP pickup. Not sure how they took 9 tricks :)|pg||

nt|janm: I don't know. I'm sure I would if I had the spades so we might be able to compete successfully, but with hearts & clubs it might be better to go quietly|pg||
nt|cascade: it looks a long way up on what might be a misfit hand vulnerable opposite a passing partner|pg||

pc|d3|nt|sybarra: as usual they always write in tiny script |pg||
pc|dK|nt|joshs: the moment of truth, must switch to a low spade to get the maximum number of tricks|pg||

nt|sybarra: S has to read the 7 of @C accurately |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: winning the diamond is necessary if spades are 32 and a duck would expose declarer to a third round club ruff, or second round ruff when spade king is on|pg||
nt|alsze:  nicely done|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kelvin yim: well done|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: ducking can gain when W has club ace and Kxxx of spades, and 3 diamonds, as here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cascade: 3NT was optimistic|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will have to toss his ace of spades|pg||
nt|janm: West is going to have to visualize the actual hand though and pitch 2 clubs to hold 3 hearts (or is that one fewer pitches than he has to make?)|pg||
nt|janm: Well done|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: suprised he didnt lead @H to take a ruff or 2 in hand |pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jrssd: there is a theory that if you would have overcalled at the one level, you should overcall at the 2 level|pg||

nt|cascade: the ten at least gives the illusion that west had QJ|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jrssd: and Robinson being short (2) in Clubs pointed towards overcallng 2@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: debatable, bad suit, no shape, mediocre values|pg||
nt|jrssd: Miller-Stout play a very simple form of Precision|pg||
nt|jrssd: Their 2 over 1 is NOT game forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that theory has its clear limitations. for example, most of us would risk a 4-card overcall at the one level routinely on certain holdings in certain situations, but never at the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: two level|pg||
nt|kelvin yim: after the @SK, open room E shifted the @DQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joshs: for the specs, souths club holding was known by inference of the play at trick 1, thus west was marked with 2 of the HA, HK, DK and SA|pg||

nt|joshs: probably without the DK, south would not have won in dummy|pg||
nt|joshs: so that puts the DK in the south hand|pg||
nt|alsze:  truth|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: It's not my style, but it works for them|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: then a club pitch but what to pitch on second diamond|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: now have to stay out of slam |pg||
nt|cascade: or just set up the clubs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ni hao: salut@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then declarer had 9 tricks|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, exit with a low heart, now declarer can't do anything can he? When he plays the second diamond, E is winning it, so W can pitch a heart and then E can lead a club through|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: only makes 5 @H missing 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|joshs: this attacks the entry to the clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent to avoid spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s is a decent contract that will probably go down. The spade layout is one that declarer should musguess|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: 2 @C is 4th suit forcing  |pg||
nt|joshs: lets see if declarer preserves the entry or takes the hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  mis*|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely game force|pg||
nt|sybarra: (at least that is way I play it) |pg||
nt|henryb:  3N needs the same guess|pg||
nt|cascade: double dummy 12 tricks but i was wondering if they would get to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|joshs: is that really what happened?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hamdi |pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty, imo with 23 hcp interesting 3N decision|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h is a pretty big bid, but he liked his shape, with the opponents bidding diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: 7 winners in bag, i dont rest 2 would be easy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jrssd: this is a hand that 2/1 bidders would likely reach 2N after 1@s - 1N - 2@s - 2N|pg||
nt|jrssd: 1@s - 1N - 2@C - 2N I mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, W had some choice cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but all will depend on E diamond holding|pg||
nt|jrssd: Miller is reluctant to play a trump - likely to pick up partner's honor(s)|pg||
nt|janm: It takes the double spade finesse to take 12 tricks, but he'll certainly make 11 with the hearts 2-2 and the spade K onside|pg||
pc|cA|nt|beauch:  hi shirley |pg||
nt|marlowepi: saw the EXACT same situation here yesterday|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slightly different layout|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 'but 3N superior because this very spade configuration would lead a good declarer to go wrong and thus fail in 4S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: * i dont think rest etc|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome David |pg||
nt|joshs: more beleivable :)|pg||
nt|janm: Now that I said that he'll surely find a way to take 10 tricks (I am so rarely right about the number of tricks)|pg||
nt|cascade: south doubled 1@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|beauch:  south is checking on kcs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will land in 5 |pg||
nt|beauch:  will be disappointed|pg||
nt|alsze:  this made much more sense|pg||
nt|cascade: so the spade jack is a reasonably normal play|pg||
nt|janm: Oh, good point - he should certainly have 3 spades, so declarer should take the double spade hook|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c5|nt|beauch:  1430|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cross ruffing looks safer than any spade play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: and it can NOT be 4 |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|beauch:  could be - but pd would move :)|pg||
nt|jrssd: but he decided his alternatives were worse|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm not sure he can make 3N from here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jrssd: (I know WE all would have shifted to the @H10 :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  with best defense|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|sybarra: no can not be 4 |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: not me, i would have had ten of hearts hidden behind another card, it is systemic|pg||
nt|janm: He might take the heart finesse here - unnecessary on this hand, but likely to win after the DBL of 1@h|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: only 3 aces missing,  and S holds ace and k of hts|pg||
nt|beauch:  great match with one of indonesias top pairs- world class and australias premier pair in last 5 years or so|pg||
nt|henryb:  actually, with any sensible defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder if declarer should have ducked first spade all around |pg||
nt|sybarra: or if that matters |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|joshs: on a heart return S with sqz the north hand|pg||
nt|joshs: on these clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: expect monosyllabic defense from EW|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sybarra: this 2//1 ish to me |pg||

nt|jrssd: and 3@D longer Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or  1nt |pg||
nt|cascade: anyone know the NT range?|pg||
nt|janm: If 1NT was 12-14, shouldl East accept here? He has pretty close to a maximum, with the 2 tens and the 5 card suit, and the AQ of hearts opposite partner's presumed length|pg||
nt|janm: I only know that he opened 1NT on 12 earlier :)|pg||
nt|janm: So I'm guessing 12-14, but of course it could be a bit stronger vul|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joshs: north has the sort of hand that 3N might be more liekly than 4S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: but being vul vs not was just too much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cautious bidding had been the rule in the antipodes for a long time. close study of Bidding Forum, before and after Keith McNeil's benevlent despotism, makes this fairly clear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so on this hand, i would have to say i would. just to be annoying. but i also doubt the a priori upsiude|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i thought same, however i still believe West would rise |pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: hart not to lead club|pg||
nt|beauch:  south will apply the brakes here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I heard the screeching sound |pg||
nt|henryb:  will N take his -100 save?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H not alerted|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|joshs: at least they got to the best game, but with hearts 5-3 this should go down|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most probably he never knows light 1@c at 1st seat and viul vs nonvul, so auto will realize cover cards at his p|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but now they picked a moysian fit at 2 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: not worse contract in the world |pg||
nt|cascade: 13-15 it says on their card|pg||
nt|janm: So they're in 3NT, now can he take 9 tricks?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|beauch:  yes kd didnt look a great asset opposite pds shortage|pg||
nt|beauch:  aq@C looked ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but if natural, why would E bid 5D rather than 5H?|pg||
nt|po-s: perfect system hand...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true, wont shatter the world|pg||
pc|c9|nt|alchilds: should make now|pg||
nt|henryb:  this auction is a mystery|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|henryb:  and North now has to let them play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: complicated hand because of heart blockage|pg||
nt|janm: I'm not so sure I'd accept with the East hand if I'd shown 13-15. Would you?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i always accept with that spade suit|pg||
nt|cascade: I'm not so sure I'd invite with the West hand if partner had shown 12-14. Would you?|pg||
nt|janm: He can power out the spades for 3 spades, 3 hearts, 1 diamond and 2 clubs I think|pg||
nt|janm: True, so that suggests it's 12-14 NV and 13-15 Vul|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should have enough tricks, and no way to judge if stoppers sufficient even for 2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jrssd: that's interesing, can you elaborate?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sybarra: wonder if better to play ace of @H  then play to aq of clubs, then to ace of spaded, then k of clubs (that might be resulting it) |pg||
nt|beauch:  might go that line in pairs?|pg||
nt|beauch:  this looks safe for 10tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes maybe better pair's play |pg||
nt|beauch:  west wants to play simultaneously a heart and a trump|pg||
nt|beauch:  guess trump?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: Bidding Forum is the Australian version of Bridge World's master Solver's Club. Strong tendency of expert bidding in that community towards "soundness" as opposed to adventure. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: same true today in AB's online Bidding Forum|pg||
pc|sA|nt|po-s: what inspired East to double 6 spades?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: have to "pick" this right however |pg||

nt|fabsayc: no jan down one off the top|pg||
nt|janm: -2 if they just play club and a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh ok you meant for the down two|pg||

pc|d7|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||

nt|marlowepi: trump stack and lack of first round controls i guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose that partner passed 5@d and did not bid 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say I am surprised E did not bid 1 nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact it was up to north|pg||
nt|janm: I don't like the spade 2 return - surely if he wanted to lead spades, he should lead the 5? (unless they don't play that lower is more encouraging|pg||
nt|janm: Defense is still okay for -1 thanks to declarer's diamond play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: count me in please|pg||

nt|jrssd: will 4@H make? any bets?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought they played a club system, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a man who calls a spade 2S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some of the dealing machines do not produce random hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: double seems a bit odd holding 5 hearts to 100 honors|pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: cant darling, i am commentating|pg||
nt|po-s: I rather believe our speculations are due to a well rooted lack of knowledge about the systes|pg||
nt|cascade: last year in this event my partner had two nine card suits and an 8-4 in the one match|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jrssd: this is the wildest N-S get, playing Muiderberg|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry. gues whatm, private:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont blame the computer, is all on the programmer|pg||
nt|janm: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|joshs: 7 tricks for the defense here|pg||
nt|joshs: lets see if they will take them|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: David,  you prefer the preference to 2 @S or passing 2 @H?|pg||
nt|beauch:  interesting decision for east whether to pass 2@H or give preference to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: this is the link to the system card page http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards.aspx|pg||
nt|beauch:  i would bid 2@S as not as terminal and like playing in my 5/2 fits|pg||
nt|joshs: nope!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N also available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but maybe N pulls the stick|pg||
nt|janm: This should make 4, losing a trick in each minor and the trump A|pg||
nt|janm: And play will probably be pretty fast|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i only predict that if i am playing|pg||
nt|janm: I did realize after I said it that I shouldn't have - it will jinx everyone and the play will go on forever :)|pg||
nt|janm: Although maybe if East thinks for too long, N will decide to claim to get on to the next board|pg||
nt|janm: I'm sorry!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jrssd: with Miller holding 9+ cards in @s and @D, declarer MAY get the trumps right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|alchilds: must be tranfsers no alerts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes. i took a semester of eastern bidding philosophy, but didnt get this far|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good decision|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok here we go |pg||
pc|cA|nt|beauch:  this 4/3 one loks sound :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W will lead what|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: many pairs use doubel as a kind of all-purpose GF facing an openming bid, along with NF free bids. much rarer to see such an agreement facing an overcall|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: I would also, passing 2 @H is sort of unilateral |pg||
nt|marlowepi: for those not familiar with Muiderberg, it is an opening bid of 2 of a major that sends the following message:  "I desperately want to drive my opponents to a game they might well ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not bid otherwise, and also want to tell them so much about my hand that they are likely to make it when they would otherwise rate to go down"|pg||
nt|jrssd: hmmm, that's not the definition in the Bridge Encyclopedia... :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still not sure abt 2@s, bcos of stiff @cK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: it will be changed soon when the downstate empoirical returns are tabulated|pg||
nt|jrssd: DeLivera is now kicking himself for not having the courage of his convictions...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: it is my favorite convention in the whole world....for my opponents to play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: as i thought|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very logical club shift|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @sK entry will try to leave a @c to Q|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, just in case declarer had 2 clubs|pg||
nt|janm: Now hopefully he is claiming|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: pingpong in the bidding. even allowing for system factors, it would seem E put a lot on the line with the 4H bid. the upside potential seemns a much narrower target than the ways ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to lose, and lose big. but leads a charmed life|pg||
pg||
qx|c8|st||md|2SAK93HT87DQ5CKT52,S64HK6DAKJT84CJ97,SJT75HAQJ53D93C63,SQ82H942D762CAQ84|sv|o|nt|marlowepi: that was a good result for the method--it broke even as compared with normal 1s bid|pg||
nt|joshs: huge misfit here for e-w|pg||
nt|sybarra: an unfortuanate hand |pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but now good 3N for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes this one should work |pg||
nt|h_karluk: also 4@s fine|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cascade: not my idea of 1NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: great 1NT|pg||
nt|janm: China picked up those 3 IMPs for collecting 200 instead of 100 against 3NT on board 6 - declarer there must also have gone after diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: intersting that 3 nt makes here, |pg||
nt|joshs: will north pass?|pg||
nt|alsze:  likely|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jrssd: I don't know how 4@H made|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: but how to know?|pg||
nt|jrssd: it seemed to have no chance after the trump misguess|pg||
nt|alsze:  oooops|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh it may not,  sorry didnt see Sacul's @D holding |pg||
nt|marlowepi: what is the NT range for EW do we know?|pg||
nt|cascade: but it kept NS out of their majors|pg||
nt|janm: I'm with you, Wayne - maybe opposite a passed partner, but you can miss too much if you don't open a good 6 card suit |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so good on this lead however :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|jrssd: did declarer lead a low @s toward dummy, and South ducked?|pg||
nt|jrssd: anyone like 3@d instead of 3@s?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this auction would be simpler if E responded 2C, especially if they had the agreement that a 2H rebid would show 6, at least over a 2C response|pg||
nt|sybarra: landing into good spot,  little to say now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: long raging controversy as to whether a rebid of 2M (the major opened) after a 2/1 should show 6. a very effective compromise is for it to do so ONLY after a 2C response. this in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: turn works very well in conjunction with the agreement that 1M-2R (2 of a new red suit) promises at least 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this increases the workload of 2C, but in a very good cause|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 15-17 this opening is a reasonable tatciucal shot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 12-14, too good and too "chromotropic" (leaning towards a suit)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D better|pg||
pc|h8|nt|janm: The spade 7 should probably be suit preference for hearts, and if S reads it, they'll collect the maximum|pg||
nt|cascade: yes if you have a good six card suit and are in range in high cards you have too much playing strength if partner has a good hadn|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: a small footnote : i think i would begin with 1N as W (bal,17)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is their system |pg||
nt|sybarra: again we do not know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: presumably some variant of big club family|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: some suggesting 4 @H makes |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cascade: and in the wrong denomination if partner has a bad hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|jrssd: 2@C sounds like more of a semi-artificail waiting bid then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H-1S seems economical, but when you have GF values the apparent gain in space is often iullusory|pg||
nt|jrssd: E to S: look again, are you SURE no more Hearts?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, most of the time you would have clubs. but yes it is a device you can use to find out if opener has 6, and so it could occasionally even be on a doubleton (3 card support for ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pd and 44 in the other two suits)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|beauch:  something odd about auction- south has opening hand- perhaps took a pessimistic view with no spade stopper|pg||
nt|cascade: as we are seeing here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|pc|sA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but the plus side is so fun when you make 1nt and opponents have two games|pg||
nt|janm: So he'll be -3 when the smoke clears - S pitches the @s A so that his partner can cash all of their 9 tricks and then lead a club through|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a marginal triumph, easy 140 NS|pg||
mc|4|nt|joshs: cash the spade A|pg||
pg||
qx|o9|st||md|3SA53HA4DA9864CJ75,SKJ7642H86DJC9862,SQT9HJT97532D53CK,S8HKQDKQT72CAQT43|sv|e|nt|barnets: i think so too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then maybe South 3@H -- tough game being commentator|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=3-10 HCP, 5+@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in other room Tobing started with 3@H and Xu bid 4N -- now Jun [West] in 10@C  [5@CX]|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: i prefer 3@H thats why|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: 7 card suits are for 3 bids not 2 bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sakul 3@H probably asks for NT stopper - so really stuck for a bid unless he wants to force to game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10@C going down at least 2 [500] so Sakul has wiggle room in this inelegant 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 500 it is|pg||
nt|barnets: indonesia making a comeback|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|c9|st||md|3SA53HA4DA9864CJ75,SKJ7642H86DJC9862,SQT9HJT97532D53CK,S8HKQDKQT72CAQT43|sv|e|nt|beauch:  3d shows values|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H does not make on best defense |pg||
nt|jrssd: all roads lead to 3N on this hand|pg||
nt|alsze:  yes|pg||
nt|alsze:  South hand shall not be too excited, with a balanced hand and 1 KC only.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joshs: NS got very high at the other table, and was punished for it|pg||
nt|alsze:  yes|pg||
nt|joshs: might be duplicated if N raises to 3H|pg||
nt|janm: With both Major suit finesses & the club finesse working, NS can make game on the last board, but not likely to bid it|pg||
nt|cascade: and some breaks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i gave you benefit of doubt and only claimed 9|pg||
nt|janm: What would you bid over 3@h with the E hand here?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|h_karluk: light overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, some 4nt bid|pg||
nt|cascade: 4@H = minors or 3NT or PASS |pg||
nt|cascade: 4-losers |pg||
nt|cascade: he only needs a fit and a couple of cards|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 4NT is minors? Or is he asking for aces and planning to power out a minor suit slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|beauch:  looks like tony nunn was right again|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me even not close to X values|pg||
nt|h_karluk: risky esp when vul vs nonvul|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jrssd: now that's a very ugly Muiderberg opener |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: tautology|pg||
nt|cascade: and one opponent has already shown a weak hand (at favourable)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: yes still 2@s mmay help to block their communiation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1400 away on a bad day|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: @D lead,  hop ace of @H,  lead S for @D ruff  and cash spade |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be esoteric but...|pg||
nt|jrssd: presumably 3D shows "values"; as Robinson would bid 2N w a weak hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems bold bidder on east seat:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H is interesting |pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. red |pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: I'm quite surprised that they couldn't find their was to 3N |pg||
nt|jrssd: I'm told the bidding was 1N - 3N in the other room|pg||
nt|alsze:  3@d was SPL ?|pg||
nt|joshs: probably a mini splinter|pg||
nt|joshs: usually played as a 3 or 5 level raise|pg||
nt|janm: Chip says he'd just bid 3NT vul, anything else too risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: good system jump shift forcing raise -refuse to que = min|pg||
nt|cascade: well no aces changed his mind lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think S shld X|pg||
nt|cascade: 3NT is not without risk|pg||
nt|janm: Nothing you do is without risk|pg||
pc|s9|nt|beauch:  danny sacul has represented indonesia since 1976 and now plays on senior teams|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe their neg x level is low|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: 2H is a bold bid|pg||
nt|janm: This will eventually be -2 I guess?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: well W had 9,  even I would say X |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jrssd: so I guess Muiderberg has it's day|pg||
nt|alsze:  ooops|pg||
nt|joshs: since you can only splinter in diamonds here, some play it as either short D or short spades, bit it does not look like thats what they do|pg||
nt|alsze:  another tie board|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|henryb:  indeed. This could possibly have been beaten with a trump lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont think 3@h a makeable contract|pg||
nt|cascade: so partner had the fit but not the two necessary cards|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|joshs: getting to 6 at this rate....|pg||
nt|joshs: I am not sure what north could possibly have that makes 6 good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Chin had done enough after 4@C in my opinion. When partner signs off in 4@H after that, he should too|pg||
nt|joshs: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|cascade: bad luck|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jrssd: sorry Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: breaks even, here, probably|pg||
nt|henryb:  encourages partner to lead a @h perhaps?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is likely to anyway, except with ace and then do you want him to?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jrssd: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear what the objective is. overstates the values considerably and doesnt use up much room|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|janm: Probably if E bid 3NT, W would bid 4@s & go down 2 (or 3 if he got the spades wrong or they got 2 club ruffs) but S might not double, since his 3 aces wouldn't be so sure a set of ...|pg||
nt|janm: a 10 trick contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@D is the value bid|pg||
nt|cascade: i had three bullets in the PABF Pairs two days ago and hit 5@c and it made and it wasnt the opponent with the void that bid the game :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont mind risking a wide open suit but not with no fast tricks|pg||
nt|janm: :)|pg||
nt|cascade: some dont have 4@d available as they play (non-)leaping Michaels|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|joshs: south will be very happy with the comparison here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|beauch:  the indonesian team finished 2nnd in world champ seniors in 2005 and 2007|pg||
nt|cascade: 4@c/@d overcalls are not big winners as natural bids|pg||
mc|9|nt|joshs: since its only lose 1...|pg||
nt|janm: But 4@d gets you past the most likely making game (3NT) as well as potentially in the wrong minor suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but if partner bids 4s has been warned, and east has a slow hand and no where near a 4nt bid |pg||
pg||

nt|fabsayc: i am not saying 4d is great, just think the others more flawed|pg||
nt|cascade: that is an advantage of 4@h = both minors - you might be able to play 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: In the other room, N opened only 2@h on the last hand, so it was easy for E to bid 3@d and he played it there (-1) to pick up 9 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: I would THINK EW can bid to 4@H, but who knows?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I'll predict PPP1NT; P3NTPPP here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jrssd: a spec was asking how many teams are in the tourney - 13; all from different countries|pg||
nt|jrssd: thanks to Al Hollander for the info|pg||

nt|jrssd: senior: 10 teams, 6 countries|pg||
nt|joshs: it looks like it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double seems questionable|pg||
nt|henryb:  On board 4, this was the only pair to reach the grand of the four on vugraph|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if pd has his share or a biut more, still game is a stretch with points behind N hand. why not hope for a few hundreds?|pg||
nt|cascade: close|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: *first|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hardly know how to play part scores at this table |pg||
nt|janm: Wrong! Vulnerable, I just wouldn't open the West hand, but here it will get what he thinks is the right lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: samurai or kamikaze (depending on result) Tadashi goes for the kill|pg||
nt|henryb:  this will not help|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has to help someone:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  the defense|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|cascade: and some more action|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @d or 2 @S preference? |pg||
nt|joshs: wow, I think passing 2H is a clear error|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond ten a big card|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: I just can't see many pairs missing these games|pg||
nt|joshs: south should correct to 2S with longer spades|pg||
nt|joshs: it is at worst also a 7 card trump fit (if partner has 4S and 5H) but might be better|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to open 1@s with such a bad hand Vul, after all|pg||
pc|dT|nt|beauch:  btw 2@D showed 4 @H|pg||
nt|cascade: either Xu doesnt know he opens light|pg||

nt|janm: Is that number going to be 750 or 850?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: oh|pg||
nt|beauch:  they play transfers after a 1Nt response|pg||
nt|sybarra: then I preference|pg||

pc|d3|nt|beauch:  good plan :)|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: +200 on club lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: tough to lead the ten|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and might still be|pg||
nt|cascade: he still has two entries to lead up to the spades|pg||
nt|cascade: so should be safe|pg||
nt|janm: Does he have to duck a club if they do shift to it?|pg||
nt|cascade: perhaps that is more awkward|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes or he  is for sure down|pg||
nt|janm: If he ducks the club, then he has to win the next one in his hand and can't lead to the spades twice, but still has 9 tricks (1 spade, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds, 2 clubs)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wins first, ducks second|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you is far from clear cut|pg||
nt|cascade: yes without a club play he has time for an overtrick|pg||
nt|janm: I think if he wins the first and ducks the second and they shift to diamonds, he has to win that in hand to keep the K as an entry to the club A, so he's still held to 9 tricks, ...|pg||
nt|janm: which of course is all he needs|pg||
nt|janm: And EW aren't trying to keep him from taking overtricks!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janm: An initial club lead would be interesting - maybe he'd have to duck, win the second and then just give up a heart to hold onto his dummy entries?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  and careful defense will now beat this|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jrssd: there is also the Womens, the under-26 teams, and the under-21 teams|pg||

nt|sybarra: that is name on profile |pg||
nt|cascade: so you might as well take the safe way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i personally dont understand any light openers when vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|beauch:  lots of 8 and 9 card suits today|pg||
nt|sybarra: in fact I was thinking they might have tapped declarer instead of spade from W |pg||
nt|joshs: yeah bid result for e-w at the other table|pg||
nt|janm: OK, and of course you're right that once they shifted to the club you couldn't lead up twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: I think West will pass 2N|pg||
nt|joshs: big|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they find the major suit fit  (n/s)|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and what a lovely dummy, N will will find |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think they ll play slam|pg||
nt|janm: Do you run as North?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: I think I need new pards,  since mine never put ones down like S |pg||
nt|beauch:  lol|pg||
nt|jrssd: that's a minimal 2@C overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would not respond with North|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dd gs @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I will just be in 4,  tyvm|pg||
nt|sybarra: now what does S do?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will bid 4@s|pg||
nt|cascade: from a weak NT yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if i did, it would be 2C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if it is a weak nt i always run|pg||
mb|d|nt|beauch:  a few jewels|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you do rspond, 2C at least has some preemptive value while limiting the hand'|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well see what we know |pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe another double would awake him|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I like the cue |pg||
nt|h_karluk: thats better - x then cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: thanks Marshall, for the very entertaining commentary|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all suits are usually the same when we dont have spades|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janm: presumably E's pass of 2@d was forcing and West's DBL takeout and of course they'll beat this, but enough to make up for their game?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|henryb:  2@C in my methods shows a limit raise or better ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: opps push to slam @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok about to push opps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hesitation?|pg||
nt|cascade: down two wont compensate for the missed slam :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry for late arrival, folks. some emergencies arose today that had to be sorted|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: pass now clear invitation to TD|pg||
nt|janm: They only took 11 tricks in the other room, but it does seem as if they had 12 if they wanted them - still, you aren't really suggesting they should bid a slam are you?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzkt: no problem thanks for coming :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure, if inverted the option is not avaiulable|pg||
nt|cascade: not at all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jrssd: a spec says 3N was reached in the Open Room|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|cascade: hence the smile|pg||
nt|janm: Still, if he holds it to -2, that will be a little pickup against the game|pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: altho there are screens|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: maybe 4@c earlier would work better|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: horobily dodgy connection has also been an impediment:(|pg||
nt|janm: It's hard for East not to "take the money" against 2@dx, maybe West isn't supposed to double with a void? But he surely didn't want to do anything else. |pg||
nt|cascade: after the double its easy to PASS |pg||
nt|cascade: but should east PASS hoping for a double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can set this 3 several ways|pg||
nt|cascade: or bid 2@H with that much distribution|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|beauch:  ok shirley time for me to go to work- sad|pg||
nt|sybarra: I usually have to put down dummy,  (with void in trumps)  saying yeah yeah,   I know trumps go on my left|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jrssd: thanks to Al Hollander for the tourney info|pg||
pc|s5|nt|beauch:  bye|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean dont double 3@c but bid 4@c|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cascade: yes drawing trumps looks a good option|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: in my methods, 2D is always the inverted raise regardless of which minor is opened. so i would be able to raise to 2C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: thx so much  |pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: however hard to tell any pancaea as S in a fog|pg||

pc|s9|nt|sybarra: I think the X is right |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is an approach, but means you can't raise to 2@d naturally|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: just has to say "finessing spade"  then claim |pg||

mb|2D|an| |nt|henryb:  no.|pg||
mb|d|nt|alsze:  welcome to the PABF 2010|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in comparison to "jump shift in other minor INV+" it gains big, because 1D-3C is very awkward. playing this method, 1D-3C is inv single-suiter|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely plopping into 4 @S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or....|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is E up to|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|sybarra: folks may have wrong pards here for fitting hands |pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: 4@s+1 fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: one more or less will double on the S hand, but it is not without flaws at these colours|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know if I'd open 2@s (or 2@d as here) or 3@s with the West hand, but I'm afraid I can't imagine passing, although it seems to have worked out well for the West player in ...|pg||
nt|janm: the other room|pg||
mb|3S|nt|alsze:  3@s seems to be an invitation here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 1m 1N, an interesting treatment is Ripstra: 2m by partner of opener is "better minor" with both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if a 2S or 2N bid forces pd to bid at  3 level, esp hearts, you could be cruising for a round number against nothing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a slight compensation, double somewhat increases the likelihood of scoring spade Q on defense, and the most likely outcome is probably a final contract in spades. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: on the third hand, with this many aces and kings the opps are not likely to bid a spade game, so the number of IMPs likely to hinge on whether or not you score spade queen on ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense is limited|pg||
nt|sybarra: can W handle 3 nt ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be able to  to handle it all |pg||
nt|sybarra: but will E sit?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: originally posited as a method over opposing NT openers|pg||
pc|d6|nt|alsze:  with both @c AQ onside, 4@s is cold|pg||
pc|d3|nt|alsze:  Philippines shall start with a good board|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cascade: how many times can you do that before you create a disclosable agreement|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which action are we talking about|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the pyschic transfer, i would say twice|pg||
nt|cascade: psychic transfer|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably the DBL of multi showed a balanced 13-15 or something like that (or probably could also be a strong hand) and 2NT asked which Major and perhaps max or min, so 3@d showed ...|pg||
nt|janm: spades and a minimum.|pg||
nt|janm: On the last hand, I just asked Chip your question (assuming that's what you meant) and he says that as a practical matter, you don't get hands like this very often, so it probably ...|pg||
nt|janm: doesn't arise |pg||

mb|4C|nt|barnets: not the right spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can Karwur do anything other than 5@C now?|pg||
nt|barnets: in clubs declarer can ruff 3 spades in dummy and 3 hearts in hand setting up the long heart|pg||
nt|barnets: and making 13 tricks despite the 3-0 trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe better question   what could/should he have done instead of 3N|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 1N works when W has 5 hearts, 1S works when W has 3 spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with a doubleton heart, E should bid 1S as less to gain from 1N|pg||
nt|kelvin yim: Hi all|pg||
nt|alsze:  or 4@s when @s Q onside and 4-3....|pg||
nt|alsze:  hi Kelvin|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still X|pg||
nt|sybarra: high or low straight|pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost flush|pg||
nt|janm: Hard for N to know that the diamonds are a danger|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|h_karluk: allright, appreciated to Mrs Shirley Ybarra and operator, kibitzers always welcomed, please follow BBO Vugraph schedule|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: clubs will work ok too of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well...|pg||
nt|joshs: 4H is also very good|pg||
nt|joshs: 4H is probably the best game|pg||
nt|janm: With the diamonds blocked, they can only beat this 2, even though at first it looks as if they have 7 tricks (5 diamonds and 2 spades)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joshs: but this is a very hard bidding problem, and NS had a normal auction|pg||
nt|cascade: its easier to know if he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|janm: Oops - I was talking about 3NT of course - didn't really think they'd bid 4@d|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is the final board for this set. more scheduled for one hour from now. thanks to all responsible parties, from irresponsible parties such as myself|pg||
nt|janm: Can he make this? Maybe lose only 1 trick in each side suit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D was imaginative but quite reasonable actually if double shows singleton club|pg||
nt|janm: No reason to think they were beating 3NT with his bad hand|pg||
mc|9|nt|janm: Did N lead A and a heart and West misguessed, hoping for both spade honors onside? Or was there some other way to go down?|pg||
nt|janm: We don't know what the play and defense were on this hand, but the only way I can see that he'd go down in 4@d is if N shifted to A and a heart and he went up K, hoping to be able ...|pg||
nt|janm: to run the spades for a heart pitch (but he didn't have the hand entries for 2 spade plays, so that seems unlikely). Really don't know how he went down, but apparently he did.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on club club you have to lead spades from dummy?|pg||
nt|janm: At any rate, that was the last hand of this match - Indonesia lost 29 IMPs on the first 3 boards we watched and then regrouped to win by 45 - well done by them!|pg||
nt|janm: Good night all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks all|pg||
