pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Asbi did have available immediate transfer to @C -- but Convention Card doesn't talk about the follow-up after 1N-2@C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Gosney play @C8 on 3rd round of @D?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ritong: not if he s not asked to ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: if his pard wants an uppercut, he plays a low @d at that point|pg||
nt|robinswr: the jack of diamonds says don't ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S4  the unreadable upside-down count/attitude|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|robinswr: lets see if declarer reads the failure to continue diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: east should have pitched a heart. the spade discard shows five or six spades|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|geot: I think: if West had continued with the J it says to partner dont ruff, there is no help in it.....while if he plays a low to force parther to ruff, if he want a promotion|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|c6|pc|d2|pg||
mc|11|nt|geot: well done|pg||
nt|robinswr: good read of the spade discard and the spade switch|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well double didnt impeded EW in the slightest from bidding their heart game....maybe S needed to Michaels:):):)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: ty pascale,  great job |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: could E ever find the stiff @D lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N already close to a 4S bid on his own after the double, but presumably downgraded club and heart holding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably wrong to downgrade hearts once the suit is supported -- heart lead probable, ESPECIALLY because you have the club king....because that means E wont have an AK or KQ ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: combination in the alternative lead suit and thus is a huge favorite to lead a heart|pg||

nt|geot: yes well done|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that there was an effective promo|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: interesting how to assess the blame there --- did @S4 influence Gill, was Gill overthinking...|pg||
nt|geot: yes third diamond ruffed by the A, and Gill has a trump trick|pg||
nt|geot: ruffed by the 8|pg||
nt|geot: from East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+@C  [2 only if 4-4-3-2, not 4@C & 4@D]|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: but it was extremely dangerous to try for it, from west s angle|pg||
nt|geot: exactly|pg||
mb|2S|nt|geot: he need pd to hold 8 or higher |pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx specs for your great comments |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: heart partscore is par, many pairs could not get to one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: forcing club gives a good chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|marlowepi: but E needs to  rebid 1N to make that likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N works when W has 5 hearts, 1S works when W has 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with a doubleton heart, E should bid 1S as less to gain from 1N|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: clubs will work ok too of course|pg||
