nt|babs59: my opponents usually rebid 1@S (with 4) or 1NT|pg||
nt|nickf: yes, some play skipping the transfer to rebid 1NT shows 18-19|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it all depends on how you treat unbalanced versus balanced hands and your no trump range|pg||
nt|babs59: whereas many now have an opening bid to show 18-19 bal|pg||
