mb|3H|nt|jcmax: Is this a Muiderberg for the Dutch?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: opening bid at other table "strong, or very occasionally weak with diamonds"|pg||
nt|dburn: North couldn't open there - he doesn't play weak two bids, and he refused to open three|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: difficult to get to 5D now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: north is a she and she does play weak 2 bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: she's just a bit aggressive|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzgr: ah, you were talking about other table|pg||
nt|jcmax: david was referring to the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: I think many would choose not to open a weak 2 though|pg||
nt|dburn: good thing Zia is facing Roy Welland and not Larry Cohen - this would not play well in 4@s doubled|pg||
nt|henryb:  I certainly would not|pg||
nt|jtr: N/S cc http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/0910/Schollaardt-Wortel_May2010.pdf|pg||
nt|jtr: E/W did their's on the back of an envelope during the dirst session|pg||
nt|jtr: first|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  the spots are such that North cannot tell whether that is a short suit or a long suit|pg||

nt|odysseus69: defence tough now|pg||
nt|dburn: this might not be the best use of East-West's trumps|pg||
nt|jtr: After Zia's thought maybe declarer had AQJxxxx but the @cK gave it away|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but ok if spade king|pg||
nt|jcmax: They can still beat it, but far from obvious|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or low diamond|pg||
nt|jcmax: They have to cash just 1 1D trick and then Zia has to ruff a @S with his @HK and give his partner a @C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: queen of clubs was perhaps a giveaway to Zia, if Welland plays a spade now, Zia can ruff and play clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Welland has to get to partner for the club ruff now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: with 4 or fewer clubs (missing the 10) declarer would not overtake the queen|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|jcmax: But he must not play a low @S at this point! Declarer would discard her @D|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now any @S will do|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: Little mileage in that|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely done|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they haven't done it yet|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland did his nice bit|pg||
nt|henryb:  not over; Zia can still go wrong|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think nicelies done is good english anyway:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: Unlikely when he is looking at the @c10|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: no need for the plural in any case|pg||
nt|jtr: True:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: Zia asks why Welland played his highest spade when he wanted a club ruff|pg||
nt|jcmax: Zia will probably tell his partner he had to return the @S9 instead of the K......zia plays the 9 as the "Nike" card meaning: partner wake up and do something unusual!|pg||

nt|jcmax: Pass could very easily have been the winner here, if the opponents' @S weren't 3-3!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would transfer partly because if partner can "super accept" showing short hearts I can bid game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2S ok with spades 3-3 but 1NT more flexible|pg||
nt|dburn: doesn't seem to have lost all that much - isn't he going to make 1NT?|pg||

nt|hvdhaar: Hi all|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt that he played the @hs that way|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: A "disciplined" action by Drijver - not opening 3@C , like some players would do , convinced by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly thatb sort of hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: can make 5@c NS|pg||

nt|hedyg: this will not make|pg||
nt|hedyg: after a @s lead they switch to @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni doesnt like it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for 1255|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would use something like 3@D by E to show a LR in @S.  3@S often just shows a max single raise.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma is extremely proud of his hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @hs 3 3 this should make nicely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very friendlt hand for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to lead a D, and with clubs 22 doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Jordan i am surprised by the 3@s bid too|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's pretty much implicit that S has to have some fit for one of the minors here.  Probably not trotting out 4@H for the first time without the ability to go to 5m as needed.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean after one spade|pg||
nt|pelu: what would u bid? - 3@S NF - they can use 3@c and 3@D as fircing/invitational bids|pg||

nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could decide to play W for three clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unwise X in my opinion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely S was prepared all along to bid 5C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W opened in 3rd seat at favorable|pg||
nt|hedyg: X= i underbid my hand ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W white on red in third, E does not have trump trick - I agree with your assessment, Marshall.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: guess we are watching a recording :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mich-b: East knows that East will not have 4 card @S support|pg||
nt|hedyg: the balancing double by Fantoni allowed E to bid again and get to play in his 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would raise to 2@S with that rather than pass|pg||
nt|mich-b: so he prefers the 7 card suit , to the 4-3 fit|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: tricky lead!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: those @C's are only useful as trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs 3-2, @ss on side..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fantunes play what are called Slavinsky leads very tricky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they only underlead aces when it is right :p|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course|pg||
nt|mich-b: best for he defense is to stay passive, and let declarer work on the @S suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: E surely has a singleton @H or void, the question is where is the 10@H (for Fantoni)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not normally this slow when defending a part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni? LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even he|pg||
nt|hedyg: yesterday there was a miracle when the table where both Fantoni and Muller played finished before the other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Shirley.|pg||
nt|hedyg: re|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling on the diamonds very dubious because S has announced trick source in hearts and E has 3 small|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no D is o nly chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play @c|pg||
nt|pelu: look at that dummy - East prob play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D only chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: or even @H in case S has K@s and W A@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i predict he will play diamond king|pg||
nt|pelu: Mullers best chance : I take my X back :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S marked with one diamond at most|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can that beat it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am with Peter :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: undo the double |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact, since S is known to have 6 strong hearts from the auction, his pass marks him with this shape almost surely|pg||
nt|pelu: the best chance is 4-6-1-2 in S and then he sh play C to kill Ss hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond lead is only chance because declarer might play W for three clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer will play to win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that shape is almost impossible,|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Marschall - have a bet (just a coke) - No @D from East :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @d back he can play 2 @hs to disc 1 @d and ruff 3, last ruff W overruffs with ace and thats all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when we look at the auction that S has followed, it is clear he was always preared to bid 5C, and he did not open with six strong hearts which almost surely means 4 spades. hence ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4603|pg||
nt|pelu: No Marshal, 2@H = 10-13 HCP|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 10 hcps to open with, they do not have weak openings for 6 card suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes there are many things he can do to make as cards lie Hedy, but they won;t all work if W has three clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well dont they play multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure they will! he just has to have 2 @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: could (should) have covered|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Marshall!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: as good a hand as he could have given the bidding  (maybe an ace extra) |pg||

nt|marlowepi: unfortunately for NS, D8 always tall on this layout whoever plays the suit|pg||

pc|hT|nt|mich-b: did the ruffing finesse in @D work? ...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||

pc|c6|nt|hedyg: LOL Michael|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Well observed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: As a player just starting out, one might wonder how S knew to value their hand so highly.  This hand shows the power of distribution.  With W and E bidding and raising @S's, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: partner is marked with shortness.  Meanwhile, pd should have creditable suits at this vulnerability and that gives the S hand very few losers off the top.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jcmax: There are 2 trump losers for sure and lot of losers to ruff with not enough trumps....|pg||
nt|jtr: No play record so probably incorrect|pg||
nt|odysseus69: bold double from Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: the previous match when Welland and Zia were playing Drijver-Brink was a lot louder than this one|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: ouch|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  and if South can make a penalty double, boldness will turn into rashness|pg||
nt|odysseus69: perhaps 2NT better idea from N orth|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2NT would indeed be a better idea. but only if partner interprets it as both minors|pg||
nt|dburn: might work better on this occasion even if partner doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: will this go down? declarer can scamble a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1D -1NT suggests a club suit or diamond support- maybe South might have redoubled 1NT|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|c2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcmax: Well let's see. Declarer plays @SAK and a @S ruff, @HAK and a @Hruff. Then a @D up. not looking so bad|pg||
nt|jtr: I wonder if they open 1@c with all balanced hands  The cc seems to imply not|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: they don't|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: they open 2D with 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks Han|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: 2C is only 2 when 4432 12-14|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: Right Got you|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcmax: I think the timing would have been better if declarer had ruffed a @H first before playing a @D towards dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|dburn: better to have taken that heart ruff first, maybe|pg||
nt|dburn: but East is taking it for her, so to speak|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: but...|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now declarer can do the same thing again. ruff a @H. play @D over and @S from dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is very well played|pg||
nt|dburn: if West ruffs this high, the defenders get too many trump tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: If West ruffs and plays the @d?|pg||
nt|jtr: East can pitch a @h|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c4|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

nt|hedyg: almost...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but can he be doubling here for -1?|pg||
nt|hedyg: isn't that very dangerous?|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends which heart nour played first|pg||
nt|lestergold: honour|pg||
nt|lestergold: morelikely to play overfcaller forv short heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: if plays heart to the ace would then have to decide whether to play restricted choice for heart J|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: camouflaging the J@H?|pg||

nt|hedyg: much harder now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: attempted Grosvenor, my favourite|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im told that the lord gave us singletons to lead them for a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Mike!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the Lord bothers with bridge?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes Hedy,  cant you tell?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: how did south think this contract wa going off without pard holding A@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: has not alternative but 9 does he?  would S lead from xx in H!?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would he lead from Jxx???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are they internationals :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: right!|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why he is in tank he cant work it out because it was not exactly a marked defence|pg||
nt|pelu: 26 HCP + solid stoppers - but still almost no play for 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Nunes knew where the 10@d is he could have exited in @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: Jan Jan Jan!!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lord has come to iceland's rescue- Grovesnor by m,istake|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: GRosvenor works, gets his trump trick back :) Victory|pg||
nt|hedyg: rather took pd for K@c and A@D in W|pg||

nt|jtr: Ah in defence, i see|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcmax: I wondr whether NS can get to @S over this bid|pg||

nt|odysseus69: more NT from North?|pg||
nt|dburn: can he?|pg||
nt|jcmax: 10 tricks were made at the other table because W did not read partner's @C lead for a singleton and ducked|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: what did his first double mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Oh missed that sorry|pg||
nt|henryb:  still that means they lost another trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: But values i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: or perhaps he wanted to double (at least) one of the majors|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  since the defence would appear to have 2@s a @c and a @d|pg||
nt|dburn: so if he were to double 2@h, it would (probably) be for penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: "2 more clubs than last time partner"|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed after the first double|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, if he were to bid 2@s that would (probably) be natural|pg||
nt|jcmax: I don't see how declarer can avoid losing 2@S, 1@D and 2 @C tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: It is much too warm to notice every bid:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: I suspect that the first double showed values, had he doubled 2H later it would still be takeout for them|pg||

nt|hedyg: hmmm is 4@H enough here?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems a lazy 4@H bid hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: N is obviously short in @s|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Agree, first DBL (take-out) and then 4 H looks better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pressure on N|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mich-b: reasonable 6@C here for NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: the optionwas to open 1@d and rebid 2@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even without a club stopper Ralf? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: indeed there was|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks an easy 4 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: this is a potential disaster -3 if passed|pg||
nt|hedyg: Baldursson : they always bid my doubelton when i double!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when 60 down, might you think of more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubleton*|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have shown a good 5@d bid by first bidding 4n then correcting 5@c to dims but i dont think north would have bid 6 even then |pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/iceland/jonsson-baldursson.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: or rebid 3 @C ,  but light for that |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes passed X's to Jansma|pg||
nt|pelu: better pass to 2@D - and take 7x@h against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: but getting 1100 here will be almost as good perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you believe other room 6@C bid?|pg||
nt|mich-b: note Fantoni's pass , on the strength of his @H10|pg||
nt|hedyg: lolllll|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|hedyg: S is definitely too good for a 3@c bid and how else to get to 6@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would that not have shown 2 places to play ?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: South has to bid a grand now ... N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW play Tarzan Precision wow sounds exciting|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play Ice-relay precision|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: now gets the chance to take 7 tricks |pg||
nt|hedyg: K@H lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is on lead |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: in a good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: S on lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe Jansma could have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: crazy 3NT there's no sense to it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes with some hesitation - if 1@c is conventional|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|mich-b: no, i dont think other room will reach 6@C , but thats not impossible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you rite -1100 more likely|pg||
nt|mich-b: the way to get to 6@C , is for South to double, North to show values via Lebensohl, and South to complete the description by bidding @Cs , going past 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to remove the @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: for most players 2NT would be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: (lebensohl)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: quess @HJ or @S9|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni knows that Nunes does not have the J@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DJ mb too DD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they'll be pushing to finish before the next scheduled start time|pg||
nt|hedyg: so playing @s is not tempting|pg||
nt|sybarra: now where to begin |pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: "a card"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not too DD for fantoni:)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: at first yes but the second bid would have corrected taht impression|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could still have 4+@s and long @ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WOW 7@H reached|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Pity that Rob Helle isn't watching; he's a Tarzan expert and encouraged Bauke en Simon to start using the system (some 5 years ago)|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it should be his duty to be here with us!|pg||
nt|hedyg: here 1@c is 2+|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: tell us about Tarzan please Hans|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: ugh,  as we can see probably low @D works better |pg||
nt|jcwla: Not free of pitfalls.  Meanwhile, 1 was a push when 3NT made in the OR, also with the help of a @S trick.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Peter sry|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: claiming  all but the @hs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: went all the way to dummy to play K@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may as well go light now|pg||
nt|lestergold: With 4 spades and 5+ dims he would bid 4@s not risking the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it again, I'm very sorry.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mike he could have a better hand with @s and @d and not want to just bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty tough contract to play i would say|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: now J@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would love to hear his thinking analysis in these both tricks:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play @s to ace and a @D back he can ruff and play K@C since S surely has A@c and no more @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: possible but more important to use the 4n bid in the manner i described that standard bidding to show good dims|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: i think S should have won the D to play hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: what for?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not |pg||
nt|hedyg: they are not going anywhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i was thinking, to avoid this defence|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|pelu: the winning line is (I hope :) to play @s to finess in trick 3 and then @d3 from hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but jack of diamonds would allow H to go away while N ruffs, so S was correct, my error|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E not thrilled with W play at trick one|pg||
nt|hedyg: low @H was encouraging by E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim...|pg||
mc|10|nt|jaapfr: but same -4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well claimed, ralf:)|pg||

nt|jcmax: hoping for a singleton Jack|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jtr: People rarely get a count on Welland's hand from his bidding:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: winning the diamond in hand and playing a club towards the king would combine the two chances|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: So here on a @H lead against 3N declarer will have to guess after a @H to the A and the @HJ whether to play his Q or withhold it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heart blockage -no way out for defence|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcmax: If NS play count on opening lead that won't be difficult. But if they lead attitude declarer may go wrong|pg||
nt|odysseus69: playing for 6 card heart suit against odds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: NS lead "high" from odd to an honor here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|jtr: The 6 cannpot be from a 6-card suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|jcmax: No, it can't. Only an attitude @H3 lead would pose a problem for declarer. But if you don't play that, then you cannot lead it :)|pg||

pc|h3|pc|c2|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok so he did finesse both @d and @c|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not as clear with the @S raise being delayed -- more an art than a science.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3 a push at 4@H making.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will with hold my "easy" comments |pg||
nt|hedyg: this might well be a boring push board :p|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: obviously 4@H was a forcing slam try :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps better to struggle with the rebid by opening something other than 1 nt |pg||
nt|pelu: Jansma just hoped for J x x by pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: easy 3N thx to heart blockage:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: 1@c 14+ f1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was nice to watch|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL better Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and rightfully so |pg||
nt|hedyg: nice to be optimistic|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the mind boggles if this is the best|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: aida,  could paulissen have opened 1 club on the hand?  |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play Polish @c|pg||
mb|1D|nt|aida_mk_nl: he can open 1@C if his hand in 16+ with 5@C|pg||
nt|pelu: in the syetem he was almost forced to open 1NT|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: then rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: he could open 1@D |pg||
nt|sybarra: he had 16,  |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: then he downgraded his hand probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma feeling robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @D in their system might have been better then  I am sure it will be discussed|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand Nunes is in 3rd seat, he could have anything|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW can make 5 @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 5@cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to get into the bidding for that |pg||
nt|pelu: still red against green - Nunes is a conservativ bidder (no junior-style)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E based on last hand should have opened 1@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think he can open 1 @C |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: I am sure paulissen made  the best bid in his view, it was just unlucky @H distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Aida |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes very interesting board|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this ending in 3@D or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: note that the Italian do NOT bid 1@H with 4 @hs and @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 10@s is a huge card here|pg||
nt|mich-b: wasnt 1@D showing @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Peter Lund :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this should stop low|pg||
nt|hedyg: i do like xfer bids over 1NT here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: put the strong hand on lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is awfully string for a NF 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strong|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 4@hs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H seems about right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d = unbalanced with @ds|pg||
nt|pelu: couldn't he bid 3@H (invitational?) - a strong hand would for sure start with X|pg||
nt|hedyg: rare to see a precision 2@c opening with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think i have ever seen that before|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: de Wijs and Muller > WijsMuller > Weismuller > Tarzan :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol cute|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: just as well if they dont get to 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok you can beat 5 by leading @H as N and S underleads his AQJ@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: either 5+ @ds and a singleton somewhere or 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or with 2NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on EW no problems with the block in @h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh yes you are right Michael|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob was 1@d alerted?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2nt a solid contract to be in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes xfrs cc here|pg||
nt|mich-b: I am a bit surprised they had no way to take out to 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He tried to bid 2 clubs over 2 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems Nunes saw a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|mich-b: normally with South's hand one would expect 3@D to play better than 2NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bob|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes that is.|pg||
nt|hedyg: right as he would have over 1NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although all T and 9 are pretty usefull in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fierce discussion ensued.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Solved : ), he can do whatever he wants.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope only with words:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Zia in 5NX-1 on the 4SX hand so 14 to Netherlands|pg||
nt|hedyg: a friendly match |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes tried to bid 2 clubs over 2NT they solved it by all passing|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Peter :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello peter |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jonsson must bid 4H here|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets you all do that specs :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 53 hearts more likely than 62|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing transfers he could bid 2@d and over 2@H 3 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: echo in here:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|jaapfr: no @SJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: TD: this is not fully according to the Laws but if you agree .... and all LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Brink asks Fantoni if he could possibly play a bit faster|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol at that one|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni: your first words where, if it's possible!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: were*|pg||
nt|hedyg: he thinks 3@H=4cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: watch the carding here,  all important |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d ended all hope for EW|pg||
nt|pelu: clever 5@D - if N pass I exp that Paulissen would have X|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: if that's Ice-Relay it just sank when the ice melted|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcwla: E has nicely sitting cards, yes, but a real minimum hand.  Might summon up 3@H (thru some sequence) as W with that length and texture.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that Muller would accept the invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes he could, but i don;t see why that should stop him from making the value bid of 3H when he isnt laying transfers|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 spec tells me he remembers Belladonna opening a superprecision 2@c with 6 6 in 1973........|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: nice spots in @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even the great Bella had one lapse in his career ?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Bad hand for the NS-system; N didn't deny 4 H we must assume|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: 9@H a giveaway|pg||
nt|hedyg: however they lead high from odd nr of cards with an honour|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|hedyg: or do they?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: everything so friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: talking about ""faster"":)|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR catching up with us|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes is already resting his head on the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1H - ? - 4@C would do it|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok 4@H is down as well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but much preferable contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3rd option would be an initial pass :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: just need Qx in @H on side|pg||
nt|hedyg: or AQx|pg||
nt|hedyg: here comes the @d back|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: he can't open @C with @C's but has to open 1N with xx in majors, is this a sound system?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: no overtake???|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: He could open Gary if HE THINK he should|pg||
nt|pelu: in CC: 1@D can be 4@D+5@c|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: surely Jansma did|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: or Slawinski or Slavinski or Slavinsky, have seen them all|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: leaving the bidding open?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in pls bid 7 if you stop @hs?|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp he took 6@C as cue with @D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: didn't expect Fantoni would have 6 card support for his side suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c might have been the cue, but 6?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcwla: "Stop the presses.  Who's that?  Vicki Vale."|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Jimmy Olsen|pg||
nt|pelu: why is 5@c not naturel?|pg||
nt|hedyg: even looking at 5 @cs in his hand..|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another tiring hand for Nunes to watch|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Thx Hedy |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was actually Lukasz Slawinski|pg||
nt|marlowepi: specs there will be a partial refund of your tickets for having to watch a contract of 1S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am not refunding!|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass by S partially based on weak 1 level overcalls|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: 5@C is on - can setup a@D to discard the @s-loser|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: where would the trouble be after 1@C? I don't see it, as for the 6 card @C NT well...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: but 3NT is not|pg||
nt|hedyg: so run!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so lets X the doomed contract to point them to the making one :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the X = warning - u cant make 3NT - find a better place :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Adolphe Menjou in "The Front Page"|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 13 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: these 20-20 1nt are thrilling imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: E ducks the Q@H lead and the J@H as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is a semi-balanced NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a lead away from KJ to many with AKQx of trumps :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: unblock A@H just in case?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: 9@d unblocking just in case|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wasted 9@D :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: no need for W to try to be brave here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: so rightsided :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: good bye ht loser |pg||
nt|pelu: need @D 4-2|pg||
nt|pelu: and no @c-ruff|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: close to push them in a winning 6@c|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 5@c|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 and 7@d were equivalent|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and good small deblock|pg||
nt|hedyg: since 8@d is in dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok votes on: -1 or made   i vote for made|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm Brink asked Fantoni to hurry up?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lolll|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: At the moment they are all patient, except for Nunes who is doing a whole host of other things.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wish we had viewcam :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: that would be great|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still it is using too much braincells whilst thinking too long when there is NOT enough info to think about|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzgq: I'm intrigued by the amount of poses Nunes has.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no OR hibernating too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to think here aagain so long must be teasing dummy:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: might play @hs off the top here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: angling for trump|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really, they just switch off when partner is playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Keyboard failed(again), missed it, apologies.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 3@H X the defense slipped up by not playing J@D so -4 for a push|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is still much better than my Spanish wifi Bob|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he didnt play the K@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I feel sorry for you.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: ace or king all the same|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but i am 12 meters of the sea with a nice sandy beach in front of me so not too unhappy:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Oh wait yes he did, after that spades, after that ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I see some paint drying outside, quite exciting|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Now I envy you.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 5 2NT in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: leading his long suit when long in trumps, hoping to tap declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h switch is good for the defence|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: only 24 C and all blue sky:(|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcwla: Seemingly @H fin cannot win with W marked with a @D card on E's lead of a @C rather than a @D.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hvdhaar: now west can't overruff the 3rd H !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 16 highs plus a void and shows 11-15 what is the point of playing prec?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: waste of 8@s :(|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: but a @s back and another @D here.......|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure he would lead a top @d after the 2@d bid|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: dont think that is clear. E holds club ace so with AK of diamonds he would not need to lead one--no diamond loser could run away|pg||

nt|vugraphzgr: first Welland's turn Sabine, thinking hard with hands over his head|pg||

mb|d|nt|jaapfr: if not 4@S (logic) by S free 6@H now i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would S bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: meaning slam very likely now|pg||
nt|pelu: remember i "imposible 3NT in board 3: IN OE played from East (and N "open" 1@S??) so @S-lead to A and @S back. Unblock @Hs and easy 9 tricks|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@s 10-13 unbalanced |pg||
nt|pelu: this time Hedy I was 0.1 sec before u :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you were indeed!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: X would be good here EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jaapfr: agree 100%|pg||
nt|pelu: "maybe" :)?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ethics |pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Bauke decided that he was much better placed to show 3-suiter after 1 D opener|pg||
nt|hedyg: he only downgraded by 1hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Plenty of jokes about not making any contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: A@D?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: They play 1 Cl - 1 D (neg) - 1 H as a relay (19+) and 2 D rebid would deny a major  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sacre bleu you either play a system or you dont :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: @hs are very friendly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N wont be thrilled at 6C until dummy hits. he could have more for his 1N|pg||
nt|hedyg: like a LOT more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but remember that 1@H is f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: so actually he promised 0 hcps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure but he still has borscht|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am not keen on the 2D then 3D sequence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and i am not sure that double is a better can than 4D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: call|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: 4@s is not kickback here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: meant NOT 4@S bid by S    is logic|pg||
nt|pelu: I like to be in 6@hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d was 10-15, 2+ @ds , 11-13 if balanced|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok, cancel that specs say 6 either minor|pg||
nt|pelu: even 6@c making, but need to find @Dq on the short @d-hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Aida what is 4NT? rkc?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: another one slips away|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pelu: ??|pg||

nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is just the correct play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in any case, the heart finesse was unlikely to gain anything even if working, as the 4th round of heart was a loser anyway. unless you have in mind declarer unblocking club king at ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: but your @cs are better |pg||
nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: lol Gary|pg||
nt|hedyg: you also play your intuition!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well ok..they do cause they are all world class players!|pg||
nt|hedyg: better for me if i dont :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: eek  is this best?|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that it was @D to Q and K, and now @CQ from W|pg||
nt|pelu: 4Nt I exp = @D-suit and some support for @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: why did Jansma not bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 x 3-2 fit - if @hs 4-1 u cant make any slam - if @Hs 3-2 and @cs 4-1 still slam in @h|pg||
nt|pelu: why 4@s and not 4NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Paulissen has bid his heart out|pg||
nt|sybarra: dragging the "good hand"  (W)|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: i dont think so, i dont know actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you would want to play 7C facing as little as K of spades and Qxxxx of clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: only way to 6@c is bashing it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|hedyg: but Peter is right, on 4NT he would get 3 keycards and then can bid slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if you had to worry about pard haveing a negative resp you would never play a strong club :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with Qx@D are they good or lucky|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but prefer nt and not 4@S bid by W|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Geoffrey :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: 3 kaycards MUST be 2 aces and K@H here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he was worried about that, rather about describing his hand economically|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: 75% of the time or more my pard responds 1@D|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and very clear (6@c) after 3@h in my opinion|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: so then ask for Q@H and went W denies stop in 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: keycards*|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont understand "better than 4@H" and then refuse to cue @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah ok ty Bob|pg||
nt|lc: 4@D would not have shown a control -- would have just been better than 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: with @C-s 4-1 decl cant make a safe-play in @h - @hK (J or Q from S) and ran @h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes now we know |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he has a choice for making except the k of @D, @D, does he?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember that 2@S is contructiv opening - 10-13 - so S is favorit to have @DQ|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: i agree peter and @H lead means only one thing -> singleton|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: indeed S is 10-13|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Larry, |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 17 imps on the grand thats a BIG loss|pg||
nt|hedyg: Brink did as we suggested, he bid X over 3@s and 4@H over 3NT...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claimed on the finesses Bob?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Uhuh|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He played the diamonds..|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni could have had 4@cs and 5@ds in the same hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this could be sporting|pg||
nt|lc: As shown, he would have gone down (if he ducked a heart).|pg||

nt|hedyg: or score, yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: As S I had expected @hQx from P when he bid 3@h|pg||

nt|hedyg: no way to make 6 that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Want me to ask them afterwards?|pg||
nt|pelu: didn't he loose a @h and a @c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 5 in OR, 1@D by E and by W........ 4@H.|pg||

nt|hedyg: i think he would have bid that immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S passed?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is a good bid facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: DBL - 3 S ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s=11-15|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree Ralf. in fact the main advantage of double is that you get to learn more about N shape. if 1N denied four spades (i am not sure it did), then the fact that pd did not pass ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the double  of 3D suggests pd's clubs are legitimate|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe that double = @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play transfer bids|pg||

nt|hedyg: knowing that N had 3 cards..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he "gambled", there was some.. relief.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe a squeeze on S?|pg||

nt|lc: Too early in the morning here -- I think West too light for 2NT  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N a somewhat hungry call here|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: 1@d was relay|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told Drijver apologized after a short discussion|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob undo pls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with a bad suit and no aces, transfer to see if pd likes it. if she doesnt, 3C will be enough|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: agree - no barrage made it easier for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nasty sys here in this situation|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for ew|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But you never know, I can ask him afterwards.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: overtake just in case|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: but this contract will not make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with natural bidding it would be automatic 4@S by EW down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 4@H a good sac vs 3@s =|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also against 2@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= 11-14 4 @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How did declarer make 9 tricks in 1NT on board 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but surely 3@s would not show strength by E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: operator did:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He didn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: we dont know :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bob was going to correct it Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many did he actually make?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NN=  is the code|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still a chance 4@H will be made here|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlucky all minor honours off side|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sorry, laptop decided to have his own will.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls correct that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: After they finish playing|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: laptops are tricky things|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can't make 4@H can he?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should not|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all suits wrong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: had he bid 1N he wouldn't have this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: the maximum he can make is 9 tricks as far as i can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: King holds, followed by another spade, 8H QH, 2H AH, KH, 2C T Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: If that's understandable|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is!|pg||
nt|hedyg: and E switches to @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: can disc 1@d on a @c but should lose 2@cs, 2@ds and a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Muller is thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yup 5D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double swing for 11 on the 3N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: for the jack, followed by 5C for the ace, and another D|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this should be -2 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Gary, 5@D EW in OR?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubled -2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -1 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get messy |pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: heart queen prsumably SP|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: wd bob|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: 1@c-1@D-1@H= 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3 clubs  to make S guess, but he can just throw a heart as cards lie|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: where 3N may make|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|nt|lc: or ....|pg||
nt|hedyg: messier on a @d lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: yes or :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since he is always down 1, but can avoid guess for -2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can ruff and lead H, but he might not |pg||
nt|pelu: then N can ruff and give pd a @H-ruff|pg||
nt|jcwla: Welland brought the 4@H home on 5 for a gain of 6 to within 23.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp down 2 - @CQ will be ruffed by S and a @D-loser|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|pelu: S sh have played @C back|pg||
nt|sybarra: still has a @H to lose |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He changed his mind.|pg||
nt|hedyg: without honour they lead high from odd|pg||
nt|pelu: low-high = odd nummer|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: or any strong|pg||
nt|hedyg: (18+)|pg||
nt|lc: Presumably, there must be some upper limit since East passed.|pg||
nt|hedyg: they might have other bids to show 20+ after 1@d|pg||
nt|lc: Since 1@H contracts are boring, I take this opportunity to tell you the strange fact that Baldursson taught me how to speak some Icelandic!|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow!|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@c - 1@D - 1NT = 18-20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|hedyg: and small from even|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: wd Fulvio|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with regard to bidding it was logic|pg||
nt|jaapfr: was it:)?|pg||
nt|hedyg: with an honour they lead the opposite|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Had to get thea for Nunes Jansma decided to play exactly then.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: i would have disced @s as W|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: yes this looks a good line|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C away|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nothing to think|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: @ds could be 3 3|pg||
mc|7|nt|hedyg: thinking what to play next|pg||
nt|hedyg: they do think further than the present trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is very unusual to think about this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nah, arbiter said 50 min left, he asked 15!?, no 50, reply being not enough but better...|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N!|an|may have a 4-card major|nt|jcmax: I wonder whether EW were on the same wavelength as to the nature of the 3@C raise there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzgr: again, low from even with an honor or odd without an honor|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Classsic Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: difficult for Schollaardt, especially since Wortel didn't give the correct count on this trick|pg||
nt|jtr: But not as good as yesterday when he played low from 108x to a single 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: they tend to signal quite honestly|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: more hearts|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|s5|pg||

nt|roswolf: bravissimo you mean|pg||
nt|pelu: strange bidding - I also have the CC - and hedy are correct 1@H = 12-14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from E point of view, hearts were more likely to be 52 because of the 3-level negative double|pg||
nt|hedyg: -1 Bob?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not -3|pg||
nt|pelu: I can see down 2 - but never down 3 - try to help us BOB|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: -2|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d disc makes no sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to get careless when unhappy with the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol yes!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kiwibridge: now 6@S ns|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but for Fantoni routine to find best line:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is wonderful that the Dutch have these generous sponsors!|pg||
nt|hedyg: (White House)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 7 even|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a simple slam hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: why only 6?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = 10-13|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c 2+|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jaapfr: 7@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the few countries that have such sponsors|pg||
nt|lc: E-W have a slam -- but have gone conservative.|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.1 sec again Hedy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4HW-2  is the code|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bob trys our patience for the umpteenth time :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 110 coming|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c would be gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c is invite|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: 2@c FG|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and they will bid that|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c = gf with @c or balanced or fit @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: only -1 Bob? not -2?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s, 2@ds and 2@cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A light 2@H here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N obviously also feared doubleton heart in S hand as he did not play a heart right away when in with spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h was down|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: can now disc a @s on @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Typo, changed it.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is trying hard, it's a very tough job!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok 100 coming|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you find the @H lead?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: and a claim at trick 1|pg||
nt|lc: It's easy for us to say that West should have balanced, but we see all 52 cards.|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red,  not easy to jump into this bidding maybe|pg||
nt|lc: South could have had some of those hearts that East has.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a great @H suit he has|pg||
nt|lc: There is an expression to cover West's decision: "It is dangerous to bid, it is dangerous to pass."  This time it was the latter.|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody can accuse Jansma of lack of courage :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: W is in trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about pass?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont need to|pg||
nt|hedyg: small from even withough honour or odd with|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: but lowest spade seems very dangerous|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: 3NT serious asking for cuebids|pg||
nt|hedyg: and make on a @c guess, but needs a very good guess|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see - no lead can defeat 5@D by force|pg||
nt|jcwla: A reasonable question to ask is "How will this do if pd has seven points?"|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky @C, would play same from A@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Q of clubs and spade back may be best chance, as N would misguess. but that opening lead would be.........difficult to find:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he shd play low despite opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to believe Muller is handing him the @c suit on a platter|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was t/o for the black suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok Muller could be a bit stronger..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: but they play rev smith|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|jaapfr: IF knowing 2 clubs and AK K THen we all bid 7@S:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT= even number of keycards|pg||
nt|lc: It's not much fun to be -110 or -130 when you have 1430 available (although, N-S have a good sacrifice against slam).|pg||
nt|hedyg: i was betting on a @s lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: harder to believe he is quickly playing a club from the ace. also he needs much more to be the case to play for club ace on|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he can assume that W has 5 @hs then the small @H was preferential|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but communications?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd way to play the clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: so 9@C= i dont want @s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: 5@c= Q@S?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: takes guts to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they always play that as short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: could not be fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the suit was set |pg||
nt|sybarra: in hearts|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: yes suit is set and that is @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would block suit if someone has A9xx|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: 5@D = yes and K@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the crux of this board is the xx of S in @C during bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh 5@c cue and 5@d cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead gave him his 7th trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had no trick in @H if he had to play the suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: so never show @s fit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: and not a 3 card or 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he got his ruff going now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if club king holds there is still a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Interesting point: Muller could DBL 1 H with the blacks, what's the difference. De Wijs assumed Muller had H too for this sequence|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: which was (a bit) true indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: but here he is just balancing|pg||
nt|hedyg: where as if he doubled earlier he might have a better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: like maximum pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how fortunate that dummy had diamond ace so that the club-spot plays didnt have to show count|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: 5NT asks for Q@s for 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very nice play will be shorter than bidding?|pg||
nt|hedyg: instant claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even with Fantoni declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes even |pg||
nt|hedyg: what is RNC?|pg||
nt|hedyg: both N and S reverse smithed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I like @dJ better than @dQ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: guys unfortunately I have to leave,  business issues over whelming me today (not my orginal plan) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: smith shouldnt take prcedence over count when count is a crucial issue, which it often is|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: Almost a textbook weak-2 here. (or Multi)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: multi it is|pg||
nt|lc: The big weakness of Multi is that with a weak-2 in @S it often allows opponents in with a @H overcall -- but here, South just didn't have enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes pls correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it says 1NT =, it's correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes Bob|pg||
nt|roswolf: well more mixed hand here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile 19 to Welland on 1NX and 6@D making|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: why pass by Brink?|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2@S from W?|pg||
nt|lc: If 2@S was pass/correct, that would seem to be a better choice.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would we all have bid 2@H as W, i would have bid 2@s (positive in @H)|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S = P/C|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh well, we all agree|pg||
nt|lc: So, strange to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|lc: Gives an extra "round" of bidding making it easier for opps to judge.|pg||
nt|pelu: if we all agree - not good :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@HX= takeout of @H|pg||
nt|lc: So important to thoroughly know your agreement against these Multi auctions.|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: not really probably typo, they play optional rkc|pg||
nt|hedyg: there was no play, quick claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: They claimed without play previous game.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: super max for 2@C (11-15 and 6 card suit)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they go on like this we will have a 3rd miracle today and Muller / Fantoni will finish before the other table again!|pg||
nt|jcwla: If they bid this slam against you, get back into bed, pull the covers up around you, and don't come out for 24 hours.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d looks right|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d???|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this a transfer?|pg||
nt|lc: Perhaps they treat the X as a strong notrump, and over interference they play x-fer lebensohl --  that, or a typo.|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange IF the double shows short @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No typos|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lc: This surely tests the partnership agreements.  Even a long-time experienced partnership such as N-S can have trouble with such auctions.|pg||

nt|hedyg: ty specs :)|pg||
nt|lc: Sounds like we'll lose everyone watching.  Who wouldn't want to watch 5@C XX!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all know 5@c XX makes so not really exciting|pg||
nt|pelu: just 11 tricks from the top - and some play for 12 :(|pg||
nt|lc: So, how does 5@CXX compare to the 1430 that was available in 6@H?|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe it is more fun to see if Baldursson-Jonsson will play in a 4-1 fit. :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: much more fun|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3@S making.|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C several poss - here balanced 15+|pg||
nt|sybarra: 12 off the top |pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: this will be a struggle|pg||
nt|hedyg: they open 1@c with 12.14 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d stopped Fantoni bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: super optimist - going for slam opp a passed pd|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d bid not a surprise for Muller|pg||
nt|pelu: but he is correct|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 180 is there hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no @D lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d t/o for @H+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@S= we have take-off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think you have to be a superoptimist with those clubs and those hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah yes sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: forgot the X|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: a small @s lead is needed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then lean back and wait|pg||
nt|lc: 4th from your longest and strongest.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d X*|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: sstruggle for who?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5!X XX = 1000 and 15 imps|pg||
nt|lc: They can run to 4@C -- and not get X, I'd think.|pg||
nt|lc: What if North runs to 4@D, though, thinking 3@D was natural!|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma trying to scare them into 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: last time EW X - they was close to push opp in 5@c (4@c +1) - no danger here for EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hvdhaar: Board 6 got costly for NS indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: did anybody bring coffee?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lc: Are they using screens? (I doubt it for this kind of match) --  it would be nice to know the table action on who is alering what to whom.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: Bob usually shows the alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: not this time though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yes, screens, I'll add the alerts.|pg||
nt|lc: Well, if ever there was an alert, 3@D had to be one.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d did too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan, by ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: defeating Poland in the final|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @d lead as well if you are talking re play last hand Shirley|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: a hopeless struggle for declarer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: nice Q@d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: and even @D lead ok as the losing @D goes on spade   (thx Jeanine, I didnt look carefully) |pg||
nt|hedyg: this will be painful|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Baldursson and Jónsson were in that team, but not as partners|pg||
nt|hedyg: this wont be pretty to watch|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E did bid 2H freely too. even spade king and Axxxxx of hearts gives you good play|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to let E ruff a loser|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice 8@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyyy and within 1 split seconde|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: notice bd 6 in OR same 1@d opening|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 1NT making 2.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni passed over 4@d so he wants another lead|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure De wijs didn't exp singelton @s by pd - thjey have 10 card an never bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: that lead saved a trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@H?|pg||
nt|pelu: Welland in 3NT on the 6-3 fit in @h - making after a @c lead - @s-lead would defeat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it, 3 tricks within 5 seconds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is happening Bob?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: you could ask them nicely to slow down?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma showed either 2 cards in @S or singleton|pg||
nt|lc: We can see that East can throw minors on the @H's -- but -- it won't be clear to him.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was born in 1991,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: have a glass of my excellent Chardonnay :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No, they are thinking very long on a lot of the problems, resulting in play everything very fast to catch up.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|nt|hedyg: lol ty|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: disced an ace|pg||
nt|lc: He is probably thinking : "If @S run, down anyway, so let me make sure not to throw away a minor."|pg||
nt|lc: For example, a @D discard would be disastrous if declarer had @DAKQxx.|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose a @C discard is unlikely to hurt in most layouts.|pg||
nt|pelu: can W signal in "hs that he like the @S-lead?|pg||
nt|lc: Smith echo -- hi-lo in @H would say "Like @S"|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose having a 2nd space could mean liking them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Smith on their CC|pg||
nt|pelu: LH = even - no "smith"|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Baldursson was surely pleased to see a @S discard.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Lavinthal|pg||
nt|pelu: so S sh take another @H and hope that East will disc a @s|pg||
nt|lc: sounds good to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I lost it.|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry N - but same hope :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|pelu: how do u play - @cs can easy be 4-1?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence take their fill of tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S8 ends the story|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhh again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he must have disced another @S|pg||
nt|lc: One @S discard meant 500.  Another would have been 200.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit early here for that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could they miss the obvious 4S? :):)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not yet, but he will be later|pg||

nt|hedyg: ambitious?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: or unlikely @CA:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should be down|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 15.45 is CET, in 3 hours and 50 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes -1 now|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: East has at the most INV strenght or else he would have started with 1 N (GF relay)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lc: In 3NT there appear to be only 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lc: Normal play picks up the @C, of course.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can pick up the J@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c pushed them|pg||
nt|hedyg: after a long think he might play small @c...|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful keeping the J@C as entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: and when that works he is home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good moment for a 1H overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: too late!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lc: Could get interesting in that both E and W have to keep @H guards and can be thrown in.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 10 3NT in OR, no double|pg||
nt|lc: I;'m guessing the only legit way to beat it was to cash 4@D and then exit (but even then, East might be caught in a major-suit sqz).|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: now a @H back|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: doublefinesse in @H? who will switch to @D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will clear the @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc some @ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again it all goes wrong for no reason|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: but would we not all lead @SK against this bidding?|pg||
nt|lc: Here, West has to keep @HKx and East @HJx -- on a double-dummy basis.  So, then they can be tossed in.|pg||
nt|lc: But, declarer is not playing double-dummy. Just work on @H and hope defense doesn't figure out what to do.|pg||
nt|pelu: they cant take 4 @D-tricks now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: yes, then spade ace and jack|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lc: Not easy when declarer has BID @D -- (albeit a nebulous @D) to correctly figure out how to switch to and run 4@D tricks.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lc: They can't even do it anyway.|pg||
nt|hedyg: E unlikely to switch to @D with the Q@d as menace in dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: sorry back all,  business tried to interfer |pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: and best defense again|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but he has also 9 tricks if @cK is on side  |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|pelu: he has to discard on the 5.@h and this plan only work with @S kx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lc: So, a very practical line of play by Jonsson.|pg||
nt|hedyg: wishing he had passed 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: TD announces '25 mins'|pg||
nt|pelu: Jansma has min for his X - but all other bidding almost OK - but unlucky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and we are only halfway!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: TD "sry, 1 hour more"|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 25 mins for 9 boards, joking surely|pg||
nt|hedyg: even that is very tight for 10 boards|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no wonder the others dropped it|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Unusual but true :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Everything so far alerted|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it says it may contain 5@ss in 1st or 2nd|pg||
nt|rhelle: Board 6: The 1@d opening is systematically ok; 1@c is an alternative, of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Hi all, just giving Bob a break|pg||
nt|hedyg: automatic @H lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: weak 2-suited openers are extremely popular in northern europe, but in my view they are theoretically unsound. |pg||
nt|hedyg: she is nv and has what she promised|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually maybe even more|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: in 5@D decl set up @SJ to dicard a !X - and then @C to J|pg||
nt|jcwla: OK let's hear it for the non-forcing 1NT, Marshall. :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||

nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe they have all the points?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, systematically they open 1@h with 55 majors|pg||
nt|rhelle: to keep the relays etc symmetric|pg||
nt|hedyg: Muller putting all his passcards on the tray?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd Marc he needs it :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: A@S on side|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: most experienced Dutch operators having other things this weekend|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this detracking by X of N i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the issue is not whether her hand fits the description. the issue is whether that is a good method|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle: snap!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jonsson should have passed out 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: is 5 cards @s a certainty here?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: no way!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: this wont make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i am wrong|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@D logic contract although down here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT was down as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: as was 3@s X|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that was not a penalty double|pg||
nt|hedyg: denied 4@hs, showed minors imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes bid his 5th @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@d by S and @H?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|hedyg: reallyyyyyyyyy nice to have you here Rob :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT ! is that a dreadful bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: but as the Bermuda Bowl will be in the Netherlands we need more operators then, for them practicing too|pg||
nt|hedyg: he didnt duck that?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok :(|pg||

nt|jcwla: Seemingly suit preference implication to that @C7 at T2.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: 3@C on 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|pelu: better if Fantoni takes @CK also and force pd to play major - block the suit at get the setting trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller had 2 options: 1NT to show @s, and 2@d non-forcing. What is best here?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: minors :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was on|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rhelle: Well given the risk that every suit breaks badly, I think it's very aggressive|pg||
nt|rhelle: especially vul - how happy are you if anyone doubles and it comes back to you?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: South dbl twice, vulnerable, agressive but not unr.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: on bd 11 where Jonsson played 3NT= OR played 2@H +2|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 plans: ruff @SA or find @CJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: wd by Nunes!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Welland and Zia did not match the 6@H on 10 -- so 13 to Netherlands 1.|pg||

nt|jaapfr: Bob playing his own version:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i think a shift was clear. only question whether spades or diamonds, and N card shd be SP|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland just bid 4@H, not 4@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: while Jansma (S) showed his @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st X was balancing, 2nd X showed a good hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 2D better with a stiff heart, closer decision with a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I know...|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 1NT was down|pg||

mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: imps still being "traded" evenly though so no great change in the score gap|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcwla: Is this "don't lead @S"?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2.5 @h from North|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely leaping to 4 @H here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= gf 5+ cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma made a pass out of turn already and has left the table while Nunes is thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = GF 5+@d|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hedyg: lead your partners suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: X and lead 8@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oeff  3nt needs too much:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead will limit a heart contyract|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like it|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: how awful that was|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh it only needed not to lead pds suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT=|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: he was in a hurry  LOL|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i guess you have as many @s stoppers as you bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be messy where ever anyone lands|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 11-15 6+ @cs or 5+@cs and 4 M|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: Bob pls tell us later how NS react about the lead ( if any)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has NO entries to hand outside where pard may have|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H likrly the "better hand" |pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: 2@s is either gf or minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT=?|pg||
nt|hedyg: serious|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma is not back, Nunes passed for him :-)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c was off on a @d lead but impossible for Fantoni to tell|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards he can make, but not sure that he can find|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs correctly saying he can make this but........|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: F asking about lead, answer "asking for count"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: now it is both :p|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lucky 5D here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Muller worried about @hs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should be|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp after the X|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: I don't quite see Nunes as a GF he must have his rosy spectacles on|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told it is an artificial minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: this is how very friendly the atmosphere is over here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10 is gf opposite 14+|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: is Nunes crying yet Bob :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can he make with @hs 3-3?|pg||
nt|pelu: and @SJ in S - close to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with fit|pg||
nt|pelu: remember that 1@S = 14+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT would be 5+ with fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and one more - Jan is back now|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting that the CC says A from AK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: De Wijs could have bid 3@H with force in @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: Is it that lucky? looks like a @d dropping or the @c finesse right|pg||
nt|pelu: need @H lead to defeat 3NT - 4@d+4@s + @cA - |pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: great auction though contract needs luck to make|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: such soft values maybe quite useless|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hedyg: here W has no space to explore so 3NT does not necessarily show great strength in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs less luck now|pg||
nt|rhelle: and with the opening in North (sound openings) that looks pretty likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni seems surprised|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff and play @h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rhelle: looks well within the 35% or so range you need to bid a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting cards ... the low @s indicates on honour|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: not sure how the spade lead means less luck. it didnt tell E anything he didnt already know, and meanwhile it compromises his options|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: he didnt expect the @s fit|pg||
nt|pelu: and 4@s play easy - 4@h need some hard work|pg||
nt|hedyg: we get to see deep Fantunes at work|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry that is Deep Fantoni|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the more I look the less GF I see |pg||
nt|hedyg: this may take a while|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some sort of @S raise |pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 10 hcps, fit and good 6 card side suit and if that isnt enough he has a void as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: good enough for me in 2/1 or any other  |pg||
nt|hedyg: how much more do you need?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly... he has a poor @D suit , poor @H suit and a void, but does have @S support|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid a NF 1NT??????|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: F: "sorry"|pg||
nt|hedyg: (he is always very polite)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am sure he was planning to show the @s fit next when the 2@H bid came along|pg||
nt|sybarra: No peter I would not bid a non forcing nt |pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Welland found a way to play 3@s on bd 10|pg||
nt|pelu: Dont take that serius - just a joke - I find 2@D a fine bid :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry only 2@ss but -3|pg||
nt|pelu: and IMPs back on the next board (the 4@H on 5-1 fit) here Welland i 3@D making|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: close to play a card now as I see it|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: if making 180/ 200 in 3@C - so best for S to pass - and hope|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 11 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: must play @ds 3-3 though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in contrast to weak 2-suited openings, 2-suited opening 2-bids that show a real opener have a lot of merit. the huge difference is that with the former your chances of declaring ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are far less (esp if u dont have spades), and thus you give opponents too much info. when you have a real hand, it is partner who ratres to be able to make most use of the shape ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: info|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but W should follow with @dK on @dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3-3 he can ruff 1 now|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they are 4-2 he is down anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean can ruff a small @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: if @DK then she should have played @D6 1st round no?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or if declarer plays a small and ruffs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N has to calculate how expensive it is if @d are K10 to j642|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: duck it now?  you up for that at table?|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently he is |pg||
nt|rhelle: and the @sJ shows faith - and also how the suit lies|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: moment of truth|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: all eyes on W|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to add injury to insult :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did he reaally played @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: worried @cs dont split|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 50 minutes: Neth 1 vs Iceland. Open Muller/De Wijs vs Magnússon/Haraldsson, closed Baldursson/Jónsson vs Jansma/Paulissen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thinking about not running @D|pg||

pc|h2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: GJP's turn to think, he puts his cards on the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@D and @c again?|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong @h - now in big problem - did he play too fast :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he was playing vs AJ8x in  W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no hesitation! play @dK immediately|pg||
nt|hedyg: grande !|pg||
mc|11|nt|hedyg: @s ruff|pg||

nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: BBB: big bathroom break (two players left)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so they will have to use the small bathroom|pg||

nt|vugraphzgr: Zia's phone going on, Hamman calling|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: going off* rather|pg||
nt|jtr: "Double them Zia"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: that was the signal probably|pg||
mb|5S|nt|odysseus69: sure to do something-depends what double means-|pg||
nt|jtr: "Welland wont stick it anyway"|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine Hamman would want Zia to bid a slam rather than double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Yes but now they might not save|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether Zia and Welland play some form of pass-double inversion|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: They were making some signs that looked like double was not forward going but I am not 100% sure David|pg||
nt|jtr: Perversions they play in abundance|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: deepest tank from Zia I have seen today|pg||
nt|dburn: something of a gamble for Zia to bid on here - true, partner should know what he is doing if he has pulled a "clear warning" double|pg||
nt|jtr: If double is inverted Welland is worth more than 5@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not clear what to do-looks like a guess to me|pg||
nt|jtr: But 6@s might not be a success|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he has pulled an "extra values" double, this is not so clear at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if 5NT were "pick a slam" he might bid that - 6@c could be best|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, on the actual lie it is best by a distance - the opponents can't get a ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: I have the impression that Zia and Welland have not discussed what 5NT is in any auction, let alone this one|pg||
nt|dburn: and even if they kill the spade suit by leading it, the diamond suit will come to the rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for the Dutch to X 6@S or over 6@C 6@H for max -500|pg||
nt|jtr: They ran out of envelopes to write their system on|pg||
nt|chmitty: you have a guess ... @s 33 or Q@d falling|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jtr: Once @cs are 4-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well resolved by Zia|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is it finished?|pg||
nt|jtr: It might be if Welland bids|pg||
nt|dburn: by no means - Welland may consider his spades solid enough to remove to 6@s anywan|pg||
nt|jtr: 6@s is actually much better than 6@c as a contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: according to Michael Rosenberg, double showed a good hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and 150 for honours - but maybe not here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: and both would have known that 5NT would be pick a slam|pg||
nt|jtr: Assuming they find a @s switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Did the right thing  But he may have a nother chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: Or rather, double "should" show a good hand, not clear whether Welland interpreted it as such since he only bid 5S|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|nt|jtr: ah|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: sorry|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@h 14+ f1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: They are overtime|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Now some relay stuff|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: south took a flyer under pressure in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c f1 14+|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: 4@S is likely to be made here so -200 not too bad for Dutch|pg||
nt|hedyg: might not need pressure here|pg||
nt|hedyg: so that was another case of leading the 4card suit..|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok dont pull trump, play @c and let him ruff|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: catching up then|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3@D|pg||

nt|hvdhaar: Shows 4+ Sp, 8+|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: even stronger nice bid 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s by Welland must be intermediate|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Another miracle today, Muller finishing before the other table|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: 2 pass bids missing|pg||
nt|hedyg: on?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but @hK off side so only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right. this one is not as good as the other one though ralf|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: so 1 imp tooo NS here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c trial bid asking for help in @c maybe|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: again??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 2 in a row|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 3-4 card|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Might reach 6 Cl with their system|pg||
nt|hedyg: another bad board for Brink/Drijver...bd 11 they are in 2@s...NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they knew what 3@D shoed :)|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: standard bidding sequence :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: after small @s to W and @d back he is down with a @d ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: or a preempt vs strong @c opening|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S difficult to be bid here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: W relaying|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: West relaying; 3 S is a "weak" relay; 3 H would have been stronger relay|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all 6@H needs is 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d was relay|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: 1@H= @s 9+ may have a longer suit, 1@s relay|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WHY weak realy witha monster?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: you dont have to look it up |pg||
pc|h7|nt|aida_mk_nl: 1@C 12-14 bal or strong 1@D relay 1@H bal 12-14 or strong @H 1@S relay 1NT 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: E is one point less to bid his 4c M|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@h= 12-14 balanced, nothing re @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Aida :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he missed that now|pg||
nt|hedyg: but Q@S = either i have Jack or singleton so playing small 2nd card is correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry she|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if declarer overruff, enter dummy and play @h10 another @s is an upperciút|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can play small to the 10|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|hvdhaar: Doesn't want to go past 3 N with misfit and minimum in East|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|hedyg: Bob?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: a bac @dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad...|pg||
nt|hedyg: blame the 2@s play|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2nd|pg||
mc|6|nt|hedyg: Paulissen desperately keeping N out of hand in @s but has lost a trick that way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy if W plays low on @dQ|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 4S looks a dubious final bid in closed room|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: but the 3@C made it very difficult there in CR|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: here X-p-2@S-3@C-3@S-p-p-p probably|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i only said maybe- just keeping youon your toes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: I believe 2C is gameforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: and does not necessarily show clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then a funny gf:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: maybe it is not gameforcing after a 1D opening|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|d|nt|jtr: They never got to the other side of the envelope for that|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it seems to be forcing to game on everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: it was GF|pg||

nt|odysseus69: ok - 500 only for 13 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: Dutch 2 consisted of Wortel-Schollaardt, playing with 3 different other pairs on 3 different days|pg||
nt|jtr: Certainly North should take the 'blame' for this disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: 2 junior pairs, and today a pair that will play in the women's team at the European championships|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||

nt|pelu: the problem can be that East cant be sure that pd has a 6 card @D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 card @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by W is not penalty, asks pd to bid on|pg||
nt|hedyg: well so much for playing 4@h..|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland bid 4@H with 3 cards over 3@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: and 11pm New Zealand, yes folks I'll be here for another set|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: is it? he passed 1@H so doesnt promise anything but fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: we will be back after a short break|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR @DK and @h8 - N @HA - and Played @CQ ducked 2 x by decl|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: we've seen 83 imps traded evenly in 15 boards so not tight bridge but good all the same|pg||
nt|pelu: this last board cost the sensation :OR are ahead of us now :(:(|pg||
nt|hedyg: useless K@D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: seems he had already bid his hand with X|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: oh :( lost the miracle!|pg||

nt|pelu: we have to do a better job next time, Hedy, :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: but this way we get the specs from the OR !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The commentators were fast, that helped|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes our fault, sorry |pg||
nt|pelu: West has by his X sjown extra values, and Muller has a lot of fine controls - so he is close to 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has also already bid 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - thats pro and contra - |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: take a coin|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that 4NT bid does show interest surely|pg||
nt|pelu: @hA is not the best defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: defending vs 4@d could have been fun|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear, 10 tricks in spades facing  Axxxxx and three small clubs (if spades 2-1 and maybe if not)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hvdhaar: painless to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|hedyg: but Fantoni did not promise anything|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he saw the 3 level double of his pd|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: Welland found a bid over the 1@H opening and then of course hard to stop Zia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very good thing to see was the concentrated tight correct bridge of all (so wd EW:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: wd Fantoni|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: start with @c?|pg||
nt|pelu: or = I can play in 2 suits|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: looks like a @c lead would have worked better here|pg||

nt|odysseus69: either side|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like 1H on that hand in 3rd seat at these colors|pg||
mb|r|nt|marlowepi: not enough for 3H, even though you have three hearts AND the three of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: Zia notices that nobody wants to play the hand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jaapfr: today we saw a few 7hcp and 8 hcp 3rd seat openers but 4hcp is indeed the most psychish one|pg||
nt|jtr: It seems the norm here|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no trump promotion by playing 4th @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|hvdhaar: 1 N game-forcing relay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hedy is this one way drury?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think so|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hvdhaar: Will be hard to guess for De Wijs that East's singleton H is an honor|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: D-lay-out is great for 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob are you sure of that result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yes, Jansma blaimed me for not being surpised|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: looked like he 2 more losers no matter what|pg||
nt|pelu: Are u sure Bob that 2@S was making? looks like down 1?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H and 1@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last session in about 55 minutes. Open room Schollaardt/Wortel vs Zia/Welland, closed Fantunes vs Verbeek/van Zwol|pg||
nt|hedyg: weird|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H=@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say 3 nt looks easier as long as clubs 4/4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will be impressive if they get to slam on 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: but then over 2NT he could have bid something else|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 3@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in Sweden S has a typical hand for Stenberg 2nt after pass|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i am told they do not play drury|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is OK facng 4th suit opener as here (esp red), but facing 3rd seat it can turn a plus into a minus|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hedyg: NT is wrongsided too on a @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and the 9@c is an extra entry to the N hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: this lead kills the @H suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: so 2@c here is 10+ balanced or fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: will have to guess @s|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hvdhaar: Luckily not vulnerable undertricks; west's entry for the hearts is gone|pg||
nt|hedyg: but didnt|pg||
nt|pelu: welland didn't check for the 5-3 fit in @S - just jumped to 3NT (after 1@D - 1@S - 1NT)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4NT = even nr of keycards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course they may haveagreements i dont know aboiut, but with both red aces the choice of 3S seems odd|pg||
nt|hedyg: it seems to be forcing showing the 10+ with fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would seem better to start showing the goodies as early as possible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 2N was slammish and 3S denied shortness?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no alerts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then this auction would make a lot of sense|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: as long it makes sense to them :)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hedyg: 5@c cue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or maybe 4C was serious slam try so S felt 4N was safe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT=18+ 5332 or 6322|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@s denies any red kings now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes really it is a perfecto mesh given no shortness|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni might worry about A@s in S and no A@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told 5@c= cue and asking re Q@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think so. S couldnt bid so much with no major ace|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: ?|pg||

nt|hedyg: 4NT showed and even nr of keycards, said nothing re @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: are u saying N bid keycard?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hvdhaar: TRF Lebensohl (Rubensohl)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2nd time today we have a precision style 2@c with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c means we are missing 1 and half keycards can you cover anything?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hvdhaar: North will act again|pg||
nt|hedyg: no i am saying they bid turbo|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: W could be 5-4 here basically though unlikely with the obvious @H shortage|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s was passed out in the OR|pg||

nt|dburn: the question is really how strong he can be|pg||

nt|jcmax: I think this double should promise decent values. it is not really a balanceing double and the opponents are not necessarily in a fit-auction|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: sure - and West has not necessarily finished bidding, so South could easily have quite a lot more than this|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sT|pc|dT|pc|h8|pg||

pc|hJ|mc|8|nt|henryb:  On the other hand, if West passed in first chair he might well have defended 3@s instead of 2|pg||
