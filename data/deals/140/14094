nt|babs59: that is perfectly acceptable in Australia|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: here our Mixed Teams means having at least one player of either gender in the team|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|babs59: so you have have 3 men and 1 woman, or vice versa|pg||
pc|h9|nt|babs59: however, internationally Mixed Teams means that each partnership must be mixed|pg||
