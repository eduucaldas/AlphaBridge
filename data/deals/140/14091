nt|mwigor: the opening bid by chadwick and the high reward the IMP scale provides for making make bourke's play correct - but -500 wont feel great|pg||

mb|5D|nt|mwigor: i prefer a 1@d overcall to bourke's double on the south cards|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mwigor: 1@d over 1@c should be a good hand because it has no pre-emptive value|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26.aspx|pg||
nt|hoffers: 3NT is the likely contract. However declarer will worry that she needs two entries to North to lead diamonds|pg||
nt|mwigor: these days you rarely get an uncontested auction - and with 2-2 in the Majors partner will do the wrong thing frequently|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Belive it will end 5@H.|pg||
nt|jaheim: prob. yes:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: I always know that u have a good meaning behind ure words. But was unchure by ure comment at @S 7. I was blind fore shure.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lets check any competition available for EW|pg||

mb|1C|an|15+ hcp any shape|nt|fabsayc: some would open 1s some 1d, i think was good enough for 1d|pg||

nt|bebechira: weak NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: THEN URE ON URE road go give them now mama:)|pg||
nt|jane22: they discovered most of it on the net from Fantoni - Nunes (Italian Team)|pg||
nt|kfay: No need to worry, partner will come to the rescue.|pg||
nt|kfay: But i doubt that E will sell out to 4@s, Hamdi.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: It's hard to say how much N should bid in this position.|pg||
nt|kfay: They can be almost certain that E/W have a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 1@d or 1@h would be a question in post-mortem|pg||
mb|1D|an|0-8hcp|nt|bebechira: wow.... fantunes is a good syystem'|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see if they stay out og game here|pg||
nt|jane22: All 1-openings forcing, 2-openings 10-13|pg||
nt|kfay: But no spade honors must be a bit disconcerting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: We apologise that the N-S team name is incorrect. The proper name is Chinese Taipei. We can't correct it at this point, but we will get it right for future matches|pg||
nt|kfay: I think it's very popular these days to respond 1@h and bypass a long diamond suit unless you have a game forcing hand, or a hand that's basically only worth one call.  |pg||
nt|hoffers: Can make 6S, but only because clubs are 33|pg||
mb|2C|an|GF|nt|rodal f: Any to fight for there parscore at level 4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non will be able to X.|pg||
nt|jaheim: close to 5 @C|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs cl 2-1, and a friendliy @D lay|pg||
nt|kfay: W in there with 5@h may get East too excited.|pg||
nt|mwigor: with @c 3-3 and trumps 2-2 can make 12 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: only a low spade lead and a diamond return beats 5clubs|pg||
mb|2D|an|2-4 points|nt|nickf: I was juect checking but I suppose 3D confirms NS are playing a strong lcub system|pg||
nt|jaheim: 3 @D prob. showning @C and @D|pg||
nt|kfay: I bet he'll take the push.|pg||
nt|kfay: S had better double to prevent a sacrifice.|pg||
nt|kfay: Which N would certainly take after this bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: undo|pg||
nt|jane22: we would probably all bid game?|pg||
mb|2H|an|relay|nt|nickf: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|nickf: welcome to Barbara Travis, many times Aust international player|pg||
nt|bg: I just agre3d to play another match sry|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the 4@C it seems as 2@C was game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 2/1 in a strange way:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't even try @DK as lead now|pg||
nt|kfay: Whether or not the double explicitly asks for a @c lead after this auction is a quesiton, I believe that it should not be so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: probably yes|pg||
mb|2N|an|no 5 card suit|nt|rodal f: Hi Bruce:) Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|jane22: no need to go 2 off; could save a bit here|pg||
nt|kfay: Although I'm sure there are some who would disagree with me.  But generally after preemptive auctions a seemingly out-of-the blue double may be interpreted as 'lightner' requesting ...|pg||
nt|kfay: an unusual lead.  Here, though, I believe partner can reasonably take it as 'please don't sacrifice, partner!!'|pg||
nt|kfay: Best defense will set this 2, but that won't be found I'm quite confident.|pg||
nt|kfay: N is probably debating between a trump lead and a @c.  The opponents are quite likely to be prepared in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say South in with @c A, easy to switch @d? perhaps that's the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||
nt|nickf: they do play Modified Precision|pg||
nt|nickf: here's their card : http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/ConventionCards/Senior/Indonesia/Hartono-Sawirudin.aspx|pg||

mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: or at least you can have that understanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jane22: do CT play precision?|pg||

nt|bebechira: to be honest...i do not know|pg||
nt|kfay: with 3 cards in the majors and a vulnerable opening on their right, W must feel that preemption is indicated.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: but I can tell you that NS play Fantunes|pg||
nt|jane22: nice lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes'|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|rodal f: No tempo given so fare.|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@d after a 1@c opener and 2@c after a 1@d opener are both highly effective preempts.|pg||
nt|kfay: Possibly the most destructive calls in the game.|pg||
nt|kfay: Takeout doubles by partner are extremely difficult to interpret.  Everyone plays them as takeout, but do they promise both majors?  Focus on spades?|pg||
nt|mwigor: only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|hoffers: Many now play that a jump shift in other suit of same rank shows a good raise, leaving a double raise as preemptive|pg||

pc|c9|nt|rodal f: How to find 8 tr here??? OK Im blind|pg||

nt|bebechira: yes... that is 3 imps to Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|davidstern: So a little light here provided West switches to club on winning diamond|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2h was not even forcing, so as far as i am concern the rest is impossible|pg||

nt|rodal f: By open card slam are on. But I hope not will be bidded.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thus, the opponent likely ends up blaming himself for not taking advantage of the opportunity presented, even though to do so would have been irrational|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The benefit of the Grosvenor gambit is supposed to come on future hands, due to a loss of concentration by the player who was taken in by the gambit.|pg||
