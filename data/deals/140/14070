nt|h_karluk: @s fit not revealed,perhaps South recognized no need to inquiry with a balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not keen on souths pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Need to be by a limited hand. Never seen that type of opening.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: but if you have enough tools might end up playing 2c doubled|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 2d with klingers hand, against weak no trump you have to get in when you can|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|kfay: I can't attest to their personal abilities, but I've played against Miura-Kido in the Open room and they are very very good.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: 1 @H from E again?|pg||
nt|jane22: hello - it's not often players have a commentary by their mother|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: I always know that u have a good meaning behind ure words. But was unchure by ure comment at @S 7. I was blind fore shure.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lets check any competition available for EW|pg||
nt|kfay: Matchpointers might be tempted to overcall 1@s with the south hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: some would open 1s some 1d, i think was good enough for 1d|pg||
nt|bebechira: feel free to give us an insight into their system|pg||
nt|bebechira: that's wonderful|pg||
nt|bebechira: weak NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: THEN URE ON URE road go give them now mama:)|pg||
nt|jane22: they discovered most of it on the net from Fantoni - Nunes (Italian Team)|pg||
nt|kfay: No need to worry, partner will come to the rescue.|pg||
nt|kfay: But i doubt that E will sell out to 4@s, Hamdi.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kfay: It's hard to say how much N should bid in this position.|pg||
nt|kfay: They can be almost certain that E/W have a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 1@d or 1@h would be a question in post-mortem|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: wow.... fantunes is a good syystem'|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see if they stay out og game here|pg||
nt|jane22: All 1-openings forcing, 2-openings 10-13|pg||
nt|kfay: But no spade honors must be a bit disconcerting.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: We apologise that the N-S team name is incorrect. The proper name is Chinese Taipei. We can't correct it at this point, but we will get it right for future matches|pg||
nt|kfay: I think it's very popular these days to respond 1@h and bypass a long diamond suit unless you have a game forcing hand, or a hand that's basically only worth one call.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Any to fight for there parscore at level 4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non will be able to X.|pg||
nt|jaheim: close to 5 @C|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs cl 2-1, and a friendliy @D lay|pg||
nt|kfay: W in there with 5@h may get East too excited.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: only a low spade lead and a diamond return beats 5clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I was juect checking but I suppose 3D confirms NS are playing a strong lcub system|pg||
nt|jaheim: 3 @D prob. showning @C and @D|pg||
nt|kfay: I bet he'll take the push.|pg||
nt|kfay: S had better double to prevent a sacrifice.|pg||
nt|kfay: Which N would certainly take after this bidding.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bebechira: undo|pg||
nt|jane22: we would probably all bid game?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nickf: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|nickf: welcome to Barbara Travis, many times Aust international player|pg||
nt|bg: I just agre3d to play another match sry|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the 4@C it seems as 2@C was game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 2/1 in a strange way:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't even try @DK as lead now|pg||
nt|kfay: Whether or not the double explicitly asks for a @c lead after this auction is a quesiton, I believe that it should not be so.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bebechira: probably yes|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Bruce:) Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|jane22: no need to go 2 off; could save a bit here|pg||
nt|kfay: Although I'm sure there are some who would disagree with me.  But generally after preemptive auctions a seemingly out-of-the blue double may be interpreted as 'lightner' requesting ...|pg||
nt|kfay: an unusual lead.  Here, though, I believe partner can reasonably take it as 'please don't sacrifice, partner!!'|pg||
nt|kfay: Best defense will set this 2, but that won't be found I'm quite confident.|pg||
nt|kfay: N is probably debating between a trump lead and a @c.  The opponents are quite likely to be prepared in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say South in with @c A, easy to switch @d? perhaps that's the question|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||
nt|nickf: they do play Modified Precision|pg||

pc|s5|nt|bebechira: 3 more imps to the brothers :)|pg||

nt|kfay: small number gathered defending in @s.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|nickf: although 3S would be be easier, perhaps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kfay: But W has no aces, and no extra heart length.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@s off one, 6@h also down..would be a nice theme for team coaches|pg||
nt|kfay: Gotoda was put under a lot of pressure to act after the 3@s bid so could be quite light.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|bebechira: he has to guess the clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kfay: Initially W might not suspect this, due to their own shortness in spades, but when S shows support it's likely that E has 2 @s at the most so felt they were also short and the onus ...|pg||
nt|kfay: was on them to bid game.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|bebechira: 11 more IMPS possible now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: If @C 3-3?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
nt|kfay: No blame to E, who probably suspects that they may be missing grand on this hand if partner has the @cA.  But this is why preempts were invented.|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Apartplay at 2@S?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d a tad ambitious overcall|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: or at least you can have that understanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jane22: do CT play precision?|pg||
nt|kfay: Certainly the choice is between 1@d and 2@d, Hamdi.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to believe it's worked, blocked @s fit of NS|pg||
mb|3C|nt|babs59: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: if 2spades showed spades and a minor east could guess trumps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: hi babs|pg||
nt|nickf: hi barb|pg||
nt|bebechira: to be honest...i do not know|pg||
nt|kfay: with 3 cards in the majors and a vulnerable opening on their right, W must feel that preemption is indicated.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: but I can tell you that NS play Fantunes|pg||
nt|jane22: nice lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes'|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|rodal f: No tempo given so fare.|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@d after a 1@c opener and 2@c after a 1@d opener are both highly effective preempts.|pg||
nt|kfay: Possibly the most destructive calls in the game.|pg||
nt|kfay: Takeout doubles by partner are extremely difficult to interpret.  Everyone plays them as takeout, but do they promise both majors?  Focus on spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: These are issues that partnerships must address.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jaheim: he did  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: E had for the 1NT but max 2@S. Any for pass at 2@S?|pg||
nt|jane22: reverse att & count|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 8 quick tricks now :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be 7|pg||
nt|kfay: It is entirely different than the auction 1@c-(1@d)- where double promises 4-4 in the majors, playing standard methods.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: How to find 8 tr here??? OK Im blind|pg||
nt|bebechira: how did they go 2 off in the open room?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|jane22: 1 off seems obvious|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... that is 3 imps to Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|c5|nt|kfay: At the higher level, you would be overloading the double too much to enforce that requirement.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ritong: have fun, guys|pg||
nt|kfay: An interesting result on board 5, where Mok's 1NT-3NT bid with 4=3=3=3 shape won a gameswing against 4@s in their 4-4 fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: admittedly the face he still had the spade entry gave different options|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|babs59: space saving |pg||

nt|rodal f: Nice music u served. U2:)|pg||
nt|pinkrobin: :):)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|babs59: I've had people suggest I play it, but I'm more into having consistency of bids - 2NT works fine for me, and also denies the opponents the opportunity to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: much better to allow opener to show his shape with some scheme|pg||
nt|kfay: I agree with the double by Mok.  Probably some would wonder why that might be the decision with a 5-card major.  There are several factors to consider|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kfay: 1) partner is a passed hand and you have minimal values so you just want to find your best fit if you're going to compete|pg||
nt|kfay: 2) your @s suit is much more stacked than your @h suit|pg||
nt|kfay: the biggest downside is if partner bids @c, but you don't rate to compete very much in the lowest suit anyway.  Hopefully the opponents will come to your rescue by outbidding you.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jaheim: @C  the best lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kfay: And if not... unless you're doubled it's only 50 a trick.|pg||
nt|kfay: Redouble is an interesting choice by W.  There is so much to talk about on these hands!!!|pg||
nt|kfay: I dislike it.  He has no real interest in defending against any suit by the opponents save @c, which I guarantee they will never bid when looking at that suit.|pg||
nt|kfay: But if their partnership has no other way to show these values unless starting with redouble, I suppose there's nothing to be done.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|robinswr: club is best lead for defense to make 3nt declarer has to guess the jack of spades |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: How to go down in 6@S if @S is 1-2 or 2-1?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Sr. And @H hook was on|pg||
nt|kfay: This looks like a matchpoint auction!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kfay: S was probably considering and expert 2@h over 2@d, offering partner the choice to play in either contract and suggesting 4-5 shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c in vul may hard to find a parking place for 3rd @s to @c lead|pg||
nt|kfay: E was probably considering bidding 2N over 2@s, suggesting that the partership may well belong in @d rather than @c.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: they could play to cut a @s ruff by table|pg||

pc|c7|nt|bebechira: 2 boards to play here.... open room finished|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kfay: The bidding here suggest to me that the double was, in fact, penalty.  Since if Tham were showing some spot to play and 2@c inquired, N would now bid something.|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: So it happens to make today.... that is just bridge|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|varange: yep, might even hit a flush on the flop|pg||

nt|kfay: a play by an opponent that gives you the contract... but then you give it right back because you would never believe them capable of it|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Thus, the opponent likely ends up blaming himself for not taking advantage of the opportunity presented, even though to do so would have been irrational|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The benefit of the Grosvenor gambit is supposed to come on future hands, due to a loss of concentration by the player who was taken in by the gambit.|pg||
