mb|2H|nt|Walddk5: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26.aspx|pg||
nt|hoffers: 3NT is the likely contract. However declarer will worry that she needs two entries to North to lead diamonds|pg||

nt|andyv:  2@c followed by 3@c and then 4@s I think would have done it|pg||

nt|kfay: But i doubt that E will sell out to 4@s, Hamdi.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: It's hard to say how much N should bid in this position.|pg||
nt|kfay: They can be almost certain that E/W have a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 1@d or 1@h would be a question in post-mortem|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bebechira: wow.... fantunes is a good syystem'|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see if they stay out og game here|pg||
nt|jane22: All 1-openings forcing, 2-openings 10-13|pg||
nt|kfay: But no spade honors must be a bit disconcerting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: We apologise that the N-S team name is incorrect. The proper name is Chinese Taipei. We can't correct it at this point, but we will get it right for future matches|pg||
nt|kfay: I think it's very popular these days to respond 1@h and bypass a long diamond suit unless you have a game forcing hand, or a hand that's basically only worth one call.  |pg||
nt|hoffers: Can make 6S, but only because clubs are 33|pg||

nt|rodal f: So 2/1 in a strange way:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't even try @DK as lead now|pg||
nt|kfay: Whether or not the double explicitly asks for a @c lead after this auction is a quesiton, I believe that it should not be so.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bebechira: probably yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Hi Bruce:) Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|jane22: no need to go 2 off; could save a bit here|pg||
nt|kfay: Although I'm sure there are some who would disagree with me.  But generally after preemptive auctions a seemingly out-of-the blue double may be interpreted as 'lightner' requesting ...|pg||
nt|kfay: an unusual lead.  Here, though, I believe partner can reasonably take it as 'please don't sacrifice, partner!!'|pg||
nt|kfay: Best defense will set this 2, but that won't be found I'm quite confident.|pg||
nt|kfay: N is probably debating between a trump lead and a @c.  The opponents are quite likely to be prepared in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say South in with @c A, easy to switch @d? perhaps that's the question|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: or at least you can have that understanding|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jane22: do CT play precision?|pg||
nt|kfay: Certainly the choice is between 1@d and 2@d, Hamdi.|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi babs|pg||
nt|nickf: hi barb|pg||
nt|bebechira: to be honest...i do not know|pg||
nt|kfay: with 3 cards in the majors and a vulnerable opening on their right, W must feel that preemption is indicated.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bebechira: but I can tell you that NS play Fantunes|pg||
nt|jane22: nice lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes'|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: No tempo given so fare.|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@d after a 1@c opener and 2@c after a 1@d opener are both highly effective preempts.|pg||
nt|kfay: Possibly the most destructive calls in the game.|pg||
nt|kfay: Takeout doubles by partner are extremely difficult to interpret.  Everyone plays them as takeout, but do they promise both majors?  Focus on spades?|pg||
nt|mwigor: only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|hoffers: Many now play that a jump shift in other suit of same rank shows a good raise, leaving a double raise as preemptive|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kfay: These are issues that partnerships must address.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaheim: he did  :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||

pc|h2|nt|bebechira: 8 quick tricks now :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be 7|pg||

nt|rodal f: A read color.|pg||

nt|ritong: welcome to michael robinson  from australia|pg||
nt|robinswr: play a diamond to hand lead a trump then run the trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: south would be squeezed in the black suits|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Might a premium for bad bridge at the top of an ....    FORGET THE LAST BOARD:(|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: right but if you run the diamonds sometimes u learn enough to change the odds|pg||
nt|pinkrobin: thank you henry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far 3@h/@s for NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: have fun, guys|pg||
nt|kfay: An interesting result on board 5, where Mok's 1NT-3NT bid with 4=3=3=3 shape won a gameswing against 4@s in their 4-4 fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: admittedly the face he still had the spade entry gave different options|pg||
nt|babs59: fact*|pg||
nt|babs59: 2@S must be their Jacoby over 1@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Michael:) Nice to see u and enjoy.|pg||
nt|pinkrobin: tks u2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Inv min?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|babs59: space saving |pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: anderson has an awkward decision|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|fabsayc: but if partner can rebid 4h then you have lost the space back|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice music u served. U2:)|pg||
nt|pinkrobin: :):)|pg||
nt|mwigor: doesnt really want to play for penalties with five low trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: I've had people suggest I play it, but I'm more into having consistency of bids - 2NT works fine for me, and also denies the opponents the opportunity to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: much better to allow opener to show his shape with some scheme|pg||
nt|kfay: I agree with the double by Mok.  Probably some would wonder why that might be the decision with a 5-card major.  There are several factors to consider|pg||
nt|mwigor: but doesnt have a 4 card suit and his side is at the 3-level|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kfay: 1) partner is a passed hand and you have minimal values so you just want to find your best fit if you're going to compete|pg||
nt|kfay: 2) your @s suit is much more stacked than your @h suit|pg||
nt|kfay: the biggest downside is if partner bids @c, but you don't rate to compete very much in the lowest suit anyway.  Hopefully the opponents will come to your rescue by outbidding you.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: here pass was possibly the winning action but partner had an unusually good hand defensively|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jaheim: @C  the best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: And if not... unless you're doubled it's only 50 a trick.|pg||
nt|kfay: Redouble is an interesting choice by W.  There is so much to talk about on these hands!!!|pg||
nt|kfay: I dislike it.  He has no real interest in defending against any suit by the opponents save @c, which I guarantee they will never bid when looking at that suit.|pg||
nt|kfay: But if their partnership has no other way to show these values unless starting with redouble, I suppose there's nothing to be done.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|robinswr: club is best lead for defense to make 3nt declarer has to guess the jack of spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: How to go down in 6@S if @S is 1-2 or 2-1?|pg||
nt|hoffers: Bourke will be hoping this is final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sr. And @H hook was on|pg||
nt|kfay: This looks like a matchpoint auction!|pg||
nt|mwigor: i like the way smolanko has bid his hand - 3@h cant really be more than a 4 card suit having bid 3@c the previous round|pg||
nt|hoffers: This will go off before Smolanko gets in|pg||
nt|mwigor: although maybe 2NT was scramble not lebensohl|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kfay: S was probably considering and expert 2@h over 2@d, offering partner the choice to play in either contract and suggesting 4-5 shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c in vul may hard to find a parking place for 3rd @s to @c lead|pg||
nt|kfay: E was probably considering bidding 2N over 2@s, suggesting that the partership may well belong in @d rather than @c.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: they could play to cut a @s ruff by table|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: note on these hand if the only issue is hearts you should play ace first, since can only handle one 4-0 break|pg||

nt|bebechira: the VG coordinator changed the contry name into the correct one and now we will have the results input manually|pg||

pc|s6|nt|bebechira: 2 boards to play here.... open room finished|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kfay: The bidding here suggest to me that the double was, in fact, penalty.  Since if Tham were showing some spot to play and 2@c inquired, N would now bid something.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kfay: But Here it seems that S has just run from the scary prospect of giving up -180 + 200 for any overtricks.|pg||

nt|babs59: really - I have yet to experience that|pg||
nt|babs59: my opponents usually rebid 1@S (with 4) or 1NT|pg||
nt|nickf: yes, some play skipping the transfer to rebid 1NT shows 18-19|pg||

nt|h_karluk: GOTODA Shunsuke new in the field|pg||
nt|kfay: a play by an opponent that gives you the contract... but then you give it right back because you would never believe them capable of it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: A Grosvenor gambit or Grosvenor Coup is a psychological play, in which the opponent is purposely given the chance to gain one or more tricks, and often even to make the contract, ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but to do so he must play for his opponents to have acted illogically or incorrectly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1nt for me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)Will try to do my best by the help from ure nice specs.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our matches in round 6 (in about 1 hour and 20 minutes) will be Chinese Taipei v Singapore (open) and Australia v Japan (women)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: that heart suit is sick|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but apparently he is showing it with 2@D|pg||
nt|hoffers: 2C - 3H (max) - 4H|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: richman hand worth 4h now, has to have some play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would assume klinger has shown about what he has|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW was at the edge and prefered a win at IMP  bythe long term. WD:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: reluctant passes by both Skippers|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now richman is having fantasies|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h was not even forcing, so as far as i am concern the rest is impossible|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: he needs two aces and heart king for slam, i can not imagine klinger would pass that|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: undo operator|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you missed a pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: By open card slam are on. But I hope not will be bidded.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thus, the opponent likely ends up blaming himself for not taking advantage of the opportunity presented, even though to do so would have been irrational|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The benefit of the Grosvenor gambit is supposed to come on future hands, due to a loss of concentration by the player who was taken in by the gambit.|pg||
nt|kfay: N'S should be careful to make sure that after the 4th @h, N is on lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|kfay: Tham got things started on the right track by leading back a 4th best @h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: auction was partly corrected to right final contract|pg||
nt|kfay: giving Mok a count on the suit and allowing for a @c through|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pinkrobin: surprised Terry didn't play a low @c there|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|rodal f: Many variants to talk abough by what I said. S still + at the lenght. Next board. |pg||
nt|mwigor: declarer needs to sneak a @s trick on the hand - not unreasonable to take the @h finesse|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: The gambit was named after Philip Grosvenor, a fictional character in a short story by Frederick B. Turner published in The Bridge World[1], who first discovered the gambit ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: accidentally, and over time developed its theory and deployed it deliberately. |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The story depicts Grosvenor as often frustrated by opponents who are too obtuse to fall for his ruse. Grosvenor's lifeless body is eventually found bludgeoned to death, his fingers ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: broken, shortly after a bridge tournament in which he used his gambit against the wrong opponents.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Push|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: they will survive this adventure|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: A subsequent article by Kit Woolsey in The Bridge World, titled The Grosvenor Gamble, extends the original idea, farcically expounded in the 1973 story, to possible at-the-table ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: applications.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|mwigor: actually the @d blockage creates an added complication|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah,still bizarre but makes a bit more sense|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|hoffers: The blockage was self inflicted, allowing Havas to make if she had played fro SA on side|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|mwigor: still down one though|pg||
nt|mwigor: could have been down two if EW hadnt blocked @d|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kfay: The article as described by Hamdi may sound grotesque... but in fact it's very light-hearted, and meant to be comical.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2c by south??|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: In 3rd seat the S hand is a mandatory opener in modern bridge, for those who may think it doesn't mesh with Tham-Mok's generally cautious MO|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: 2@S can't be revers as we see it. By me it would have been.|pg||
