nt|rodal f: So tells @S?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i prefer a 1@d overcall to bourke's double on the south cards|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|mwigor: 1@d over 1@c should be a good hand because it has no pre-emptive value|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26.aspx|pg||
nt|hoffers: 3NT is the likely contract. However declarer will worry that she needs two entries to North to lead diamonds|pg||
nt|mwigor: these days you rarely get an uncontested auction - and with 2-2 in the Majors partner will do the wrong thing frequently|pg||

nt|hoffers: Well played, but a likely loss of 10imps|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jaheim: 1 @H from E again?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: seems easy 4@s for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I always know that u have a good meaning behind ure words. But was unchure by ure comment at @S 7. I was blind fore shure.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lets check any competition available for EW|pg||
nt|kfay: Matchpointers might be tempted to overcall 1@s with the south hand.|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|fabsayc: some would open 1s some 1d, i think was good enough for 1d|pg||
nt|bebechira: feel free to give us an insight into their system|pg||
nt|bebechira: that's wonderful|pg||
nt|bebechira: weak NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: THEN URE ON URE road go give them now mama:)|pg||
nt|jane22: they discovered most of it on the net from Fantoni - Nunes (Italian Team)|pg||
nt|kfay: No need to worry, partner will come to the rescue.|pg||
nt|kfay: But i doubt that E will sell out to 4@s, Hamdi.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: It's hard to say how much N should bid in this position.|pg||
nt|kfay: They can be almost certain that E/W have a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 1@d or 1@h would be a question in post-mortem|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|bebechira: wow.... fantunes is a good syystem'|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see if they stay out og game here|pg||
nt|jane22: All 1-openings forcing, 2-openings 10-13|pg||
nt|kfay: But no spade honors must be a bit disconcerting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: We apologise that the N-S team name is incorrect. The proper name is Chinese Taipei. We can't correct it at this point, but we will get it right for future matches|pg||
nt|kfay: I think it's very popular these days to respond 1@h and bypass a long diamond suit unless you have a game forcing hand, or a hand that's basically only worth one call.  |pg||
nt|hoffers: Can make 6S, but only because clubs are 33|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Any to fight for there parscore at level 4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non will be able to X.|pg||
nt|jaheim: close to 5 @C|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs cl 2-1, and a friendliy @D lay|pg||
nt|kfay: W in there with 5@h may get East too excited.|pg||
nt|mwigor: with @c 3-3 and trumps 2-2 can make 12 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: only a low spade lead and a diamond return beats 5clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nickf: I was juect checking but I suppose 3D confirms NS are playing a strong lcub system|pg||
nt|jaheim: 3 @D prob. showning @C and @D|pg||
nt|kfay: I bet he'll take the push.|pg||
nt|kfay: S had better double to prevent a sacrifice.|pg||
nt|kfay: Which N would certainly take after this bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: undo|pg||
nt|jane22: we would probably all bid game?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nickf: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|nickf: welcome to Barbara Travis, many times Aust international player|pg||
nt|bg: I just agre3d to play another match sry|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the 4@C it seems as 2@C was game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 2/1 in a strange way:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't even try @DK as lead now|pg||
nt|kfay: Whether or not the double explicitly asks for a @c lead after this auction is a quesiton, I believe that it should not be so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: probably yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Bruce:) Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|jane22: no need to go 2 off; could save a bit here|pg||
nt|kfay: Although I'm sure there are some who would disagree with me.  But generally after preemptive auctions a seemingly out-of-the blue double may be interpreted as 'lightner' requesting ...|pg||
nt|kfay: an unusual lead.  Here, though, I believe partner can reasonably take it as 'please don't sacrifice, partner!!'|pg||
nt|kfay: Best defense will set this 2, but that won't be found I'm quite confident.|pg||
nt|kfay: N is probably debating between a trump lead and a @c.  The opponents are quite likely to be prepared in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say South in with @c A, easy to switch @d? perhaps that's the question|pg||

nt|nickf: here's their card : http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/ConventionCards/Senior/Indonesia/Hartono-Sawirudin.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Then -1|pg||
nt|kfay: High-level competition is the most difficult area to judge in Bridge.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bebechira: 3 more imps to the brothers :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: ok makes some sense in precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in precision 3d is 55 invite|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nickf: well they managed to stop on the button|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaheim: yes, an elimination and endplay |pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 4d in context is this hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance to make it now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kfay: Here, I think that Handa made the biggest mistake of bidding 5@h over 4@s.  I'm sure that the colors were attractive for such an action, not wanting to give up on 650 against a ...|pg||
nt|kfay: small number gathered defending in @s.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|nickf: although 3S would be be easier, perhaps|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kfay: But W has no aces, and no extra heart length.|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah what an opportunity to commentate with Brother and Sister in Law playing - hi all|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: 5@s off one, 6@h also down..would be a nice theme for team coaches|pg||
nt|kfay: Gotoda was put under a lot of pressure to act after the 3@s bid so could be quite light.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bebechira: he has to guess the clubs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|kfay: Initially W might not suspect this, due to their own shortness in spades, but when S shows support it's likely that E has 2 @s at the most so felt they were also short and the onus ...|pg||
nt|kfay: was on them to bid game.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bebechira: 11 more IMPS possible now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @C 3-3?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
nt|kfay: No blame to E, who probably suspects that they may be missing grand on this hand if partner has the @cA.  But this is why preempts were invented.|pg||

nt|bebechira: 2 imps ..sorry|pg||
nt|davidstern: Major suit partscore by E/W here likely|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in precision 4d is definitely not forcing and does show the shape|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|nt|rodal f: Apartplay at 2@S?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d a tad ambitious overcall|pg||
nt|mwigor: 3@c presumably some sort of @d raise|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|fabsayc: or at least you can have that understanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jane22: do CT play precision?|pg||
nt|kfay: Certainly the choice is between 1@d and 2@d, Hamdi.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to believe it's worked, blocked @s fit of NS|pg||
nt|hoffers: This is a criss-cross raise in diamonds|pg||
mb|2H|nt|babs59: hi everyone|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indonesia running 4th and New Zealand 8th before this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: if 2spades showed spades and a minor east could guess trumps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: hi babs|pg||
nt|nickf: hi barb|pg||
nt|bebechira: to be honest...i do not know|pg||
nt|kfay: with 3 cards in the majors and a vulnerable opening on their right, W must feel that preemption is indicated.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: but I can tell you that NS play Fantunes|pg||
nt|jane22: nice lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes'|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rodal f: No tempo given so fare.|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@d after a 1@c opener and 2@c after a 1@d opener are both highly effective preempts.|pg||
nt|kfay: Possibly the most destructive calls in the game.|pg||
nt|kfay: Takeout doubles by partner are extremely difficult to interpret.  Everyone plays them as takeout, but do they promise both majors?  Focus on spades?|pg||
nt|mwigor: only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|hoffers: Many now play that a jump shift in other suit of same rank shows a good raise, leaving a double raise as preemptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: These are issues that partnerships must address.|pg||
mb|6N|nt|jaheim: he did  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: E had for the 1NT but max 2@S. Any for pass at 2@S?|pg||
nt|jane22: reverse att & count|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 8 quick tricks now :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be 7|pg||
nt|kfay: It is entirely different than the auction 1@c-(1@d)- where double promises 4-4 in the majors, playing standard methods.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: How to find 8 tr here??? OK Im blind|pg||
nt|bebechira: how did they go 2 off in the open room?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Possibility of going down if Viv mispicks both majors|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|jane22: 1 off seems obvious|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... that is 3 imps to Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|kfay: At the higher level, you would be overloading the double too much to enforce that requirement.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: back|pg||
nt|davidstern: SO that pick will go ok|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: A read color.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kfay: Most play that it generally promises 2 places to play, if you can't tolerate whichever major partner may respond in, then you can fall back on supporting partner's minor.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|babs59: these heart spots work nicely for Bob Richman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no good defense,|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still is probably best to discard|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hoffers: Can afford to lead ST and duck, trying for 33, before playing on clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|c3|nt|bebechira: Chinese Taipei on the board with 6 imps on brd 29|pg||

nt|kfay: In my opinion with 6 spades, 4 @hs, and short diamonds, Tham should have doubled.|pg||
nt|kfay: But system may have prohibited that. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Turn the hand by NS and u get.......|pg||
nt|kfay: Many European players get around the problem faced on the last hand by playing negative free bids, where the a direct 2@s by Tham in the last sequence would have been non-forcing.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playable slam|pg||
mb|1D|an| |mb|p|nt|bebechira: can be trouble here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|robinswr: this will not be the dummy of his dreams|pg||

nt|jane22: dont think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: i see...|pg||
nt|bebechira: S does not have a bid then|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W probably play inverted minors, hence the 1NT response.  And Tham now regrets again not coming into the auction with @s.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: 3H complicates matters|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i can force with reverse i would, otherwise 3nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT will run home normaly.|pg||
nt|jane22: I could be quite wrong - I'm not very familiar with their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
nt|jane22: that's take-out, & North will pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: But Yu have a 50% choice if @C 3-3 or and @S 3-3|pg||
nt|bebechira: interesting contract if North passes|pg||
nt|bebechira: you are right Rodal..... 2s not such a bad spot|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT from S+ Some undos here?|pg||

nt|vugraphzks: no|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|robinswr: ?????|pg||
nt|bebechira: N in the tank?|pg||
nt|kfay: This is another common auction where many players aren't sure of their methods.|pg||
nt|mwigor: that looks like an overbid by smolanko - partner neednt even have 3@s for his 2@s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: U ment @H I belive:)|pg||
nt|robinswr: i can see no reason why you wouldn't take 4spades doubled|pg||
nt|mwigor: X should probably show a hand that is only 55 and wants to act again|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nickf: Australia 13-4 after 4 boards|pg||
nt|babs59: I would have thought a reverse was forcing |pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: perhaps they have some other agreement|pg||
nt|jane22: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: auction is correct folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: Chinese Taipei in recovery mode...more IMPS coming up|pg||
nt|rodal f: May I ask Jane.|pg||
nt|jane22: sure|pg||
nt|mwigor: cant really be penalties when you've bid Michaels|pg||
nt|hoffers: However the 4H by N makes 4S a two way bid (a good save, or a make)|pg||
nt|mwigor: anderson wouldve bid 4@s on his hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: X just gives you more ways to win|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|c4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

mb|p|nt|babs59: space saving |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mwigor: anderson has an awkward decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but if partner can rebid 4h then you have lost the space back|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice music u served. U2:)|pg||
nt|pinkrobin: :):)|pg||
nt|mwigor: doesnt really want to play for penalties with five low trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: I've had people suggest I play it, but I'm more into having consistency of bids - 2NT works fine for me, and also denies the opponents the opportunity to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: much better to allow opener to show his shape with some scheme|pg||
nt|kfay: I agree with the double by Mok.  Probably some would wonder why that might be the decision with a 5-card major.  There are several factors to consider|pg||
nt|mwigor: but doesnt have a 4 card suit and his side is at the 3-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: 1) partner is a passed hand and you have minimal values so you just want to find your best fit if you're going to compete|pg||
nt|kfay: 2) your @s suit is much more stacked than your @h suit|pg||
nt|kfay: the biggest downside is if partner bids @c, but you don't rate to compete very much in the lowest suit anyway.  Hopefully the opponents will come to your rescue by outbidding you.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apologies, after midnight here and have ben up for about 40 hours|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mwigor: here pass was possibly the winning action but partner had an unusually good hand defensively|pg||
nt|davidstern: Poor contract as the cards lie|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jaheim: @C  the best lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kfay: And if not... unless you're doubled it's only 50 a trick.|pg||
nt|kfay: Redouble is an interesting choice by W.  There is so much to talk about on these hands!!!|pg||
nt|kfay: I dislike it.  He has no real interest in defending against any suit by the opponents save @c, which I guarantee they will never bid when looking at that suit.|pg||
nt|kfay: But if their partnership has no other way to show these values unless starting with redouble, I suppose there's nothing to be done.|pg||
nt|davidstern: Likely to lose 1-1-0-2 with handling charges|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: club is best lead for defense to make 3nt declarer has to guess the jack of spades |pg||
nt|davidstern: I would personally NOT open East second in hand Vul vs Not aceless 11 count|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not to mention QJ bare|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: How to go down in 6@S if @S is 1-2 or 2-1?|pg||
nt|hoffers: Bourke will be hoping this is final contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Sr. And @H hook was on|pg||
nt|kfay: This looks like a matchpoint auction!|pg||
nt|mwigor: i like the way smolanko has bid his hand - 3@h cant really be more than a 4 card suit having bid 3@c the previous round|pg||
nt|hoffers: This will go off before Smolanko gets in|pg||
nt|mwigor: although maybe 2NT was scramble not lebensohl|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kfay: S was probably considering and expert 2@h over 2@d, offering partner the choice to play in either contract and suggesting 4-5 shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c in vul may hard to find a parking place for 3rd @s to @c lead|pg||
nt|kfay: E was probably considering bidding 2N over 2@s, suggesting that the partership may well belong in @d rather than @c.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: they could play to cut a @s ruff by table|pg||
