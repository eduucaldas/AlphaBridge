nt|woozle: The other room played 2H EW, but 3NT NS has fair chances|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|marcsmith: 3N is not great but can be made|pg||
nt|marcsmith: against some defences anyway :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|woozle: Hung has a tough call over 1S - double, 2C and 2D would have adherents - but surely nobody would pass|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marcsmith: 2D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|marcsmith: Dbl has merit too|pg||
nt|woozle: an extra queen compensating for the lack of a fourth trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: what is this 2S bid?|pg||
nt|woozle: Awful, awful 2S bid from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: perhaps 2H is forcing?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if not then 2S is truly horrible|pg||
nt|woozle: Good of him to remind his partner that he overcalled 1S, just in case his partner missed it|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i'm nor sure Fantoni-Nunes would recognize their methods|pg||
nt|woozle: dummy's not too bad, all things considered|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@H forcing wouldn't be a good treatment|pg||
nt|woozle: few would play it as forcing in the opponents' strongish auction|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not an abnormal one tho|pg||
nt|marcsmith: agree once South has bid 2C|pg||
nt|davidstern: In Australia Lavings developed 5 card stayman and 14-17 1NT opening - the 5 card stayman became known as Lavings. After much use and abuse he disavowed any knowledge - maybe ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Fantunes will do the same|pg||
nt|marcsmith: after 1D-1S-Pass tho it is fairly normal for 2H to be forcing, so maybe it is here for the kiwis|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: can South find a pass now?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: my money's on 3D|pg||
nt|woozle: If it's clearly penalty, he can|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would pass partner opened no likely game|pg||
nt|marcsmith: no it's balancing|pg||
nt|patricck: Some, but not all, would play it as forcing after South's pass, surely not with South's 2@C bid tho|pg||
nt|davidstern: He has bid 2 over 1 I think the double suggests penalties|pg||
mb|3D|nt|davidstern: Oh well what would I know|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he doesn't like his diamond length and badly placed heart honours|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's only 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: If the double is blood, the 3D is poor...he was prepared to defend 2S right up until the moment that his partner said that he could beat it|pg||
nt|davidstern: Now north is under some pressure|pg||
nt|davidstern: Doesnt know whose hand it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: he'll pass i suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Or if game is likely|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3N isn't a great spot but 2S-X was|pg||
nt|davidstern: Needs to make to cover team mates -100 in CR|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely a heart lead is obvious|pg||

nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts are EW 5@h/5@s   NS5@c/5@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess 4Nt unusual by S would give a slight idea |pg||
mb|d|nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the open room seems a lot with 4 quick loosers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then 6@c/@d would be a nice save|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: As we see and EW know. NS play weak NT. Was 2@C the right acktion?|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Skipper's 2D is 9-12, 5 card suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marcsmith: 3C showed values and North still passed?|pg||
nt|woozle: Adam might have considered reopening with 2NT, but there's nothing wrong with double|pg||
nt|marcsmith: double is ok but when partner makes a positive 3C (alerted so presumably they are playing Leb) then surely he has to bid again|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|woozle: One would think, especially if 2NT would not have been natural so there could easily be a diamond card opposite|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|marcsmith: as the cards lie, he is right to pass in principle, but not when teammates have conceded 600 anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|woozle: I fancy 3NT from North over 3C - if there's a game, 3NT is most likely to make with the QT protected from the lead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|marcsmith: he's going down in this|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: perhaps but i suspect not|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 3D seems kinda wet|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5D really sticks it to West and virtually forces him to bid 5H|pg||
nt|woozle: 3D a bit wet, but no particular game is in sight as a likely make|pg||
nt|marcsmith: although he gets away with it this time|pg||
mb|4H|nt|woozle: 5D might beget -750|pg||
nt|woozle: 4H from West, no milquetoast he|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed, although not this time|pg||
nt|marcsmith: Now North wishes he'd bid 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: 5HX+1 looks pretty likely|pg||
nt|marcsmith: who is doubling 5H?|pg||
nt|woozle: North might, after 5D...he does have a 10-count, and West is clearly guessing|pg||
nt|patricck: I'll go for 4@H passed out|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, a dull 4H-P-P-P|pg||
nt|marcsmith: maybe North is now going to bid 5C|pg||

mb|5D|nt|marcsmith: is North really thinking all this time?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Awful sequence from Adam - 5D earlier much better, but 5D wasn't in trouble|pg||
mb|d|nt|marcsmith: North's 5D bid virtually says 'I didn't bid enough last time partner'|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: now he thinks he has to double|pg||
nt|marcsmith: North deserves to concede 750|pg||

nt|patricck: oops wrong vul|pg||
nt|patricck: 650 or 750|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marcsmith: West certainly does not deserve the plus tho (assuming XX wasn't conventional for spades - not alerted)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: It's hard to say how much N should bid in this position.|pg||
nt|kfay: They can be almost certain that E/W have a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 1@d or 1@h would be a question in post-mortem|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: wow.... fantunes is a good syystem'|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see if they stay out og game here|pg||
nt|jane22: All 1-openings forcing, 2-openings 10-13|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: We apologise that the N-S team name is incorrect. The proper name is Chinese Taipei. We can't correct it at this point, but we will get it right for future matches|pg||
nt|kfay: I think it's very popular these days to respond 1@h and bypass a long diamond suit unless you have a game forcing hand, or a hand that's basically only worth one call.  |pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Any to fight for there parscore at level 4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non will be able to X.|pg||

nt|rodal f: So 2/1 in a strange way:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't even try @DK as lead now|pg||
nt|kfay: Whether or not the double explicitly asks for a @c lead after this auction is a quesiton, I believe that it should not be so.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bebechira: probably yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Hi Bruce:) Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|jane22: no need to go 2 off; could save a bit here|pg||
nt|kfay: Although I'm sure there are some who would disagree with me.  But generally after preemptive auctions a seemingly out-of-the blue double may be interpreted as 'lightner' requesting ...|pg||
nt|kfay: an unusual lead.  Here, though, I believe partner can reasonably take it as 'please don't sacrifice, partner!!'|pg||
nt|kfay: Best defense will set this 2, but that won't be found I'm quite confident.|pg||
nt|kfay: N is probably debating between a trump lead and a @c.  The opponents are quite likely to be prepared in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say South in with @c A, easy to switch @d? perhaps that's the question|pg||

nt|kfay: small number gathered defending in @s.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bebechira: he has to guess the clubs|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|babs59: I've had people suggest I play it, but I'm more into having consistency of bids - 2NT works fine for me, and also denies the opponents the opportunity to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: much better to allow opener to show his shape with some scheme|pg||
nt|kfay: I agree with the double by Mok.  Probably some would wonder why that might be the decision with a 5-card major.  There are several factors to consider|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kfay: 1) partner is a passed hand and you have minimal values so you just want to find your best fit if you're going to compete|pg||
nt|kfay: 2) your @s suit is much more stacked than your @h suit|pg||
nt|kfay: the biggest downside is if partner bids @c, but you don't rate to compete very much in the lowest suit anyway.  Hopefully the opponents will come to your rescue by outbidding you.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|jaheim: @C  the best lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kfay: And if not... unless you're doubled it's only 50 a trick.|pg||
nt|kfay: Redouble is an interesting choice by W.  There is so much to talk about on these hands!!!|pg||
nt|kfay: I dislike it.  He has no real interest in defending against any suit by the opponents save @c, which I guarantee they will never bid when looking at that suit.|pg||
nt|kfay: But if their partnership has no other way to show these values unless starting with redouble, I suppose there's nothing to be done.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|robinswr: club is best lead for defense to make 3nt declarer has to guess the jack of spades |pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: How to go down in 6@S if @S is 1-2 or 2-1?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: Sr. And @H hook was on|pg||
nt|kfay: This looks like a matchpoint auction!|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kfay: S was probably considering and expert 2@h over 2@d, offering partner the choice to play in either contract and suggesting 4-5 shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c in vul may hard to find a parking place for 3rd @s to @c lead|pg||
nt|kfay: E was probably considering bidding 2N over 2@s, suggesting that the partership may well belong in @d rather than @c.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: they could play to cut a @s ruff by table|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaheim: 5 loosers now?|pg||

nt|kfay: a play by an opponent that gives you the contract... but then you give it right back because you would never believe them capable of it|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2h was not even forcing, so as far as i am concern the rest is impossible|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you missed a pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: By open card slam are on. But I hope not will be bidded.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thus, the opponent likely ends up blaming himself for not taking advantage of the opportunity presented, even though to do so would have been irrational|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The benefit of the Grosvenor gambit is supposed to come on future hands, due to a loss of concentration by the player who was taken in by the gambit.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: accidentally, and over time developed its theory and deployed it deliberately. |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The story depicts Grosvenor as often frustrated by opponents who are too obtuse to fall for his ruse. Grosvenor's lifeless body is eventually found bludgeoned to death, his fingers ...|pg||

nt|woozle: hi Marc|pg||
nt|marcsmith: may regret that if EW can now bid to their club slam|pg||
nt|woozle: Skipper and Skipper are playing a variation on the Fantoni-Nunes style, with forcing one-bids and 9-12 two-bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Not sure about the alert of 2C - if the bid isn't too clear about clubs then the issue may be obscured for now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6C is good, particularly since North cannot lead a trump|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: Excellent anyway - ruff three spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marcsmith: you'd expect an auction to start something like 1H-2C-3S in standard methods|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C doesn't really appear to do justice to the East hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: for a bit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not at all|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely E can't pass 3N|pg||

mb|4C|an| |mb|p|nt|marcsmith: that's probably easier than Skipper1 and Skipper 2 :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Skipper isn't having any of this 3NT nonsense, but the main point of his hand - the spade void - seems to remain unshown|pg||
nt|marcsmith: how West is to know that he is facing such a suitable hand I don't know|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|patricck: Too many cooks spoil the broth, two many skippers sink the ship?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: He really doesn't want to show that spade control does he|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: i can think of no reason for not Q-bidding 4S|pg||
nt|woozle: East really never got to the nub of this hand - club support, spade void, massive slam potential|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
nt|marcsmith: unusual for juniors to be conservative|pg||
nt|patricck: Had 2 good opportunites to Q it, I would blame East 100% for failing to reach slam|pg||
nt|marcsmith: problem on this deal is surely to avoid the moderate grand|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marcsmith: hard to see how West could do more|pg||
nt|davidstern: How about a splinter over 2@C|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it does seem obvious, doesn't it David|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or Even Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|davidstern: @S4|pg||
nt|marcsmith: splinter and then Q 4S later to show the void seems enough|pg||
nt|davidstern: All of the above|pg||

nt|woozle: Fair 4S for EW, if they can reach it|pg||
nt|davidstern: Patrick - website for results please|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not much chance if East is as reticent as on the previous deal|pg||
nt|davidstern: Skinny values to unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|davidstern: How about Clubs N/S |pg||
nt|marcsmith: 1S-2S-3D-4S does seem reasonable|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|davidstern: If N/S get busy in clubs then that may propel E/W in diamonds|pg||

mb|1N|an| |nt|marcsmith: 5D fails tho|pg||
nt|woozle: I've seen crazier auctions than 1S-2S-4S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: true|pg||
nt|woozle: Entries to dummy a little scarce though|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marcsmith: i'm guessing that they play 1s-2S as constructive|pg||

nt|davidstern: West will be interested NOW|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marcsmith: right but 1S-2S seems better |pg||
mb|3D|nt|marcsmith: North really should bid 3c over 1N|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marcsmith: EW might get an easy 500 from 5C-X|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C over 1NT really compromises on other chances, like 4H|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i think trying to bid constructively when opps have already opened and responded is losing tactics|pg||
nt|marcsmith: chances are that it's their hand unless you can find a fit|pg||
nt|woozle: Even the response is forced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: particularly when their suit is spades|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|woozle: Sounds like a good reason to respond with nothing when playing against you|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5th round results http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/YouthRR01-05.html|pg||
nt|marcsmith: true -- i don;t really understand this Fantoni-Nunes system|pg||
nt|marcsmith: fairly normal to respond on just about anything these days anyway, isn;t it|pg||
nt|woozle: I do|pg||
nt|marcsmith: is anyone going to smack 5C?|pg||
nt|woozle: Adam really should realise here that he's done enough|pg||
nt|marcsmith: as do i|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: NS had a much better chance of getting to their cold 4S if Wet raises to 2S at his first turn|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: Ew|pg||
nt|woozle: is 4S cold? diamonds are blocked and West has only one entry|pg||
nt|marcsmith: Surely West should convert 4D to 4S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: so it needs a little help from the defence|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i'd still want to be there|pg||
nt|woozle: 4D will surely make four - not many losing lines|pg||
nt|marcsmith: Chances are good in 4S too|pg||
nt|davidstern: Deep finesse says South has to lead low club|pg||
nt|davidstern: To beat 4@S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: Odds are that South would cash CA, see length signal and switch to a heart|pg||
nt|marcsmith: making it easy|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think fundamentally to make East has to play @SA and a low spade|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ah - so that North cas switch to diamonds without allowing declarer to unblock the suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tick|pg||
nt|woozle: And you need to finesse hearts twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: in reality tho, South will lead CA and switch to hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: I have mastered the art of entering hands into DF quickly while bidding going on - comes in handy some times|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not sure of West's logic -- he's at the 4-level anyway, so surely he might as well play in game|pg||
nt|woozle: Have to cash one diamond before ace of spades, spade|pg||
nt|davidstern: Oh and BTW I own one of the three legitimately sold copies as opposed to the 934,000 illegal copies|pg||
