nt|ahollan1: that's some double fit for each side|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: :)   been there done that Jack|pg||
nt|joest: they achieved 'par' in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yesterday i was in copy/paste from wrong LINE mode|pg||
nt|cascade: will someone play at the six-level?|pg||
nt|cascade: 4@s or 4NT now for both minors|pg||
nt|joest: yes I often use 4@s here as the minors|pg||
nt|cascade: me too|pg||
nt|joest: and 4NT is either Blackwood (rare) or some gigantic balanced hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N as Ace ask would be better, but who plays that?|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|joest: this would be a great hand for the "Blackwood (rare)|pg||
nt|cascade: Jack (and probably me)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cascade: 3@s is often played as simply a stopper ask - usually with just one long minor|pg||
nt|joest: 4@s is the kinda obvious call but I might be tempted to bid 4@h just to see what happens -- to see if partner reacts in which case I might save forever|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right Wayne, so maybe now reopening 4N switches to 2-suit|pg||
nt|joest: the opponents are not selling to 4@s -- of that I would be sure|pg||
nt|cascade: Liu is not finished i suspect|pg||
nt|cascade: either that or confusion Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: completely different circumstances in the other room after Multi 2@D opener|pg||
nt|joest: I like 5@c b/c of its simplicity.  There is some chance, albeit small, of confusion with 4NT here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No way to find out if partner hasx an ace, so 5@C is enough|pg||
nt|cascade: 5NT might be possible|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|cascade: partner is odds on to have an ace i think Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not *my* partners|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in Juniors match  one table 6@C -50   one bought 5@C +400|pg||
nt|joest: who would double this power auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: these guys won't play with you :)|pg||
nt|cascade: i think 6@c is good |pg||
nt|joest: I agree.  North is my typical partner|pg||
nt|cascade: it might have made|pg||
nt|cascade: and you are surely going to bid again over 5@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So much for law of total tricks-11/11   I hear from the audience|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 4N probably had good chance of buying 5@C|pg||

nt|alsze:  EW got a good stop at 3@h in the other table for this hand.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: as good an opening bid as any with N hand |pg||

nt|marlowepi: Sitting S is my good friend and occasional partner and teammate Tadashi Teramoto. I hope to meet the other three players someday|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and we often have saying 4 @H's transfer to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|joshs: in some ways he has a better hand, a 4'th trumps and loves the spade K|pg||
nt|alsze:  since the 2@s promise at least 3@h, principle of fast arrival shall be used.|pg||
nt|alsze:  yes, compenstating the doubleton @d Q.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joshs: yup|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nope still the one round force with 0-4@S|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cascade: their card does say 1@s = 0-4 spades and 1NT = 5+ spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cascade: west has extras here|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: might it now go 5@d - 5@h all out?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that a leap to 4@H shows 3-card support for spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H looks very premature to me|pg||
nt|joest: i like that conventino very much Roland|pg||
nt|cascade: 12 tricks on a non-club lead|pg||
nt|joest: does it make 12 on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you get 12 if South is alert, Wayne?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: but showing 3@S when responder has AT MOST 4@S doesn't make much sense [to me]|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cascade: if you are going to bid 4@h then you need to be on firm ground that you can be this weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On a none-club lead it's a cute hand. In order to avoid being stepping stone squeezed in @S and @C, South has to throw away the A@C on the run of trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yes in this system context it makes less sense|pg||
nt|cascade: sorry yes it must be a major lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Jun-Xu do have mechanism to show the good 6+@H & 3@S hand -- in context of Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: non-club even|pg||
nt|cascade: I am curious as to what 4@s then 5@s were|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a textbook example of how useless Blackwood is when you have a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|joest: i agree Roland|pg||
nt|cascade: @dQ looks normal|pg||
nt|joest: west has a problem when east can have a wide variety of hands for 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S is a cue bid agreeing hearts|pg||
nt|joest: could he have 17 say?|pg||
nt|cascade: but then what is 5@s Roland|pg||
nt|joest: If you play Namyats then WEst probably has a pass|pg||
nt|cascade: it doesnt seem consistent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then the 5@S response makes sense, 2 keys and @HQ|pg||
nt|cascade: ok|pg||
nt|joest: i tend to agree that 4@s is a cue not "my spades are better than your hearts" :)|pg||
nt|cascade: in a dream |pg||
nt|joest: particularly again since the spade length is non ambiguous here|pg||
nt|joest: i.e. fewer than five|pg||

nt|henryb:  Warm, sunny, joyful because the Cornell LAX team reached the final four|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: with a solid spade holding and favorable vulnerability, the slow approach of 1H is preferred to the buccaneer shot of 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bravo|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|alsze:  i found that, not everyone had the same definition on NAMYATS.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joshs: for those who dont know, in namyats, 4 of a minor should a good 4 of a major pre-empt|pg||
nt|alsze:  the better way to handle is, Do not play NAMYATS|pg||
nt|alsze:  :)|pg||
nt|joshs: 4 of a minor shows a good 4 of a major |pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|joest: in the other room north bid 2@d here|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|ahollan1: i still think 4@H rebid was premature  -- but probably better route than initial Namyats [which was available]|pg||
nt|cascade: 2@d NF?|pg||
nt|joest: might be a good raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: I think it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=normal raise @H, better than 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It does not seem right to bid a non-forcing 2@D when you have support for opener's major|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room it looks as though east-west got caught in a typical forcing pass disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So support it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: btw - 1@H is 5+ or 4441@D|pg||
nt|cascade: their notes actually say 2@d = normal raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and 2@h = weak raise|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|joest: when east jumped to 4@s and south bid 5@h west thought 'at these colors' he had to double|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|cascade: east needs to guess well in clubs if this is the final contract|pg||
nt|joest: super well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Jing will pull. He has no defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Often they don't have a heart trick|pg||
nt|joest: and if he does, will east-west consider themselves 'forced'?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: answer: yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Two very good decisions in a row by Liu Jing who is an avid BBO'er and one of our commentators|pg||
nt|joest: personally I don't think forcing passes would apply here.  Just b/c you bid a vulnerable game means that you are in a forcing pass situation, but I know I am in a minority|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am in your camp, Jack|pg||
nt|joest: excuse me DOESN"T mean that you are in a forcing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too many see too many forcing pass ghosts. They are very rare|pg||
nt|cascade: certainly if you are going to raise 3@s to 4@s with 11 hcp then that mitigates against wanting to play forcing passes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: in the Juniors -- both tables 5@H undoubled   in our match both 5@HX|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: maybe they've read different versions of Kantar's Forcing Pass book |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|joest: and they are as complicated as his Blackwood books!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: not that west has a minimum either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but should bid 5@S or something below 6@H with 1st round @S control|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: I think West should have bid 5@S over 5@H. That leaves room for 5NT by East|pg||

nt|joest: it is even more so if the auction gets more competitive|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: but still --- West had plenty of room for bids other than 3@H/4@H [catering to LR]  and 5@S over 5@H costs nothing|pg||

mb|p|nt|beauch:  this 4/3 one loks sound :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: many pairs use doubel as a kind of all-purpose GF facing an openming bid, along with NF free bids. much rarer to see such an agreement facing an overcall|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: I would also, passing 2 @H is sort of unilateral |pg||
nt|marlowepi: for those not familiar with Muiderberg, it is an opening bid of 2 of a major that sends the following message:  "I desperately want to drive my opponents to a game they might well ...|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: folks may have wrong pards here for fitting hands |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: one more or less will double on the S hand, but it is not without flaws at these colours|pg||
pc|h4|nt|alsze:  3@s seems to be an invitation here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 1m 1N, an interesting treatment is Ripstra: 2m by partner of opener is "better minor" with both majors|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: if a 2S or 2N bid forces pd to bid at  3 level, esp hearts, you could be cruising for a round number against nothing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a slight compensation, double somewhat increases the likelihood of scoring spade Q on defense, and the most likely outcome is probably a final contract in spades. |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on the third hand, with this many aces and kings the opps are not likely to bid a spade game, so the number of IMPs likely to hinge on whether or not you score spade queen on ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense is limited|pg||
nt|sybarra: can W handle 3 nt ?|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 5 events but only 3 round-robins|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|cascade: In the Open the surprise from day one is that French Polynesia - last I think last year - are tied in the lead|pg||
nt|cascade: I have not seen it confirmed but I believe that after the first round robin it maybe that the combined sections will split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if not planning to reverse would you open 1@D instead of 1@C?  that just leads to slower auction to 3N|pg||
nt|cascade: i think the diamonds are weak enough that I am happy with 1@c|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: while we wait   the NS names as entered actually combine first & last names|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i hereby command NS to get on the scoreboard. my uncle has a big bet down in Vegas|pg||
nt|marlowepi: al right|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: well double didnt impeded EW in the slightest from bidding their heart game....maybe S needed to Michaels:):):)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: ty pascale,  great job |pg||
mb|2S|nt|alsze:  this hand seems to be a partial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i must have mis-sorted E's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  anyone will bid with East hand after North 1@c ??|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: could E ever find the stiff @D lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: canape? hadnt npotice it before|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Josh Sher|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|alsze:  hihi|pg||
pc|hK|nt|alsze:  hi Josh|pg||
nt|alsze:  welcome here...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: N already close to a 4S bid on his own after the double, but presumably downgraded club and heart holding|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: probably wrong to downgrade hearts once the suit is supported -- heart lead probable, ESPECIALLY because you have the club king....because that means E wont have an AK or KQ ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: combination in the alternative lead suit and thus is a huge favorite to lead a heart|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|joest: auction might well go 1@h - 1@s; 3@h all pass|pg||
mb|1S|an| |mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: their convention card on the website is Li-Liu.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|joest: and it is a length cc with all the notes :)|pg||
nt|cascade: Roman leads |pg||
nt|cascade: do you know what 1@s was Al - I don't have the convention card opened|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|joest: declarer might well worry to what purpose he should use the ace of spades: (a) to play for the club ten onside; (b) to play for both heart honors on or in the alternative (c) Honor ...|pg||
nt|joest: x of hearts onside|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: here anything works!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems they use Kaplan Inversion  1@H-1N=5+@S  1@H-1@S is like forcing NT but may have 4@S|pg||
nt|joest: hard to say Al.  I can't find this sequence on their card|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT is listed as 'semi forcing' which suggests that it does not show spades|pg||
nt|joest: sometimes when I play the "F" convention I play that 1@s shows five or four good ones|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: sorry guys i lost track of teh play of the hand|pg||
nt|joest: well at this point declarer looks committed to leading a club to the ten and will be +140|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: from Kaku-Kohno CC  1@H-1@S/1NT=@S0-4 F1/@S5+, 1@S-1NT=F1|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: thanks all last board of the set |pg||
nt|alsze:  icic, me 2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to all and David who was here earlier |pg||
nt|sybarra: back shortly for the rest of you, however it is bed time for me |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open until scores confirmed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for your great comments |pg||
nt|alsze:  1NT would be good enough, if Chin got @d J right, as he did just now.... |pg||
nt|joshs: in general, I beleive a balanced hand should always say that he is balanced as soon as possble (especially 4333) that was responder can show shape and the balanced hand can ...|pg||
nt|joshs: evaluate honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  and that's the only way he could do, since @d Ace could not be with 3 cards, otherwise no entry.|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|joshs: that way|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an| |nt|alsze:  NS had a safe 3NT here, when @d is 4-4.|pg||
nt|joshs: lucky 3N here, so they will survive even if they do not get to the correct game|pg||
nt|joshs: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: heart partscore is par, many pairs could not get to one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: forcing club gives a good chance|pg||
mb|1H|an| |nt|alsze:  the correct game is 5@c ??|pg||
nt|joshs: yeah 5C is much better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kelvin Yim|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but E needs to  rebid 1N to make that likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N works when W has 5 hearts, 1S works when W has 3 spades|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|marlowepi: with a doubleton heart, E should bid 1S as less to gain from 1N|pg||
nt|kelvin yim: Hi all|pg||
nt|alsze:  or 4@s when @s Q onside and 4-3....|pg||
nt|alsze:  hi Kelvin|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an| |mb|p|nt|marlowepi: clubs will work ok too of course|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: well...|pg||
nt|joshs: 4H is also very good|pg||
nt|joshs: 4H is probably the best game|pg||
mb|p|nt|joshs: but this is a very hard bidding problem, and NS had a normal auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: this is the final board for this set. more scheduled for one hour from now. thanks to all responsible parties, from irresponsible parties such as myself|pg||
