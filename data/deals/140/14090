nt|sybarra: but alas a push|pg||
nt|janm: It will be interesting to see whether the other room manages to get the ruffs to beat either of these first two contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||

nt|woozle: Interesting decision for gregory over Ino's 1D - double, 1H or 1NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  I like 1@h|pg||
nt|woozle: Gregory doubles - fairly old-school...many modern players prefer to get their heart suit named on the first round|pg||
nt|andyv:  only because I usually get stuck in the suit I bid|pg||
nt|woozle: For one thing, this hand will be a disappointing dummy in any other suit|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Also, this hand is not so great that the simple 1@H overcall seriously understates it.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|woozle: Gregory has been able to follow through in his initial plan without complications, and will be allowed to play in 2H|pg||

mb|1D|nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
mb|1H|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
pc|dA|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
pc|h6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: If N leads a club now, declarer has to ruff, not win the A, which may not be clear|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||

nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||

pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||

nt|janm: He knows he probably has the best hand at the table, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not 2@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|janm: Your partner, maybe :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||

nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||

pc|cT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||
