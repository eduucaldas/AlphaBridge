mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|cascade: would anyone pull?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: if East IS short in clubs.....|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|cascade: i suppose it depends on how often partner might rebid 1NT with a stiff heart although even then he rates to have four diamonds|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: i was just wondering that too -- 2 key questions for me -- 1) can Ng have 4@S when he rebid 1N   2) what do they open with 4@C & 4@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: especially if they bypass 4@S - then I vote PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 4@D & 4@C opens 1@D -- then PASS|pg||
nt|cascade: 4=3=3=3 might not be that fun in 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's the rub -- can 1N include 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in long run, i suspect PASS is a winner ... except when 2@H is better|pg||
nt|cascade: perhaps they cant bid 2@d naturally though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet it is VERY close|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i favor 2H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: sorry i lost it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suitish looking hand to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their CC mentions Weak Jump Shift -- so even 2@H is forward-going|pg||

nt|alsze:  EW got a good stop at 3@h in the other table for this hand.|pg||
nt|alsze:  so, if EW here got overboard, they will lose IMPs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: as good an opening bid as any with N hand |pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: good evening all from New Zealand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Sitting S is my good friend and occasional partner and teammate Tadashi Teramoto. I hope to meet the other three players someday|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and we often have saying 4 @H's transfer to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||

nt|alsze:  yes, compenstating the doubleton @d Q.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it seems at first that S has a 1-bid hand so 2H. but he does not want a heart lead. he takes a chance with 1S, risking maybe smaller IMPs, to avioud a potentially disastrous lead ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: against a game. i am with him, but kids dont try this at home|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in other room, Chung-Liu are NOT playing precision  just Weak NT non-vul|pg||
nt|cascade: nicely judged 3@c |pg||
nt|cascade: not sure i would have thought of it|pg||
pc|c7|nt|caitlin: 1NT weak all pass...South should balance with spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|cascade: maybe club leads will beat it|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|caitlin: harder when VUL tho|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ritong: and balanced|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well with 9 losers at unfavourable colours i am not sure of that|pg||
nt|cascade: it is dangerous balancing over 1NT with a weakish hand |pg||
nt|cascade: partner might try for or even bid game|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the jackpot syndroma|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wonder what the % of that phenomena is with weak notrumps but points taken|pg||
nt|ritong: however, with a structured hand, like 6/4 or better, you re not that scared of being raised|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think E was really trying to push NS to 3H. th ebidding by S suggested more values, so it was a very reasonable hope espo at these colours|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm wondering how many more times East is going to raise his partner with Honor doubleton|pg||

nt|alsze:  4@d seems to be a NAMYATS |pg||
mb|1N|nt|joshs: yeah, but 4D is deifinitely not my style witho nly a 7 bagger and 3 defensive tricks|pg||

nt|henryb:  Warm, sunny, joyful because the Cornell LAX team reached the final four|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: with a solid spade holding and favorable vulnerability, the slow approach of 1H is preferred to the buccaneer shot of 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bravo|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|alsze:  i found that, not everyone had the same definition on NAMYATS.....|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joshs: for those who dont know, in namyats, 4 of a minor should a good 4 of a major pre-empt|pg||
nt|alsze:  the better way to handle is, Do not play NAMYATS|pg||
nt|alsze:  :)|pg||
nt|joshs: 4 of a minor shows a good 4 of a major |pg||

nt|ritong: it visibly is 4+@hs, no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in north america, negative doublers would promise 4@S & 4@H after 1@C-(1@D)-DBL|pg||

nt|marlowepi: cautious bidding had been the rule in the antipodes for a long time. close study of Bidding Forum, before and after Keith McNeil's benevlent despotism, makes this fairly clear|pg||

nt|cascade: an immediate return to 4NT is discouraging|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would also, passing 2 @H is sort of unilateral |pg||

mb|1N|nt|alsze:  welcome to the PABF 2010|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in comparison to "jump shift in other minor INV+" it gains big, because 1D-3C is very awkward. playing this method, 1D-3C is inv single-suiter|pg||

mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: folks may have wrong pards here for fitting hands |pg||
mb|4D|nt|h_karluk: 4@s+1 fine|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: one more or less will double on the S hand, but it is not without flaws at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  3@s seems to be an invitation here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 1m 1N, an interesting treatment is Ripstra: 2m by partner of opener is "better minor" with both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if a 2S or 2N bid forces pd to bid at  3 level, esp hearts, you could be cruising for a round number against nothing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a slight compensation, double somewhat increases the likelihood of scoring spade Q on defense, and the most likely outcome is probably a final contract in spades. |pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: on the third hand, with this many aces and kings the opps are not likely to bid a spade game, so the number of IMPs likely to hinge on whether or not you score spade queen on ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense is limited|pg||
nt|sybarra: can W handle 3 nt ?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i hereby command NS to get on the scoreboard. my uncle has a big bet down in Vegas|pg||
nt|marlowepi: al right|pg||
nt|sybarra: whatever,     |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and equal vuln.|pg||
nt|sybarra: penultimate board,  this on one more|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: well double didnt impeded EW in the slightest from bidding their heart game....maybe S needed to Michaels:):):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ty pascale,  great job |pg||
mb|1N|nt|alsze:  this hand seems to be a partial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i must have mis-sorted E's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  anyone will bid with East hand after North 1@c ??|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sybarra: could E ever find the stiff @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: canape? hadnt npotice it before|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this may end up with 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: see what we know?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Josh Sher|pg||
nt|joshs: hello everyone|pg||
pc|s7|nt|alsze:  hihi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that was reopening X|pg||
pc|s8|nt|alsze:  hi Josh|pg||
nt|alsze:  welcome here...|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N already close to a 4S bid on his own after the double, but presumably downgraded club and heart holding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously asked a wish to play in any Major suit at 2 level|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now have to trust @s lead was 4th best|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so just pull @s A|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and play another @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think this is 1NWX+1 or 1NWX=|pg||

mb|4N|an| |nt|ahollan1: 4N = takeout|pg||
mb|5S|nt|cascade: maybe 5/5 depending on how they play double of 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, better explanation Wayne|pg||
nt|cascade: well it depends - there is variation in partnership methods there|pg||
mb|6H|nt|marlowepi: this is the second day in a row i have commentated this event, and i have seen more eight and nine card suit than liarsin a courtroom. the organizers have some splainin to do|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|cascade: i guess it is tough to defend 6@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I believe Patrick Hwang [which spelling is correct?] is one of the original Chinese Precision players from late 60s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcom caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Marshall:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes inded if this is he|pg||
nt|cascade: but they had pushed NS around a lot it was not clear they had bid to a good contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has a different nick on BBO|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|cascade: they have Huang on the convention card|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reasonable actions from all players -- but Raj made the last [losing] guess|pg||
nt|cascade: and Patrick is definitely in Hamilton I saw him on Saturday when I was there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand generating contract seems to have gone to "randoidgoulaschdeal.com"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're starting with the last of the 14.  this is done so when we play  17 we'll be able to compare with Closed Room|pg||
nt|cascade: there is actually a website where you can deal goulash hands - i know i wrote it|pg||
nt|cascade: it is the day for 8card spade suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set - there was a hand where player had 8@S -- and partner overcalled 1@S!!!|pg||
nt|cascade: last match one was put down in the dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yesterday there were 3 9-card suits and 1 8-bagger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 1st with same deal containing 2 8s|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: for the record, most top pairs lead King from AK in cashout situations -- to get COUNT|pg||
nt|cascade: overall standings are here http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: part of the argument -- you often lead unsupported Ace at that level, so it gets attitude|pg||
nt|cascade: click on the headings OPEN SENIORS/LADIES and YOUTH for the overall summary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they haven't posted results from Match  5 yet :(|pg||
nt|cascade: true i am not sure what the hold up is|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: thanks all last board of the set |pg||
nt|alsze:  icic, me 2.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only 5@h for NS|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: thx to all and David who was here earlier |pg||
nt|sybarra: back shortly for the rest of you, however it is bed time for me |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open until scores confirmed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for your great comments |pg||
nt|alsze:  1NT would be good enough, if Chin got @d J right, as he did just now.... |pg||
nt|joshs: in general, I beleive a balanced hand should always say that he is balanced as soon as possble (especially 4333) that was responder can show shape and the balanced hand can ...|pg||
nt|joshs: evaluate honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|alsze:  and that's the only way he could do, since @d Ace could not be with 3 cards, otherwise no entry.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joshs: that way|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: kind of goulash deal|pg||
mb|4S|nt|alsze:  NS had a safe 3NT here, when @d is 4-4.|pg||
nt|joshs: lucky 3N here, so they will survive even if they do not get to the correct game|pg||
nt|joshs: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: heart partscore is par, many pairs could not get to one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: forcing club gives a good chance|pg||
mb|5S|nt|alsze:  the correct game is 5@c ??|pg||
nt|joshs: yeah 5C is much better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kelvin Yim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however singleton @d lead may change many things|pg||
nt|sybarra: will take the E hand (@D suit) for poker|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but E needs to  rebid 1N to make that likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N works when W has 5 hearts, 1S works when W has 3 spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with a doubleton heart, E should bid 1S as less to gain from 1N|pg||
nt|kelvin yim: Hi all|pg||
nt|alsze:  or 4@s when @s Q onside and 4-3....|pg||
nt|alsze:  hi Kelvin|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still X|pg||
nt|sybarra: high or low straight|pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost flush|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: allright, appreciated to Mrs Shirley Ybarra and operator, kibitzers always welcomed, please follow BBO Vugraph schedule|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: clubs will work ok too of course|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: well...|pg||
nt|joshs: 4H is also very good|pg||
nt|joshs: 4H is probably the best game|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|joshs: but this is a very hard bidding problem, and NS had a normal auction|pg||
