pc|hT|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||

mb|2S|an| |nt|geot: A bit soft by N/S in the CR, I think, this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 6 -- Bad 12 HCP, 5+@S and 4+ minor|pg||

nt|geot: Should be a 6 imp pick up for HK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|geot: Game is of course not obvious, if the diamond suit gives two losers you must solve the spades. But this is certainly a game you want to be in|pg||

nt|sybarra: but alas a push|pg||
nt|janm: It will be interesting to see whether the other room manages to get the ruffs to beat either of these first two contracts|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
mb|3S|an| |mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||

nt|geot: 5@C will go -500, and the major game E/W will go down, normally. Phantom-save.... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 3-suited 1@D denies 5@H/@S  so 1@H is the system opener|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: 4@C may have been more descriptive here|pg||

nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||

nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
pc|c5|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
pc|d8|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
pc|d2|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||

nt|janm: So making 5 or 6 depending on whether they cash the heart A now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|janm: Somewhat similar I suppose, but the S hand would have shown a better hand at that point and N could then bid 3@s to pattern out. I don't know, I just hear comments about how much ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: agree|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
pc|h6|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
pc|h7|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||

nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||

mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not at these colors -- especially in context of aggressive precision opening partnership|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|barnets: in my experience it can work both ways|pg||

nt|barnets: I have a feeling if polled it would be close|pg||
nt|geot: Of course it can work, but this time pd has KQxx in your side suit, and still you go 5-800 down...so?|pg||

nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||

nt|janm: What were you saying about 8 card suits yesterday, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: well there have been plenty of 8s and 9s the first two days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are occuring too often|pg||
mb|4C|nt|janm: And what would you do with this one? Pass and hope to bid later? Open 1, or open a bunch?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||
nt|alchilds: easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Friggi, and Al,  and Frank and Pat, who were here earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you. back in  a bit oveer 30 minutes- lets hope I am more awake then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
pc|s5|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
pc|c8|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s9|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cascade: Ker at the other table is a many time NZ Chess champion|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
mc|11|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
