mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if a 2S or 2N bid forces pd to bid at  3 level, esp hearts, you could be cruising for a round number against nothing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a slight compensation, double somewhat increases the likelihood of scoring spade Q on defense, and the most likely outcome is probably a final contract in spades. |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: on the third hand, with this many aces and kings the opps are not likely to bid a spade game, so the number of IMPs likely to hinge on whether or not you score spade queen on ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense is limited|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: another plus of double is that when opps have a heart fit they sometimes shy away from it due to your vul double|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably wrong to downgrade hearts once the suit is supported -- heart lead probable, ESPECIALLY because you have the club king....because that means E wont have an AK or KQ ...|pg||
