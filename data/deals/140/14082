mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|an| |nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7  [and not 5-7 with 6+ suit]|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder whether they play 1@h as 19+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=F1, a) 4+@H  b) BAL, 19+ HCP|pg||
mb|1H|an| |nt|ahollan1: thanks for asking Henry :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If so, South probably has to bid 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this pair is 1st i've seen to use 1@H as 2-way bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: this was the old way|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Matchpoint Precision introduced 1@C-1@D//1M as 1 round force with 4+ suit  [ala meckwell]|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: either way is a dangerous auction for gosney to get involved|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think Sontag introduced the totally artificial 1@H=19+ in Power Precision|pg||
nt|henryb:  and Power Precision introduced 1@h as extra strength|pg||
nt|henryb:  they borrowed it from Ultimate Club|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: and it is probably older than that even|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: @C suit really gets no respect in this auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  orobably right to overtake to start @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction -- i would have thought trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are lots of possibities|pg||
nt|henryb:  South is pretty much marked with the @dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ruff a club for diamond play is also possible|pg||
nt|henryb:  I don't know that you want to reveal the @c void so early. It invited @sA and a @s by S|pg||

pc|s2|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the @c gives the contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  but Gill did not want it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course - in this part of IMP scale -- +110 and +140 = same imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no defense at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA @S seems best -- declarer only gets 1@D that way|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|dburn: 10 am apparently - in which case, good morning|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, there is a widely held view that no morning is good on which you have to play bridge straight after breakfast|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|dburn: South doing something artificial here, but I am not sure what|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: someone who does know what tells me that 2@d was in effect a transfer - either weak or invitational with five hearts|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|dburn: and East (who might barely have competed over 1NT anyway) is choosing between a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: North, who does not know about the club break yet, will consider that he has four club tricks, a couple of spades, a diamond and... well, one in the wash somewhere|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: but that club break makes it slightly awkward to get to all those tricks|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|dburn: still, what with spades 4-4 (as expected on the bidding) he can almost certainly scramble home anyway|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: since Shi will (in effect) have to provide him with an entry to the fifth club or give up the heart suit|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d8|pc|h5|nt|dburn: still, I guess the defenders can arrange to make him guess hearts, but he is likely to do that|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: since with @hA in addition to quite a lot of cards in spades and diamonds, East probably would have bid over 1NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but if this is how long he is going to take over 2NT, I hope he doesn't have too many tricky games to play this set|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: we use to play double was less than 7 points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C was any 16+    i suspect PASS was forcing|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the rest seems a bit lucky|pg||
nt|ritong: north assumed east has solid @hs  the @h K will be an unpleasant surprise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always a luck factor for Big @C auctions with high level preempt|pg||
nt|ritong: when helgemo does this, he has solid @hs|pg||
nt|mr murray: very hard to judge how high is enuff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: well --- almost always|pg||

mc|11|nt|fabsayc: well he did have another forcing pass available|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s was far from clearcut, mind you|pg||
nt|ritong: double looked more appropriate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we just don't know what the pair has agreed about these hi-level auctions|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when opener bids 4@s, he has @ss for real|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is not clear but one sequence should be forward going , the other to play 5s|pg||
nt|davidstern: Should credit Peter Gill for creating the push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 more matches today -- next set in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|ritong: we can t, david|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after the early 1400 in 3NXX  Australia did very well to play to a tie|pg||
nt|ritong: if you have a look at the movie, you will see some experimental things by gill which turned out less happily|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lucky I just joined then|pg||
nt|ritong: probable|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: case for East to act again if 4@s comes back to him|pg||
nt|dburn: but Hans may try for slam anyway, even though he knows South bid under pressure|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: in NZ we use BridgePadm very similar|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: worst rain for decades here in NZ one entire town down South has become an island in a sea of rainwater :(|pg||
nt|dburn: Gill and Gosney did reach the thin game on board 7 when North passed his partner's opening with an ace and a queen|pg||
