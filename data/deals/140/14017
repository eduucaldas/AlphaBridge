mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: 3NT looks like a good result|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: a Polish style 1C basically means that all balanced hands are opened with 1@C, unless they are opened with 1NT|pg||

mb|d!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Where the auction was invitational as next door, i am really surprised at the lead|pg||

nt|daman: not a trying contract now|pg||
nt|henryb:  really? what are his 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|jcmax: This will not be so easy from here. zia will have to find a @D switch. And when declarer plays low from dummy W will have to duck his K|pg||
nt|jtr: Which?|pg||
nt|roswolf: confucius he say the opening lead determines the beauty of the contract |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|henryb:  I see 8. but a passive defense might create trouble|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, a @c exit would not have done|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer can then play Ax@d and West either takes for nine tricks or East gets endplayed|pg||

nt|hedyg: like 5@H?|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6@d quite enuf|pg||
nt|sybarra: was clearly before I got out of bed,  its only 714a here now |pg||

mb|2N|nt|hedyg: no description of 4 level openings on their CC|pg||
nt|lestergold: west may phantom at this vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: take insurance|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "insurance" may lead to opps going to 5 level |pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: of course the traditional approach is not to preempt with a side 4 card major|pg||

nt|hedyg: pass pass 1@s|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Hi all|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt that he played the @hs that way|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mich-b: A "disciplined" action by Drijver - not opening 3@C , like some players would do , convinced by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly thatb sort of hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: can make 5@c NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob undo pls|pg||
nt|hedyg: multi 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i would consider 5@s off one a normal result on hand altho it isnt par|pg||

mb|3H|nt|hedyg: Bob pls undo|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass by south is missing|pg||

nt|sybarra: and his name is Jan Jansma |pg||
nt|lestergold: however north is still there|pg||
nt|hedyg: this will not make|pg||
nt|hedyg: after a @s lead they switch to @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni doesnt like it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for 1255|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would use something like 3@D by E to show a LR in @S.  3@S often just shows a max single raise.|pg||

pc|sK|nt|lestergold: well a good result for Iceland extracti8ng maximum avaialble on the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma is extremely proud of his hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @hs 3 3 this should make nicely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very friendlt hand for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to lead a D, and with clubs 22 doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Jordan i am surprised by the 3@s bid too|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's pretty much implicit that S has to have some fit for one of the minors here.  Probably not trotting out 4@H for the first time without the ability to go to 5m as needed.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean after one spade|pg||
nt|pelu: what would u bid? - 3@S NF - they can use 3@c and 3@D as fircing/invitational bids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense has a chance on spade out and diamond shift|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure they can|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|mich-b: East knows that East will not have 4 card @S support|pg||
nt|hedyg: the balancing double by Fantoni allowed E to bid again and get to play in his 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would raise to 2@S with that rather than pass|pg||
nt|mich-b: so he prefers the 7 card suit , to the 4-3 fit|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: tricky lead!|pg||

nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs 3-2, @ss on side..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fantunes play what are called Slavinsky leads very tricky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they only underlead aces when it is right :p|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course|pg||
nt|mich-b: best for he defense is to stay passive, and let declarer work on the @S suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: E surely has a singleton @H or void, the question is where is the 10@H (for Fantoni)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not normally this slow when defending a part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni? LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even he|pg||
nt|hedyg: yesterday there was a miracle when the table where both Fantoni and Muller played finished before the other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Shirley.|pg||
nt|hedyg: re|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling on the diamonds very dubious because S has announced trick source in hearts and E has 3 small|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no D is o nly chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play @c|pg||
nt|pelu: look at that dummy - East prob play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D only chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: or even @H in case S has K@s and W A@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i predict he will play diamond king|pg||
nt|pelu: Mullers best chance : I take my X back :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S marked with one diamond at most|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can that beat it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am with Peter :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: undo the double |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact, since S is known to have 6 strong hearts from the auction, his pass marks him with this shape almost surely|pg||
nt|pelu: the best chance is 4-6-1-2 in S and then he sh play C to kill Ss hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond lead is only chance because declarer might play W for three clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer will play to win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that shape is almost impossible,|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Marschall - have a bet (just a coke) - No @D from East :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @d back he can play 2 @hs to disc 1 @d and ruff 3, last ruff W overruffs with ace and thats all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when we look at the auction that S has followed, it is clear he was always preared to bid 5C, and he did not open with six strong hearts which almost surely means 4 spades. hence ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4603|pg||
nt|pelu: No Marshal, 2@H = 10-13 HCP|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 10 hcps to open with, they do not have weak openings for 6 card suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes there are many things he can do to make as cards lie Hedy, but they won;t all work if W has three clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well dont they play multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure they will! he just has to have 2 @hs|pg||

nt|hedyg: almost...|pg||

nt|hedyg: isn't that very dangerous?|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends which heart nour played first|pg||
nt|lestergold: honour|pg||
nt|lestergold: morelikely to play overfcaller forv short heart|pg||

nt|hedyg: but...........it is tough at both tables|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said at beginnig the transportation is extremely diffcult |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mich-b: without the double declarer might have tried to duck a @S from both hands|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: camouflaging the J@H?|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think jansma not guesses hts |pg||
nt|lestergold: just pulled wrong card as we all do sometimes?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: will be easier now|pg||
nt|hedyg: back comes a @H now?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: difficult now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: still has a decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Did seem fairly intentional|pg||
nt|hedyg: much harder now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: attempted Grosvenor, my favourite|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im told that the lord gave us singletons to lead them for a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Mike!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the Lord bothers with bridge?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes Hedy,  cant you tell?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: how did south think this contract wa going off without pard holding A@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: has not alternative but 9 does he?  would S lead from xx in H!?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would he lead from Jxx???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are they internationals :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: right!|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why he is in tank he cant work it out because it was not exactly a marked defence|pg||
nt|pelu: 26 HCP + solid stoppers - but still almost no play for 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Nunes knew where the 10@d is he could have exited in @d|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jan Jan Jan!!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lord has come to iceland's rescue- Grovesnor by m,istake|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: i think that was a very clever move by Jonsson who obviously did not believe his pd had A@d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: GRosvenor works, gets his trump trick back :) Victory|pg||
nt|hedyg: rather took pd for K@c and A@D in W|pg||
nt|hedyg: remember that Jansame took the 1st trick with A@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma*|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||

nt|jcmax: That 3@C bid was not without risk. But without it might S have led a @D against 4@S? that would have given declarer an easier time|pg||
nt|jcmax: The play on this hand will take a long time, i expect....|pg||

mb|p|pc|h4|mc|6|nt|roswolf: i think it has to be practically dd to make|pg||
nt|jcmax: We all can see that declarer can succeed easily by taking the trump finesse, drawing trumps, playing a low @D to his A and giving up a trick to the @DJ. But playing the @D-suit ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kiwibridge: no finesse required|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: seems a lazy 4@H bid hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: N is obviously short in @s|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Agree, first DBL (take-out) and then 4 H looks better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pressure on N|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: reasonable 6@C here for NS|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: this is a potential disaster -3 if passed|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: when 60 down, might you think of more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubleton*|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have shown a good 5@d bid by first bidding 4n then correcting 5@c to dims but i dont think north would have bid 6 even then |pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/iceland/jonsson-baldursson.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: or rebid 3 @C ,  but light for that |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes passed X's to Jansma|pg||
nt|pelu: better pass to 2@D - and take 7x@h against 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mich-b: but getting 1100 here will be almost as good perhaps|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|mich-b: no, i dont think other room will reach 6@C , but thats not impossible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you rite -1100 more likely|pg||
nt|mich-b: the way to get to 6@C , is for South to double, North to show values via Lebensohl, and South to complete the description by bidding @Cs , going past 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to remove the @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: for most players 2NT would be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: (lebensohl)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: @DJ mb too DD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they'll be pushing to finish before the next scheduled start time|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: "a card"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not too DD for fantoni:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: at first yes but the second bid would have corrected taht impression|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could still have 4+@s and long @ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WOW 7@H reached|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Pity that Rob Helle isn't watching; he's a Tarzan expert and encouraged Bauke en Simon to start using the system (some 5 years ago)|pg||

pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: tell us about Tarzan please Hans|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: ugh,  as we can see probably low @D works better |pg||

nt|hedyg: they play Polish @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|aida_mk_nl: he can open 1@C if his hand in 16+ with 5@C|pg||
nt|pelu: in the syetem he was almost forced to open 1NT|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: then rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: he could open 1@D |pg||
nt|sybarra: he had 16,  |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: then he downgraded his hand probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma feeling robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @D in their system might have been better then  I am sure it will be discussed|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand Nunes is in 3rd seat, he could have anything|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW can make 5 @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 5@cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to get into the bidding for that |pg||
nt|pelu: still red against green - Nunes is a conservativ bidder (no junior-style)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E based on last hand should have opened 1@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think he can open 1 @C |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: I am sure paulissen made  the best bid in his view, it was just unlucky @H distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Aida |pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: yes very interesting board|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this ending in 3@D or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: note that the Italian do NOT bid 1@H with 4 @hs and @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 10@s is a huge card here|pg||
nt|mich-b: wasnt 1@D showing @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Peter Lund :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this should stop low|pg||
nt|hedyg: i do like xfer bids over 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: put the strong hand on lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is awfully string for a NF 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strong|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 4@hs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H seems about right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d = unbalanced with @ds|pg||
nt|pelu: couldn't he bid 3@H (invitational?) - a strong hand would for sure start with X|pg||
nt|hedyg: rare to see a precision 2@c opening with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think i have ever seen that before|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: de Wijs and Muller > WijsMuller > Weismuller > Tarzan :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol cute|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: just as well if they dont get to 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok you can beat 5 by leading @H as N and S underleads his AQJ@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: either 5+ @ds and a singleton somewhere or 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or with 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh yes you are right Michael|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob was 1@d alerted?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2nt a solid contract to be in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes xfrs cc here|pg||
nt|mich-b: I am a bit surprised they had no way to take out to 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He tried to bid 2 clubs over 2 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems Nunes saw a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|mich-b: normally with South's hand one would expect 3@D to play better than 2NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bob|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes that is.|pg||
nt|hedyg: right as he would have over 1NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although all T and 9 are pretty usefull in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fierce discussion ensued.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Solved : ), he can do whatever he wants.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope only with words:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Zia in 5NX-1 on the 4SX hand so 14 to Netherlands|pg||
nt|hedyg: a friendly match |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes tried to bid 2 clubs over 2NT they solved it by all passing|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Peter :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello peter |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jonsson must bid 4H here|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets you all do that specs :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: playing transfers he could bid 2@d and over 2@H 3 @H|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: now then|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no @SJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: TD: this is not fully according to the Laws but if you agree .... and all LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Brink asks Fantoni if he could possibly play a bit faster|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol at that one|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni: your first words where, if it's possible!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: were*|pg||
nt|hedyg: he thinks 3@H=4cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: watch the carding here,  all important |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d ended all hope for EW|pg||
nt|pelu: clever 5@D - if N pass I exp that Paulissen would have X|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: if that's Ice-Relay it just sank when the ice melted|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcwla: E has nicely sitting cards, yes, but a real minimum hand.  Might summon up 3@H (thru some sequence) as W with that length and texture.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that Muller would accept the invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes he could, but i don;t see why that should stop him from making the value bid of 3H when he isnt laying transfers|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 spec tells me he remembers Belladonna opening a superprecision 2@c with 6 6 in 1973........|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots in @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even the great Bella had one lapse in his career ?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Bad hand for the NS-system; N didn't deny 4 H we must assume|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: everything so friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: talking about ""faster"":)|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR catching up with us|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes is already resting his head on the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1H - ? - 4@C would do it|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok 4@H is down as well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but much preferable contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3rd option would be an initial pass :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: just need Qx in @H on side|pg||
nt|hedyg: or AQx|pg||
nt|hedyg: here comes the @d back|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: he can't open @C with @C's but has to open 1N with xx in majors, is this a sound system?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: no overtake???|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: He could open Gary if HE THINK he should|pg||
nt|pelu: in CC: 1@D can be 4@D+5@c|pg||
mc|10|nt|hedyg: surely Jansma did|pg||

mb|3H|nt|sybarra: Mike's son is (name I can not remember) but is playing at highest level in UK, |pg||
mb|4D|nt|hedyg: David?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Mike is rightfully, very proud|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think you can reach 4@H here except if you bash it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 11-15 unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think Jansma would play small when a big chance pd has no more @ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam on ns|pg||
nt|sybarra: prefer to be in clubs dont you Gary |pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h- 4NT by N 2 places to play?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, it is not inconceivable some highly aggressive N or S could X for takeout.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c 11-15 6+@cs or 5+@c +4M|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11-15 unbal at least 3@D|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Bauke foreseeing trouble after 1 Cl opener (16+)|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@H - but 5@h by Jamsma ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: would have pref 4@H opening but then Nunes could 4N|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H's would make it tough, but you are red! |pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni cannot pass|pg||
nt|pelu: red light for children :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe bid 5@d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if cannot bid 4NT|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: specs,  is it David Gold? |pg||
nt|pelu: D=? @s or 3 card @h?|pg||

nt|sybarra: ok  he says I have a PLACE to play |pg||
nt|pelu: can Nunes pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has a @H loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: and anyhow Fantoni isnt asking him for his opinion when he bids 6@c|pg||
nt|pelu: agree in that argument - when pd take a shot - then dont bid on|pg||
nt|pelu: when fixed - stay fixed|pg||
mb|6D|nt|hedyg: 1NT= 4@ss|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: leaving the bidding open?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in pls bid 7 if you stop @hs?|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp he took 6@C as cue with @D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: didn't expect Fantoni would have 6 card support for his side suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c might have been the cue, but 6?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: "Stop the presses.  Who's that?  Vicki Vale."|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Jimmy Olsen|pg||
nt|pelu: why is 5@c not naturel?|pg||
nt|hedyg: even looking at 5 @cs in his hand..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: claim|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: 5@C is on - can setup a@D to discard the @s-loser|pg||

nt|hedyg: now 13 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|jaapfr: these 20-20 1nt are thrilling imo|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: agree 100%|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: ethics |pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Bauke decided that he was much better placed to show 3-suiter after 1 D opener|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Plenty of jokes about not making any contract|pg||

mb|6C|nt|hedyg: A@D?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: They play 1 Cl - 1 D (neg) - 1 H as a relay (19+) and 2 D rebid would deny a major  |pg||

nt|jaapfr: frey|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt that was actual play..|pg||
nt|pelu: correct, Bob?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will never know :(|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: On board 4 (the grand Brink DBLed 3S > 3 N from N, 4 H pass pass pass !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 17 imps on the grand thats a BIG loss|pg||
nt|hedyg: Brink did as we suggested, he bid X over 3@s and 4@H over 3NT...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claimed on the finesses Bob?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Uhuh|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He played the diamonds..|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: this could be sporting|pg||
nt|lc: As shown, he would have gone down (if he ducked a heart).|pg||
nt|pelu: ok he maded 6 - but not as the operator played - tell us Bob - how did he make?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or score, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Quite sure I got it right|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Hans, you are to quick for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: east should bid spades naturally for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way to make 6 that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Want me to ask them afterwards?|pg||
nt|pelu: didn't he loose a @h and a @c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 5 in OR, 1@D by E and by W........ 4@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how did he guess the Qx in @d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S passed?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is a good bid facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: DBL - 3 S ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s=11-15|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: maybe that double = @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play transfer bids|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: knowing that N had 3 cards..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he "gambled", there was some.. relief.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe a squeeze on S?|pg||
nt|lc: Once he ducked a heart (if he did) and played the clubs from the top (normal) he had to be -1.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nevermind they did go downn|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: will get the straightened out |pg||
nt|sybarra: and jams the auction for for n/s |pg||
nt|hedyg: well wow|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: but does it show 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lunch break after this match. Restart at 13.00 local time, in 1 hour and 35 minutes|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: This will TRF them int 4 H :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as I would have bid 1N rather than X....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: guess Bob missed a pass somewhere|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc: A system triumph here, since 1@H is a beautiful contract. (As opposed to 2NT P P P )|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@h = 14+, X = neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 4@S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: methinks n/s have had a foft ride in the bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: soft|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by E imo|pg||
nt|lc: Too early in the morning here -- I think West too light for 2NT  :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@d was relay|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told Drijver apologized after a short discussion|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob undo pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: agree - no barrage made it easier for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nasty sys here in this situation|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for ew|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But you never know, I can ask him afterwards.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|hedyg: but this contract will not make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with natural bidding it would be automatic 4@S by EW down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 4@H a good sac vs 3@s =|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also against 2@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= 11-14 4 @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How did declarer make 9 tricks in 1NT on board 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but surely 3@s would not show strength by E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: operator did:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He didn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: we dont know :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bob was going to correct it Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many did he actually make?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NN=  is the code|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still a chance 4@H will be made here|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlucky all minor honours off side|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sorry, laptop decided to have his own will.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls correct that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: After they finish playing|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: laptops are tricky things|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can't make 4@H can he?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should not|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all suits wrong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: had he bid 1N he wouldn't have this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: the maximum he can make is 9 tricks as far as i can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: King holds, followed by another spade, 8H QH, 2H AH, KH, 2C T Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: If that's understandable|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is!|pg||
nt|hedyg: and E switches to @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: can disc 1@d on a @c but should lose 2@cs, 2@ds and a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Muller is thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yup 5D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double swing for 11 on the 3N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: for the jack, followed by 5C for the ace, and another D|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this should be -2 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Gary, 5@D EW in OR?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubled -2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -1 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get messy |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: wd bob|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: 1@c-1@D-1@H= 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3 clubs  to make S guess, but he can just throw a heart as cards lie|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: where 3N may make|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|lc: or ....|pg||
nt|hedyg: messier on a @d lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: yes or :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since he is always down 1, but can avoid guess for -2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can ruff and lead H, but he might not |pg||
nt|pelu: then N can ruff and give pd a @H-ruff|pg||
nt|jcwla: Welland brought the 4@H home on 5 for a gain of 6 to within 23.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp down 2 - @CQ will be ruffed by S and a @D-loser|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|pelu: S sh have played @C back|pg||
nt|sybarra: still has a @H to lose |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He changed his mind.|pg||
nt|hedyg: without honour they lead high from odd|pg||
nt|pelu: low-high = odd nummer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: or any strong|pg||
nt|hedyg: (18+)|pg||
nt|lc: Presumably, there must be some upper limit since East passed.|pg||
nt|hedyg: they might have other bids to show 20+ after 1@d|pg||
nt|lc: Since 1@H contracts are boring, I take this opportunity to tell you the strange fact that Baldursson taught me how to speak some Icelandic!|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow!|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@c - 1@D - 1NT = 18-20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|hedyg: and small from even|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: @S9|pg||

nt|jaapfr: with regard to bidding it was logic|pg||

nt|roswolf: this looks a good result for the italians next door|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jcmax: It appears E led the @HA against 5@D and then switched to a low @C. That way declarer had to lose only 1 @C-trick|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|daman: and it might happen the same way here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|daman: :)|pg||

nt|jcmax: But what is the hurry of switching to a @C at trick 2?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|daman: none|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk2: In case declarer has 7 diamonds and 2 clubs I suppose|pg||
nt|daman: a trump now would be cool|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 8 diamonds rather|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: he can ruff out the @S King perhaps |pg||
nt|jcmax: DEclarer can always succeed on his own by finessing E for the Q8 in @C, though.|pg||

nt|pelu: strange bidding - I also have the CC - and hedy are correct 1@H = 12-14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from E point of view, hearts were more likely to be 52 because of the 3-level negative double|pg||
nt|hedyg: -1 Bob?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol yes!|pg||

nt|hedyg: it is wonderful that the Dutch have these generous sponsors!|pg||
nt|hedyg: (White House)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 7 even|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a simple slam hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: why only 6?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: 7@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the few countries that have such sponsors|pg||
nt|lc: E-W have a slam -- but have gone conservative.|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.1 sec again Hedy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4HW-2  is the code|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bob trys our patience for the umpteenth time :(|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: 2@c FG|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and they will bid that|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c = gf with @c or balanced or fit @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: only -1 Bob? not -2?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s, 2@ds and 2@cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A light 2@H here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|3S|an|short|nt|marlowepi: N obviously also feared doubleton heart in S hand as he did not play a heart right away when in with spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h was down|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: can now disc a @s on @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Typo, changed it.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is trying hard, it's a very tough job!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: and a claim at trick 1|pg||
nt|lc: It's easy for us to say that West should have balanced, but we see all 52 cards.|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red,  not easy to jump into this bidding maybe|pg||
nt|lc: South could have had some of those hearts that East has.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a great @H suit he has|pg||
nt|lc: There is an expression to cover West's decision: "It is dangerous to bid, it is dangerous to pass."  This time it was the latter.|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody can accuse Jansma of lack of courage :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: W is in trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about pass?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|hedyg: 3NT serious asking for cuebids|pg||
nt|hedyg: and make on a @c guess, but needs a very good guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: as I see - no lead can defeat 5@D by force|pg||
nt|jcwla: A reasonable question to ask is "How will this do if pd has seven points?"|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky @C, would play same from A@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Q of clubs and spade back may be best chance, as N would misguess. but that opening lead would be.........difficult to find:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he shd play low despite opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to believe Muller is handing him the @c suit on a platter|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was t/o for the black suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok Muller could be a bit stronger..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
mb|4S|an|RNC|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: IF knowing 2 clubs and AK K THen we all bid 7@S:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT= even number of keycards|pg||
nt|lc: It's not much fun to be -110 or -130 when you have 1430 available (although, N-S have a good sacrifice against slam).|pg||
nt|hedyg: i was betting on a @s lead|pg||
mb|5S|an|MAX, 2 + HQ|nt|marlowepi: harder to believe he is quickly playing a club from the ace. also he needs much more to be the case to play for club ace on|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: if he can assume that W has 5 @hs then the small @H was preferential|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@c= Q@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: takes guts to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they always play that as short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: could not be fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the suit was set |pg||
nt|sybarra: in hearts|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: yes suit is set and that is @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: 5@D = yes and K@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the crux of this board is the xx of S in @C during bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh 5@c cue and 5@d cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead gave him his 7th trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had no trick in @H if he had to play the suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: so never show @s fit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: and not a 3 card or 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he got his ruff going now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if club king holds there is still a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Interesting point: Muller could DBL 1 H with the blacks, what's the difference. De Wijs assumed Muller had H too for this sequence|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: which was (a bit) true indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: but here he is just balancing|pg||
nt|hedyg: where as if he doubled earlier he might have a better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: like maximum pass|pg||
mc|12|nt|hedyg: 5NT asks for Q@s for 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very nice play will be shorter than bidding?|pg||
nt|hedyg: instant claim|pg||

nt|aida_mk_nl: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Almost a textbook weak-2 here. (or Multi)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: multi it is|pg||
nt|lc: The big weakness of Multi is that with a weak-2 in @S it often allows opponents in with a @H overcall -- but here, South just didn't have enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes pls correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it says 1NT =, it's correct|pg||

mb|1S|nt|hedyg: yes Bob|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile 19 to Welland on 1NX and 6@D making|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hedyg: why pass by Brink?|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2@S from W?|pg||

nt|hedyg: would we all have bid 2@H as W, i would have bid 2@s (positive in @H)|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S = P/C|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh well, we all agree|pg||
nt|lc: So, strange to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|lc: Gives an extra "round" of bidding making it easier for opps to judge.|pg||
nt|pelu: if we all agree - not good :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@HX= takeout of @H|pg||
nt|lc: So important to thoroughly know your agreement against these Multi auctions.|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: not really probably typo, they play optional rkc|pg||
nt|hedyg: there was no play, quick claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: They claimed without play previous game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: super max for 2@C (11-15 and 6 card suit)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they go on like this we will have a 3rd miracle today and Muller / Fantoni will finish before the other table again!|pg||
nt|jcwla: If they bid this slam against you, get back into bed, pull the covers up around you, and don't come out for 24 hours.|pg||

nt|hedyg: is this a transfer?|pg||
nt|lc: Perhaps they treat the X as a strong notrump, and over interference they play x-fer lebensohl --  that, or a typo.|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange IF the double shows short @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No typos|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lc: This surely tests the partnership agreements.  Even a long-time experienced partnership such as N-S can have trouble with such auctions.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 7 EW are in 5@c XX|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty specs :)|pg||
nt|lc: Sounds like we'll lose everyone watching.  Who wouldn't want to watch 5@C XX!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all know 5@c XX makes so not really exciting|pg||
nt|pelu: just 11 tricks from the top - and some play for 12 :(|pg||
nt|lc: So, how does 5@CXX compare to the 1430 that was available in 6@H?|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe it is more fun to see if Baldursson-Jonsson will play in a 4-1 fit. :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: much more fun|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3@S making.|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C several poss - here balanced 15+|pg||
nt|sybarra: 12 off the top |pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: this will be a struggle|pg||
nt|hedyg: they open 1@c with 12.14 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d stopped Fantoni bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: super optimist - going for slam opp a passed pd|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d bid not a surprise for Muller|pg||
nt|pelu: but he is correct|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 180 is there hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no @D lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d t/o for @H+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@S= we have take-off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think you have to be a superoptimist with those clubs and those hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah yes sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: forgot the X|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: a small @s lead is needed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then lean back and wait|pg||
nt|lc: 4th from your longest and strongest.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d X*|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: sstruggle for who?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5!X XX = 1000 and 15 imps|pg||
nt|lc: They can run to 4@C -- and not get X, I'd think.|pg||
nt|lc: What if North runs to 4@D, though, thinking 3@D was natural!|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma trying to scare them into 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: last time EW X - they was close to push opp in 5@c (4@c +1) - no danger here for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|hvdhaar: Board 6 got costly for NS indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: did anybody bring coffee?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Are they using screens? (I doubt it for this kind of match) --  it would be nice to know the table action on who is alering what to whom.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: Bob usually shows the alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: not this time though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yes, screens, I'll add the alerts.|pg||
nt|lc: Well, if ever there was an alert, 3@D had to be one.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d did too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan, by ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: defeating Poland in the final|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @d lead as well if you are talking re play last hand Shirley|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: a hopeless struggle for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: nice Q@d|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and even @D lead ok as the losing @D goes on spade   (thx Jeanine, I didnt look carefully) |pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Baldursson and Jónsson were in that team, but not as partners|pg||
nt|hedyg: this wont be pretty to watch|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E did bid 2H freely too. even spade king and Axxxxx of hearts gives you good play|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to let E ruff a loser|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: nice 8@H|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 1NT making 2.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni passed over 4@d so he wants another lead|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure De wijs didn't exp singelton @s by pd - thjey have 10 card an never bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: that lead saved a trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@H?|pg||
nt|pelu: Welland in 3NT on the 6-3 fit in @h - making after a @c lead - @s-lead would defeat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it, 3 tricks within 5 seconds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is happening Bob?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: you could ask them nicely to slow down?|pg||
mc|9|nt|hedyg: Jansma showed either 2 cards in @S or singleton|pg||
nt|lc: We can see that East can throw minors on the @H's -- but -- it won't be clear to him.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was born in 1991,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: have a glass of my excellent Chardonnay :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No, they are thinking very long on a lot of the problems, resulting in play everything very fast to catch up.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not yet, but he will be later|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will just play @H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: E will be endplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: No he jas 2+@s + 2@h + 2@c ? endplay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options at trick 2, but i expect a spade from dummy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: or unlikely @CA:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should be down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15.45 is CET, in 3 hours and 50 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes -1 now|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: East has at the most INV strenght or else he would have started with 1 N (GF relay)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: In 3NT there appear to be only 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lc: Normal play picks up the @C, of course.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can pick up the J@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c pushed them|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lc: Could get interesting in that both E and W have to keep @H guards and can be thrown in.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 10 3NT in OR, no double|pg||
nt|lc: I;'m guessing the only legit way to beat it was to cash 4@D and then exit (but even then, East might be caught in a major-suit sqz).|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: now a @H back|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: doublefinesse in @H? who will switch to @D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will clear the @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc some @ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again it all goes wrong for no reason|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but would we not all lead @SK against this bidding?|pg||
nt|lc: Here, West has to keep @HKx and East @HJx -- on a double-dummy basis.  So, then they can be tossed in.|pg||
nt|lc: But, declarer is not playing double-dummy. Just work on @H and hope defense doesn't figure out what to do.|pg||
nt|pelu: they cant take 4 @D-tricks now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: yes, then spade ace and jack|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lc: Not easy when declarer has BID @D -- (albeit a nebulous @D) to correctly figure out how to switch to and run 4@D tricks.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: They can't even do it anyway.|pg||
nt|hedyg: E unlikely to switch to @D with the Q@d as menace in dummy|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry back all,  business tried to interfer |pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: and best defense again|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|pelu: he has to discard on the 5.@h and this plan only work with @S kx|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lc: So, a very practical line of play by Jonsson.|pg||
nt|hedyg: wishing he had passed 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: TD announces '25 mins'|pg||
nt|pelu: Jansma has min for his X - but all other bidding almost OK - but unlucky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and we are only halfway!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: TD "sry, 1 hour more"|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 25 mins for 9 boards, joking surely|pg||

mb|p|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|jcmax: sometimes it is a good idea to bid 1NT on hands like this because it can make it easier to get to @D later. if you respond with 1@S and partner bids 2@C over that, it is impossible ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: to get to @D anymore.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec suggests an italian's convention (Garozzo !?) over 1@H 2@S = 4 @S + 6 of minor :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Interesting aspect Sabine mentions. You miss a possible spade fit of course, but in the long run I think it's right to respond 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice gadget if you have it in your bag|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H  1@S   is actually not a very good start to an auction. It often turns out to create problems later|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: It sounds economical, and in a sense it is, but it does not always work that way|pg||
nt|jcmax: On this hand, however, it could have worked well. W would have rebid 1NT and then if EW played a system where 2@C forces 2D they would have been there!|pg||
nt|roswolf: zia did a scissors coup in @C which is a pleasant sight to see|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed sabine|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|jcwla: 4@D seems more helpful.|pg||
nt|hedyg: much|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile 3NT can make w/o @H lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: imps still being "traded" evenly though so no great change in the score gap|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: Is this "don't lead @S"?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2.5 @h from North|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely leaping to 4 @H here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= gf 5+ cards|pg||

nt|marlowepi: a lucky 5D here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Muller worried about @hs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should be|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp after the X|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I don't quite see Nunes as a GF he must have his rosy spectacles on|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told it is an artificial minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: this is how very friendly the atmosphere is over here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10 is gf opposite 14+|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: is Nunes crying yet Bob :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can he make with @hs 3-3?|pg||
nt|pelu: and @SJ in S - close to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with fit|pg||
nt|pelu: remember that 1@S = 14+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT would be 5+ with fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and one more - Jan is back now|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: De Wijs could have bid 3@H with force in @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: Is it that lucky? looks like a @d dropping or the @c finesse right|pg||
nt|pelu: need @H lead to defeat 3NT - 4@d+4@s + @cA - |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: great auction though contract needs luck to make|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: such soft values maybe quite useless|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: here W has no space to explore so 3NT does not necessarily show great strength in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs less luck now|pg||
nt|rhelle: and with the opening in North (sound openings) that looks pretty likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni seems surprised|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff and play @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: looks well within the 35% or so range you need to bid a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting cards ... the low @s indicates on honour|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: not sure how the spade lead means less luck. it didnt tell E anything he didnt already know, and meanwhile it compromises his options|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hedyg: he didnt expect the @s fit|pg||
nt|pelu: and 4@s play easy - 4@h need some hard work|pg||
nt|hedyg: we get to see deep Fantunes at work|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry that is Deep Fantoni|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the more I look the less GF I see |pg||
nt|hedyg: this may take a while|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some sort of @S raise |pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 10 hcps, fit and good 6 card side suit and if that isnt enough he has a void as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: good enough for me in 2/1 or any other  |pg||
nt|hedyg: how much more do you need?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly... he has a poor @D suit , poor @H suit and a void, but does have @S support|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid a NF 1NT??????|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: F: "sorry"|pg||
nt|hedyg: (he is always very polite)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am sure he was planning to show the @s fit next when the 2@H bid came along|pg||
nt|sybarra: No peter I would not bid a non forcing nt |pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Welland found a way to play 3@s on bd 10|pg||
nt|pelu: Dont take that serius - just a joke - I find 2@D a fine bid :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry only 2@ss but -3|pg||
nt|pelu: and IMPs back on the next board (the 4@H on 5-1 fit) here Welland i 3@D making|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: close to play a card now as I see it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: if making 180/ 200 in 3@C - so best for S to pass - and hope|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: duck it now?  you up for that at table?|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently he is |pg||
