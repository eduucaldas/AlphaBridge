nt|kiwibridge: (n)Ice|pg||
nt|lestergold: may explore for 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL Gary|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason for north not to hold A@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: re Bob and good luck with mice|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 5@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Thanks|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have seen it before today|pg||
nt|lestergold: a void showing diamond bid now would not excite north too much|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry 5@d of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d quite enuf|pg||
nt|sybarra: was clearly before I got out of bed,  its only 714a here now |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d i meant|pg||

nt|hedyg: 5@d by S|pg||
nt|lestergold: go back shirley much too early for u|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d not void|pg||
nt|sybarra: early person here,  this is "late start" for me |pg||

nt|sybarra: forcing |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c = atrificial gf|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d too much spade taken up|pg||
nt|lestergold: south wants to give north space to cue club if he has it|pg||

nt|sybarra: now can bid 4 @D? |pg||

nt|hedyg: and then the 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n merely abouy miscjief|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: I think n/s in forcing auction,  so just a matter of seeing how far e/w want to hang themselves|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: im  told that 4@d means 4 controls|pg||

pc|s3|nt|hedyg: really 4@H?|pg||

mc|7|nt|hedyg: K@d is 1 control, the 2 aces are 2 each, that makes 5|pg||

mb|1N|an|12-14?|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Back to our asymmetric 8-card red suit fits|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Case for West trying 3NT over the weak no-trump...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: what a prediction!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cuttysark: We members of the weak Nt club have to stick together :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If I'd tried that comment, would have seen a pass, or 2@H or something|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Now does he stick it?  -710 looks eminently possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: But now he is worried about leavint the penalty double|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: Must confess I would wimp to 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Right - he's decided his 3NT was actually a psyche, and therefore he cannot leave 4@D whacked|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: 3NT was no psyche, but he just doesn|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: t have enough defensive tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Sometimes you just have to believe a vulnerable opponent|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Playing UDCA, North doesn't know who has the last diamond|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West less likely to have a singleton after his 3NT bid, I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: couldn't see the south heart|pg||

nt|vugraphzgr: you lost the bet|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rmb1: Defense seem to be doing the right things|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West's gallant attempt to keep North off lead fails...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But this is the key point - does South try to cash a heart?  Or go for the club ruff/diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cuttysark: but it's another 2 - how many 2s are there in this pack?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|s3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: club 3 looks wrong|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lestergold: well 4@s is a lucky make|pg||

nt|lestergold: 5@h is one ioff|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|hedyg: nooooooooooo|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no description of 4 level openings on their CC|pg||
nt|lestergold: west may phantom at this vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: take insurance|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "insurance" may lead to opps going to 5 level |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mich-b: of course the traditional approach is not to preempt with a side 4 card major|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H from Nunes would be 10-13|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass pass 1@s|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Hi all|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mich-b: A "disciplined" action by Drijver - not opening 3@C , like some players would do , convinced by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly thatb sort of hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: can make 5@c NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob undo pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i would consider 5@s off one a normal result on hand altho it isnt par|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jan being disciplined |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bob pls undo|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass by south is missing|pg||
nt|mich-b: but some "modern" players , tend to ignore this advice|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think he didnt want to preempt his partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Apologies|pg||
nt|hedyg: E did not open 1@H|pg||

nt|hedyg: W 1@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: np Bob :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it is still wrong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's still wrong bob|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jan=Jansma|pg||
nt|lestergold: east nolt being disciplined|pg||
nt|sybarra: and his name is Jan Jansma |pg||
nt|lestergold: however north is still there|pg||
nt|hedyg: this will not make|pg||
nt|hedyg: after a @s lead they switch to @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni doesnt like it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for 1255|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would use something like 3@D by E to show a LR in @S.  3@S often just shows a max single raise.|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: got there!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: well a good result for Iceland extracti8ng maximum avaialble on the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma is extremely proud of his hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @hs 3 3 this should make nicely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very friendlt hand for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to lead a D, and with clubs 22 doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Jordan i am surprised by the 3@s bid too|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's pretty much implicit that S has to have some fit for one of the minors here.  Probably not trotting out 4@H for the first time without the ability to go to 5m as needed.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean after one spade|pg||
nt|pelu: what would u bid? - 3@S NF - they can use 3@c and 3@D as fircing/invitational bids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense has a chance on spade out and diamond shift|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure they can|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: would need to lead K@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so he should be :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could decide to play W for three clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unwise X in my opinion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely S was prepared all along to bid 5C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W opened in 3rd seat at favorable|pg||
nt|hedyg: X= i underbid my hand ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W white on red in third, E does not have trump trick - I agree with your assessment, Marshall.|pg||
nt|hedyg: names will be up as soon as Bob has a moment|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: guess we are watching a recording :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: East knows that East will not have 4 card @S support|pg||
nt|hedyg: the balancing double by Fantoni allowed E to bid again and get to play in his 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would raise to 2@S with that rather than pass|pg||
nt|mich-b: so he prefers the 7 card suit , to the 4-3 fit|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|hedyg: tricky lead!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: those @C's are only useful as trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs 3-2, @ss on side..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fantunes play what are called Slavinsky leads very tricky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they only underlead aces when it is right :p|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course|pg||
nt|mich-b: best for he defense is to stay passive, and let declarer work on the @S suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: E surely has a singleton @H or void, the question is where is the 10@H (for Fantoni)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not normally this slow when defending a part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni? LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even he|pg||
nt|hedyg: yesterday there was a miracle when the table where both Fantoni and Muller played finished before the other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Shirley.|pg||
nt|hedyg: re|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling on the diamonds very dubious because S has announced trick source in hearts and E has 3 small|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no D is o nly chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play @c|pg||
nt|pelu: look at that dummy - East prob play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D only chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: or even @H in case S has K@s and W A@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i predict he will play diamond king|pg||
nt|pelu: Mullers best chance : I take my X back :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S marked with one diamond at most|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can that beat it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am with Peter :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: undo the double |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact, since S is known to have 6 strong hearts from the auction, his pass marks him with this shape almost surely|pg||
nt|pelu: the best chance is 4-6-1-2 in S and then he sh play C to kill Ss hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond lead is only chance because declarer might play W for three clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer will play to win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that shape is almost impossible,|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Marschall - have a bet (just a coke) - No @D from East :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @d back he can play 2 @hs to disc 1 @d and ruff 3, last ruff W overruffs with ace and thats all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when we look at the auction that S has followed, it is clear he was always preared to bid 5C, and he did not open with six strong hearts which almost surely means 4 spades. hence ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4603|pg||
nt|pelu: No Marshal, 2@H = 10-13 HCP|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 10 hcps to open with, they do not have weak openings for 6 card suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes there are many things he can do to make as cards lie Hedy, but they won;t all work if W has three clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well dont they play multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure they will! he just has to have 2 @hs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
mc|9|nt|sybarra: as good a hand as he could have given the bidding  (maybe an ace extra) |pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|mb|r|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I imagine that 2@S is North's weakest action here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: yes, shows what kind of 1NT he had: raise to weak fo 2S directly|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|rmb1: This could be flat 3@H can go off|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: the first two laptops I tried didn't work somehow, this one is about 1/3 the size of the others|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: so forgive me my typos|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: If only declarer had an entry to dummy ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So a 'pairs' auction pushes South to 3@S where he will make the same 9 tricks|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Removing their own heart exits is not the way... but they can still do it, I guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a real interesting hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: Three rounds of @D now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: no entry so looks like 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The key seems to me to be for the defence to not play a third heart until the "end" - as Liz points out|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: And on this line of play, their challenge is to switch to diamonds|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|d|an|takeout|nt|cuttysark: doesn't need the break - a spade ruff in dummy look safe enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The CR auction is a good example of a key point about Blackwood|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: South couldn't have any idea whether a grand slam would make; however when the response to Blackwood revealed all the key cards |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: He was duty bound to tell his partner - who in this case, could know the grand was making|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: I like Brink's double followed by 4H.. just the right amount I think|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Certainly it's an unusual auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And certainly North simply didn't read South's intentions|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: Drijver explains to Brink that he interpreted dbl followed by 4H as showing doubt, a 5-card suit or a weak 6-card suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Since North did not double South knows he is unlikely to have hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: Brink says not|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: seems a lazy 4@H bid hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: N is obviously short in @s|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Agree, first DBL (take-out) and then 4 H looks better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pressure on N|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mich-b: reasonable 6@C here for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: indeed there was|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks an easy 4 @S |pg||
mb|4N|nt|jaapfr: this is a potential disaster -3 if passed|pg||
nt|hedyg: Baldursson : they always bid my doubelton when i double!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when 60 down, might you think of more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubleton*|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have shown a good 5@d bid by first bidding 4n then correcting 5@c to dims but i dont think north would have bid 6 even then |pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/iceland/jonsson-baldursson.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: but getting 1100 here will be almost as good perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you believe other room 6@C bid?|pg||
nt|mich-b: note Fantoni's pass , on the strength of his @H10|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: S is definitely too good for a 3@c bid and how else to get to 6@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would that not have shown 2 places to play ?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: South has to bid a grand now ... N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW play Tarzan Precision wow sounds exciting|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play Ice-relay precision|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: in a good hand|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|mich-b: no, i dont think other room will reach 6@C , but thats not impossible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you rite -1100 more likely|pg||
nt|mich-b: the way to get to 6@C , is for South to double, North to show values via Lebensohl, and South to complete the description by bidding @Cs , going past 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to remove the @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: for most players 2NT would be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: (lebensohl)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: quess @HJ or @S9|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni knows that Nunes does not have the J@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DJ mb too DD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they'll be pushing to finish before the next scheduled start time|pg||
nt|hedyg: so playing @s is not tempting|pg||
nt|sybarra: now where to begin |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: "a card"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not too DD for fantoni:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: at first yes but the second bid would have corrected taht impression|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could still have 4+@s and long @ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WOW 7@H reached|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Pity that Rob Helle isn't watching; he's a Tarzan expert and encouraged Bauke en Simon to start using the system (some 5 years ago)|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it should be his duty to be here with us!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: tell us about Tarzan please Hans|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: ugh,  as we can see probably low @D works better |pg||
nt|jcwla: Not free of pitfalls.  Meanwhile, 1 was a push when 3NT made in the OR, also with the help of a @S trick.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: went all the way to dummy to play K@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may as well go light now|pg||
nt|lestergold: With 4 spades and 5+ dims he would bid 4@s not risking the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it again, I'm very sorry.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mike he could have a better hand with @s and @d and not want to just bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty tough contract to play i would say|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: now J@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would love to hear his thinking analysis in these both tricks:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play @s to ace and a @D back he can ruff and play K@C since S surely has A@c and no more @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: possible but more important to use the 4n bid in the manner i described that standard bidding to show good dims|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: i think S should have won the D to play hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: what for?|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: And West's overcall has little to recommend it|pg||

nt|rnmalik: True.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yup, 100% each :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Solomon would approve ... but I am a little more sympathetic.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: if that's Ice-Relay it just sank when the ice melted|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: E has nicely sitting cards, yes, but a real minimum hand.  Might summon up 3@H (thru some sequence) as W with that length and texture.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that Muller would accept the invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes he could, but i don;t see why that should stop him from making the value bid of 3H when he isnt laying transfers|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: Well, the point is that 1@D has zero pre-emptive effect ... in fact it's an anti-preempt, giving the opponents more options than over a pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Therefore, it needs to be bid with a clear reason in mind - hence Liz's comment|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: it is true that 1D itself has little effect, but sometimes a raise to 2D or 3D will do lots of damage|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: ... or 5@D|pg||

mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: and a claim at trick 1|pg||
nt|lc: It's easy for us to say that West should have balanced, but we see all 52 cards.|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red,  not easy to jump into this bidding maybe|pg||
nt|lc: South could have had some of those hearts that East has.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a great @H suit he has|pg||
nt|lc: There is an expression to cover West's decision: "It is dangerous to bid, it is dangerous to pass."  This time it was the latter.|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody can accuse Jansma of lack of courage :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: W is in trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about pass?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT serious asking for cuebids|pg||
nt|hedyg: and make on a @c guess, but needs a very good guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: as I see - no lead can defeat 5@D by force|pg||
nt|jcwla: A reasonable question to ask is "How will this do if pd has seven points?"|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky @C, would play same from A@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Q of clubs and spade back may be best chance, as N would misguess. but that opening lead would be.........difficult to find:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he shd play low despite opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to believe Muller is handing him the @c suit on a platter|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was t/o for the black suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok Muller could be a bit stronger..|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: IF knowing 2 clubs and AK K THen we all bid 7@S:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT= even number of keycards|pg||
nt|lc: It's not much fun to be -110 or -130 when you have 1430 available (although, N-S have a good sacrifice against slam).|pg||
nt|hedyg: i was betting on a @s lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: harder to believe he is quickly playing a club from the ace. also he needs much more to be the case to play for club ace on|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he can assume that W has 5 @hs then the small @H was preferential|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|hedyg: 5@c= Q@S?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 5@D = yes and K@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the crux of this board is the xx of S in @C during bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh 5@c cue and 5@d cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead gave him his 7th trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had no trick in @H if he had to play the suit himself|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: and not a 3 card or 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he got his ruff going now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if club king holds there is still a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Interesting point: Muller could DBL 1 H with the blacks, what's the difference. De Wijs assumed Muller had H too for this sequence|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: which was (a bit) true indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: but here he is just balancing|pg||
nt|hedyg: where as if he doubled earlier he might have a better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: like maximum pass|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: 5NT asks for Q@s for 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very nice play will be shorter than bidding?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: Almost a textbook weak-2 here. (or Multi)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: multi it is|pg||
nt|lc: The big weakness of Multi is that with a weak-2 in @S it often allows opponents in with a @H overcall -- but here, South just didn't have enough.|pg||

nt|pelu: why not 2@S from W?|pg||
nt|lc: If 2@S was pass/correct, that would seem to be a better choice.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would we all have bid 2@H as W, i would have bid 2@s (positive in @H)|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S = P/C|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh well, we all agree|pg||
nt|lc: So, strange to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|lc: Gives an extra "round" of bidding making it easier for opps to judge.|pg||
nt|pelu: if we all agree - not good :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@HX= takeout of @H|pg||
nt|lc: So important to thoroughly know your agreement against these Multi auctions.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: super max for 2@C (11-15 and 6 card suit)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they go on like this we will have a 3rd miracle today and Muller / Fantoni will finish before the other table again!|pg||
nt|jcwla: If they bid this slam against you, get back into bed, pull the covers up around you, and don't come out for 24 hours.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d looks right|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d???|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this a transfer?|pg||
nt|lc: Perhaps they treat the X as a strong notrump, and over interference they play x-fer lebensohl --  that, or a typo.|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange IF the double shows short @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No typos|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: we all know 5@c XX makes so not really exciting|pg||
nt|pelu: just 11 tricks from the top - and some play for 12 :(|pg||
nt|lc: So, how does 5@CXX compare to the 1430 that was available in 6@H?|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe it is more fun to see if Baldursson-Jonsson will play in a 4-1 fit. :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: much more fun|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3@S making.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this will be a struggle|pg||

nt|hedyg: 4@d stopped Fantoni bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: super optimist - going for slam opp a passed pd|pg||

nt|hedyg: 5!X XX = 1000 and 15 imps|pg||
nt|lc: They can run to 4@C -- and not get X, I'd think.|pg||
nt|lc: What if North runs to 4@D, though, thinking 3@D was natural!|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma trying to scare them into 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: last time EW X - they was close to push opp in 5@c (4@c +1) - no danger here for EW|pg||

nt|hedyg: that lead saved a trick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: Jansma showed either 2 cards in @S or singleton|pg||
nt|lc: We can see that East can throw minors on the @H's -- but -- it won't be clear to him.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: have a glass of my excellent Chardonnay :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: lol ty|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: disced an ace|pg||
nt|lc: He is probably thinking : "If @S run, down anyway, so let me make sure not to throw away a minor."|pg||
nt|lc: For example, a @D discard would be disastrous if declarer had @DAKQxx.|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose a @C discard is unlikely to hurt in most layouts.|pg||
nt|pelu: can W signal in "hs that he like the @S-lead?|pg||
nt|lc: Smith echo -- hi-lo in @H would say "Like @S"|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose having a 2nd space could mean liking them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Smith on their CC|pg||
nt|pelu: LH = even - no "smith"|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Baldursson was surely pleased to see a @S discard.  :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||

mb|2S|nt|roswolf: this looks too bold|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3@C on 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|pelu: better if Fantoni takes @CK also and force pd to play major - block the suit at get the setting trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller had 2 options: 1NT to show @s, and 2@d non-forcing. What is best here?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: minors :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was on|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rhelle: Well given the risk that every suit breaks badly, I think it's very aggressive|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well i think a shift was clear. only question whether spades or diamonds, and N card shd be SP|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland just bid 4@H, not 4@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: while Jansma (S) showed his @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st X was balancing, 2nd X showed a good hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: i think 2D better with a stiff heart, closer decision with a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not make this|pg||

pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: great auction though contract needs luck to make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: here W has no space to explore so 3NT does not necessarily show great strength in @s|pg||

nt|rhelle: and with the opening in North (sound openings) that looks pretty likely|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rhelle: looks well within the 35% or so range you need to bid a vulnerable game|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The commentators were fast, that helped|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And well done also to my co-commentators, Liz, Rashed and Robin (the keeper of the N/S system!)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally our appreciation to the NBB (Marc van Beijsterveldt) and the sponsor, Hans Melchers for putting on this broadcast.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Brink-Drijver missed a Grand on Board 4 - don't think they will repeat that here|pg||
mb|2C!|an|strong|mb|d|nt|rmb1: Fascinating match.  Interest to the end and the scores are tight|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The next session starts in 45 minutes.  Don't go away, because it will feature Mr Zia and Fantunes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: I didn't catch the explanation of the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, if North bids 5@D at any point, it will be Exclusion Blackwood, and that will be the end of the story|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 13 cards, some of them black, or red?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: 2C is only strong, very few Dutch pairs play this|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I bet South's pass was alerted :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, 2@C incorporating a weak option was a Dutch invention, was it not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: no not alerted, and when asked Brink said something and shrugged|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: unfortunately I couldn|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: t hear what he said|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not vulnerable, 2@C = weak @D or strong (artificial)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "It probably means something but I forget"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: smells like tomato soup here, hurry up guys|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: People asking what's the score for 2@C redoubled making 7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The first problem is that it only makes 6 on the @DA lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: Drijver: pas shows something, some values|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rmb1: Is that right operator?  5@C is brave by East|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surely Haraldsson has done enough with his pre-emptive double?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: it is, and I still don't kn0w what the double is|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|rmb1: What is the score for 5@CX -11 ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has done more than enough ... pretty much killed the grand via the N/S confusion|pg||

nt|vugraphzgr: it seems they had all the bidding decisions right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N is a great hand for specific Ace ask opening a la the Schenken 2@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes indeed, it was exciting stuff - usually is when Baldursson is around|pg||
nt|rmb1: East succeeded in suggesting an entirely different hand from the one he held|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: not an easy hand for the defense, how many black suited tricks can they take before the diamonds provide pitches|pg||
