nt|petergill: Bulg 13.50, Denmark 30|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C both majors|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D = please bid your longer major|pg||
nt|christinas: Hm, perhaps he should consider showing it as spades only|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT was 12-14|pg||
nt|petergill: North might try 3NT, with the solid spades|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: but North might be worried that with partner likely to be 2-2 in the majors (the 2@D bid suggests equal length), perhaps hearts are a bit weak for 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2NT was a good bid - passing 2@S would have been less successful|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in CR - lead @C to Q|pg||
nt|pelu: and then @H A @H 3 to king|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|christinas: i confess i am surprised S bid on. As I play 2@c is limited since otherwise I would D a weak nt, so with only 10 balanced and misfit he still  bids 2nt|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: If @HA is offside, then West cannot have @CA, hence the low club was best from dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: South's reasoning would be (roughly): 2@S might go down, so why not be in 2NT?, with the upside that sometimes partner will be able to bid 3NT. Why put all your eggs in one basket ...|pg||
nt|petergill: by making 2@S the only possible contract - 2Nt covers more bases. If partner returns to 3@S, I can always pass that. |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: now S is looking for overtricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, when one opponent has shown 12-14 points, the declarer play will be so much easier - placing the cards being easier, hence aggression towards a vul game is in order|pg||
nt|christinas: I would see a big risk in getting too high. N has a very good hand for 2@c, he could hardly have more, but easily less with distribution, since he would D 1nt with 14+|pg||
nt|petergill: and vul games at imps should (mathematically) be bid on about 24 or 23 points, according to my calculations|pg||
nt|petergill: At this vulnerability he is less likely to double 1NT, as penalties at this vulnerability are not so attractive|pg||
