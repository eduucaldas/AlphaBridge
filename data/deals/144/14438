nt|odysseus69: same contract next door|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer's correct line of play is not obvious|pg||
nt|odysseus69: The welsh pair is a father-son combination - France usually has one of these|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he wants to enjoy his clubs, he needs to draw 2 trumps with a finesse and switch to clubs, a comfort that the opening lead is threatening to damage|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I left closed room where they had just received a trump lead which should have made it easy for declarer|pg||
nt|psridhar: going after diamonds would mean ruffing with dummy's strong trumps and in his hand he has poor trumps|pg||
nt|psridhar: an Unenviable situation for the delcarer|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a second spade will make this very tough|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi|pg||
nt|psridhar: Yes Victor -the spd lead is superb for defense|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning Tony and PS|pg||
nt|psridhar: good morning Victor and Tony|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and good morning Victor and PS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think there may be communication problem - the delay feels too long|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, perhaps, but its a tough hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer is likely to win 2nd spd in hand and play a trump to queen -hoping the club will be ruffed by 3 card trump hand-works here |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Mari has been a great player for decades and has been playing in wrnklies -sorry Seniors recently|pg||
nt|psridhar: but that will lose 2 trumps and 2 aces sry no it wont work|pg||
nt|odysseus69: vugraph operater is there a problem?|pg||
nt|psridhar: try ruffing 2nd spd in dummy , finesse h, and hope it is not covered? :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that we will miss the play here- probably at board 5 by now|pg||
nt|psridhar: if first h from dummy is not covered decl can yank out 3 trumps and claim when dia ace is rt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, missed play board 1 too...that seems to have interesting results|pg||
