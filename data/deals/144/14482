mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: Fit jump from East.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the field has been invited into 2 groups and after a round robin the leading 9 teams from each group qualify for 2nd round robin but play only against teams from other group- this ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has the effect of shortening the event|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@S is here a good safe against 5@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will be reluctant to let 5@D play.|pg||
nt|sommer: guess so, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S perhaps from South.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|petergill: England is 3rd of 19, Russia is only 18th of 19 teams. 19 in each Group, 9 teams qualify from each group (with carry forward) then the 18 teams play another round robin.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sommer: 6@C makes:)..?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: Not a format that encourages teams to include a sponsor because you need maximum IMPs from every match.|pg||

mb|4N|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
mb|5D|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|5S|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
mb|6D|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||

nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *East|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 3NT   easy if playing diamonds from the top   and have other chances even if diamonds are 4-1|pg||

mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: well it all depends @s guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||

nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||

nt|petergill: 2NT = limit raise on their system card|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South looks like an obvious 3S bid but maybe 2NT has wide range|pg||
nt|brolucius: Partnerships need to discuss which of Pass and 3@S is weaker. Best is to play 3@S as the weakest bid, since you are already committed to that level.|pg||

nt|andyv:  20-20 hands usually don't travel too far in the bidding|pg||

nt|lestergold: what then?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some nbooks its simply a minimum 1 @s opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess even red stickers|pg||
nt|ady: west baled out as soon as possible|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||

nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||

pc|c4|nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||

nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||

mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 5NT usually asking for side-suit king to be named.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a 5th diamond is all East needs|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he will bid 6@H, needing a bit more for 7@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: + c singleton|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|nt|sommer: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: West did bid 3@S ....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only 12 points accounted for in West so must have some other value|pg||
nt|odysseus69: successful punt|pg||
nt|petergill: so it looks to East like the heart hook at worst, after 6@D showed @DK|pg||
nt|brolucius: The sort of board where there is too much luck involved. Not that I am particularly worried on this particular occasion.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West raised to only 2@S at the other table, so there was no chance to bid the grand.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: New leaders in the match|pg||

nt|rodvenn: 2 strange slams to Iceland|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Iceland leads now by a mile|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pelu: I have seen that the match in Women: Israel - Libanon didnt start - we had that problem 10 years ago - but I hoped that sport now overruled politic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cold slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have saved a trick drawing a trump at the end|pg||
nt|ady: grand here|pg||
nt|ady: but on heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: granny on a finegle|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: 50-50? then good:)|pg||

nt|lestergold: ordinary mortals in 6 of course|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pelu: but late arivel can explain|pg||
nt|pauleger: piekarek tested @ss first to check, how they behave|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 7 :P|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C from Dubinin now? or 4@h?|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a super fly hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which given layout makes|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
mb|4N|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: or just ask K and roll the dice - worst scenario|pg||
nt|copeyj: and judging by response id say just kc for @S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rmb1: East knows West can't have enough for grand, given limited 1@D opening|pg||

nt|lestergold: Gold has decided to get out of this misfit auction early|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|petergill: NS play Standard|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|petergill: with transfer responses to 11C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: justin deciding on possible later entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: to 1@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1h= spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many pairs use transfers opposite a 1@C opening. |pg||
nt|brolucius: And most use a 2@S rebid to show a minimum hand with four-card support. |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|petergill: NS play 2/1 GF, Standard, for those who don't believe that Russian pairs play Standard|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C = artificial game try (usually)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C is an enquiry of some kind|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West's double will deter East from bidding, if he still had any thought in that direction (which was unlikely).|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H may show 4 card spades or maybe not- he plans to bid 4S on next round|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 11@C = Standard, 1@H = 4+ spades, 11@S = 3 or (minimum with) 4 spades, 2@C game try, artificial - their system notes stop there but I guess 2@H = natural, non minimum perhaps|pg||
nt|brolucius: A lot of fancy bidding on two quite ordinary hands.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|petergill: if 2@H not natural, it would have been alerted|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: last board- doesnt time fly- thx all- and bon apetit to me|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: No clues at either table about East being 6-5 in the red suits ---> such clues might make the declarer play easier|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: 7@S on Bd 16 bid 5 times in Women's including by Ireland, bid 4 times in Group B - all = 2210 of course|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|rmb1: Hi, interloping from CR.  We think CR 2@D on board 19 was -1.  So small lead to Russia|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East got a quick warning off next door when North opened 1 heart|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Robin, and Bd 7 in Closed Room was really 660 not 690 (according to official scores) so England can add another imp to their "lead"|pg||
nt|odysseus69: d now looks best|pg||

nt|petergill: The Russians did well to put their (this) pair who were fined 5 VPs (altered to 3 VPs on protest) yesterday for slow play against the very fast Hackett twins - still 25 minutes of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: session time left here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no rush to play trumps but it is a world-wide disease|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|xenya: last hand now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4cards M ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: Didn't the defence have 2 trumps for the last three tricks?  Declarer claiming 2 tricks was unlikely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ACOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: the last few tricks looked strange like why would towsend not play the third spade rather than the heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: Auken - von Arnim played only 2@h on this board|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: last 5 tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: i agree hamid all very strange|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: this only possible very fast players there, also in a long marathon operators got tired|pg||
nt|lestergold: a savage misfit in the side suits and a nasty spade layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|rmb1: Me (and some spec.s - thanks) think defence took 2@H and 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we all think that Robin|pg||

nt|h_karluk: good morning from South Carolina USA, 07am here|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: now its a question of damage limitation contract likely to be same in open |pg||
pc|c4|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: might be too late|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each IMPs vital|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|xenya: 12 tricks were available here, but declarer is playing it safe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and they are in vul|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: that was the last hand -- thanks everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: and don't forget -- the score here is almost certainly wrong|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far Russia is near to win |pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: that was 1 imp to Russia if 2@D made    but I suspect should be 4 imps  2 diamonds down 1|pg||

nt|lestergold: club so helpful|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way sir|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless it grovesnor's townsend|pg||
nt|h_karluk: West guaranteed to set|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: yes but wurestion of how many off as contract likely to be same ion open was my point|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many off is critical and this club has limited the damage for townsend|pg||
nt|h_karluk: coup en passant there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so always off one|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: on eoff could earn 3 imps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: c u after an hour|pg||
nt|rmb1: bye|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always only one off|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: close match|pg||
nt|lestergold: if at that point he pkays spade spade declarer has to lose 2 clubs and go 2 ioff or one club abd a dim|pg||
