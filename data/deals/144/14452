mb|p|nt|jtr: Jonsson will get their name into the bulletin on the very first board!|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just been through the play in 6@S. I may be only half awake, but it seems that declarer claimed when he could only make one down. That can't be right, so perhaps I need ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: another coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: I am told there was a misdefence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator Bas van Beijsterveldt|pg||
nt|athene: some use 2@C for the same purpose|pg||
nt|daman: Hey Bas    good luck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine 3@C being Puppet Stayman after which LV reverse 3@H and 3NT|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Billand Roland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So 3@H denies 4/5M and 3@S is a puppet to 3NT after which N may offer minors|pg||
nt|daman: this is the par contract no matter the bidding|pg||
