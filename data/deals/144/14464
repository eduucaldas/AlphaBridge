mb|p|nt|caitlin: a heart partial E-W|pg||
mb|2S|nt|anamtebha:  He had a @s rebid later to compete so there wasn't a need to put them in a gf auction|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: you need it, especially when down|pg||

mb|p|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|caitlin: ok NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfj: interesting points, however, the fact he freely bid 5@h suggests he felt he didn't describe his hand accurately in the first place :)|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: declarer will likely attack @d, he doesnt have the entries to dummy to set up @hs|pg||

nt|caitlin: or tactically best to get rid of @SA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kjadams: a 9 count with heart support.   I doubt he bid to go down|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|s6|nt|anamtebha:  if pard has 1@d the auction isn't dying at 2@h. There would be a raise or competition of some kind i think|pg||
nt|anamtebha:  I think it boils down to the imp score. E/W are trying to pick up imps|pg||

mb|3S!|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|3N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|mr murray: dont think e will try for slam but if he does w will be more than happy to cooperate. Looks like zero play needs a good heart position that is not there|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mr murray: gonnqa lose a lot now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: there is a pseudo squeeze on South   he has to keep all 4 hearts to set|pg||
mb|4H|an|key card !D|nt|vugraphzfe: Gitelman on lead and nothing attractive:  has to avoid a low club|pg||
nt|mr murray: gitleman goopd enuff to play partner for cspade 10  he knows all about parity in hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|2, no Q|mb|p|nt|jlrice: my fault   not likely to get into a pseudo squeeze position|pg||
nt|jlrice: if beatty's Q was in any other suit though the contract would be lay down|pg||
nt|mr murray: ak hearts right line. hopping for 3-3 or dbltn honor in South's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the slam defense will not be at all trivial,   South will need help from partner:  carding that says "I like spades by North"|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mr murray: very unlucky in that respect. west has a super 20 with all controls. that is why beatty's slam try is questionable. he hit perfwecta and still not enuff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Beatty needed to have his side queen "working"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: why is Jacobs thinking now?|pg||
nt|mr murray: Gitleman will never release a heart unless a gun put to his head :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: he might be thinking about putting it in 6nt |pg||
