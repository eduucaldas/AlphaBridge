nt|curtis: why did goerge pass 2C?|pg||
nt|curtis: I guess he didn't want a spade lead against 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Happy to have you join us Allan|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S!|an|5+ some minor, 4-card Major|mb|d|nt|algraves: normal 3NT or 5D|pg||
nt|algraves: George has resorted his hand and found his spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2@S explained as 5+ minor (either)|pg||
nt|algraves: he has always claimed to be a better defender than declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: along with some 4-card Major|pg||
nt|curtis: Brad and Fred have a very unusual 1NT structure.  My eyes glaze over every time they start explaining it to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: so one of the drawbacks here is that we dont really know the ins and outs of a lot of pairs methods|pg||
nt|algraves: so one thing to do is to see what the best contract is and determine how you and your favourite partner might bid it|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: 3@S alerted by both sides, can't quite read the explanation|pg||
nt|algraves: for eg with souths hand it would be good to some exporing for 5D in case partner has no spade stopper . In this case of course the spade lead has been guaranteed so that is what ...|pg||
nt|algraves: they are determinng now. diamonds or NT |pg||
nt|curtis: I'm guessing exactly this shape|pg||
nt|curtis: if 2N showed 4S then mybe 3C=4H5C sing D, 3D 45 sing S, 3H 4H5D sing C, 3S 4h5D sing S|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|curtis: That's how I'd do it at least|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|curtis: Now they win 7 for bidding game and only lose 4 for bidding slam.  sweet odds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: If N had bid 2N then S would be showing short spades and 5+ diamonds.......  |pg||
nt|algraves: Moss and Gitelman  (THE GRAND POOHBAH OF BBO ! ) as Curtis has pointed out are in some semi artificial sequence. For regular folks what would happen if west overcalled 2S ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: both players on the same page:   same if N passes the double|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|algraves: Nothing to the play here 5D bid and made, 3NT makes 4 |pg||
nt|algraves: but NS get style points for fancy bidding|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
mc|11|nt|curtis: failing to overcall 2S let the boys tell their story with ease.  Can't make it so easy|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Jacki: Welcome Cherilou everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "guess I could have saved a trick or 2 with a better opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Cheri|pg||
nt|stewball: there are differing views as to how to go about this S hand when pard opens 1nt|pg||
nt|stewball: hi Cheri|pg||
nt|cherilou: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Raija - never would have occurred to me|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|stewball: mine is that I dont go looking for a major without a legit invite in NT|pg||
nt|stewball: Bates agrees it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|cherilou: I think it's really borderline VUL|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: vul, and with tricks, S prob raises|pg||
nt|peachy: ordinarily, 2NT in competition not to play but this is obviously an exception such rule (if they have it)\|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|stewball: really really very:)|pg||
nt|stewball: i HATE down 1 in 2nt|pg||
nt|mildredb: assuming @C lead will only make if Beatty guesses @D situation which will probably require x-ray vision|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: no running now, Mr, jacobs|pg||
nt|mildredb: what a dbl!  |pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: Platnick is thinking, pull, pull, pull :)|pg||

nt|bobh1: hey marshall|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|cherilou: with favorable @S Mohan will make 1NT|pg||
nt|mildredb: Greco in the other room did infact play AK of @D - what a play!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Bob, Marshall|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|cherilou: yet, as you can see John will lose 2 imps because they weren't in @S|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 1D here so no knowl;edge where length is|pg||
nt|peachy: if anywhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Each of these teams has two pairs playing souped up Precision and one (Jacobs-Beatty & Gitelman-Moss, who are out this quarter) playing standard|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "you play upside down, right?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|stewball: but I would rather play 1nt than 3 @s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs has put the screen down to ask Diamond something - I couldn't hear what (which is good because that means Platnick couldn't either :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Although he's a lot younger than I am so maybe he could|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfb: Probably asking about whether Platnick could have a stiff @d for the 1@d opening, since from the DBL of 3NT he thinks Diamond has the Q|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|bobh1: looks like -1|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|cherilou: now only 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfb: Guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "should have known Diamond had the diamond"|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|mildredb: I doubt he could have singleton @D in this auction & rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mildredb: George has many clever sayings|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: You're right of course - wouldn't rebid 1NT with stiff @d. But he was definitely doing his thinking before playing @d K not after|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|mc|8|nt|bobh1: not that happy with +100 i'm sure|pg||

nt|curtis: beatty avoids the modern 1D opener and the no-play game in the process|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|algraves: he will correct spades to clubs|pg||
nt|curtis: What do you think about that 3H overcall, Allan?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|algraves: cant pass 3H with 2,5 quicks and some support but does not want to give up on 3NT with balcnced hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|curtis: What a winner 3H was on a hand that could easily bid an intermediate 2H!|pg||
nt|algraves: Fred happy to defend, He would have taken defending 4C when he took his hand out of pocket|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|algraves: 3H was one down for those keeping score at home|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|algraves: 3NT was two down|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|curtis: We're getting a good look at tactics. I would think 95% of the field would overcall a puny 1H.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|cQ|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "well, you might make 3NT"|pg||
mb|1D!|an|can be short|nt|cherilou: but you're down by 46--you need to bid that Vul game|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mildredb: Jan is the greatest operator - always shares table comments w/ us - ty, Jan|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: yes, makes people feel like they are right there tableside|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherilou: any one know what 2@D is?|pg||
nt|stewball: not familiar with this 2@d treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i wonder what 2@h shows|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mildredb: yes - much more fun :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherilou: hmmm--me either|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: They play transfers after 1M-1NT - I thought that 2@d showed either 4+ hearts or an accept of a NT invite, but Harris only wrote 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N knows that W has at most 3 hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: W certainly has his bid but it wont work out well for him|pg||
nt|bobh1: is 4@s makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 5 spades he would presumably want to play in spades or at least explore for best game, and since he responded 1S....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S goes down|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North has shown some mild interest, I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, of course it's Diamond who's been thinking here, not Wold :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H likely would have shown less|pg||
nt|mildredb: Jacobs not even willing to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|mildredb: this should end the auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: right wold had nothing to think about|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: nobody invited him to the party|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|peachy: yes, should, but maybe the diamond filler should have been shown, he does not have a bad minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: some might play it is required below game|pg||
nt|mildredb: of course, the slam in on a @D break & finding @H Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Before the screen went up, Jacobs asked Beatty how he had described 3NT and Beatty said "mild slam try" so they were in agreement. |pg||
nt|peachy: thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Then they discussed bids over the Precision 1@d and decided they would play that 2@d and 3@d are natural and with a Michaels hand they just bid 1@s and then bid hearts later|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|mildredb: Jacobs squad likely to win an imp|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|cherilou: since Harris knows morgan has @DK needs to return @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems ill-advised. the spades are poor and E has already passed 4C. of course there may be some ambiguity about how many clubs W has shown, but since he clearly has game values ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he ought to have only 4 clubs, and yet E was still willing to play 4C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mildredb: oh, sorry, they made 7 in other room, my apologies :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: they can't make 8, can they?|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s9|nt|cherilou: well done|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|s8|nt|bobh1: so this one could be costly to @d; but the truth is the auction may be very similar in the other room|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a trap hand for EW|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the double y S worked out well, but it was dangerous...he can work out the shapes almost exactly, so he knows his side will be able to lead trumps a maximum of once|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: these two pairs have an acbl conv card available, most of the peirs in this event only have system summary on the USBF site   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblc...|pg||

nt|algraves: 4C one down so the 3H call pushed them to a minus, with a 1H overcall ew would have been able to bid to 3C and may well have defended 3H for a plus|pg||

nt|mildredb: Harris is lead the Nickell team 18-1 after 3 bds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4CX is down one, and even then only because S gets to throw a spade on 3rd heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "sorry - 3NT is only down 2, I should have stayed there"|pg||
nt|bobh1: so he jumped out of the frying pan into the fire|pg||

nt|marlowepi: he jumped out of the frying pan of 3N into the relatively safe haven of 4C and then abandoned it to go back into the blazes|pg||

nt|peachy: Chance for Jacobs to gain IMPs here, aggressive game but makeable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: curious that he ap[ologized for leaving 3N but not for leaving 4C which was his best haven|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|bobh1: jacobus a touch heavy for 4@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: but no harm no foul in this case|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|mildredb: 10 imps likely|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, they did it|pg||
nt|mildredb: anything Beatty wants to do, works|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs using his time as dummy to study his bidding notes :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: then 4@s is normal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobh1: in fact the ability to jump to 4@s with a hand like this is one of the benefits of playing a strong @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: We have 2 strong club pairs here and 2 standard pairs in the other room|pg||
pc|d6|nt|stewball: will E let his pard out?|pg||
nt|stewball: no|pg||
nt|cherilou: Bates finds the right lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 2@c showed diamonds and 2@d showed about 11-12 HCPs and said nothing about diamonds|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure what 2@c accomplished.effectively he bid 3nt over 1@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan puts the screen down to ask what their 1NT range is - Mohan says 14-16|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cherilou: he found out his partner had better than an 8-9 count with good suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: nice try by diamond, but declarer's trumps are big enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess Beatty's deciding which hand he wants to be in, and how he's going to play the hand, guarding against bad breaks. He knows a vul game is an important hand so doesn't want ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: to miss anything|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||

nt|cherilou: when partner leads low card I think you're obliged to return that suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Director took the phone and said he'd be back presumably to tell them how many IMPs it will cost|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|peachy: In Precision, N can open 1S. In standard style, not everyone does|pg||
mb|r|nt|stewball: only if they play attitude leads,,surely a @d shift could have been right|pg||
nt|stewball: the problem was the 1@d opener perhaps|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mildredb: some might open 2@S in std, but perhaps he doesn't think the suit is good enuf or just not his style|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I was taught long ago that there isn't any space between 1 and 2 - if the hand isn't a 1@s bid, it's a 2@s bid, but some people have rules about suit quality so that doesn't apply|pg||

mb|p|nt|mildredb: @HA will work |pg||

nt|bobh1: marc likes his hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stewball: i wonder if the rules in europe are similar|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: In the Vanderbilt, Michael Kami had his cell phone in the playing room and it went off and I think it was 10 IMPs - luckily it was in a match they were winning by a lot|pg||
nt|stewball: anyone know?|pg||
nt|bobh1: its true that Wold should have sound values to overcall 1n red opp a passed hand|pg||
nt|jimkrek: good 7 vul when you can place most of the cards and pard can have up to 18 favors bidding in these situations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: devilish hand to defend, looks good for S|pg||
nt|bobh1: he prob is figuring where there's 8 tricks there should be 9 somehow|pg||

pc|h5|nt|vugraphzfb: Bates: "if you'd just made a try there...." general laughter|pg||

nt|peachy: both sides raised with a doiubleton in this hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: the defense benefits a bit from the fact that W led the heart deuce, so E knows no doubleton. but declarer is going to get very lucky|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d3|nt|bobh1: or maybe if he had a different partner he might not bid it this way|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jimkrek: d back wd have made him sweat, but lucky club position wd always see him home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes. the heart does not look right to me. unlikely that S has a doubleton as with a good 3244 or whatever S would have doubled|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: 1NT opener not as solid as 1NT overcall vul vs not|pg||

mb|d|mb|2D|nt|curtis: looks like 4S makes but 4H down on ruffs|pg||
nt|algraves: right so Jacobs and Beatty are playing the modern standard style where 1D is always "real " and 1C is opened with weak NT hand s 12-14 even if only 2 clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|algraves: so that is why beatty had routine raise to 2D as partner cant have 3|pg||
mb|4D|nt|curtis: maybe premature analysis. looks like 4S down 1 if jacobs avoids cashing an ace when he comes in with his spade ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|algraves: nice bid by jacobs taking away the room needed to pick major fit in some case|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: good decision by Moss to avoid bidding 4@S to "protect" the @DK    he was considering it a fair bit|pg||
nt|curtis: Fred's bidding is indicative of 5H and 4S so George should work out the defense|pg||
pc|hT|nt|algraves: so the spotlight will be on Jacobs here . He will have to switch to spade A if he leads diamond ace|pg||
nt|curtis: maybe he thought they were in spades|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|algraves: he might have asked himself the question.  Why didnt fred just bid 4H over 2D?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|algraves: as he is a passed hand |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|algraves: so perhaps he also had 4s so then likely that partner is short spades|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||

nt|algraves: as redouble does not promise another bid on this auction I dont think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: hard to pass without ever showing your 3-card support and side 7-card suit....|pg||
nt|algraves: well hard to bid when you have only 7 points opposite passed partner at 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: perhaps some sort of @H raise on the first round, then|pg||

mb|2N!|an|!ds|nt|bobh1: and i guess dont is a good thing to be playing when you have this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but that partner is Marc Jacobus, and if he passed at favorable your chances of a good catch go down somewhat|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "3NT hasn't been faring well at this table" Morgan: "so you went low with 12, eh?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile you could go plus in hundreds by staying quiet. alternatively, your bid might tell them how to play a close game|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Perhaps these boards are a little difficult, because I see that the other room isn't ahead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: because the aceless E hand is likely to be better for suit play|pg||
nt|jimkrek: something to be said for Marc bidding 3hearts over 2nt as pass or ccorrect |pg||

nt|marlowepi: but N cant have another card|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he wd only need 3 spades to beat it anyway so it wd always be wrong to play a low spade back|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this hand if 2n was @ds then 3@s was probably shortness|pg||
nt|jimkrek: yes-was alerted as such|pg||
nt|bobh1: should E be so eager to play 3n with only Kx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold picked up his cards, which had been on the table, but then put them back down and thinking some more.|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he was hoping pard had 2 aces and he cd scramble 9 with 5ds in jeapardy|pg||

mb|2C|nt|stewball: non vul is not the same as invul|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Apparently they're on different wavelengths here|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus asked if there was any explanation on the other side and Wold said "3@s was natural"|pg||

nt|jimkrek: seems like Diamond had a X of 3s-especially with theur limited system|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is better for E to raise diamonds, even facing 2+. when partner does have a diamond suit he needs to know about the support, esp at these colors. besides partner's NAME ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is Diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold asked Diamond to show him his hand and claimed -2|pg||

nt|stewball: the real score is 193-176|pg||

nt|stewball: 11 plus the ringtone|pg||
nt|cherilou: ahhh yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better to try that ploy in a close slam|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 1NT seems a little pessimictic on 5 diamonds and a decent 10 count, maybe their way to show a limit raise in diamonds was not attractive|pg||
mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|mb|p|mb|1D|an|0-7|nt|stewball: ive never been a fan of weak 2 bids with 7 card suits|pg||
nt|cherilou: Mohan taking the low road with his 3@S preempt|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|an|forced 2!s|nt|peachy: S had a choice to Dbl or overcall spades, I like the Dbl|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so Nick, you always bid a bit more aggressivley when you have that card?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: do you methods incorporate a queen-ask, just for clubs regardless of what the trump suit will be?|pg||
