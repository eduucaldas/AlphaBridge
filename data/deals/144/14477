pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: although EW 1NT in first position non-vul is 9-12.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold knows his partner is incl;ined to be conservative and as i suspected has play pard for more than two Ks and a J|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: well its nopt doubled into game but as cards lie i cannot see this contract doing off|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: 1st favourable.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has no S in his name.|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: thk|pg||
nt|mdgraham: meanwhile, this is the 9-12 version, and NS have elected to try to penalise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as against that, EW are probably in an 8 card fit, which means the double could be shaded, and S surely has 5 hearts. so at these colors i think there is a strong case for 2H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: it could be a disaster tho at unfave vul when townsend only has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|skollie: EW play close to the system Jansma-Verhees play(ed) - 'Orange Club', a lot like old fashioned Polish Club|pg||
nt|skollie: but they made some changes|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: in any case, what S has promised is offense, not defense, and as i said, S almost surely has 5 hearts. even if not, it is unlikely to be  disaster|pg||

nt|odysseus69: good afternoon all|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|christinas: Ron in N has a 15-count but chose to D rather than bid 1nt because of the vulnerability|pg||
nt|skollie: Blakset needs to finesse in spades to make this, now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and he still has no clue to do so imo|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: Dutch took 7 bids and OR 2 bids to both end in 2@S:)|pg||

nt|skollie: bid spades, diamonds or double?|pg||
nt|christinas: I like the 2Nt bid, it takes away space and serves as a good preempt when he is not vulnerable and the opps are. But it could keep them out of the contract|pg||

nt|christinas: or perhaps even lead them to make it|pg||

pc|d7|nt|spooky: but I'm not sure|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'm guessing the emptiness of the convention card means they probably don't have any big gadgets but just natural (and cue) bidding|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|andy_h: Seems very hard to locate slam if West is unable to ask for shortages|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@D would ask for a shortage I guess, Not sure tho :)|pg||

mb|r|nt|mdgraham: 2@C=majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: They did not even bid it after East opened in the other room|pg||
mb|4H|nt|odysseus69: 3D coming from North|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasu: sama sit toisessa pöydässä|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasu: Mikäli suomi yltää tasapeliin tai jopa pieneen voittoon on se erinomainen aloitus kisalle:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Could be one of my slams I suppose|pg||
pc|c3|nt|christinas: this slam looks dreadful|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: not a bad shot pity about the dim finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention the position of the heart hons|pg||

nt|andy_h: Muller goes for the full edged sword by preempting to the max given the favourable seat position and vulnerability (and certainly better than a 7222 shape)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  Is a make - or?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still minus 1 I think|pg||
nt|spooky: defence needs to be careful tho|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trump switch|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @H-tricks, one ruff and 2 kings|pg||

nt|spooky: but not that easy to see at the table...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, then you can't come back to your hand|pg||

nt|jaapfr: a real 4@H+2|pg||
nt|christinas: ok, NOW 2 more boards|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|jaapfr: well counted:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|christinas: this time the dutch bid more than the Danes - 4@h at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasu: jako 18 tasan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and ew have no makeble game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite 27 hcp|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: as cards lie 6N makes 6@c not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a fan of 2N on the S hand, especially facing an unpassed hand -- 2N is a real slam-killer. bad enough when opps preempt us, we dont have to do it to ourselves|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: its a two suited hand not a balanced hand of course|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 5@C bid very tempting great pass by W|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lasu: tilanne siis Norjan eduksi 21-19 epävirallisen laskennan mukaan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still down not to be avoided|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: 3S is minors - I gree bout 2NT|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: If East leads @D9 and North plays @D10 from dummy, East needs to duck|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: must be heading for the doomed club slam|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lasu: kahta herttaa pelaa Antti toisessa huoneessa ja sai risti lähdön kurkon alta |pg||

pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: may play on hearts|pg||
nt|rado: no enough entries to check both red suits|pg||
nt|rado: now|pg||
nt|rado: enought|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 6C - not too lucky|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: a very reasonable contract on a normal club break|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so 42-36 with 1 board to go|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: especially played by south|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rado: routine ublocking 10 @H|pg||
nt|eamongall: well its not down yet |pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wasnt down yet during the bidding either, but it will be|pg||
nt|lestergold: are u envisaging a pinning diamond finesse etc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt help|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my computer predicts nisht machen im afraid|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not envisioning anything except the person who sings at the end of things sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzers p[oint out that 6nt is an easy make as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Eamon well i think the singer will be Irish|pg||
nt|lestergold: at tyhe end of this hand i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think mike said that at the start of the hand|pg||
nt|eamongall: Meanwhile over in London its 44-43 to one of the tennis players in the long game ... 8 hours now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or you did victor:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we noticed that a long time ago the 8 of dimaonds is a very big card|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably in tended it as a 'chinese' finesse not expecting such a fine catch|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lasu: Vesa ja Jussi puolustaa hyvin kun eivät koske ristiin|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: however i cant see the hand being manageable|pg||
