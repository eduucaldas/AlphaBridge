nt|cherilou: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Raija - never would have occurred to me|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcmax:  Sometimes one can also catch a defender off-guard covering the Jack in the N seat with H10x|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: mine is that I dont go looking for a major without a legit invite in NT|pg||
nt|stewball: Bates agrees it seems|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|peachy: vul, and with tricks, S prob raises|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Bob, Marshall|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Here is another chance for a technical play in the @H suit|pg||
nt|marinesa: rixi markus first wrote about the intra finesse|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Without any additional information the best chance for 1loser only is to play N for H10 doubleton|pg||
nt|marinesa: or 10 doubleton|pg||
mc|11|nt|jcmax:  That means declarer would play a low @H away from the A. and if N plays his honor, he next plays the Jack from dummy to pin N's 10|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "well, you might make 3NT"|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Only this is not the layout here, where that would work|pg||
mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|cherilou: but you're down by 46--you need to bid that Vul game|pg||
mb|2D!|an|1 Major|nt|jcmax:  Yes, very true Marinesa, or 10 doubleton. If N plays low declarer would finesse against the 10 and then again in the next round play the Jack from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: If you're talking about taking an intrafinesse, the players were all laughing about "have you ever seen one work at the table" and "it's in a book"|pg||
mb|d!|an|6+ HCP|nt|mildredb: Jan is the greatest operator - always shares table comments w/ us - ty, Jan|pg||
mb|p!|nt|peachy: yes, makes people feel like they are right there tableside|pg||
nt|marinesa: yes, it's in bols brillancy book the hand by rixi markus|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cherilou: any one know what 2@D is?|pg||
nt|stewball: not familiar with this 2@d treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i wonder what 2@h shows|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The truth is they all have seen several working and they all have taken several of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss alerted his Pass of the DBL, Gitelman didn't|pg||
mb|3C|an|Stayman|nt|mildredb: yes - much more fun :)|pg||
nt|marinesa: and yes i've had it work many times as i'm sure sabine has|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: hmmm--me either|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfb: They play transfers after 1M-1NT - I thought that 2@d showed either 4+ hearts or an accept of a NT invite, but Harris only wrote 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N knows that W has at most 3 hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: W certainly has his bid but it wont work out well for him|pg||
nt|bobh1: is 4@s makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 5 spades he would presumably want to play in spades or at least explore for best game, and since he responded 1S....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S goes down|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North has shown some mild interest, I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, of course it's Diamond who's been thinking here, not Wold :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|nt|jcmax:  I wonder whether NS here were on the same wavelength as to S's dbl over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Now Jacobus is asking about Moss' pass of the DBl and I'll try to see what G wrote (but he is leaning forward and blocking my view of it, sorry)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  It looks to me as if S intended it as showing @D and N thought it showed values|pg||
mb|4C|nt|peachy: 4H likely would have shown less|pg||
nt|mildredb: Jacobs not even willing to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|mildredb: this should end the auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: right wold had nothing to think about|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: nobody invited him to the party|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|peachy: yes, should, but maybe the diamond filler should have been shown, he does not have a bad minimum|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mildredb: some might play it is required below game|pg||
nt|mildredb: of course, the slam in on a @D break & finding @H Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Before the screen went up, Jacobs asked Beatty how he had described 3NT and Beatty said "mild slam try" so they were in agreement. |pg||
nt|peachy: thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Then they discussed bids over the Precision 1@d and decided they would play that 2@d and 3@d are natural and with a Michaels hand they just bid 1@s and then bid hearts later|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|mildredb: Jacobs squad likely to win an imp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|cherilou: since Harris knows morgan has @DK needs to return @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems ill-advised. the spades are poor and E has already passed 4C. of course there may be some ambiguity about how many clubs W has shown, but since he clearly has game values ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he ought to have only 4 clubs, and yet E was still willing to play 4C|pg||
mb|d|nt|mildredb: oh, sorry, they made 7 in other room, my apologies :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: they can't make 8, can they?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Oh dear. You know something went wrong when you ran from 3NT doubled and all you achieved was getting doubled in 4NT instead....|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Let's say W wins the @D and switches to a @C|pg||
nt|marinesa: best d|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Now declarer can finesse in bothe @S and @H, but because of communication problems he can only get 3 @H tricks|pg||
nt|jcmax:  That means he would end up with 8 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: after 4@h got doubled and went PP, Jacobus started to take the tray away but Wold said "wait" and then "this is a partnership game" :) then bid 4NT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, Moss has been thinking, I didn't realize I hadn't played the @d Q|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|cherilou: well done|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|bobh1: so this one could be costly to @d; but the truth is the auction may be very similar in the other room|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a trap hand for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus: carding? Gitelman: "upside down"|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sJ|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the double y S worked out well, but it was dangerous...he can work out the shapes almost exactly, so he knows his side will be able to lead trumps a maximum of once|pg||
nt|jcmax:  If W plays another @D now declarer would get an extra entry into his hand and would end up making his contract!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus is the declarer so Moss can see the diamond and entry situation I think|pg||
nt|jcmax:  But on any other switch declarer cannot get his 4th @H and ends up down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: So I guess they should have sat it out in 3N doubled?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: these two pairs have an acbl conv card available, most of the peirs in this event only have system summary on the USBF site   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblc...|pg||

nt|peachy: Chance for Jacobs to gain IMPs here, aggressive game but makeable|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marinesa: double is probably staymen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus and Moss are now debating 4@hx - Jacobus says they had to get the diamond ruff to beat it; Moss disagrees; going back and forth for awhile|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: curious that he ap[ologized for leaving 3N but not for leaving 4C which was his best haven|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: jacobus a touch heavy for 4@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: but no harm no foul in this case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mark lives pressure bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: They're playing strong club so 4@s is very wide-ranging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marc|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: unless they play a strong @c|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mildredb: 10 imps likely|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, they did it|pg||
nt|mildredb: anything Beatty wants to do, works|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs using his time as dummy to study his bidding notes :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: then 4@s is normal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: in fact the ability to jump to 4@s with a hand like this is one of the benefits of playing a strong @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: We have 2 strong club pairs here and 2 standard pairs in the other room|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stewball: will E let his pard out?|pg||
nt|stewball: no|pg||
nt|cherilou: Bates finds the right lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 2@c showed diamonds and 2@d showed about 11-12 HCPs and said nothing about diamonds|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure what 2@c accomplished.effectively he bid 3nt over 1@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan puts the screen down to ask what their 1NT range is - Mohan says 14-16|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|cherilou: he found out his partner had better than an 8-9 count with good suit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: nice try by diamond, but declarer's trumps are big enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess Beatty's deciding which hand he wants to be in, and how he's going to play the hand, guarding against bad breaks. He knows a vul game is an important hand so doesn't want ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: to miss anything|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jimkrek: had a chance to beat it on heart lead-now it sd be over|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stewball: N may fall to the @d shift temptation|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|stewball: and does|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: We'll have a short break here while the director is called - Mohan had a cell phone which just rang.|pg||
nt|cherilou: when partner leads low card I think you're obliged to return that suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Director took the phone and said he'd be back presumably to tell them how many IMPs it will cost|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: Jan is right, we all can see that any line he chooses will work, but he has to do all the thinking without dbl dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: it is understandable than Platnick does not expect W to have D king, but what is the plan for beating 4S by returning any other suit but Ds?|pg||

nt|mildredb: this is a good coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I got some, if I didn't have coffee I'd have no personality whatsoever.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It's a good exercise to figure out what they're thinking, I find. Here, probably Diamond is trying to figure out a lie of the cards where he can beat 4@s or at least give declarer ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: a problem, and that's going to be hard so takes awhile|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|s9|pc|h5|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|peachy: In Precision, N can open 1S. In standard style, not everyone does|pg||
nt|marinesa: particularly since both pairs opened a club with 4 diamonds and 3 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: only if they play attitude leads,,surely a @d shift could have been right|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mildredb: some might open 2@S in std, but perhaps he doesn't think the suit is good enuf or just not his style|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I was taught long ago that there isn't any space between 1 and 2 - if the hand isn't a 1@s bid, it's a 2@s bid, but some people have rules about suit quality so that doesn't apply|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Jan|pg||

nt|jimkrek: he appears to have made a good dec unless Marc made an inspired heart play|pg||

nt|stewball: anyone know?|pg||
nt|bobh1: its true that Wold should have sound values to overcall 1n red opp a passed hand|pg||
nt|jimkrek: good 7 vul when you can place most of the cards and pard can have up to 18 favors bidding in these situations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: devilish hand to defend, looks good for S|pg||
nt|bobh1: he prob is figuring where there's 8 tricks there should be 9 somehow|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|reisig: @d seems easy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: the defense benefits a bit from the fact that W led the heart deuce, so E knows no doubleton. but declarer is going to get very lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was busy inviting Steve Beatty to join us - the diamond was played promptly|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|bobh1: or maybe if he had a different partner he might not bid it this way|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jimkrek: d back wd have made him sweat, but lucky club position wd always see him home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes. the heart does not look right to me. unlikely that S has a doubleton as with a good 3244 or whatever S would have doubled|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: and i guess dont is a good thing to be playing when you have this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but that partner is Marc Jacobus, and if he passed at favorable your chances of a good catch go down somewhat|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "3NT hasn't been faring well at this table" Morgan: "so you went low with 12, eh?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile you could go plus in hundreds by staying quiet. alternatively, your bid might tell them how to play a close game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stewball: looks like a breather|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: because the aceless E hand is likely to be better for suit play|pg||
nt|jimkrek: something to be said for Marc bidding 3hearts over 2nt as pass or ccorrect |pg||
nt|marlowepi: obviously that could get you too high though|pg||
nt|bobh1: on the -400 hand N with his yarborough bid stayman and went for only -300|pg||

nt|marlowepi: but N cant have another card|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he wd only need 3 spades to beat it anyway so it wd always be wrong to play a low spade back|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this hand if 2n was @ds then 3@s was probably shortness|pg||
nt|jimkrek: yes-was alerted as such|pg||
nt|bobh1: should E be so eager to play 3n with only Kx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold picked up his cards, which had been on the table, but then put them back down and thinking some more.|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he was hoping pard had 2 aces and he cd scramble 9 with 5ds in jeapardy|pg||

mb|2C|nt|stewball: non vul is not the same as invul|pg||

nt|marinesa: brad's 2 spades here is 5 spades 4+ hearts invitational|pg||
nt|gowdy: facing a 5 4 invite|pg||
nt|marinesa: probably 9-11|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|peachy: semiforcing 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ty Joanna, that explains a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: You're welcome, but this is Jan, JoAnna is in the other room :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well your name is inside her name so i was covered either way:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It's been a long time since people got us confused :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: good stab Fred|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|mildredb: I have to run - enjoy the rest of the set and tournament - thx all|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: partnerships should sort out what RDBL means as opposed to 3H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It was alerted but no-one asked; Diamond sort of pointed at the 2@s card, which is why I think it was a re-transfer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i just meant in general, all of us|pg||
nt|jimkrek: looks like 3nt and 4s can make but you have to double hook spades and in spades need abit of timing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess 3N makes but 4@s doesn't? |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jim plays 4@s better than I do :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do you have to double hook? cnt you just make small trumps?|pg||
nt|bobh1: W would seem to have a pass here so it may be academic|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think thatis a pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it looks like a good hand to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i forgot their notrump range is 13-16|pg||
nt|jimkrek: isnt he maxe by their standards-and his aq of heats like the ak?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb:  I still don't know what this auction meant, might have been a choice of games with 5 spades and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi Nic|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is a Q of which game|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sbeatty:  Declarer can claim at least 11 tricks by leading a low D at trick 2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jimkrek: yes it looks like u might scrable 4s on some sort of xruff too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sois le bienvenu le canadien|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Afraid no one asked about the auction so we still don't know |pg||
pc|s9|nt|niclecuyer: merci :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: D to king and then start doing business|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: the only thing to avoid is to play trumps from the top - any other line will work - but he does not know that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will touch trumps except to ruff things|pg||

nt|stewball: the real score is 193-176|pg||
nt|cherilou: they must be--the lead is down to 11 and not many imps here the last 2 hands|pg||
nt|stewball: 11 plus the ringtone|pg||
nt|cherilou: ahhh yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better to try that ploy in a close slam|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 1NT seems a little pessimictic on 5 diamonds and a decent 10 count, maybe their way to show a limit raise in diamonds was not attractive|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|stewball: ive never been a fan of weak 2 bids with 7 card suits|pg||
nt|cherilou: Mohan taking the low road with his 3@S preempt|pg||
nt|jimkrek: perhaps all the energy he put into last hand had him a little off-sometimes such a relief to make a tough hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|peachy: S had a choice to Dbl or overcall spades, I like the Dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently E felt that way, but i think the diamond raise is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: ugh|pg||
nt|cherilou: many ughs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Mohan wrote "undiscussed BUT must show a good preempt|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Bates wrote "good 3@s bid"|pg||
mb|5S|nt|stewball: i expect this will be 50 more than the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so Nick, you always bid a bit more aggressivley when you have that card?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: do you methods incorporate a queen-ask, just for clubs regardless of what the trump suit will be?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no more conservatively - usually cannot find it...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even in your own hand?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|niclecuyer: well then I can manage|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: difficult hand for NS - bound to go down in whatever they attemps|pg||

nt|cherilou: hard to find the trump lead|pg||
nt|stewball: very|pg||
nt|stewball: if N started with 3@d a trump lead would be more attractive perhaps|pg||
nt|cherilou: Even with more "not good" results from other room it looks like Harris will win this match. Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus: "Sorry, I got distracted & pulled the wrong card, didn't mean to bid 2@s; not the contract they're playing at the other table, but haven't gone down yet"|pg||
