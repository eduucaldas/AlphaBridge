mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|henryb:  Doug may invite, and the very friendly heart position will let 3N make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even when you lead A from AK -- common at 5+ level to lead K from AK for count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: part of the idea is that you often lead unsupported Ace in cash-out situations|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Note this contract's only virtue is that it makes. It is actually very poor: about 18%|pg||
nt|henryb:  He could have improved his chances by playng a club to dummy and starting hearts from the table, which picks up stiff Ace and AJ doubleton with West|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|anamtebha:  He had a @s rebid later to compete so there wasn't a need to put them in a gf auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kjadams: problem with negative free bid...  It's not forcing.   He must have wanted to gamble game.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: interesting points, however, the fact he freely bid 5@h suggests he felt he didn't describe his hand accurately in the first place :)|pg||

nt|kjadams: a 9 count with heart support.   I doubt he bid to go down|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|anamtebha:  if pard has 1@d the auction isn't dying at 2@h. There would be a raise or competition of some kind i think|pg||
nt|anamtebha:  I think it boils down to the imp score. E/W are trying to pick up imps|pg||
nt|kjadams: when it got to 5D, he could bet on stiff opposite.   only question is where is the rest of stuff...  spades and hearts = good.|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  need to play @s now and exit with @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  won't help. Adam cashes another @d, then ducks a @h to Leven|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... but that seems the best he can do|pg||
nt|henryb:  scary for Adam though|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: since Levin known to hold @DA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  @c isn't that easy to read here either|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6@h in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  will slice the Fleisher lead almost in half|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: Doub wants to win 3rd @H just in case Wildavsky can ruff @D - unlikely with Levin tendancy for 2@S opener to always have 6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  this long huddle will be revealing to declarer. If Levin did not have the @cQ a club would have been on the tablle a long time ago|pg||

nt|kjadams: 3s is eastern q|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kjadams: transfers the NT..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|anamtebha:  lets see if he comes up with the @c lead|pg||
nt|anamtebha:  or shift|pg||
nt|kjadams: often right to put overcaller on lead and to protect partners short honors.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Thanks for tuning in everyone, and special thanks to our wonderful commentators John Adams and Anam Tebha|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the final segment of the day should resume in about 15 minutes following the completion of this round|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kjadams: club shift hard to find with west as dummy.   easier if east dummy.  |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|anamtebha:  its not that much harder. he cant shift to a @H holding T 4th|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|c5|nt|anamtebha:  its actually easier imo. He sees KJ9x. if E were dummy he'd see Axx he could still hope for a tenace with partner|pg||
