mb|p|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|shevek: unsuccessfully|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - lead down to 30|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|tomi2:  I think @DK from hand is best, if east had a singleton, he might have lead it, so two honors from hand and you see if he had 4 cards|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: this will lead to 6 no|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4-1 break wud be a guess; @D8 may influence him, but shud guard against 5-0 by cashing @Dk or @D first|pg||
nt|tomi2:  this is imo the worst bidding sequence in polish club, 1@C-2@D naturla strong but maybe on a weak 5 card suit|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he had no entries to get jxxx with west after he started low to the ace, so he would have lost against both 4-1 I think|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can he ask aces now?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  east is 12+ because they do not play 2@C precision opening|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tomi2:  and might still have 3 cards @D fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sharkey: good question - 4 NT wud often be quantative|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  4@C might be taken as @CA|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: West may temporize with 4@C aiming at 6 NT anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  and 4@S as rkcb in @C (they play kickback in situations when clubs are agreed)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|tomi2:  5@H would then be the resonose, good luck that he also has @HAK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so now 5 h 2 aces +queen in cl|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  but I am sure Piekarek took this as RKCB and responded...|pg||
mb|6N|nt|janhamhurg: so alex knows they are missing an ace|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont thin W is looking for Grand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  with my regular pd I switched 1@C-2@D and 1@C-1@D-1M-2@D, this gives us room to investigate fits, strenght and stoppers before 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2:  I do not think alex intented 4@S as RKC, he was in a cuebid sequence starting with 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  ho is the best play in @D?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  how|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: Anyhow they landed in the perfect spot; just have to top out @DJ to make it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but there must be a way to ask aces- anyway good spot|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|sharkey: think topping it - takes care of 33 and Jx|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure though|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: please dont finess ever having akq10x  xx |pg||

nt|janhamhurg: clubs- by bidding 4 cl|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sharkey: In US Gerber convention popular in cases like this where 4@C is KCBW or BW|pg||

nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||

nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
mb|6N|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||

nt|andyv:  20-20 hands usually don't travel too far in the bidding|pg||

nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||

nt|andersk: and Norway stoped in 5@S on the next slam, as we predicted|pg||

pc|c3|nt|pelu: no: 3@S by N = 3+ @S - System note 14 :):))|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs educating me... one states that 3@d may show a weak 5+ in major or other strong hand and 3@h or 3@s is the other major forcing to game.... interesting treatment.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i think thw way Iclenad bid to 4@s on board 11 was impressive|pg||
