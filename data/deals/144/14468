mb|3H|nt|sharynr: hi Linda, and everyone watching|pg||
nt|lml: hello Sharyn|pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: Good afternoon everyone, :) will try and put on a good show|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: a nail-biter match!|pg||
nt|lml: in years past north's hand would not constitute a 2@C overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|lml: some confusion east west|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if Weinstein meant to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: was the bid truly 3@H|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think Garner would have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: well just as well, they are too high already!|pg||
nt|lml: true the hand lies terribly for them|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe north actually bid 3@C|pg||
nt|lml: but I think 3@H should have been forcing then|pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: i assure you, you are in good hands :), he bid 2@c and 3@h|pg||
nt|joest:  3@h is natural and invitational in east-west methods|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein has 12 points and a good suit he didnt want to get passed out|pg||
nt|lml: either it was a mechanical error or Garner opens very very light|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|migry: Hi all from sunny NYC:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfg: Welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I have not followed the play but I will put the result in|pg||
nt|migry: NS play 2NT 20-21 |pg||
nt|bobh1: either a heavy 2n or their range is higher than normal|pg||
nt|migry: so North decided to downgrade his hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess he didn't like the @h holding|pg||
nt|migry: good morning Bob , Alison and the 8 spectators|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi migry|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think it was an inspired decision|pg||
nt|migry: i agree|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|migry: South can either bid 1NT which is a game forcing relay or 2NT which is a normal Jacoby|pg||
nt|migry: 2NT usually shows a minimum balanced GF|pg||
nt|migry: the J@s may well be a wasted card and his 2nd long suit, the clubs needs too much|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|caitlin: Welcome back to John Adams and Larry Mori|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S asking for minor and 2N denying|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@S I am told either shows clubs or invitational|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2S size lets stayman promise a 4 card major.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|migry: North will bid 4NT and get to 6@h|pg||
nt|jlrice: Basseggio weinstein get to game but with every finesse offside; will not come close to making|pg||
nt|jlrice: affter West opens though  tough to stay out of game|pg||
nt|marinesa: yes and who wouldn't open the west hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: but they wont end in hearts in either direction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: South could try 1NT I suppose|pg||
nt|sharynr: tempting to bid for South, but what?|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: it should show a decent hand with hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: pass is very reasonable|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||

nt|lml: is there anyway that Garner can figure this out|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|sharynr: we will see|pg||
nt|lml: if he finesses he is playing for Kx onside|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: wow good for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: interestingly, he called for ace of spades from the dummy when he was in his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: reminded by the opponents he was in his hand, he then repeated the move :p after thinking|pg||
nt|sharynr: and they corrected him ?|pg||

nt|bobh1: everyone upgrades these days but few downgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: grand slam time|pg||
nt|bobh1: so kudos to chris|pg||
nt|migry: very well done:)|pg||
nt|migry: yesterday he decided to upgrade in the 1st hand of the match and it didn't work - i guess he tries the other approach:)|pg||
nt|migry: anyway it was great evaluation|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 1NT = 14-16|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: roy is all dressed up with nowhere to go|pg||
nt|migry: interesting problem for South |pg||
nt|mslair: Soloway would invite with Smith's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: spades split nicely|pg||
nt|migry: a bit pushy by North, but the 10s and 9s add a lot to the hand's value|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mslair: brb|pg||
nt|jlrice: I would as well   if partner is sticking his neck out vul vs not    wouldnt be on a complete min I would think|pg||
nt|marinesa: yes he would mark, 7 after and overcall unless 4x3 he thought it was right to invite|pg||
nt|jlrice: Cohen decided to get in auction afraid that he might not have an easy way back in later and dont want to miss a Vul game if weinstein is opening light|pg||
nt|jlrice: auction could easily progress into 2C or 2S for opponents and he would just be forced to pass|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they'll get to the safe 7@D after this start|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am asked 7NT or 7@D|pg||
nt|kjadams: my money is on playing diamonds.|pg||
nt|jlrice: if he didnt say something now|pg||
nt|mslair: and less likely to get dbled with a passed LHO|pg||
pc|h9|nt|migry: it looks "natural" to play a high club - but that won't work|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|caitlin: in a grand play it safe with your 10 card fit|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree John|pg||
nt|larrymori: and not rely on additional things|pg||
nt|joest: hello again all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: hello Jack|pg||
nt|joest: joe do you know all the other scores?|pg||
nt|joest: or any? :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: declarer appears to be a trick short|pg||
pc|hK|nt|migry: good play - Roy know he needs to create an entry for North|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they might have gotten to 7NT if south opened|pg||
nt|kjadams: can you work out the extra tricks and no club losers and play a grand?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzfg: i do not|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|caitlin: well he did:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: I think he just shot it out.|pg||
nt|larrymori: if 2@s shows something specific like 2 or 3 top honors it would help the count|pg||
nt|kjadams: true|pg||
nt|bigtrain: generally speaking responses to 2@C are made only with good suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the lure of the vul game has got them too high|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|larrymori: i happen to like 6 card suits with 2 of 3 top but here, it is a passed hand so it may take on different meanings|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mslair: must duck  and now Cohen will establish a diamond winner for trick  7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfg: scores should be posted soon (not yet) at http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mslair: West will have to read the club position   maybe giving count at trick one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobh1: whoa|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest: looks like Weinstein headed for +110 next door so another swing to Weinstein will draw them quite close|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sharynr: Sorry I did not have time to do my homework, what system do E-W play|pg||
nt|lml: 1@D was a transfer|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4 spades|nt|lml: it showed 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lml: and as we can see the transfers continue|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 1@C is multiway|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lml: either various balanced hands or primary clubs with distribution as wash shown by the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|lml: Garner has now shown his 4-4-4-1 shape|pg||
nt|sharynr: pretty good slam|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein has a super hand if partner is something like 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|lml: he might not have 4 clubs |pg||
nt|lml: but he will have distribution|pg||
nt|lml: so maybe 5-4-3-1|pg||
nt|lml: 5-4-1-3|pg||
nt|sharynr: why can't he have 4-5-1-3?|pg||
nt|joest:  he could|pg||
nt|lml: yes that is the other alternative|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lml: either way Weinstein has a terrific hand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sharynr: now he knows his partner does not have a heart control|pg||
nt|sharynr: IF they bid them up the line, that is|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lml: if 4@C here is keycard I would bid it|pg||
nt|lml: since this was not alerted it may just be a quiet forward bid|pg||
nt|sharynr: looking for a 4@D call|pg||
nt|lml: it would suggest a heart control of course|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes|pg||
nt|joest:  I believe 4@c is RKCB but Garner is mulling it over|pg||
nt|lml: yes that makes sense |pg||
nt|joest:  they had some discussion about playing 4@d here as RKCB and that might be a part of the hesitation here|pg||
nt|joest:  which goes to show that "Minorwood" is dangerous without lots of discussion|pg||
nt|sharynr: would that be 4@D over 3@C you mean?|pg||
nt|lml: you can do either.  I usually like to play the bid minor is keycard|pg||
nt|joest:  any time a minor is agreed at the three level, then that minor + 1 at the four level = RKCB|pg||
nt|joest:  permits either partner to Blackwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: garner and weinstein enjoy adventures with the blackwood convention jack? :)|pg||
nt|joest:  east couldjust 'wait' with 4@c on some hands|pg||
nt|lml: or you can use the bid minor as they may be doing|pg||
nt|joest:  the longer garner huddles|pg||
nt|joest:  the more this is an adventure: believe me|pg||
nt|lml: but you do need to know which|pg||
nt|sharynr: I bet most people do not discuss what happens after the minorwood response is given, i.e. how to ask further|pg||
nt|lml: as I watch this angst I am more and more in favor of the bid minor|pg||
nt|joest:  7 is not actually unreasonable|pg||
mb|6C|nt|joest:  i've been in far worse|pg||
nt|lml: when in doubt just bid the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: avoiding the reponse here is good idea|pg||
nt|lml: a simple solution :)|pg||
nt|joest:  garner obviously not sure and did something pratical|pg||
nt|joest:  *practical|pg||
pc|d2|mc|13|nt|lml: the grand is pretty good and you are likely to guess clubs since you wont get a club lead|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am sure the play will be faster than the bidding|pg||
nt|lml: actually that means nothing thinking about it|pg||
nt|lml: south wouldnt lead a trump with Qxx or with a void!|pg||
nt|lml: so it is still a guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|bigtrain: playing precision you takes extreme risks to get the @D suit in play|pg||
nt|migry: nice bid by East|pg||
nt|jlrice: 7C is a good contract for EW   but with 3-0 clubs could go down if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: in the other room, south just bid the normal 1NT and south is playing it|pg||
nt|marinesa: hi Mark :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest: East leading a top honor, perhaps in case declarer has a singleton heart honor|pg||
nt|marinesa: i prefer 3diamonds over 2c with 2d forcing 3d surely splinter|pg||
nt|mslair: perfect except the stiff king is somewhat of a flaw|pg||
nt|marinesa: i agree but a little boxed now|pg||

pc|c3|nt|joest: Baseggio gave count on the spade lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps josh should not have unblocked since he can see spade shift easier|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure why welland opened 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: they open 1@C with all bal minimums (11-13)|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe 1@d is always an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|marinesa: in my partnerships i like 2nd round control in other 2 suits for splinters, so i couldn't splinter but most don't play that|pg||
nt|jlrice: I guess he could still be worried partner is 5-4   but if he finds out partner has 3 aces i think i would want to be in 7|pg||

nt|mslair: now the dbl|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mslair: takeout with extras|pg||
nt|mslair: I think Welland will bid 3h|pg||
nt|bobh1: he does have 3 trumps and a good raise|pg||
mb|2N|nt|joest: a 1@s overcall not duplicated in the replay|pg||
nt|joest: garner will x again|pg||
nt|joest: Howie will bid 3@h unhappily and probably play there|pg||
mb|4H|nt|migry: 2@h= just a normal reverse hand|pg||
nt|joest: because he likes to bid? :)|pg||
nt|mslair: yes|pg||
nt|mslair: NS make 5 clubs|pg||
nt|jlrice: double fit here   NS can make 6 of eitther minor   but EW will think it is their hand|pg||
nt|marinesa: ruffing 2 d in the west hand before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|mslair: y 6 c|pg||
nt|marinesa: ron will get them to at least 5 for sure|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fabsayc: spade lead|pg||
nt|mslair: but i misguessed|pg||
nt|bobh1: although his trumps are kind of ratty|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: i disagree with attacking when they stop in 2nt|pg||
nt|migry: pity south can't retransfer|pg||
nt|migry: 2@d - heart support|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: hate having to lead on these auctions.  that one hurt.|pg||
nt|caitlin: Walter (bigtrain) must be waiting for Nickell team as he is an expert on Meckstroth and Rodwell (Meckwell) bidding|pg||
nt|joest: this has to be a very bad hand|pg||
nt|joest: declarer probably has six hearts|pg||
nt|joest: but passed on the chance to bid a competitive 3@h last round|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: ace of hearts opening lead beats 3n.t  nothing else|pg||
nt|joest: fortunate location of the spade ace here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marinesa: and may save over 5s as he knows they have double fit|pg||
nt|jlrice: 5S willl not do very well  but undoubled will only be -150|pg||
nt|mslair: does very well un-dbled|pg||
nt|jlrice: but i would guess was not bidding to sacrifice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|migry: well judged all around|pg||
nt|joest: yes ace of hearts does it Mark|pg||
nt|joest: do you think that lead could be reasoned out?|pg||
nt|marinesa: no was bidding to make i'm sure|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mslair: Welland was out of character  not 3 hearts or dbl:)|pg||
nt|mslair: I don't think so |pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: welland leads out of turn (good idea, but...) - no probl with screens|pg||
nt|joest: let's see if Howie escapes for down one|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jlrice: cohen giving suit preference with the 6 of clubs trying to get a diamond switch|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|mslair: now a matter of an uptrick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bigtrain: hey i'm contributing here :)|pg||
nt|joest: seven was discouraging|pg||
nt|joest: a switch in case partner has J7x of spades|pg||

nt|joest: it appears this is Kokish|pg||

nt|bobh1: roy retires from the fray with his 19 count|pg||
nt|bobh1: would think a double would be ok|pg||

pc|dK|nt|larrymori: and quite good|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Adam, dare I say a 'handful'@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 6 is nice spot here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: overboard again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but needs attacking lead this time|pg||
nt|mittmouse: might lead the 10 of d|pg||
nt|mslair: looks mixed|pg||
nt|joest: with three trumps?|pg||
nt|mslair: must be 4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfg: berk is laughing about bid, not his normal|pg||
nt|migry: i would think they show pattern there after 3@h but i guess not|pg||
nt|joest: pretty good hand|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein needs more than the king of diamonds.  Maybe more than just another minor suit queen too|pg||
pc|d5|nt|joest: the auction next door, treating the north hand as a balanced NT did not work well|pg||
nt|mslair: 7-9 w/4  but something I have not seen|pg||
nt|mslair: 2d|pg||
nt|joest: I have seen 2@d as four card drury and 2@c as three|pg||
nt|joest: but these guys play lots of different things|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 2@D was natural -- would be heart support by UPH  , says Willenken|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|migry: in spite of the 5-1 split this contract should make |pg||
nt|joest: i wonder if this blackwood or a cue bid|pg||
nt|joest: blackwood could not serve much purpose after partner has shown controls|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|joest: if Jonathan passes the worst he can do is a push. if he bids on (which I doubt) a push is the best he can accomplish|pg||
nt|joest: true  pointed out to me that just strip the blacks|pg||
nt|joest: 5 is cold|pg||
pc|c6|nt|larrymori: a good slam to get to|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|caitlin: During my 2 days of commentating, I have yet to see so many slams and grand slams|pg||
nt|larrymori: 5@h might do it now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club 9|pg||
nt|joest: so the Weinstein team will add some more to their 14-0 start|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mslair: I would bid 2c vs 2d if going high with drury|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: then Roy lost his mind (or forgot he was a passedhand)|pg||

nt|larrymori: the problem with 4nt is it does not find out the necessary info|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if there is doubt about trump they may have an accident|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pushing my luck, heart seven|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cJ|nt|larrymori: that's why 5@h gets to the point instead of guessing|pg||

nt|lml: this could be the same auction as in 1950|pg||

nt|joest: Mark: any Hall of Fame member can commentate any time he/she chooses!|pg||
nt|mslair: that is the good news|pg||
nt|bobh1: the weinstein team lost a few imps on the previous board due to overbidding by their opponents also|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: triple squeeze for 3NT on last hand (so they say at the table)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess N has no entries so 2 @s tricks are not available|pg||

mb|p|nt|jlrice: hhmmm   9 solid clubs   11 tricks    this instant blackwood bid will be a success|pg||
nt|mslair: will it be?|pg||
nt|jlrice: find out his partner has the other ace and then no Kings   |pg||
mb|5D|nt|joest: this should silence everybody|pg||
nt|joest: except Howard :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: stayman here is useful|pg||

nt|jlrice: 7 makes    but i wouldnt want to be there|pg||
mb|5N|nt|caitlin: once South bids hearts will North pass?|pg||

nt|bobh1: welland prob has a supp x avail but will eschew it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i think he's planning on passing anything|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would think so|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he's just especially pleased to have found an actual fit|pg||
nt|larrymori: the old argument about what to open, here, 1@h might have gotten to game|pg||
nt|joest: Mark, how do you play 5NT here?  forcing and choice of slams?  or 'highly invitational' to six?|pg||
nt|mslair: choice of slams  maybe another suit is possible with 5|pg||
nt|migry: 4H by south passed out?|pg||
nt|mslair: Cohen may not be so clear on 4n.t being ace asking|pg||
mb|7N|nt|bobh1: willenken doesn't really want to defend 3@d|pg||
nt|bobh1: but he may be worried about his partner having nothing in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: weinstein thinking - willenken passed quickly|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think he should double myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: alex said "we may have game"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: board was flipped|pg||
nt|migry: by north:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: good news is the hands fit together v well|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh ok|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  but even so   he should have enough for slam |pg||
nt|marinesa: think he will settle for 6c, but squeeze possibilites played from south are huge|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: and they do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not, diamond lead beats game|pg||
nt|bobh1: they may be on different wavelengths re 3!|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3@d|pg||
nt|bobh1: is it a bar bid or a game try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: bad news is the @ds are off|pg||
nt|migry: may have some problems on a trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: smith:  "we'll stop here"|pg||

nt|migry: but game is cold|pg||
nt|bobh1: W finds the trump lead but it will not be enuf|pg||

nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: starts with ducking this|pg||
nt|mslair: must duck the club which he will do|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mslair: Baseggio must play well to beat the likes of the Meltzer team|pg||
nt|migry: that's why the "3 clubs"|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bobh1: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: both saying 3@D is undefined -- wide range|pg||
nt|bobh1: only 2 obvious losers but lots of handling|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: well so far they have been|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|bobh1: he will try to guess the @d for an overtrick|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|joest: Jonathan Weinstein is a biology professor (I believe) at Northwestern University here in Chicago|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobh1: this lead solves some of the handling issues|pg||
nt|marinesa: i think billy's decision to bid 7 is resonable as partner was prob going to bid 7 something if he had a king|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: i stand corrected.  he's in the business school.  his wife is a biologist|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marinesa: and q and qj may be that other trick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bigtrain: prefect fitters are tough to diagnosis regardless of the opening bid...  is it clear to bid game after 1@H-mixed raise? i don't think so|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: questions about whether Willenken can have 6 hearts - unlikely; 2@D overe 1@D would show 6 hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: chris didn't have a clear lead and his partner did open @cs|pg||
nt|bobh1: as we have seen that doesn't mean he has them|pg||
nt|bobh1: but he had to lead something|pg||

nt|larrymori: i like opening good 1nt ranges with a good suit as opposed to a small doubleton elsewhere, to try to help get to game|pg||

nt|lml: I dont think so|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sharynr: that overcall may talk them out of it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: wrong again|pg||
nt|lml: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: hoping partner controls spades|pg||
nt|lml: is South had the @HK and not the @SK it would be not so nice|pg||
nt|lml: would you have bid 6 Sharyn?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Like you said before Linda, when things go your way.... they keep coming|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharynr: not me Linda|pg||
nt|lml: not me either|pg||
nt|lml: this pair is lucky and hot|pg||
nt|warrens:  great lead|pg||
nt|sharynr: so will he take the finesse or play for @DJ to come in 3 rounds?|pg||
nt|joest:  only lead that might beat it if declarer misguesses what to do|pg||
nt|lml: easy to go wrong|pg||
nt|lml: very easy|pg||
nt|joest:  particularly since LHO does not rate to have only two jacks|pg||
nt|sharynr: That overcall may just turn out to be magic!|pg||

nt|joest: what a hand this is!|pg||
nt|joest: the auction could go many different ways here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: the bd is switched NS -- very hard for me :(|pg||
nt|joest: although it feels the players have taken a break :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think that's a dangerous board for weinstein|pg||
nt|mslair: another slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: not sure if this is 14-16 or an upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: upgrade|pg||
nt|joest: thx joe|pg||
nt|joest: so how would you go about this Mark|pg||
nt|joest: after the transfer that itis|pg||
nt|joest: would you consider 5@d as exclusion roman key card?|pg||
nt|mslair: texas followed by new suit is exclusion for most of the world|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: that would get this over quickly|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs, no matter what their normal responses, revert to 0-3, 1-4 after exclusion|pg||
nt|joest: after 5@d here, East would bid 5@s, one key card, west bids 5NT, east bids 6@c to show the king and voila|pg||
nt|mslair: not underwritten  although only 13 possible high card points... no ace of dia  can't fail to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: so far that is precisely the auction next door|pg||
nt|joest: that's true, asking about the club king may just be torturing partner|pg||
nt|mslair: very interesting to me to see a top pair miss 7 spades|pg||
nt|joest: they bid it next door on exactly the sequence we just discussed|pg||
nt|bobh1: @d game|pg||
nt|bobh1: that could be a partscore swing against weinstein|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: marginal hand for stayman|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: particularly after 1n.t opening:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: but need to guess the Q|pg||
nt|bobh1: or 3n|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: may get a second chance|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d = mixed|pg||
nt|joest: that is a pretty good hand to pass with has west although admittedly what does one do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: smith and cohen are going to get ttired of bidding 4 of the last 5 hands they could make slam on|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: double=one minor or both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 1@d= hearts usually less than a game force which is normal with the south hand as they do open light|pg||
nt|migry: 2@h= normal heart support|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d is doubled for penalties in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: it may be clear tous to preference to 4@s but its hardly clear to west|pg||
nt|migry: can they get too high?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzfg: wow|pg||
nt|migry: i know i've been in worse slams|pg||
mb|p|nt|marinesa: bet they bid this one |pg||
nt|mslair: Cohen might simply bid 5c and hope ron will kick it in with the appropriate keycards  2254  pretty soft at this point|pg||
nt|jlrice: smith will drrive this one home after partner jump shifted into hiss 5 card suit     but might be a little hesitant if partner has a tendency to J/S into 3 card suits|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|joest: if I were west and all I did was pref to 4@s and then got whacked I would be disappointed|pg||
nt|joest: maybe he is reconsidering however|pg||
nt|jlrice: I dont know their styles on those types of hands|pg||
mb|6C|nt|fabsayc: NV but i think sher was worth a raise|pg||
nt|joest: the mark lair approach|pg||
nt|joest: in an expert partnership 4@d might have been a choice of games cue-bid over 4@c so that he did not have to make the nasty guess himself|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime, this has a lot of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: although even if Weinstein makes it he is losing a bunch|pg||
nt|joest: well not a bunch but 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 7 IMPs for Weinstein on board 64 they got them for 3X 800 versus 500 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: wd RS|pg||
nt|marinesa: now ron won't think it's fake js sine\ce didnt bid 4d over 4c|pg||
nt|jlrice: but still with prime controls outside I would still take chance    might be a little worried of 2 spades off the top though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobh1: is it clear to lead a @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Etter has shown 5 hearts and 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think so|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: weinstein-garner had a colossal mishap on 81|pg||
nt|bobh1: 80|pg||
nt|mslair: xx kx KQJ10x, AKQx   might not jump shift but|pg||
pc|s6|nt|migry: but i have much less imagination than Roy:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: well he picked an imaginative @c to lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: he will have to unblock the suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: unless alex guesses @ds|pg||
nt|migry: don't think he will guess the diamonds|pg||
nt|bobh1: then it becomes academic|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|migry: NS lead attitude so he doesn't know about club length|pg||
nt|bobh1: certainly has no obvious clues|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|joest: brutal for howie|pg||
nt|joest: has to either lead spades himself or give declarer the second dummy entry to double hook spades|pg||
nt|joest: i am told the board is reversed|pg||
nt|joest: so it is brutal for steve garner|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marinesa: other room on solid club hand 4n-7n|pg||
nt|mslair: 7n.t was a push   |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: dog barks somewhere in the background:  Howie says "with the dog barking, you have to ruff"|pg||
nt|joest: jonathan certainly needs to win this cheaply|pg||
pc|cK|nt|migry: and he will see 4 hearts in south - normal to assume that north has length in diamonds or 2-2|pg||
nt|bobh1: i was wondering why the board was taking so long|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|migry: same contract would have gone down on a spade lead if played from the South hand, so a good hand for transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: west is thinking|pg||
nt|joest: sorry franco|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|bobh1: nope|pg||

nt|joest: back to back grands|pg||
nt|mslair: this one is more interesting|pg||
nt|joest: in challenge the champs you need to get to 7NT|pg||
nt|joest: in real life you are happy to get to 7@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and in the process of discovering the red herrings he cost himself an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|bobh1: people are telling me it is not so bad to get to a slam on a finesse |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@h = limit raise in spades|pg||
nt|mslair: even the best can not find the spade jack in the auction?|pg||
nt|joest: exactly right|pg||
nt|bobh1: texas i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: unless playing relay where all things are possible|pg||
nt|joest: a 1NT rebid maybe|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think its a bit more than a finesse needed|pg||
nt|bobh1: Howard Weinstein opened the W hand with 2@c|pg||
nt|bobh1: it was close imo, but the upshot wasn't good for them|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mslair: although  I once overheard Freddy Hamilton exuberantly going nuts about he and Ira asking for the jack of a suit successfully:)|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c presumably Michaels |pg||
nt|mslair: 30-35 years ago|pg||
nt|joest: Ira was quite a character|pg||
nt|joest: still is i'm sure|pg||
nt|mslair: he was  and a great player and competitor|pg||
nt|joest: so Mark are you betting on or against this pair reaching the grand?|pg||
nt|mslair: slightly against with the interference|pg||
nt|jlrice: Bassegio passing his 12 count will ggo a long way to keeping them low     |pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfg: again stating the obvious|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: no bet then.  i'm afraid I agree with you|pg||
nt|joest: bidding and raising spades here has yet to come to grips with the eleven card club fit|pg||
nt|migry: was roy going to invite game or offer a choice @s/NT?|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he bids game now it is a slam try which he doesn't have|pg||
nt|jlrice: but will likely take 1H ass real opener and might drive to game|pg||
nt|mslair: I like Ron's pass   he figures to be able to bid better in competitively|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|joest: whoa|pg||
nt|mslair: wow:)|pg||
nt|joest: Welland has not shown extras yet|pg||
nt|joest: he could have a bad eleven with three spades|pg||
nt|joest: I think seven just left the building|pg||
nt|bobh1: this game isn't great but it makes|pg||
nt|marinesa: me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: identical auctions so far|pg||
nt|mslair: can they bid to 6 clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: with this vul, the key for 2@d is really about suit quality|pg||
nt|joest: hands like this often do better when north starts with a forcing club raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: maybe that is not the best matchpoint action but at imps or total points or rubber bridge it has the merit of simplicity|pg||
nt|mslair: not good %  but makes 7 on this layout|pg||
nt|joest: welcome to mark lair|pg||
nt|mslair: not sure of the pass of 2s tho|pg||
nt|marinesa: now just working 10 count with 8 losers good pass|pg||
nt|jlrice: I would probably have opened Rons hand 3rd chair White on red|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: they have reached six clubs in the other room|pg||
nt|migry: not sure i would have taken the conservative approach with the south hand |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mslair: hi|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room they just yanked this out to 4@s.  would u bid 4@c mark?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|migry: vulnerable at imps - or non vul at matchpoints for that matter|pg||
nt|bobh1: fortunately for him chris had enough to accept the GI|pg||
nt|migry: but in 3NT he has to guess what to do on the 2nd round of hearts|pg||
nt|migry: is it obvious?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: screen down -- etter asking welland questions|pg||
nt|migry: looks right to play the Q@H|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s requires less inspiration|pg||
nt|migry: yeah, i guess|pg||
nt|migry: who would like to bid 1NT - 4@h? - so boring|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont know why Roy bid it like this...maybe he thought his table feel would help him decide what to do later|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think the longer etter thinks the more likely it is that roy will guess wrong|pg||
nt|migry: unless he ducks:)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mslair: y|pg||
nt|mslair: with my favorite partners|pg||
nt|joest: well lets see how that works out|pg||
nt|mslair: now cue bidding is an overstatment  maybe 4s although Baseggio is unlimited|pg||
nt|mslair: looks like 1 down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobh1: or returns the J|pg||
nt|jlrice: probably|pg||
pc|h5|nt|migry: no way north is going to guess it right|pg||
nt|bobh1: right chris is playing it not roy|pg||
nt|migry: wouldn't like to be in his shoes now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: the delay was etter asking questions - welland was out of room, so chris was answering onthe other side of screen|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|migry: wow|pg||
nt|mslair: maybe 2 down now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|joest: is 6@c a contract you would want to be in ?|pg||
nt|migry: very well done|pg||
nt|bobh1: good guess in that suit...now @ss|pg||
nt|bobh1: the percentage play works|pg||
nt|migry: he can play AK @s |pg||
nt|migry: to protect against Qx with west|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|mslair: hard to be objective when you see this layout|pg||
nt|joest: is the board turned the right way this time joe?|pg||

nt|migry: in the meantime the welland team picked up a big swing in the 3NT hand|pg||
nt|migry: in board 68|pg||
nt|bobh1: somehow ron smith guessed the @ds|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: that makes three in a row|pg||

nt|mslair: Baseggio seems to play near flawless from what I've seen|pg||
nt|joest: he has indeed played very well|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jlrice: another slam for NS      i guess they want to test slam bidding all in one set  :)|pg||
mb|2D|an|one major|nt|joest: well 6@c requires only the spade hook|pg||
nt|joest: and the club hook|pg||
nt|mslair: Baseggio plays well|pg||
nt|jlrice: after the interference though will be tough to find|pg||
nt|mslair: 1n.t to me is a perfect choice|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would bid 1D|pg||
mb|3S|an|minors|nt|fabsayc: 2@D classic precision, three suited, short diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: 5@d 5@h all pass|pg||
nt|bobh1: alex steps up|pg||

nt|mslair: ok|pg||
nt|jlrice: i dont mind raising partner with 3 trumps should he happen to bid spades|pg||
nt|mslair: 1n.t with the great spot cards and the potential rebid problem|pg||
mb|4D|nt|joest: 1@h = spades|pg||
nt|mslair: the one level transfers are a huge new innovation|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not sure what 3@D is, maybe stayman|pg||
nt|migry: 1H= spades|pg||
nt|bobh1: no|pg||
nt|bobh1: i could see bidding more than 2@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: chris doesn't subscribe to the casino count concept|pg||
mb|5D|nt|joest: are you sure he didn't bid 3@c joe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: he does have a nice opener despite short @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Willenken terrified of what a Roy Welland third seat favorable vulnerability 3@d might look like|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|vugraphzfg: no, i missed 2@D by Baseggio|pg||
nt|joest: ah|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: apparently 3NT confirmed hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: or sonty forgot that they play 2d weak in 3rd chair, that was on their card|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: rather lucky to right side this contract|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime back on the last hand, on the very same sequence as here, north carried on to 5@c over their 4@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: also bob might have passed the double some kibs are saying|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||

nt|bobh1: somehow roy figured out this was a good time to psyche|pg||
mb|1N|nt|migry: he really didn't - they open all 11|pg||
nt|mslair: 6d was pretty good on last|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: so is it double or 4@h mark?|pg||
nt|joest: no fair peeking|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 2n was coming home on 86|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobh1: i see|pg||
nt|migry: and some tens too:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bobh1: well a lot of tens are much better than this particular 11|pg||
nt|migry: double or 1@s with the south hand, Bob?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1@s is my style|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: even playing fishbien dbls  +200 is your max   now he must go low|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobh1: so the odd-looking (to me anyway) 3@c bid may have cost|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: so spades scores more than clubs and they will pick up 2|pg||
nt|mslair: that was a given sorry|pg||
mb|3N|nt|migry: i have to go to work:( see u later and enjoy the show|pg||

nt|migry: i have to watch this - lucky i live next to the club:)|pg||
nt|jlrice: EW get to get in on the fun this time|pg||
nt|mslair: a very good 16 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: diamond lead most effective|pg||
mb|6N|nt|bobh1: which would you do migry, double or 1@s|pg||
nt|migry: 1@s|pg||
nt|migry: for me, it's not even close|pg||
nt|migry: but it's a matter of style|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: begins to lock declarer out of his hearts|pg||
nt|joest: plus it's fourth from your longest and strongest!|pg||
nt|joest: Axxx is a disfavored expert lead however|pg||
nt|bobh1: a decent game|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 4@d is probably KC for diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: declarer may need to hop ace here|pg||

nt|joest: so Mark why is Axxx so despised by experts?  why would Roy choose to lead lefty's RHO suit over leading a diamond?|pg||
nt|joest: i'm sorry lefty's suit|pg||
nt|mslair: spade ace  ak of hearts  club king but Chris will get that right|pg||
nt|mslair: ace of spades seems clear and hope for Ax of clubs|pg||
nt|mslair: unblock hearts  and hope for Ax of clubs with a spade blockage|pg||

nt|lml: and the crossruff doesnt work|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: that gives the defence a fighting chance|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that he cant ruff another thing in dummy and get off dummy without promoting the @HJ|pg||
nt|lml: there is no way out that I can see|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he could try for a spade club squeeze which doesnt work|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: on 32 @cs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mslair: 5 spades down 2  on the KJ9xx, KJ10xxx layout|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW will get to @hs...hopefully not too many of them|pg||
nt|bobh1: alex shouldn't get too excited|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think he will he doesn't have much|pg||
nt|bobh1: no spots non-prime honors|pg||
nt|mslair: he is famous at the University of Georgia for picking off a fake kick/pass...running for a touchdown to win the game in the last 30 seconds|pg||
nt|bobh1: but first lets see how high chris goes|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: whether forcing or semiforcing, jonathan has to rebid 2@d|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobh1: N goes for the walk-the-dog approach maybe|pg||
nt|bobh1: and alex does get excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: berkowitz weak = others mixed raise|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobh1: maybe he knows that if they overbid to game they might save|pg||
nt|bobh1: which i think they will|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now Garner will be concerned that west might have been clowing around a bit and they have a fit|pg||
nt|joest: @clowning|pg||
nt|joest: clowning sorry :)|pg||
nt|mslair: dbl is knee jerk and then you re-think that 5 of partners cards are hearts|pg||
nt|joest: if lho is legit right|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mslair: this partnership guarantees 6+ cards on their major suit rebids|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: another slam:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: no gin for me, thanks|pg||
nt|joest: it is not like garner to pass there|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s is not music to S's ears|pg||
nt|bobh1: but he will be happy to know that his partner seems to like @cs |pg||
nt|bobh1: if 2n is a transfer to 3@c then 3n probably implies 17-19 and within that context, the N hand is very good for slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: any time you have 4 sticks and partner tries for slam you should cooperate|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobh1: no chris avoids the temptation|pg||
nt|bobh1: but roy doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i would play wellands 4n as rkc|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mslair: good matchpoint challenge|pg||
nt|mslair: that is true  he is a great matchpoint player|pg||
nt|joest: so that means double is a matchpoint bid :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he wanted to make a slam invite he would have bid 4n a round earlier|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess chris didn't think it was RKC|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfg: they switch 2@H and 2@D here so this is a heart rebid and 2@H would guarantee 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mslair: 4 spades by Roy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: yep|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest: this one would be tricky in 6@s even with the heart ace on|pg||
nt|bobh1: was 2n really the bid?|pg||
nt|mslair: very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: sry, yes it was 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Willenken: "uncharted territory-no agreements"|pg||
nt|bobh1: so he didn't know what 4n was all about|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 4N was passable he thinks|pg||
nt|bobh1: so he punted with 5n|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|mslair: a little  but tons of imp players would likely dbl  |pg||

pc|h2|nt|mittmouse: 3 rds of spades would complicate life for declarer i dont think he can make it|pg||
nt|marinesa: this is gonna take careful play , make with 3-2 hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobh1: even if 2n was the bid 4@s is strange|pg||
nt|mslair: y|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|joest: cross ruff|pg||
nt|mslair: very hard not to make 6 spades playing any form of bridge|pg||

nt|mittmouse: now he is going down|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mslair: the dia to the king was 100% to lose to the ace  |pg||
pc|sT|nt|mslair: I might   depends on my partner's temperament and great declarer play skills:)|pg||

nt|mittmouse: no|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfg: Roy was trying to bid blackwood|pg||
nt|bobh1: that's what i thought|pg||
nt|bobh1: meantime the dangerous 5@d contract that i mentioned earlier has cost the weinstein team a few|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobh1: roy is obviously one of those guys who thinks 4@h is a transfer to 4@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: translation: can he go for a number cheerfully?|pg||
nt|mslair: doesn't let it hang over   mentioning the hand 2 or 3 times |pg||

pc|h4|nt|mslair: club club ruff and play a spade   it's over|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest:  with south with only three clubs yes|pg||
nt|lml: problem now|pg||
nt|lml: I think he had to put in the @H10|pg||
nt|lml: he cant play up to it now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mslair: almost can't make from here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||

nt|fabsayc: made 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: duck ace of hearts, 3c pitched other heart, ruff heart, lead dia|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow|pg||
nt|mslair: 6s was bid at the other table on last?|pg||
nt|joest: looks like they let 3NT through in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: they are a board back|pg||
nt|mslair: ok|pg||
nt|bobh1: but this board could be a big winner for them|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|joest: and a fascinating line of play it was|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c is a relay, parhaps Gf|pg||
nt|bobh1: another 11-count|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: tempting to bid a natural 2@H with sontags hand|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: with qjxxx vul?|pg||
nt|joest: weinstein could trot out a 2@s slam try and ask for information|pg||
nt|joest: which i suspect he might on the off chance he locates a singleton club|pg||
mb|2D|nt|caitlin: Over precision 1@C responses are artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: terrible suit, but that is where the imps are|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|joest: interesting that they would promise/deny controls at a level this low.  I wonder if they still need to be checking for a heart fit|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew might have competed at the 3-level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mslair: low trump lead would have got the king from dummy|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think a second double by W might have been appropriate|pg||
nt|bobh1: when the opps have bid and raised a suit, this kind of double should just show a desire to compete further|pg||
nt|mslair: maybe another queen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: this hand could swing a few|pg||
nt|joest: rusinow|pg||
nt|joest: promising the jack|pg||
nt|joest: sorry about that |pg||
nt|bobh1: would be comforting yes|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|joest: he opened 1@c|pg||
pc|d9|nt|joest: not the best start for the defense|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|joest: no he can't have a stiff club|pg||
nt|joest: he rates to be buying something like he got|pg||
nt|joest: not clear whether this measures upto slam standards|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|caitlin: making 6|pg||
nt|mittmouse: that was inspired|pg||
nt|marinesa: and very correct on this hand|pg||
nt|mittmouse: now he knows spades are 4-1|pg||
nt|mslair: that was very inspired|pg||
nt|mittmouse: but 4s is relatively easy to make with the c k onside|pg||
nt|mslair: that play was too good|pg||
nt|mslair: you think?|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|caitlin: Here are scores up till last match......sorry 5..forgot that @S8:)  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfg: west asking about the bidding which has shown a 5=3=3=2 hand with no more than14-15|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: west staring intently at dummy|pg||
nt|joest: playing for 3-3 spades leading to four spades + two clubs + three hearts if king is onside|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzfg: this was big opportunity for meltzer's squad, hard to get there though|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|joest: had to duck that|pg||
nt|bobh1: weinstein picks up a big swing on the previous  board and are now back in front|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|s7|nt|mslair: heart 10 from hand on last was best|pg||
nt|joest: you mean pitch a heart instead?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mslair: now only 1 down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marinesa: not if he follows it with another spade|pg||
nt|mslair: now one less heart and 4th club and he went down in a hand he had made|pg||
nt|mittmouse: exactly|pg||
nt|mslair: the spades could not be 3-2|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he is going down if s ducks the h|pg||
nt|mslair: why?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if he |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: These guys have all played a lot of boards, very tiring|pg||
nt|mslair: yess|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Aftrr spade held, he had a lapse/happens|pg||
nt|marinesa: ron can win 2nd heart and draw trumps and pin the heart nine|pg||
nt|mslair: so refreshing to land on feet   after knowing you've made errors|pg||
nt|mslair: we are looking at 2 different hands|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he would have gone down if s had a 4th club |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|joest: in the other room east entered with 3@d over 1@s and is playing right there doubled!|pg||
nt|mslair: heart 10 under the queen  |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: why?|pg||
nt|mslair: now down for sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: again, what happened|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marinesa: exactly just play hearts and take club hook|pg||
nt|mslair: by saying too good  I meant like an NBA basketball star making a great shot  no other implication   |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|mslair: maybe not because of the dia 8 pitch|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mslair: would have been 2 down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marinesa: none taken was a great play here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  how about an undo operator? :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest:  no my bad sorry :)|pg||
nt|lml: interesting line if anybody wants to look|pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: once again :). no error in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|joest:  i'm not sure I would have passed over 1@d.  I never have great success trapping but i don't pretend 2@c is a perfect call.  In the old days passing and bidding 2@c showed a good hand with diamonds on the side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  maybe it stilll does!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with you|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: when heart wasn't led, he played for stiff honor, since south bid hearts, could cash diam for 4|pg||
nt|joest: this is going to be a huge loss for Welland once the dust settles in the open room|pg||
nt|mslair: what was his logic of the hook   I'm not paying clost attention|pg||
nt|joest: not sure how he worked it outto hook there|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: last hand for this set - short break and then back|pg||
nt|bobh1: so bob and alex get a score on the right side of zero|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: last board before a break of about an hour and a half -- restart at 3:45 Central DT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|joest: ok last hand of the day|pg||
nt|joest: the halfway point of this match|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: we will have a new leader in the match|pg||
nt|mslair: 1/2 time has arrived|pg||
nt|joest: play starts again tomorrow at 11 a.m. east time|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: last hand   yes after 2d Xed result comes in|pg||
nt|joest: Joe Stokes: applause to our operator|pg||
nt|mslair: 2h must =11 or 12|pg||
nt|joest: and thanks to Mark Lair as well for his commentary and to the kibs for all your help|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: thanks -- thanks Jack, Mark and specs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|larrymori: routine 4@h here|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d!|pg||
nt|mslair: go figure|pg||
nt|mittmouse: anybody for a nt ocall with e hand-just kidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: but are you really kidding us George?:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzfg: west has been thinking for some time now|pg||
nt|mslair: but non vul is the good news|pg||
nt|joest: true but it's not going to imp well with -200 from his teammates|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't mind 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: could be good hand with 4s, just not slamworthy|pg||
nt|bobh1: opp a passed hand, so he won't hang you hopefully|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm sure n didnt bid 3@c|pg||
nt|mslair: this will be erased|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: east hand a 'death hand' in standard methods|pg||
nt|mslair: I'm wondering|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mslair: West defers the play with his empty aces|pg||
nt|joest: east invented a 1@h response in the other room and passed the raise|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: i like that convention: "you play it"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Kolesnik thot 3@C was forcing|pg||
nt|mslair: did he really pass?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think so too|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfg: imps are flying this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: maybe some on 71|pg||
nt|joest: Franco can be pretty sure that the heart suit offers no future|pg||
nt|mslair: bridge is not what it use to be   so many partnerships playing transfers at the one level|pg||
nt|joest: agreed. i have a huge collection of bridge books a complete set of the Bridge World|pg||
nt|joest: when you read about old matches there is a lot more excitement|pg||
nt|joest: b/c the biddingis a lot worse and they get to more exciting contracts :)|pg||
nt|joest: but you can also follow the bidding without a translator|pg||
nt|mslair: the favorable 3 diamonds went for 800 in the other room   on the long run   the good suit overcalls at favorable vul pay dividends|pg||
nt|mslair: IMO|pg||
nt|mslair: these are 120 board matches starting today?|pg||
nt|joest: so you have no objection to the actual 3@d bid on @SJx @HKxx @DAJ98xx @Cxx notwithstanding the result?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: last hand now, although a few more comparisons|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he did|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: he'll probably play a high club then switch back to spades: my guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mslair: defensive feel is the hardest facet of bridge|pg||
nt|bobh1: aside from which even if it is NF W's hand is not so bad|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: diamond leads jacobs 169-80|pg||
nt|joest: nickell +2 over Harris|pg||
nt|mslair: una mas?|pg||
nt|joest: don't have that one mark|pg||
nt|joest: I found two |pg||
