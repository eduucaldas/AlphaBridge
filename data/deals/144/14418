nt|mslair: 2d|pg||
nt|joest: I have seen 2@d as four card drury and 2@c as three|pg||
nt|joest: but these guys play lots of different things|pg||

nt|mslair: texas followed by new suit is exclusion for most of the world|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: that would get this over quickly|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs, no matter what their normal responses, revert to 0-3, 1-4 after exclusion|pg||
nt|joest: after 5@d here, East would bid 5@s, one key card, west bids 5NT, east bids 6@c to show the king and voila|pg||
nt|mslair: not underwritten  although only 13 possible high card points... no ace of dia  can't fail to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: so far that is precisely the auction next door|pg||
nt|joest: that's true, asking about the club king may just be torturing partner|pg||
nt|mslair: very interesting to me to see a top pair miss 7 spades|pg||
nt|joest: they bid it next door on exactly the sequence we just discussed|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: marginal hand for stayman|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mslair: particularly after 1n.t opening:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: may get a second chance|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: double=one minor or both majors|pg||
mb|5D|nt|migry: 1@d= hearts usually less than a game force which is normal with the south hand as they do open light|pg||
