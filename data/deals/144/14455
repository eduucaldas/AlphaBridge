mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: Welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I have not followed the play but I will put the result in|pg||
nt|migry: NS play 2NT 20-21 |pg||
nt|bobh1: either a heavy 2n or their range is higher than normal|pg||
nt|migry: so North decided to downgrade his hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess he didn't like the @h holding|pg||
nt|migry: good morning Bob , Alison and the 8 spectators|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi migry|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think it was an inspired decision|pg||
nt|migry: i agree|pg||
pc|s4|mc|8|nt|migry: South can either bid 1NT which is a game forcing relay or 2NT which is a normal Jacoby|pg||
nt|migry: 2NT usually shows a minimum balanced GF|pg||
nt|migry: the J@s may well be a wasted card and his 2nd long suit, the clubs needs too much|pg||

nt|migry: very well done:)|pg||
nt|migry: yesterday he decided to upgrade in the 1st hand of the match and it didn't work - i guess he tries the other approach:)|pg||

nt|migry: interesting problem for South |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: spades split nicely|pg||
nt|migry: a bit pushy by North, but the 10s and 9s add a lot to the hand's value|pg||
mb|p!|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|bigtrain: they'll get to the safe 7@D after this start|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|migry: it looks "natural" to play a high club - but that won't work|pg||

nt|bobh1: declarer appears to be a trick short|pg||
pc|cA|nt|migry: good play - Roy know he needs to create an entry for North|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bigtrain: they might have gotten to 7NT if south opened|pg||
nt|kjadams: can you work out the extra tricks and no club losers and play a grand?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfg: i do not|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hA|nt|caitlin: well he did:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: I think he just shot it out.|pg||
nt|larrymori: if 2@s shows something specific like 2 or 3 top honors it would help the count|pg||
nt|kjadams: true|pg||
nt|bigtrain: generally speaking responses to 2@C are made only with good suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the lure of the vul game has got them too high|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|larrymori: i happen to like 6 card suits with 2 of 3 top but here, it is a passed hand so it may take on different meanings|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Here, the aim is to avoid reaching 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|petergill: Is a diamond lead totally impossible if West bids 3NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  which shoud be possible missing the @dAK. Bot finding spades might have been tougher if North had responded 1@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Hard to respond 1@S when you are vulnerable - or would you do so, Henry?|pg||

mb|3H|nt|migry: in spite of the 5-1 split this contract should make |pg||
nt|joest: i wonder if this blackwood or a cue bid|pg||
nt|joest: blackwood could not serve much purpose after partner has shown controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: if Jonathan passes the worst he can do is a push. if he bids on (which I doubt) a push is the best he can accomplish|pg||

pc|c4|nt|petergill: I would back USA's 500th best team against Algeria at bridge :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer should play for the drop in @D's, as it's the best %age play, then fall back on the spade hook - bad luck|pg||
nt|petergill: If West was in 4@H on a non spade lead, the spade loser might vanish on the 5th @D. |pg||
nt|petergill: Even if West plays on hearts and discovers the long hearts with South, that would encourage West to think South has short @D's , not long @Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot see any realistic way for declarer to make 3NT, looking at 26 cards, with no opposition bidding. |pg||
nt|petergill: Another vaguely possible start to the auction was 1@D - 1@H - 1@S - 3@D - 3@H - this might dodge 3NT. |pg||
nt|petergill: The other table played on hearts at Trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Cohen still thinking|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing on hearts loses if @Ds don't come in for 5 tricks and @SK is onside and hearts do not break 3-3, as you lack entries late in the hand to play two spade hooks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||

nt|joest: after the transfer that itis|pg||

nt|mslair: texas followed by new suit is exclusion for most of the world|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: that would get this over quickly|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs, no matter what their normal responses, revert to 0-3, 1-4 after exclusion|pg||
nt|joest: after 5@d here, East would bid 5@s, one key card, west bids 5NT, east bids 6@c to show the king and voila|pg||
nt|mslair: not underwritten  although only 13 possible high card points... no ace of dia  can't fail to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: so far that is precisely the auction next door|pg||
nt|joest: that's true, asking about the club king may just be torturing partner|pg||
nt|mslair: very interesting to me to see a top pair miss 7 spades|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: double=one minor or both majors|pg||
mb|2N|nt|migry: 1@d= hearts usually less than a game force which is normal with the south hand as they do open light|pg||
nt|migry: 2@h= normal heart support|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d is doubled for penalties in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: it may be clear tous to preference to 4@s but its hardly clear to west|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: wow|pg||
nt|migry: i know i've been in worse slams|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|joest: if I were west and all I did was pref to 4@s and then got whacked I would be disappointed|pg||
nt|joest: maybe he is reconsidering however|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NV but i think sher was worth a raise|pg||
nt|joest: the mark lair approach|pg||
nt|joest: in an expert partnership 4@d might have been a choice of games cue-bid over 4@c so that he did not have to make the nasty guess himself|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime, this has a lot of play|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest: although even if Weinstein makes it he is losing a bunch|pg||

mb|p|nt|larrymori: with this vul, the key for 2@d is really about suit quality|pg||
nt|joest: hands like this often do better when north starts with a forcing club raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: maybe that is not the best matchpoint action but at imps or total points or rubber bridge it has the merit of simplicity|pg||
nt|mslair: not good %  but makes 7 on this layout|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: they have reached six clubs in the other room|pg||

pc|h6|nt|mslair: hi|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room they just yanked this out to 4@s.  would u bid 4@c mark?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|migry: vulnerable at imps - or non vul at matchpoints for that matter|pg||
nt|bobh1: fortunately for him chris had enough to accept the GI|pg||
nt|migry: but in 3NT he has to guess what to do on the 2nd round of hearts|pg||
nt|migry: is it obvious?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: screen down -- etter asking welland questions|pg||
nt|migry: looks right to play the Q@H|pg||

nt|migry: yeah, i guess|pg||
nt|migry: who would like to bid 1NT - 4@h? - so boring|pg||

nt|migry: for me, it's not even close|pg||
nt|migry: but it's a matter of style|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: begins to lock declarer out of his hearts|pg||
nt|joest: plus it's fourth from your longest and strongest!|pg||
nt|joest: Axxx is a disfavored expert lead however|pg||
nt|bobh1: a decent game|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 4@d is probably KC for diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: declarer may need to hop ace here|pg||
nt|joest: mark how would you go about this one?|pg||
nt|bobh1: but it wont make|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|migry: good pass by north|pg||

nt|mslair: seems like he's destined for doom|pg||
nt|joest: i don't see a way home|pg||
nt|joest: so Mark why is Axxx so despised by experts?  why would Roy choose to lead lefty's RHO suit over leading a diamond?|pg||
nt|joest: i'm sorry lefty's suit|pg||
nt|mslair: spade ace  ak of hearts  club king but Chris will get that right|pg||
nt|mslair: ace of spades seems clear and hope for Ax of clubs|pg||
nt|mslair: unblock hearts  and hope for Ax of clubs with a spade blockage|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: i think that is what Jonathan will do too|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: some of you may remember  Bob Etter as a place kicker for the Falcons a while back|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mslair: 5 spades down 2  on the KJ9xx, KJ10xxx layout|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW will get to @hs...hopefully not too many of them|pg||

nt|bobh1: no spots non-prime honors|pg||
nt|mslair: he is famous at the University of Georgia for picking off a fake kick/pass...running for a touchdown to win the game in the last 30 seconds|pg||
nt|bobh1: but first lets see how high chris goes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: whether forcing or semiforcing, jonathan has to rebid 2@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobh1: N goes for the walk-the-dog approach maybe|pg||
nt|bobh1: and alex does get excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: berkowitz weak = others mixed raise|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobh1: maybe he knows that if they overbid to game they might save|pg||
nt|bobh1: which i think they will|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now Garner will be concerned that west might have been clowing around a bit and they have a fit|pg||
nt|joest: @clowning|pg||
nt|joest: clowning sorry :)|pg||
nt|mslair: dbl is knee jerk and then you re-think that 5 of partners cards are hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mslair: another slam:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: no gin for me, thanks|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mslair: good matchpoint challenge|pg||
nt|mslair: that is true  he is a great matchpoint player|pg||
nt|joest: so that means double is a matchpoint bid :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mslair: 4 spades by Roy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: yep|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|joest: this one would be tricky in 6@s even with the heart ace on|pg||
nt|bobh1: was 2n really the bid?|pg||
nt|mslair: very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: sry, yes it was 2N|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobh1: even if 2n was the bid 4@s is strange|pg||
nt|mslair: y|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|joest: cross ruff|pg||
nt|mslair: very hard not to make 6 spades playing any form of bridge|pg||

pc|s7|nt|joest: translation: can he go for a number cheerfully?|pg||
nt|mslair: doesn't let it hang over   mentioning the hand 2 or 3 times |pg||

mb|2H!|nt|fabsayc: tempting to bid a natural 2@H with sontags hand|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: with qjxxx vul?|pg||
nt|joest: weinstein could trot out a 2@s slam try and ask for information|pg||
nt|joest: which i suspect he might on the off chance he locates a singleton club|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Over precision 1@C responses are artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: terrible suit, but that is where the imps are|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|joest: interesting that they would promise/deny controls at a level this low.  I wonder if they still need to be checking for a heart fit|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew might have competed at the 3-level|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mslair: low trump lead would have got the king from dummy|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think a second double by W might have been appropriate|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: west staring intently at dummy|pg||
nt|joest: playing for 3-3 spades leading to four spades + two clubs + three hearts if king is onside|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|joest: east hand a 'death hand' in standard methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: West defers the play with his empty aces|pg||
nt|joest: east invented a 1@h response in the other room and passed the raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i like that convention: "you play it"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Kolesnik thot 3@C was forcing|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: maybe some on 71|pg||
nt|joest: Franco can be pretty sure that the heart suit offers no future|pg||
nt|mslair: bridge is not what it use to be   so many partnerships playing transfers at the one level|pg||
nt|joest: agreed. i have a huge collection of bridge books a complete set of the Bridge World|pg||
nt|joest: when you read about old matches there is a lot more excitement|pg||
nt|joest: b/c the biddingis a lot worse and they get to more exciting contracts :)|pg||
nt|joest: but you can also follow the bidding without a translator|pg||
nt|mslair: the favorable 3 diamonds went for 800 in the other room   on the long run   the good suit overcalls at favorable vul pay dividends|pg||
nt|mslair: IMO|pg||
nt|mslair: these are 120 board matches starting today?|pg||
nt|joest: so you have no objection to the actual 3@d bid on @SJx @HKxx @DAJ98xx @Cxx notwithstanding the result?|pg||
