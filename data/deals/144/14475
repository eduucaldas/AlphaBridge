nt|wstuart: Very odd.|pg||
nt|psridhar: this slam is ill-fated|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will have to hope 5d goes d1 in the other room |pg||
nt|wstuart: Even with 3-1 @D the slam wouldn't make, so it's odds off.|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||

nt|Gerben42: but if so, why not play @C2 instead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even if he finds @HJ will go down now|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|h6|pg||
