nt|cherilou: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Raija - never would have occurred to me|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|stewball: mine is that I dont go looking for a major without a legit invite in NT|pg||
nt|stewball: Bates agrees it seems|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|cherilou: I think it's really borderline VUL|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|peachy: vul, and with tricks, S prob raises|pg||
nt|peachy: ordinarily, 2NT in competition not to play but this is obviously an exception such rule (if they have it)\|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|nt|stewball: really really very:)|pg||
nt|stewball: i HATE down 1 in 2nt|pg||
nt|mildredb: assuming @C lead will only make if Beatty guesses @D situation which will probably require x-ray vision|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cherilou: yet, as you can see John will lose 2 imps because they weren't in @S|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 1D here so no knowl;edge where length is|pg||
nt|peachy: if anywhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Each of these teams has two pairs playing souped up Precision and one (Jacobs-Beatty & Gitelman-Moss, who are out this quarter) playing standard|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|stewball: but I would rather play 1nt than 3 @s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs has put the screen down to ask Diamond something - I couldn't hear what (which is good because that means Platnick couldn't either :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Although he's a lot younger than I am so maybe he could|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: You're right of course - wouldn't rebid 1NT with stiff @d. But he was definitely doing his thinking before playing @d K not after|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "well, you might make 3NT"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cherilou: but you're down by 46--you need to bid that Vul game|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mildredb: Jan is the greatest operator - always shares table comments w/ us - ty, Jan|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: yes, makes people feel like they are right there tableside|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cherilou: any one know what 2@D is?|pg||
nt|stewball: not familiar with this 2@d treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i wonder what 2@h shows|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mildredb: yes - much more fun :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: hmmm--me either|pg||
mb|3N|an|frivolous slam try|nt|vugraphzfb: They play transfers after 1M-1NT - I thought that 2@d showed either 4+ hearts or an accept of a NT invite, but Harris only wrote 4+ hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North has shown some mild interest, I assume|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|peachy: 4H likely would have shown less|pg||
nt|mildredb: Jacobs not even willing to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|mildredb: this should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: yes, should, but maybe the diamond filler should have been shown, he does not have a bad minimum|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mildredb: some might play it is required below game|pg||
nt|mildredb: of course, the slam in on a @D break & finding @H Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Before the screen went up, Jacobs asked Beatty how he had described 3NT and Beatty said "mild slam try" so they were in agreement. |pg||
nt|peachy: thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Then they discussed bids over the Precision 1@d and decided they would play that 2@d and 3@d are natural and with a Michaels hand they just bid 1@s and then bid hearts later|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mildredb: Jacobs squad likely to win an imp|pg||

nt|stewball: no|pg||
nt|cherilou: Bates finds the right lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 2@c showed diamonds and 2@d showed about 11-12 HCPs and said nothing about diamonds|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure what 2@c accomplished.effectively he bid 3nt over 1@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan puts the screen down to ask what their 1NT range is - Mohan says 14-16|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|cherilou: he found out his partner had better than an 8-9 count with good suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: nice try by diamond, but declarer's trumps are big enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess Beatty's deciding which hand he wants to be in, and how he's going to play the hand, guarding against bad breaks. He knows a vul game is an important hand so doesn't want ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: to miss anything|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: We'll have a short break here while the director is called - Mohan had a cell phone which just rang.|pg||
nt|cherilou: when partner leads low card I think you're obliged to return that suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Director took the phone and said he'd be back presumably to tell them how many IMPs it will cost|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: Jan is right, we all can see that any line he chooses will work, but he has to do all the thinking without dbl dummy|pg||

nt|peachy: I got some, if I didn't have coffee I'd have no personality whatsoever.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It's a good exercise to figure out what they're thinking, I find. Here, probably Diamond is trying to figure out a lie of the cards where he can beat 4@s or at least give declarer ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: I was taught long ago that there isn't any space between 1 and 2 - if the hand isn't a 1@s bid, it's a 2@s bid, but some people have rules about suit quality so that doesn't apply|pg||
