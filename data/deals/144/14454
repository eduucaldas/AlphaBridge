nt|vugraphzfk: other table playing in 5@d X (!)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: well conceivably this can go down if chorush leads @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: which plays quite nicely if you have good guessing skills... or a very revealing auction (which they did)|pg||
nt|harmon: d lead quite lukr=ely on auction|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dougdscsu: doesn't look ilke theres any hope for declarer|pg||
nt|gavin:  a good time for a passive lead by hamman|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: he can afford to lead the @s king and switch to a @d after a suit preference card from partner|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: the ten could be right if declarer started with KJx|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: @h 10|pg||
nt|gavin:  yes but it also might deter hamman from continuing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: however it could mislead Hamman also|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yeah|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dougdscsu: katz still has to squash the @h jack to keep it to -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|thurston:  fit jumps reserved for those who dont jump shift on previous|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: it is often right to play the doubler for the trump void|pg||
nt|me argent: guess gerstman and i are complete  opposites on the subject of jump shifts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: North questions 4nt call - but is unsatisfied with the no agreement comment|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to keep score some time of how often it is|pg||
nt|lml: looking at Zia's hand I am not sure what 4NT meant|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@HS being played in OR|pg||
nt|lml: maybe it was just designed to confuse or maybe it was intended to show extra|pg||
nt|thurston:  4NT was Zia's turn to bid - a sowing of confusion effort I'd bet|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is playing with Landen's head right now|pg||
nt|me argent: zia likes to make speculative doubles esecially when he has a dirth of trumps|pg||
nt|me argent: comes from his rubber bridge days|pg||
nt|lml: I have found it quite common for players to double with short or void trump|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to start keeping records|pg||
nt|thurston:  he would be unlikley to dbl and give away trump Q's location|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure that Landen wishes that his opponent was anybody but ZIa who could have anything|pg||
nt|me argent: 4nt was an effort to effect the lead against 5@Hs doubled|pg||
nt|lml: I think Landen will get the trump suit right any bets?|pg||
nt|thurston:  could be huge swing if Landen finds a route to 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|caitlin: and Harmon|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: rough decision for harris|pg||
nt|gavin:  north can deduce south has some points (the opponents didnt try for game) and he thinks his prospect of making 2@S is better than defending 1NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: morning :)|pg||

mb|4S|an|key card|mb|p|nt|thurston:  zia worn out by previous - no creative effort here|pg||
nt|thurston:  4S = kickback for heart Keycards|pg||

mb|5H|an|2 with the queen or extra length|mb|p|nt|lml: is that the right answer?|pg||
nt|lml: I think they are not in the same place|pg||
nt|thurston:  2 with Queen because of extra length|pg||
nt|lml: okay maybe he is showing the heart queen|pg||
nt|me argent: meanwhile in OR NS are attempting to make 4@Ss aint science wonderfull|pg||
nt|lml: all the specs think so|pg||
nt|thurston:  4@S violates Burn's first Law|pg||
nt|lml: Gertsman isnt sure that Landen is answering aces, particularly because he has the @HQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: correct|pg||
nt|lml: so he has to decide if this is just extra length|pg||

nt|harmon: with k of hts maybe not minor kings|pg||

mb|4S|nt|harmon: spade|pg||

mb|p|nt|harmon: oyyyyyyyyyyyyyy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gavin:  the fact that north didnt bid 3nt implies that he doesnt have a lot of points in @S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 2 ways to mke 6 here, 1) ruffing finesse in @h or 2) black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: pick ur poison|pg||
nt|gavin:  the most normal way to try to make 6 is just a @H finesse|pg||
nt|gavin:  this slam is very close to 75%|pg||
nt|gavin:  (need 1 of 2 finesses)|pg||
nt|gavin:  a little more business|pg||
nt|gavin:  probably more like 65% because u will need none of your suits to break badly|pg||
nt|gavin:  but the opponents have to make an opening lead, (the a@S could have been on lead, making it that much tougher)|pg||
nt|harmon: good lead ralph|pg||
pc|d5|nt|harmon: if he had a 4th spade this wouldnt be a bad contract|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: as it is, it appears fairly hopeless|pg||
nt|harmon: prolly d2|pg||
nt|harmon: or 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: depends, I think he can get out for -1 if he plays a heart now|pg||
nt|harmon: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: even a small one would work the same ironically :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|dougdscsu: finessing the j of @hs surely isnt the % play to make 6 though once the @d finesse loses however|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|s4|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|gavin:  these guys are very delicate when they give signals|pg||
nt|gavin:  but an offer of advice to every day signallers|pg||
nt|gavin:  its best to be as obvious as you possibly can without costing a trick|pg||
nt|gavin:  if you have T9865 and you want to encourage, play the T, not the 9 or 8|pg||
nt|gavin:  the higher your card the more obvious it is to your partner|pg||
nt|gavin:  and sometimes it rules out potential holdings|pg||
nt|gavin:  like if you had T98 and wanted to discourage you would play the 8|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gavin:  so the 8 could be misinterpreted, the T however is obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: this looks doomed to -1 at best|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Good job Adam!!(MtV):-)) ---alll day slogging away|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gavin:  so you just have to decide who is more likely to have 3 and who 0|pg||
nt|gavin:  and start by playing the correct honor to cater to it|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|gavin:  in this case, south has bid hearts and diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: thanks V, and everyone else, I'll be covering this match again tomorrow... so will see everyone soon I'm sure|pg||
nt|gavin:  at this point as declarer im quite happy that it was a low @D lead, it means that south at least has A@D, and probably one of the K or Q|pg||
nt|gavin:  because they didnt lead the A or K|pg||
nt|gavin:  so its looking like my finesses are onside|pg||
nt|harmon: low heart1111|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|passell: very lucky hand not many entries to lead everything|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|ritong: zia trying his best to muddy the picture|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|gavin:  another reason for starting with a low club to the king is if its singleton Queen|pg||
nt|ritong: so far so good|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|gavin:  you will be able to use two seperate dummy entries to draw trumps|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gavin:  south's shape is very well definited now, either 3-5-5-0 or -4-5-4-0|pg||
nt|gavin:  defined|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|gavin:  if spades are 3-3 the easiest thing to do is spade to the T that will make it easy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gavin:  the support double puts south with exactly 5@H|pg||
nt|passell: yes that looks like best by far  makes with K of hearts offside|pg||
nt|passell: good play by north with AJ9 of spades to play the J without the king of hearts to give a losing option|pg||

nt|mittmouse: no i guess he will make it|pg||
nt|curtis: chorush too greedy with club shift|pg||

nt|algraves: Zia is not 5-5 with K 5th of hearts|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He knows only AJ spades, Q clubs, soemthing in diamonds (not A/K, so ergo heart K|pg||
nt|passell: must have heart K to open  not Hampson and Greco|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Right|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  ya hamman vul playing standard 2nd chair, hes not opening some 3-3-4-3 11 count|pg||
nt|algraves: which is what playing spades to be 3-3 would mean rather than finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: he thinks Hamman probaby has the K@D though|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Ok, but so...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: this comes back to Zia's A@D play|pg||
nt|gavin:  ya he thinks hamman is AJx ?xx KJxx Qxx|pg||
nt|gavin:  still only 11, no chance|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That wld be only 10 (or at best) 11 pts|pg||
nt|caitlin: let's just tell Morgan what is obvious so we can all go to sleep|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That is not anything he wlda opened vul--2nd chair|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Marty asking about their opening style, and Zia said only 11 if he "really likes his hand"|pg||
nt|caitlin: Marty|pg||
nt|othered1: would northhave made support double on Ajx xxx KJxx qxx?|pg||
nt|passell: 2nd seat vul no chance Bob opens bal 11|pg||
nt|algraves: that gives Zia XXX, KXXXX, AQXXX, void, I dont see that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yep, I think he'll get this eventually|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Additionally, if Zia had that, he mighta taken a chance & dbled 5@c|pg||
nt|passell: long tough day  they have played great bridge|pg||
nt|algraves: he would have bid more than 3D|pg||
