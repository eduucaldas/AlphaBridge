nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS pretty much the same, with a loose club |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lasu: näyttää kotipeliltä|pg||

nt|kippari: olisiko pari helppoa voittoa tänään tiedossa:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although EW 1NT in first position non-vul is 9-12.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold knows his partner is incl;ined to be conservative and as i suspected has play pard for more than two Ks and a J|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: well its nopt doubled into game but as cards lie i cannot see this contract doing off|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1st favourable.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has no S in his name.|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: thk|pg||
nt|mdgraham: meanwhile, this is the 9-12 version, and NS have elected to try to penalise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as against that, EW are probably in an 8 card fit, which means the double could be shaded, and S surely has 5 hearts. so at these colors i think there is a strong case for 2H|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: it could be a disaster tho at unfave vul when townsend only has 4 hearts|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: in any case, what S has promised is offense, not defense, and as i said, S almost surely has 5 hearts. even if not, it is unlikely to be  disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: however it has not made yet!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good afternoon all|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 1D = H ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i get the commentator's curse award of the year for sure|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1NT rebid is something like 18-20 - 1D was t/fer to hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: at favourable some will stretch to 3@S with N's hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: townsend / gold play a lot of tramnsfer sequences leqading to a lot of right siding of contracts|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm....|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasu: tämä me jo nähtiin|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: or even at green, as Zia did in the American Trials yesterday|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he went for 500 against 430, so only a small loss|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rado: desperate effort to promote trump trick for defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: towsend rock minimum for his bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this can make double dummy on this lead but i fear iy wont make in practice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it will|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here unluckily it is wrong sided - 4nt not safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E will not enjoy discarding twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can safely discard clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if declarer plays 2 top diamonds it is over|pg||
nt|lestergold: but is that an abovious line|pg||
nt|lestergold: and when q@d drops does that deny the J!?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he discards clubs declarer's task is easy as little temptation to try club hook|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, but there is restricted choice, plus some possibility that with diamonds that good he might have led one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he cashes his hearts East will be forced to make at leas 1 club discard and declarer will guess to play on diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: all possibe Victor but he has to play well if he is to makem this|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: it just seems normal to run hearts then play 2 top diamonds|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: if LHO does have QJx of diamonds there is still the spade king onside possibility|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see this failing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but then i dont see my own failings either:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes since WEst has at least 8 major cards playing diamonds looks natural|pg||

nt|eamongall: they should be reeled in |pg||

nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed @ds and @ss|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: So, left alone declarer can pick up the suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes but East unlikely to hold four spades after a 1NT overcall.|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: director was called by West|pg||
nt|jtr: To ask the football score?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I hope he doesn't take objection to my director reference recently.|pg||

nt|brolucius: He might play one top club to see what happens.|pg||

nt|roswolf: he may well david|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three clubs and two hearts would be enough.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he switches to a diamond and declarer clears the hearts, he will need to play clubs then, of course.|pg||
nt|copeyj: hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi.|pg||
nt|copeyj: justin rightly taking his time - he knows this is potentially a huge board with the opps being doubled and vulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be good if BBO provided some sort of icon (such as a blinking eye) to let you know that the system has not crashed when there is such a long pause.|pg||
nt|roswolf: or a monk comtemplating his navel perhaps?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or a pulsating brain icon, to indicate that the player is thinking. |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think he may switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|copeyj: the W @C holding is a nice one to have - if partner lays down the ace it doesn't matter what carding you play you can convey the good news|pg||
