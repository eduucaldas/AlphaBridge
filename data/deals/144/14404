mb|1D!|an|2+|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|bigtrain: 1@D is thier catchall bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually 2+@D and 10-15 or so (11-13 BAL)|pg||
nt|caitlin: if you play 2/1 with those clubs you need to make a 2/1 bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is a natural one round force|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT could offer interesting duel|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kjadams: double penalty here?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: X is a good raise to 3@C|pg||
nt|kjadams: to bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe they changed it...  looks like meck means penalty|pg||
nt|kjadams: 800 on best def.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: on perfect defense I believe 2@d X is -3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: wonder what roddy will make of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Club lead, @s switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: and a spade ruff, then Heart back|pg||
nt|kjadams: the trick to getting 800 is to get the 3 spades, 2 clubs, then force North to win heart for a 3rd club and uppercut|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: now meck is confronted to a difficult situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Meckstroth said X is penalty|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: at least i suppose so  walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|bigtrain: only a one round force|pg||
nt|ritong: okay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: although the only non-GF follow-up is 3@C|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ritong: @cs are not solid, because rod would have bid game directly if so|pg||
nt|ritong: east has @ds + entri(es)|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3D|an|weakish - little or no spades|nt|bobh1: would be the wrong move if the @cs are running because then you have 9 tricks and are risking going down on a cold hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: it is unusual to see meckwell stay out of a game that their counterparts bid and make|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell is inquiring about the 2S call - is there delayed entries?|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes one always wonders about these things|pg||
