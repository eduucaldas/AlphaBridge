nt|joest:  these two teams have been pretty much even steven for 105 boards and will settle things here in this final set|pg||
nt|joest:  east-west play a pretty standard system|pg||
nt|joest:  north-south play a 'kind of standard' system of their own making|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  whose odd features include transfer responses to 1@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|mildredb: Hi, Raija - we're becoming real buddies :)|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!ss|nt|peachy:  www.bbotv.com/vugraph to watch closed room or any other match at the same time|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: North South are playing the popular transfer advance |pg||
nt|lml: a lot of total tricks on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: E-W have 11 of them and N-S about 8 or 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax:  has the singleton 10 |pg||
mb|2S|nt|me argent: 2@Ss?|pg||
nt|lml: I think that was misplaced|pg||
nt|lml: it should go in the West column|pg||
nt|me argent: jacksons faith is touching|pg||
nt|lml: I would say "touched" rather than touching myself|pg||
nt|me argent: shers 1@H was a transfer to @SS|pg||
nt|lml: but South might have bid more diamonds to sir the pot a bit|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Beatty asks about leads - 4th|pg||
nt|peachy: Diamond - Platnick play 2/1 with variable NT opening|pg||
nt|mildredb: I believe different hands are being played in each match this round - same hands begin in semi-finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Beatty "I don't think that's legal :)" (His first quetion had been 3rd and 5th?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I meant strong club with variable NT|pg||
nt|me argent: 2@Ss was more than enough pot stirring if you ask me linda|pg||
nt|lml: Jackson should not be thinking about bidding now|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: okay that makes more sense|pg||
nt|lml: I might have lead a spade instead of the @DA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry - was trying to get something organized :)|pg||
nt|lml: but everybody was bidding them|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: And Jacobs-Beatty sys 2/1 with 15-17NT|pg||
nt|joest:  Kolesnik relying on something reasonable in hearts so reaching 8 tricks via four trumps + 1 spade + 1 ruff + 2 clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Gitelman-Moss playing their version of 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will compton upgrade to 1@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: Welcome Cherilou everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "guess I could have saved a trick or 2 with a better opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Cheri|pg||
nt|stewball: there are differing views as to how to go about this S hand when pard opens 1nt|pg||
nt|stewball: hi Cheri|pg||
nt|cherilou: Hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gets my vote too     16+ HCP unbal [or compensating playing strength]  or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|joest:  a hand that east-west will almost certainly bid to slam|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Raija - never would have occurred to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax:  Sometimes one can also catch a defender off-guard covering the Jack in the N seat with H10x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 12+ HCP, 5+@C   they have immediate bid for 4441 but not 5440|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt looks like the NS normal contract but down if @Ss led|pg||
nt|lml: 5@c is a terrifc spot |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Except for the 3 aces?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stewball: mine is that I dont go looking for a major without a legit invite in NT|pg||
nt|stewball: Bates agrees it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: I think it's really borderline VUL|pg||
nt|me argent: except 4 the 3 missing aces|pg||
nt|lml: oh that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: sorry.  Well Jackson isnt sorry because he got a heart lead|pg||
nt|me argent: must admit  i also would have led a @H with  @Ds hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: vul, and with tricks, S prob raises|pg||
nt|peachy: ordinarily, 2NT in competition not to play but this is obviously an exception such rule (if they have it)\|pg||
nt|joest:  many play this as forcing to six and a choice of slams|pg||
nt|joest:  also leaves room for west to introduce a five card suit of his own and suggest a 5-3 slam (here in diamonds for example)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stewball: really really very:)|pg||
nt|stewball: i HATE down 1 in 2nt|pg||
nt|mildredb: assuming @C lead will only make if Beatty guesses @D situation which will probably require x-ray vision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the rest of this auction will be natural|pg||
nt|poohbear: Its very easy to overbid good hands and underbid bad ones when playing strong @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman-Moss didn't even sniff for slam  1@H-1@S;3@H-4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this would be easy slam to reach playing relays|pg||
nt|poohbear: quite a raise with a @h void. Though could well be right|pg||
nt|lml: you just have to read the beginners book I guess... fourth highest from longest and strongest|pg||
nt|me argent: but @Cs block and def will get another chance to  lead @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jackson fiddled with the K and Q of clubs - not sure why he chose the Q|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: no running now, Mr, jacobs|pg||
nt|mildredb: what a dbl!  |pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: Platnick is thinking, pull, pull, pull :)|pg||
nt|marinesa: 5-3-3-2 pick a slam most common|pg||
nt|joest:  hi marinesa|pg||
nt|marinesa: hi jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Apparently Kolesnik thought 5NT was choice of slams, but Etter thought it was GSF and didn't know what to respond|pg||
nt|joest:  usually there are ways to set hearts trump short of 5NT :)|pg||
nt|joest:  this use of 5NT is very practical|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: He's made the right choice anyway, although on this hand it doesn't make any difference since with hearts splitting, there are 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  And here old fashioned me would have thought it was a grand slam invitation!|pg||
nt|joest:  yes henry that is old fashioned :)|pg||
nt|joest:  I think the direct 5NT still has that meaning but that's about it|pg||
nt|marinesa: 6 of a suit by etter should be a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|joest:  everyone has less for their calls these days than they used to|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: So between the two players and the three of us we have 3 different ideas of what it means - I'm with Alex and Jack that it's choice of slams|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|Jacki: Welcome our Commentators, Bob Heitzman and Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|bobh1: hey marshall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Etter: "got anything?"|pg||
nt|marinesa: totally agree pick a slam, but 5-3-3-2 specifically|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Garner: "pretty good"|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru 3 of 8 sets are now online -- thx Jan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||
nt|poohbear: Compton's pass surprises me. 4@h rates to be a better contract than 3NT and he has slam potential opposite 12 points when partner is marked with some @d cards|pg||
nt|poohbear: never really conveyed the strength of his suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Bramley asking about the lead - it's lower of touching, but would lead the J if interested in the 10 and the Q if interestd in the J (at least I think that's what he said)|pg||
nt|lml: not after Jackson lead the tricky @CQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|cherilou: with favorable @S Mohan will make 1NT|pg||
nt|mildredb: Greco in the other room did infact play AK of @D - what a play!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Bob, Marshall|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Here is another chance for a technical play in the @H suit|pg||
nt|marinesa: rixi markus first wrote about the intra finesse|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Without any additional information the best chance for 1loser only is to play N for H10 doubleton|pg||
nt|marinesa: or 10 doubleton|pg||
nt|lml: now if Diamond would duck once more|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcmax:  That means declarer would play a low @H away from the A. and if N plays his honor, he next plays the Jack from dummy to pin N's 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think EW play standard signals|pg||
nt|me argent: last chance 4 @D to beat this|pg||
nt|lml: Platnick doesnt really know he wants a spade|pg||
nt|lml: you cant blame him|pg||
nt|me argent: true|pg||
nt|lml: after that discard which should be suit preference its hard to find a spade|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|cherilou: yet, as you can see John will lose 2 imps because they weren't in @S|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 1D here so no knowl;edge where length is|pg||
nt|peachy: if anywhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Each of these teams has two pairs playing souped up Precision and one (Jacobs-Beatty & Gitelman-Moss, who are out this quarter) playing standard|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobh1: hi Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "you play upside down, right?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT might go down|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stewball: but I would rather play 1nt than 3 @s|pg||
nt|lml: Diamond did very well to ignore his partner|pg||
nt|me argent: pitch a @D @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs has put the screen down to ask Diamond something - I couldn't hear what (which is good because that means Platnick couldn't either :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Although he's a lot younger than I am so maybe he could|pg||
nt|patricck: K@D instead of the k@S and 13 tricks would have been easy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Probably asking about whether Platnick could have a stiff @d for the 1@d opening, since from the DBL of 3NT he thinks Diamond has the Q|pg||
pc|d4|nt|me argent: not best|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: looks like -1|pg||
nt|joest:  note the start of the @HQ incase hearts were 5-0 onside|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA lose @HK|pg||
nt|lml: somebody had to keep spades|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know what Platnick kept all those diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Same auction in the other room and they didn't get the spades going either|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cherilou: now only 1|pg||
nt|lml: they just couldnt be useful|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzfb: Guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "should have known Diamond had the diamond"|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer is lucky that the defense cant run @ss|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
mc|11|nt|mildredb: I doubt he could have singleton @D in this auction & rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is very tough to defend but Diamond did so well to switch to a spade|pg||
nt|me argent: an exciting push|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "well, you might make 3NT"|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Only this is not the layout here, where that would work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: There were problems with the first two boards (duplication) so we'll play them later|pg||
nt|poohbear: everyone friends here. I expect a snide comment from Hampson :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky -- this is only match playing that board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but you can watch other vugraph tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Hal|pg||
nt|joest:  Weinstein has a pretty nice duke|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Etter: "so that's a choice of slams?" Kolesnik: "yes" Etter: "well I had the same bid no matter what"|pg||
nt|me argent: NEXT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: EW unhappy that they didn't hold onto their spades|pg||
nt|lml: I bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: but you're down by 46--you need to bid that Vul game|pg||
mb|2D!|an|3-suited|nt|jcmax:  Yes, very true Marinesa, or 10 doubleton. If N plays low declarer would finesse against the 10 and then again in the next round play the Jack from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: If you're talking about taking an intrafinesse, the players were all laughing about "have you ever seen one work at the table" and "it's in a book"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boards WILL be duplicated across both matches in the Semi-Final which begins Thursday|pg||
nt|marinesa: sure does,|pg||
nt|joest:  can Garner-Weinstein bid to the heart game? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: Jan is the greatest operator - always shares table comments w/ us - ty, Jan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D is catchall  2+@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: smoke em if you got em 3NT here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C shows @C & @D|pg||
nt|poohbear: around inv values|pg||
nt|poohbear: but not quite|pg||
mb|2H!|an|pass or correct|nt|peachy: yes, makes people feel like they are right there tableside|pg||
nt|marinesa: yes, it's in bols brillancy book the hand by rixi markus|pg||
nt|joest:  doesn't make on best d|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: any one know what 2@D is?|pg||
nt|stewball: not familiar with this 2@d treatment|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H is cute but beaten on double dummy.... 2 diamonds followed by A@S and Q@S|pg||
nt|marinesa: the tap will beat even that|pg||
nt|joest:  right.  but it is harder to beat than 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i wonder what 2@h shows|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The truth is they all have seen several working and they all have taken several of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss alerted his Pass of the DBL, Gitelman didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: yes - much more fun :)|pg||
nt|marinesa: and yes i've had it work many times as i'm sure sabine has|pg||
nt|me argent: in other match bd 2 also was a push but their both EW pairs were plus 200 instead of minus 660|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cherilou: hmmm--me either|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzfb: They play transfers after 1M-1NT - I thought that 2@d showed either 4+ hearts or an accept of a NT invite, but Harris only wrote 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N knows that W has at most 3 hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: W certainly has his bid but it wont work out well for him|pg||
nt|bobh1: is 4@s makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 5 spades he would presumably want to play in spades or at least explore for best game, and since he responded 1S....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S goes down|pg||
nt|joest:  well this auction shows a good hand (not this good) with longer clubs and four hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 5 perhaps|pg||
nt|marinesa: but wouldn't 2nt leb still apply by steve theoretically  guess after overcall and cuebid maybe should still be constructive|pg||
nt|joest:  perhaps Howard is contemplating the devious 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 3@c wasn't alerted on either side of the screen; some play that it's stronger than a cue bid of the opponent's suit, but I don't think that applied here or they'd have alerted|pg||
nt|henryb:  btw would you bid 2@c or 2@d with Etter's hand? I would bid 2@d unless I played transfer responses|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: North has shown some mild interest, I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, of course it's Diamond who's been thinking here, not Wold :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Platnick asks about carding - 3rd/low, upside down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcmax:  I wonder whether NS here were on the same wavelength as to S's dbl over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Now Jacobus is asking about Moss' pass of the DBl and I'll try to see what G wrote (but he is leaning forward and blocking my view of it, sorry)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  It looks to me as if S intended it as showing @D and N thought it showed values|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: 4H likely would have shown less|pg||
nt|mildredb: Jacobs not even willing to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|mildredb: this should end the auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: right wold had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|marinesa: for sure|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobh1: nobody invited him to the party|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mouser:  nice restraint by Howie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Garner: "I've got a Jack ... actually, I've got 2 Jacks"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: yes, should, but maybe the diamond filler should have been shown, he does not have a bad minimum|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mildredb: some might play it is required below game|pg||
nt|mildredb: of course, the slam in on a @D break & finding @H Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Before the screen went up, Jacobs asked Beatty how he had described 3NT and Beatty said "mild slam try" so they were in agreement. |pg||
nt|peachy: thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Then they discussed bids over the Precision 1@d and decided they would play that 2@d and 3@d are natural and with a Michaels hand they just bid 1@s and then bid hearts later|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: the Precision 2@D got them to hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Welcome Steve Beatty, who'd rather be playing, but ...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mildredb: Jacobs squad likely to win an imp|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cherilou: since Harris knows morgan has @DK needs to return @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems ill-advised. the spades are poor and E has already passed 4C. of course there may be some ambiguity about how many clubs W has shown, but since he clearly has game values ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he ought to have only 4 clubs, and yet E was still willing to play 4C|pg||
nt|lml: welcome :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mildredb: oh, sorry, they made 7 in other room, my apologies :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: they can't make 8, can they?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mildredb: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Hi folks |pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Oh dear. You know something went wrong when you ran from 3NT doubled and all you achieved was getting doubled in 4NT instead....|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Let's say W wins the @D and switches to a @C|pg||
nt|marinesa: best d|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Now declarer can finesse in bothe @S and @H, but because of communication problems he can only get 3 @H tricks|pg||
nt|jcmax:  That means he would end up with 8 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: after 4@h got doubled and went PP, Jacobus started to take the tray away but Wold said "wait" and then "this is a partnership game" :) then bid 4NT|pg||
nt|marinesa: next case|pg||
nt|henryb:  DOIGB|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Etter: "good switch"|pg||
nt|joest:  same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, Moss has been thinking, I didn't realize I hadn't played the @d Q|pg||
nt|lml: so they may win an imp or two here|pg||
nt|lml: since hearts is more fun than clubs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|cherilou: well done|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: I can count 4 more tricks if he cashes a spade and a club and makes 2 hearts|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|bobh1: so this one could be costly to @d; but the truth is the auction may be very similar in the other room|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a trap hand for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus: carding? Gitelman: "upside down"|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the double y S worked out well, but it was dangerous...he can work out the shapes almost exactly, so he knows his side will be able to lead trumps a maximum of once|pg||
nt|jcmax:  If W plays another @D now declarer would get an extra entry into his hand and would end up making his contract!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus is the declarer so Moss can see the diamond and entry situation I think|pg||
nt|jcmax:  But on any other switch declarer cannot get his 4th @H and ends up down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: So I guess they should have sat it out in 3N doubled?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: these two pairs have an acbl conv card available, most of the peirs in this event only have system summary on the USBF site   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblc...|pg||

nt|marinesa: i believe he'll find the club switch then fred can kill the dummy|pg||

nt|mildredb: Harris is lead the Nickell team 18-1 after 3 bds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4CX is down one, and even then only because S gets to throw a spade on 3rd heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "sorry - 3NT is only down 2, I should have stayed there"|pg||

nt|lml: chance at 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: 2@c =@d it seems|pg||
nt|peachy: Chance for Jacobs to gain IMPs here, aggressive game but makeable|pg||
nt|poohbear: same auction here|pg||
nt|me argent: but one never knows sinc 3nt is being played in OR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marinesa: double is probably staymen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus and Moss are now debating 4@hx - Jacobus says they had to get the diamond ruff to beat it; Moss disagrees; going back and forth for awhile|pg||
nt|marinesa: did they lead a trump in other room|pg||
nt|joest:  2@c = artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: curious that he ap[ologized for leaving 3N but not for leaving 4C which was his best haven|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and when i say "some"  i mean Bart & company :)|pg||
nt|joest:  2@d = art. 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|marinesa: wow|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c either a good hand or clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  2@h = a good hand with 3+ hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Both Weinstein & Garner wrote long explanations of 2@c (and 2@d in Garner's case) but neither has handwriting I can read from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: jacobus a touch heavy for 4@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: but no harm no foul in this case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mark lives pressure bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: They're playing strong club so 4@s is very wide-ranging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marc|pg||
nt|lml: you should beat it though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: unless they play a strong @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: good save NS except for one small problem ::)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his notes actually say 3@C = preempt/mixed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 5+@C 5+@D|pg||
nt|mouser:  Neither has handwriting I could read sitting next to them|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think that 2@c was either natural or some good hand and 2@d asked and now 2@h shows a good hand with long spades, but not certain|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "Upside down attitude and reverse smith by both of you, right?" Sher "yes"|pg||
nt|me argent: not so easy think 9 tricks are their 4 the taking with the 3 2 @C split|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mildredb: 10 imps likely|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, they did it|pg||
nt|mildredb: anything Beatty wants to do, works|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs using his time as dummy to study his bidding notes :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: then 4@s is normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense just has to knock out @C before giving up the lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense needs to get @cs going otherwise they might disappear on @ss . But the 7 of @ss is a powerful card|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: in fact the ability to jump to 4@s with a hand like this is one of the benefits of playing a strong @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: We have 2 strong club pairs here and 2 standard pairs in the other room|pg||
nt|joest:  2NT = natural GF|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|stewball: will E let his pard out?|pg||
nt|stewball: no|pg||
nt|cherilou: Bates finds the right lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 2@c showed diamonds and 2@d showed about 11-12 HCPs and said nothing about diamonds|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure what 2@c accomplished.effectively he bid 3nt over 1@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan puts the screen down to ask what their 1NT range is - Mohan says 14-16|pg||
nt|joest:  3@s = sixth spade|pg||
nt|lml: they need to shift to a heart now|pg||
nt|lml: the defense can take 2 hearts a spade a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: it isnt that exciting in 1NT though|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  A heart shift here should result in 5 tricks for defense 1S 2H 2C 1D|pg||
nt|me argent: they wont|pg||
nt|lml: you can make 3NT if you rise on the @SA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|cherilou: he found out his partner had better than an 8-9 count with good suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: nice try by diamond, but declarer's trumps are big enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess Beatty's deciding which hand he wants to be in, and how he's going to play the hand, guarding against bad breaks. He knows a vul game is an important hand so doesn't want ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: to miss anything|pg||
nt|lml: he found the heart shift|pg||
nt|me argent: bravo|pg||
nt|lml: it seemed normal enough to me|pg||
nt|lml: but I am seeing all the hands|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: that will be last time i beat Barry to the analysis of defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: i type too slow :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i type fast but think slow|pg||
nt|poohbear: Doesnt seem like much for Bramley to do except shift to a @c  . Is he pondering a trump shift?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jimkrek: had a chance to beat it on heart lead-now it sd be over|pg||
nt|poohbear: or deciding that  alow @c is right :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah - just wondering if King or 6|pg||
nt|poohbear: got that one in first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the table, Bart is what some would call  'deliberate'|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hampson is studying this one though :)|pg||
nt|mouser:  Fortunate layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Weinstein explained that he has shown 6+ spades and 3+ hearts and Garner could have asked about a 4th heart but didn't so presumably doesn't have 4 hearts, but other than that ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Garner could have anything|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stewball: N may fall to the @d shift temptation|pg||
nt|marinesa: good decision by steve with howie holding 9 major suit cards|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|me argent: it seems both EWs bid to their best contracts|pg||
nt|lml: they got a diamond lead from the south hand in the other room which made it easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: So first serious swing to the Weinstein team, who have been playing very well here - they were a very low seed to start with|pg||
nt|me argent: but that means 10  imps to weinstein|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stewball: and does|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: We'll have a short break here while the director is called - Mohan had a cell phone which just rang.|pg||
nt|cherilou: when partner leads low card I think you're obliged to return that suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Director took the phone and said he'd be back presumably to tell them how many IMPs it will cost|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: Jan is right, we all can see that any line he chooses will work, but he has to do all the thinking without dbl dummy|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein has been amazing|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is understandable than Platnick does not expect W to have D king, but what is the plan for beating 4S by returning any other suit but Ds?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|joest:  i suspect that the east-west lead conventions have pegged doubleton ace king there|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mildredb: this is a good coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I got some, if I didn't have coffee I'd have no personality whatsoever.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It's a good exercise to figure out what they're thinking, I find. Here, probably Diamond is trying to figure out a lie of the cards where he can beat 4@s or at least give declarer ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: a problem, and that's going to be hard so takes awhile|pg||
nt|poohbear: If Hampson trusts the bidding his plan was to take a winning @s finesse then draw one round of trumps and set up @ss then he would run them thru  North|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: If North ruffed in he could draw the last trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: and dummy would be high|pg||
nt|joest:  so garner afraid of going down at once|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: the losing @s finesse was not in the plan :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mildredb: this is like watching grass grow ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: And Beatty still trying to figure out who might have all the spades and what, if anything, he can do about it.|pg||
nt|peachy: Diamond was on the right track, it was possible partner had short diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|lml: I liked the fact that they got to the aggressive game|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|joest:  Weinstein sorry|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mildredb: should go quickly from here - @H |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|poohbear: we will see this variation for down 1|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s8|nt|vugraphzfb: Good switch since Weinstein would have taken the diamond finesse for his contract if he found out about the spade loser before diamonds were played|pg||
nt|marinesa: technically ruffing d then pulling trumps is a little better|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|me argent: i guess the secret to playing good bridge is to have a weinstein on your team|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Weinstein: "I should probably ruff a diamond at trick 2, but if that worked the squeeze probably would too"|pg||
nt|me argent: now this looks like a NS 3 NT contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: In Precision, N can open 1S. In standard style, not everyone does|pg||
nt|marinesa: particularly since both pairs opened a club with 4 diamonds and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: palyinf notrump means never having to say your sorry|pg||
nt|lml: playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: only if they play attitude leads,,surely a @d shift could have been right|pg||
nt|stewball: the problem was the 1@d opener perhaps|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Puppet Stayman|nt|mildredb: some might open 2@S in std, but perhaps he doesn't think the suit is good enuf or just not his style|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I was taught long ago that there isn't any space between 1 and 2 - if the hand isn't a 1@s bid, it's a 2@s bid, but some people have rules about suit quality so that doesn't apply|pg||
nt|ahollan1: (10)11-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: No I think other room opened a Precision diamond and then East bid 2@c to show both minors maybe?|pg||

mb|3H!|an|4 !ss|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Wold: "maybe too much"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has an awful lot of controls for the blunderbuss call of 4S i think. as he holds spades, there is no rush, and no need to worry to much about further competition. i like pass or ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he appears to have made a good dec unless Marc made an inspired heart play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus asks about the lead - Platnick puts the screen down to whisper something, probably that it is usually 4th but might be different in partner's bid suit|pg||
nt|marinesa: i see |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: GItelman-Moss are the only "natural" pair playing now - other 3 are strong club|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: First seat also can take liberties that would not be wise in second seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Of course that line is in a different place at different vuls and seats - I suspect Mildred & I would agree that at this vul in second seat, the N hand would clearly be a 2@s bid - ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: in first, it's less clear|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 4@s is fairly descriptive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is NOT 6@D 4@C  other than that unclear about minor dist|pg||
nt|mouser:  Steve might have made a spec x|pg||
nt|marinesa: not true with the heart return if etter held diamond guard since communication now broken so couldn't squeeze either out of the red suits only east|pg||
nt|curtis: been noticing lately that everytime 3nt gets doubled, it's cold|pg||
nt|marinesa: curtis the scores were wrong in the nickell match, right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I agree, seond seat vul 2S|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I thought the hand was worth 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Down 75?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only time they'll raise to 2@S with only 3 card support is the troublesome 3=4=5=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: no problem with 1NT here--not the kind of boards NS want|pg||
mb|p|nt|marinesa: some clubbers play don't there so clubs and a higher|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: with only 70+ boards to play|pg||
nt|poohbear: The other reason to bid 2NT is it now allows partner to show 3 card @s support and avoid NT |pg||
nt|lml: so its about the uptricks and maybe an imp|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mildredb: looks like -1 & if so, Diamond will jump into lead by 1|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcmax:  If declarer here draws trumps and then plays on @H he is bound to lose 3 heart tricks because of the bad breaks|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The natural line of play is trying to ruff some @H in dummy depending on how they break|pg||
nt|marinesa: think he will work out not to play trumps but ace and a heart with bidding and lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: well, slam would be cold if either one held the jack of hearts, and that wouldnt change anbyones bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Nickell won the segment 57-17|pg||

pc|dK|nt|poohbear: Bart ducks a round in case @hs 6-3 .|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @c finesse then loses the defense would not be able to take their @h tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there ANY way for him to guess @C?|pg||
nt|poohbear: hand records or peeking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or - anti-percentage play for a swing|pg||

nt|me argent: lets get a  move on boys this hand is boring|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I'll tell them you asked (not really) :)|pg||
nt|lml: you have to think about how to make that extra overtrick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfb: Didn't need any inspiration in hearts, with the endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: The USBF Conditions of Contest have a long discussion of slow play and one of the points is that you shouldn't "waste" time, like taking a long time over an overtrick. |pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: we are watching the paint dry while diamond is working to assure no more than 1 down, against possible lays of the cards|pg||

nt|marinesa: welldone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred opened South 1N -- Wold in 8@H  -- exactly NOT how Jacobs wanted the swing to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Compton asks what Bramley had and then "can we make 5 of some minor?" and B says "no, we can't make anything" Hampson: "4@s is the game that has a play"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Now they're discussing what happens in diamonds - Howie: "lose 2 clubs and a ruff and a diamond" Alex: "so I make 3@d ... that was what I bid" lots of laughter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: How many total hours was it?|pg||

nt|lml: incredible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-20|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  must have been about 11 hours...it was 10 hours at 59 all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: And I suppose Isner's reward is having to play some more!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfb: Leads are Rusinow from length and top from 3 or fewer|pg||

pc|h2|nt|stewball: was he peeking at it jan?:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|stewball: bad luck for it to go off when you're peeking at it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|cherilou: He is not allowed to have in the room--major penalty--maybe 12 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Of course Mohan wasn't looking at his cell phone, but in order to avoid any issues the rules are very strict|pg||
nt|stewball: N may take a run at this....|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mildredb: @HA will work |pg||
nt|mildredb: or low|pg||
nt|me argent: east will have trouble getting the @Ds wrong so he should make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Looks like 9 tricks...6D 1S 2H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: judging by the stayman call, it would appear NS favor very sound values for a 1N overcall at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: true - and he gave that the most thought of all his plays :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: marc likes his hand|pg||
nt|reisig: Many uses of X here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stewball: i wonder if the rules in europe are similar|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: In the Vanderbilt, Michael Kami had his cell phone in the playing room and it went off and I think it was 10 IMPs - luckily it was in a match they were winning by a lot|pg||
nt|stewball: anyone know?|pg||
nt|bobh1: its true that Wold should have sound values to overcall 1n red opp a passed hand|pg||
nt|jimkrek: good 7 vul when you can place most of the cards and pard can have up to 18 favors bidding in these situations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: devilish hand to defend, looks good for S|pg||
nt|bobh1: he prob is figuring where there's 8 tricks there should be 9 somehow|pg||
nt|bobh1: better to blast 3n than to invite and have partner accept reluctantly then get doubled|pg||
nt|jimkrek: and Marc AWAYS likes his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss: "all right with that, Marc, already" (leading trumps that is)|pg||
nt|marinesa: but he really has none of them|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfb: Bates: "if you'd just made a try there...." general laughter|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: at mps he would probably not bid it this way|pg||
nt|joest:  better than 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Weinstein: "does this show extra values?" Kolesnik: "I think it shows some extra, not clear"|pg||
nt|me argent: to pick up about 2 or 3 imps 4 the @D team since NS are playing 4@Hs in OR|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|d3|nt|mildredb: oops |pg||
nt|me argent: the 9 tricks east will take shows how much he undervalued his 6card @D suit by opening a weak NT his hand was closer to a strong nt in value|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mildredb: if going to lead @S, why overtake?|pg||
nt|peachy: both sides raised with a doiubleton in this hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|reisig: @d seems easy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: the defense benefits a bit from the fact that W led the heart deuce, so E knows no doubleton. but declarer is going to get very lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was busy inviting Steve Beatty to join us - the diamond was played promptly|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|nt|bobh1: or maybe if he had a different partner he might not bid it this way|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jimkrek: d back wd have made him sweat, but lucky club position wd always see him home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes. the heart does not look right to me. unlikely that S has a doubleton as with a good 3244 or whatever S would have doubled|pg||
nt|reisig: I was sure of the speed :)|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Hi Folks :)|pg||
nt|marinesa: welcome steve|pg||
nt|reisig: Hi Steve :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|lml: north south are going to providing East with an extra uptrick|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and E is conspicuously short of entries, so heart will only give the declarer an extra trick in a dicey game|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Steve has a passing interest in this match :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: that was a good pitch|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|lml: so +150|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a disgusting result for EW but their teammates in the other room might well do the same thing|pg||
nt|bobh1: moss and gitelman are pretty aggressive themselves|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c3|nt|poohbear: looks like 9 now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict low club exit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would squeeze W if 45 in pointeds|pg||
nt|bobh1: woops guess not|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 1NT opener not as solid as 1NT overcall vul vs not|pg||
nt|bobh1: different situation when 1n is an opening bid and not an overcall|pg||
nt|reisig: oops|pg||
pc|s2|nt|reisig: needed @h to score the @s Q|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobh1: as jan just pointed out :)|pg||
nt|reisig: I think he "knows" the hand now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: sure  THIS hand takes 9|pg||
nt|poohbear: partner had extras . 9 of @s and a third @h :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Haven't been able to see Greco's discards, so he may have a club to lead here, I'm not sure, but he's thinking a lot|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|cherilou: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: big 1@C|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, the swings have really come in the other room. EW there will know they started behind and have got significantly further behind|pg||

mb|2C|nt|stewball: interesting choice by Mohan|pg||
nt|stewball: little boost coming?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: The director just came in to say that it will be a 6 IMP penalty for the cell phone - asked if they wanted him to tell their teammates now and they said no|pg||
nt|bobh1: personally I'm not sure what LTC is...my approach is, we have a @h fit? so let's try 4@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Losing Trick Count|pg||
nt|bobh1: its imps....maybe it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i'm told 2@h may s how @h and another|pg||
nt|marinesa: must have led ace of diamonds for 6 clubs to have made since 2 diamond losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = any (5)6-7 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Compton is going to have a problem over the presumed 3@h bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl would be TO I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 48 imps in 8 boards isn't impossible, but we are now into the realms of the very unlikely|pg||
nt|joest:  this would be a startr|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cherilou: the 3 matchs on vugraph--essentially no score changes at the half way point|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I forgot we had started the KO or I'd have written it sooner - yes, 2@h shows hearts and another and the other can be spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stewball: Bates sees an opportunity and goes for it|pg||
nt|cherilou: good pick up here can't take more than--or less thn 7|pg||
nt|stewball: W likley to bail|pg||
nt|stewball: 3nt is an overbid imo|pg||
nt|cherilou: then N better lead @DK|pg||
nt|stewball: or perhaps a misbid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cherilou: it's a youthful bid|pg||
nt|stewball: hard to believe that not everyone bids like me..lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then that means you disapprove of the 2N bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: so most likely they just gave their game swing back|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: And won't lead A of @d here since north is on lead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: real problem would be if Compton's minors reversed|pg||
nt|poohbear: caught partner with a good hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: wellll I wouldnt want to see partner jump  to 5@c :)|pg||
nt|curtis: well this is a start|pg||
nt|patricck: 8 back on the next board is an excellent start.... so 38 needed from 7 boards|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cherilou: we are older and wiser (?) and know that bidding 2NT tells our story|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "hope minor cards help you, because that's all you get. Good luck"|pg||
nt|stewball: as EOK would say,,this is 10 imps from nowhere|pg||
nt|stewball: or so|pg||
nt|cherilou: indeed|pg||
nt|stewball: oh well they still have the cellphone result to fall back on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan asks if 2@h is 5-5 or can it be 5-4 and Mohan says that they've discussed that in 3rd seat favorable it can be 54, but "it's been discussed but it's never been done"|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  looks like a badly needed pick up for Jacobs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobh1: but at least they bid the red game and missed the white game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont misunderstand, i would also force to game, as jim and you said. i was simply trying to explain Marc's rationale|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will play to set up @ds in dummy. A dummy reversal|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

pc|s8|nt|stewball: check out the CR result on 15|pg||

nt|marinesa: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: The director just looked in and said "we could pick up the tempo here too"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: So I guess there may be other slow(er) tables - but for Marc to be slow is amazing :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can go all out for overtrick with ruffing @C finesse|pg||
nt|poohbear: no way he thinks the @c ace is in East hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: once @S22 -- but will he play 2 rounds of trump|pg||

mb|p|nt|mildredb: is e/w NT range 14-16?|pg||
nt|peachy: 13-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Interesting that Bramley, playing pretty much the same methods as platnick, chose to open 1@d on the East hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: the previous bd could be dangerous as eddie promoted a 14-count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but EW make 600 in 3N|pg||
nt|bobh1: u should try not to do that when your pd has a yarborough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they could easily win 5 IMPs for -400|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think that they play 14-16 NT (at least they told me they played the same as Greco-Hampson and they play 14-16. But Gitelman-Moss probably play 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Bramley to Hampson: "how were the clubs?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry - I'm trying to get the other tables all back up correctly - of course this made|pg||
mc|13|nt|mildredb: i would certainly consider it in p/o seat |pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: He showed his hand and asked about the club K|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marinesa: in other room spade ace, now club shift so bramely thought pard had stiff club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6+@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzfb: The director, who had been here getting them to hurry, just said "well, youre up to 7 minutes a board, don't rest on your laurels" as he left (meaning they have to play the ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: remaining 6 boards in about 42 minutes)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E opens another junkpile, this time red|pg||
nt|bobh1: is it clear to get involved here?|pg||
nt|bobh1: as S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think it is clear, no|pg||
nt|jimkrek: when ur pard has 6 trumps for you it is:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: right|pg||
nt|bobh1: being non-vul helps also|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and i guess dont is a good thing to be playing when you have this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but that partner is Marc Jacobus, and if he passed at favorable your chances of a good catch go down somewhat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=weak @C  or FG 2-suiter|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "3NT hasn't been faring well at this table" Morgan: "so you went low with 12, eh?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile you could go plus in hundreds by staying quiet. alternatively, your bid might tell them how to play a close game|pg||
nt|joest:  2@h is a call that the cowboys in the other room neglected to make!  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: looks like a breather|pg||
nt|stewball: which EW will relish|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so i think cases can be ,made each way|pg||
nt|bobh1: so platnick super-accepts with his junkpile|pg||
nt|bobh1: assuming 2n is normal lebensohl|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marinesa: you type faster than me jan|pg||
nt|joest:  will Etter take a vul vs not overcall seriously? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jimkrek: looks like 2nt was system on -which is usually ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps 3H by E should mean D-positive PLUS five hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: i see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  3@C forced    not sure if DBL changes anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: now we see a different approach to wk 2s|pg||
nt|mildredb: J6th in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|peachy: diamond would not be a good lead here...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Perhaps these boards are a little difficult, because I see that the other room isn't ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Kolesnik: "got anything?" Etter: "something"|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|marinesa: he he|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I think it is an overcall I would neglect to make too, and yes i can see that EW have 10 tricks in hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: because the aceless E hand is likely to be better for suit play|pg||
nt|jimkrek: something to be said for Marc bidding 3hearts over 2nt as pass or ccorrect |pg||
nt|marlowepi: obviously that could get you too high though|pg||
nt|bobh1: on the -400 hand N with his yarborough bid stayman and went for only -300|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like this will be a good hand for Smith|pg||
nt|bobh1: i didnt even know smith was playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Compton didn't alert 3@c, but did write that 2NT forced 3@c|pg||
nt|joest:  amazing.   the one hand where trying to hit a home run would have worked and welland and willenken never bid :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|joest:  sometimes that happens when you are shell shocked from prior restults|pg||
nt|joest:  !results|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|passell: awful contract but cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hampson: "from Texas, this one?" Guess they don't play 2@c-2NT the same :)|pg||
nt|me argent: 9 tricks should presnt no great problem for declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzfb: DIamond: "might be cold on that lead" Jacobs then laughingly ground the diamond 3 into the table and Platnick said "standard signals?"|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|jimkrek: well-now they can take a bunch of tricks-or it might make if they dont play a spade bk|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Platnick: I'm taking at least 9 tricks, just so you know|pg||
nt|me argent: i guess east agrees with me|pg||
nt|lml: a good ploy to relax the defenders and steal overtricks|pg||
nt|lml: we are waiting for the results of Board 9 to come in|pg||
nt|lml: which should bring the score a lot closer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: though i guess the run of Ds will mangle S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you have to bid some awful games/slams  because so many good ones go down|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: wow great lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not much choice now|pg||
nt|jimkrek: seems like with all those ds he is force to cash spade ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he i sthinking about low spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but N cant have another card|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he wd only need 3 spades to beat it anyway so it wd always be wrong to play a low spade back|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this hand if 2n was @ds then 3@s was probably shortness|pg||
nt|jimkrek: yes-was alerted as such|pg||
nt|bobh1: should E be so eager to play 3n with only Kx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold picked up his cards, which had been on the table, but then put them back down and thinking some more.|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he was hoping pard had 2 aces and he cd scramble 9 with 5ds in jeapardy|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess its as good a guess as anything|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 1n bid was 13-16 someone has told me|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Compton "take your A of clubs, partner" (as he cashed it (laughter)|pg||
mc|9|nt|passell: when Compton wins the ace of hearts he has to lead one back to have any chance here|pg||
nt|poohbear: cant see Hampson misguessing that 1:)|pg||

nt|mildredb: I'm afraid the wk 2 bid got what it deserved|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Beatty: " at least you didn't do that non-vulnerable, George"|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  If hearts were friendlier, there would be a trump play available...but not today |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Brad was trying to decide whether to play for that and Wold knew that was what he was thinking so sped things up|pg||
nt|marinesa: yeah for eddie claiming|pg||
nt|joest:  I'm not sure how that works but I am sure I don't want to find out :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: EW turn for 16+ 1@C opening|pg||
nt|passell: 3rd round of clubs beats it for sure partner would score the 9 of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: but he really had nothing better to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Well, he said "I just want to speed up play"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marinesa: redouble, is 1 heart bid|pg||
nt|joest:  a worthy goal|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: thanks for relating the table talk so well--it sure adds enjoyment|pg||
nt|peachy: humor best, at things like that... :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we have seen a disproportionate number of aceless opening bids in this set|pg||
nt|jimkrek: great lead to get maximum punishment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes on club lead mustpitch right to beat it at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus tried to find out who had the club A but no one said and so then he claimed -3 and everyone agreed and Wold just figured out it was really 4, so changed the result and when ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I get a chance I'll go get the bidding & play back in since it was interesting|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stewball: non vul is not the same as invul|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris alerted Morgan's pass of 2@s but I don't know why|pg||
nt|mildredb: Harris still leads Nickell by 5, but has a huge board coming when Meckwell dbld Chorush/Koneru in 3@H making +1|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 3@H nat FG|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously if Bramley PASS   1@C-1@H = 8-11 HCP saying NOTHING about @H|pg||
nt|lml: you might be able to handle 4@S on this hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|stewball: this 800 off the top|pg||
nt|jimkrek: agree...if you bid 3 s and partner passes it cant be bad|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cherilou: yes--he has only 4 tricks if they X|pg||
nt|cherilou: if they X and sit z:)|pg||
nt|stewball: but E has no spots so he might pull|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris to Bates: "we play pass-dbl inversion. He either has a penalty X or a strong hand|pg||
nt|cherilou: I agree-so what's taking so long?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Apparently they're on different wavelengths here|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes, being able to shrug off a horrible result is best |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: This delay is because Beatty was in the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Bramley: "this might not be right"|pg||
nt|lml: but you are going to have to guess hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: good lead  but dia 3-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Etter: "what'd I show, 4 card support?" Kolesnik: "8 card, I'm counting on 8"|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond asked me to tell you :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that really seems like a lot to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess N didnt think he was worth a slam try|pg||
nt|passell: 4hearts much safer|pg||
nt|poohbear: what do  you think of the pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Meant Hampson on the comment, of course - sorry!|pg||
nt|poohbear: again we see a pass of 3NT before the hand had a chance to express how good their @hs are|pg||
nt|poohbear: Greco thinking of Ducking the @c here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Greco definitely thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3-2 @ds he just claims|pg||
nt|poohbear: ducking the @c is right when @cs 6-2 and the dbltn has the 4@ds but he cant know they arent 5-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this is also a bit hard to swallow|pg||
nt|jimkrek: ah-different auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus asked if there was any explanation on the other side and Wold said "3@s was natural"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: different but equally suspect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I missed the auction when I was changing the result and when Wold told me I didn't hear right|pg||
nt|poohbear: That was his 8th trick|pg||
nt|poohbear: he had goos play for a 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Greco asked Compton "2@s is normal?" before ducking|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: cant say I blame him|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: So it's back to the normal score |pg||
nt|stewball: if W is short they dont rate to make a profit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Gitelman's delayed 2@s bid bought the contract, where Bramley's immediate one didn't - we'll see whether that's good or bad|pg||
nt|lml: 3@S will be fairly straightforward I would expect|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzfb: Wold was a passed hand, playing Precision|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like this lead|pg||
nt|me argent: north has bid this hand extremely conservatively|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sher: "I apologize if I should have bid more"|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: yes but 4@S is lucky|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan asks "Did you think we had any agreements here?" Harris: "yes, I thought we played Pass-DBL inversion here, so pass was either a penalty DBL or strong, but the 2NT follow up ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: doesn't fit with that so don't draw and inferences"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus-Wold in 4@S already -- and auction isn't over|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: it needs the diamonds to not be ruffed and to play for 1 loser and you have to play hearts right just to start|pg||
nt|lml: 1 loser in hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: numerous ways it can gain|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would hope not Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wold treated his hand as  12+ HCP with 5+@H   maybe Hampson would have done that too instead of nebulous 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss-Gitelman never in the auction so Jacobus HAS shown @D length|pg||
nt|poohbear: in other matches Nickell leads Harris by 4 . Fleisher pummelling Robinson by 75ish and Weinstein over Welland by 22|pg||
nt|passell: 6 dia cold|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond and Jacobs both went "hmmm" when Beatty showed out of clubs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss: "he can be 5-4 either way?" Wold: "yes"|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: it wouldnt be a bad lead even if E never bid, either|pg||
nt|passell: he is thinking about hooking dia|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jimkrek: interestingly on bd 22 where after opening a 10 count wold-jac stayed out of game gitt-moss got there when gitt passed|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus and Wold discussing that they play transfers on this auction by UPH but not by PH but Wold wasn't certain so 3@s was a "safety bid"|pg||

nt|patricck: OK, that's the end of that I guess. I have to go now anyway, but it doesn't look as though I will miss a great fightback. Thanks everyone|pg||

nt|joest:  Welland and Willenken are hyperactive.  When they are on they are very on|pg||

mb|p|nt|passell: some early swing here|pg||

nt|poohbear: would at least try to have a bigger @c spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hampson: "what are your spot leads?" Bramley: "3rd and low"|pg||
nt|marinesa: we've all been there where we're stuck a little and things start off badly and the more we push the worse it gets, and these seasoned guys have been there before, you're right jack ...|pg||
nt|marinesa: they'll be disappointed but not surprised|pg||
nt|joest:  Kolesnik doing something quite normal with 2NT|pg||
nt|marinesa: howie always had lousy writing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|curtis: yes, i suppose disappointed is probably a better description |pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: I have to run - enjoy the rest of the set and tournament - thx all|pg||
nt|passell: this is very bizzarre|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: and then lead the @s K  |pg||
nt|poohbear: If I am going to gamble I will gamble all the way :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: partnerships should sort out what RDBL means as opposed to 3H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It was alerted but no-one asked; Diamond sort of pointed at the 2@s card, which is why I think it was a re-transfer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i just meant in general, all of us|pg||
nt|jimkrek: looks like 3nt and 4s can make but you have to double hook spades and in spades need abit of timing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess 3N makes but 4@s doesn't? |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jim plays 4@s better than I do :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do you have to double hook? cnt you just make small trumps?|pg||
nt|bobh1: W would seem to have a pass here so it may be academic|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think thatis a pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it looks like a good hand to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i forgot their notrump range is 13-16|pg||
nt|jimkrek: isnt he maxe by their standards-and his aq of heats like the ak?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb:  I still don't know what this auction meant, might have been a choice of games with 5 spades and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi Nic|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is a Q of which game|pg||
nt|joest:  the defense will get off to a fast start here.. and a slow finish|pg||
nt|marinesa: right curtis|pg||
nt|lml: once you have a weapon like puppet I suppose you have to use it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sbeatty:  Declarer can claim at least 11 tricks by leading a low D at trick 2|pg||
nt|me argent: all the more reason not to play it|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marinesa: not that they had a lot of pickups really|pg||
pc|c4|nt|passell: interesting 3nt would have to decide on a finesse or endplay|pg||
nt|poohbear: this wight actually have gone down with repeated @d leads|pg||
nt|poohbear: might|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hampson shuffled his cards around - I think counting losers and getting to 5|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jimkrek: yes it looks like u might scrable 4s on some sort of xruff too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sois le bienvenu le canadien|pg||

nt|marlowepi: D to king and then start doing business|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: the only thing to avoid is to play trumps from the top - any other line will work - but he does not know that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will touch trumps except to ruff things|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 56  Jacobus declaring  4N|pg||
nt|lml: might as well try the @DJ now|pg||
nt|lml: now|pg||

nt|gowdy: whew  after the H pitch:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Compton: "sorry partner ... could have bid 2NT" Bramley:" make 3"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Howie: "at matchpoints I might have done differently"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Assuming that Nickell and Weinstein win, Nickell will play Fleisher and Diamond will play Weinstein tomorrow|pg||
nt|lml: now here is a chance for Weinstein|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is a very decent game|pg||
nt|me argent: as is 4@Ss|pg||
nt|lml: nothing wrong with that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|niclecuyer: good :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guided by an unseen hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus sort of wanted to let him but Wold had already followed to the club :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: but not so easy to bid|pg||
nt|lml: everybody loves opening notrump with singletons|pg||
nt|lml: the 1NT bid will help|pg||
nt|lml: I think they will definitely get to game now|pg||
nt|lml: in fact south might just transfer to the spade game|pg||
nt|me argent: the OR  auction was reasonable albeit very unsuccessfull:(|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!ss|nt|niclecuyer: sort of like the Victor Mollo stories...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North's values dont look good after 2NT|pg||
nt|passell: good assumptions|pg||
nt|marinesa: thanks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cherilou: absolutely no excitement on that last one so 3 to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry! The hotel's internet has been very shaky, so we've been using our Sprint instead and before this quarter I checked every computer except mine to make sure they were on ours ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: and not the hotel, but ....|pg||
nt|jimkrek: where is secretary bird when you need him?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: interesting situation for Jacobus here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Hampson uses New Math|pg||
nt|me argent: 1nt does make for an easy NS auction to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: it's OK really was not an exciting hand at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris wrote about his DBL: "if you raise we play responsive X. We've discussed that DBL of an artificial raise is takeout of real suit, but not in this exact auction|pg||
nt|passell: feeling his oats by now|pg||
nt|lml: yes just bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: for those of you who Mollo fans who may be unaware of it, the excellent father-son writing team Philip & Robert King have done at least two books wherein they continue the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: adventrues of the Griffins, very faithful to Mollo's own style|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: surprised there was no more bidding from EW|pg||
nt|lml: North will be happy when he sees the dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Platnick asks whether 4@s is slammish and Sher says no.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 4@d would have been SA Texas and slammish|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest:  1@d = hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: or maybe like college days against me  -- system designed to keep Compton on opening leead|pg||
nt|joest:  3@h = transfer to spade showing spade values and diamond worries|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "Thank you; I guess you were hoping for double"|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lml: well this hand should go quick I would think|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: I was almost double dummy   awful|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Weinstein: "do you lead 4th best from 4 small?" Kolesnik "second"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Presumably didn't want to lead the 4 because it was so low|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzfb: He really did claim at trick 1 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Although at first he wanted to claim making 4, but they said only 3|pg||
nt|cherilou: Bates does not have the hand Mohan wanted to see|pg||
nt|jimkrek: yes-they can just about make 6ds|pg||
nt|curtis: surprised e gave up so easily. may be good result for n-s|pg||
nt|jimkrek: seems like Diamond had a X of 3s-especially with theur limited system|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is better for E to raise diamonds, even facing 2+. when partner does have a diamond suit he needs to know about the support, esp at these colors. besides partner's NAME ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is Diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold asked Diamond to show him his hand and claimed -2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Curtis:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cherilou: John, if you doubled 3@D would it be @D's or a responsive X?|pg||
nt|gowdy: some would have Xed with the E hand after 1 H  this kept them low  and well done|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gowdy: may guess @C now :)|pg||
nt|marinesa: yes, many but with 1d precision not as clear cut as std auctiion|pg||

nt|stewball: the real score is 193-176|pg||
nt|cherilou: they must be--the lead is down to 11 and not many imps here the last 2 hands|pg||
nt|stewball: 11 plus the ringtone|pg||
nt|cherilou: ahhh yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better to try that ploy in a close slam|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 1NT seems a little pessimictic on 5 diamonds and a decent 10 count, maybe their way to show a limit raise in diamonds was not attractive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 boards left for the day -- 4 more sets of 15 boards tomorrow in the Round of 8|pg||
nt|lml: and the lead changes again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sher asks Platnick: "hearts were 4-1, I assume?" Platnick shakes his head|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: So the reason Sher pitched the club wasn't to make an extra ovetrick, but because he was afraid of a heart ruff and wanted to cut the opponent's communications|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Compton's turn for 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: ive never been a fan of weak 2 bids with 7 card suits|pg||
nt|cherilou: Mohan taking the low road with his 3@S preempt|pg||
nt|jimkrek: perhaps all the energy he put into last hand had him a little off-sometimes such a relief to make a tough hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|peachy: S had a choice to Dbl or overcall spades, I like the Dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently E felt that way, but i think the diamond raise is right|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stewball: ugh|pg||
nt|cherilou: many ughs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Mohan wrote "undiscussed BUT must show a good preempt|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I should try that the next time I look for the club Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Bates wrote "good 3@s bid"|pg||
nt|joest:  spade lead does the trick|pg||
mb|3D|nt|stewball: i expect this will be 50 more than the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so Nick, you always bid a bit more aggressivley when you have that card?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL =  a) 1-suit @C/@D  b) @H & @S  c) some strong hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: do you methods incorporate a queen-ask, just for clubs regardless of what the trump suit will be?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no more conservatively - usually cannot find it...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even in your own hand?|pg||
nt|lml: I would have gone quietly with the east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Director just came into the room and Diamond asked if there was a time problem. Director: "no, just that you're the last table for me to hover over"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|niclecuyer: well then I can manage|pg||
nt|lml: I think North has been conservative most of the time and this deal is no exception|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: difficult hand for NS - bound to go down in whatever they attemps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on low club lead i think must put up jack|pg||
nt|bobh1: N opened this hand with lofty aspirations but partner put a damper on them|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|passell: another lucky 3nt  needs qx of clubs and dia|pg||
pc|c7|nt|passell: might run dia j here|pg||
nt|passell: think he will play clubs first|pg||
nt|passell: not many dull hands in this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 5@C tricks, doesn't can afford @DK then finesse -- if not 5@C -- doesn't matter, not enough tricks|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|passell: he might get fancy in clubs and lead the J play for 10 x  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: however ----   if stiff Queen is @C, then 3@C|pg||
nt|passell: or stiff 8  very tough play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now DOES need 5@D |pg||
nt|passell: yes  very complicate as he knows greco has majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: greco could hold singleton @CT and @DQ|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do you guys do this AT THE TABLE|pg||
nt|passell: or sing 8 and dia Q|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: declarer should have no trouble making two, and might make more|pg||

nt|marinesa: he's home now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: He was home after the opening lead, wasn't he?|pg||
nt|lml: but north south should get a plus and then only a tiny loss|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|stewball: i suppose its impossible to bid 2@s p/c with that S hand but one can dream|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stewball: drifting off a couple|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stewball: or is it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think if he puts up jack and takes D hook and runs 2 hearts and 4 diamonds and club exit he would make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobs Team karma sucks today|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Compton - I thought they'd go the other way at the other table, and the two lines looked about equal, so I thought I'd try for the swing|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: In this room, they still don't know the score and think these last boards are important|pg||
nt|me argent: but i wouldnt make a TOX with wests hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: I confess I would have bid hearts now on diamond's hand|pg||
nt|lml: it isnt even clear the double is takeout|pg||
