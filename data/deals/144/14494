mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kit: If 2@H follow is invite, perfect, but most play it is weak|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|kit: on this hand, notrump is potentially in a lot of jeopardy, although it comes out very lucky|pg||

nt|pbundy: nick also may sweat a while here trying to decide how to guess - while he cannot go wrong|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: some would open 2@D (or maybe even 3@D) on East hand - not Nickell's style.|pg||
mb|2H|an|might be a 3-card raise with 4 spades|mb|p|nt|pbundy: truly awful spots|pg||
mb|2S|an|natural, guarantees 4 card suit|mb|p|nt|pbundy: hmm; this could possibly get n/s to game|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: will certainly get them to game.  The 2@S call was optimistic|pg||
nt|kit: But very unlucky they chose the suit which splits well -- now a heart ruff defeats this|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: Of course Nickell has to lead his singleton, but he does|pg||

nt|pbundy: oops no; sorry|pg||
nt|kit: I think South didn't have to jump to 4@S -- why not 3@S and keep both suits in picture?|pg||
nt|harmon: :)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfk: Only in this last set has the margin been over 20 IMPs... an exciting match for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to USBF and Jan Martel  who orgaizes the operators , we know she works hard on this |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: for sure :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|barnets: the hand zia misguessed 4@S they stopped in partial so was 5 imps away|pg||

mc|13|nt|vugraphzfk: don't think so|pg||
nt|gavin:  not me|pg||
nt|gavin:  with only 5@S, you ahve a lot of 5 level jeopardy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks guys, we'll be back in about 15-20 minutes|pg||
nt|barnets: i prefer 2@C by west|pg||
nt|barnets: over 1@S|pg||
nt|gavin:  yes i prefer 2@C too, but definitely could have considered doubling 1@C to show a big hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Adam, Barnets, Gavin, specs!|pg||
nt|barnets: tks all|pg||
nt|barnets: so c|pg||

mb|1C|nt|pbundy: both e/w in the other room might have chosen differently to get to the slam|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3H|an|Last Train|nt|kit: Here West started with takeout double, so East can expect spade support.|pg||
nt|kit: But East may think West just has strong 1-suiter.  He has a problem, as the best trump suit hasn't been determined.|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see why West has to gobble up valuable space by jumping.  surely 2@H must be forcing.|pg||
nt|pbundy: if he had a 6 card suit i could see it.  after the cue bid, not sure why he did this with only 5.|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course - i don't presume to second guess ralph katz, either!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|kit: I think Nickell is planning on bidding diamonds, then spades, then maybe 5NT pick a slam or something like that|pg||
nt|pbundy: lots of kibs mentioning that it would seem the odds great to get to SOME small slam at least|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - they all make|pg||
nt|kit: So they will probably get to some slam just on momentum|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it seems like 7h is the best contract|pg||
nt|caitlin: will be nice pickup for Nickell|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm not sure what ralph is supposed to bid now, however|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|an|Last Train|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|kit: so Nickell has left his KQxxx of the major on the shelf|pg||
nt|peachy: sry, uanswered that|pg||
nt|pbundy: lots of guessing from everyone as to what their bids actually mean.  of course, we're not sure that they are on the same wavelength here.|pg||
nt|kit: Note, btw, that South did open the light 1@C.  Had he passed, E-W would have had an easier auction.  Opponents don't bid as well when they don't get to open.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|an|Pick a slam|nt|kit: This will probably get them to 6@D -- not the greatest, but it does make|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: ok|pg||
