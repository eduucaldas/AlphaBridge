nt|migry: this may be a small swing to welland if they get too high in the other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team was originally seeded 20th out of 23 entering teams, a remarkable feat to be 15 boards away from the semis|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Gitelman-Moss playing their version of 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will compton upgrade to 1@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: Welcome Cherilou everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "guess I could have saved a trick or 2 with a better opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Cheri|pg||
nt|stewball: there are differing views as to how to go about this S hand when pard opens 1nt|pg||
nt|stewball: hi Cheri|pg||
nt|cherilou: Hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gets my vote too     16+ HCP unbal [or compensating playing strength]  or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|joest:  a hand that east-west will almost certainly bid to slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Raija - never would have occurred to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax:  Sometimes one can also catch a defender off-guard covering the Jack in the N seat with H10x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 12+ HCP, 5+@C   they have immediate bid for 4441 but not 5440|pg||
mb|2D!|an|transfer|nt|stewball: mine is that I dont go looking for a major without a legit invite in NT|pg||
nt|stewball: Bates agrees it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cherilou: I think it's really borderline VUL|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|peachy: vul, and with tricks, S prob raises|pg||
nt|peachy: ordinarily, 2NT in competition not to play but this is obviously an exception such rule (if they have it)\|pg||
nt|joest:  many play this as forcing to six and a choice of slams|pg||
nt|joest:  also leaves room for west to introduce a five card suit of his own and suggest a 5-3 slam (here in diamonds for example)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: really really very:)|pg||
nt|stewball: i HATE down 1 in 2nt|pg||
nt|mildredb: assuming @C lead will only make if Beatty guesses @D situation which will probably require x-ray vision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the rest of this auction will be natural|pg||
nt|poohbear: Its very easy to overbid good hands and underbid bad ones when playing strong @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman-Moss didn't even sniff for slam  1@H-1@S;3@H-4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this would be easy slam to reach playing relays|pg||
nt|poohbear: quite a raise with a @h void. Though could well be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: no running now, Mr, jacobs|pg||
nt|mildredb: what a dbl!  |pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: Platnick is thinking, pull, pull, pull :)|pg||
nt|marinesa: 5-3-3-2 pick a slam most common|pg||
nt|joest:  hi marinesa|pg||
nt|marinesa: hi jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Apparently Kolesnik thought 5NT was choice of slams, but Etter thought it was GSF and didn't know what to respond|pg||
nt|joest:  usually there are ways to set hearts trump short of 5NT :)|pg||
nt|joest:  this use of 5NT is very practical|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: He's made the right choice anyway, although on this hand it doesn't make any difference since with hearts splitting, there are 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  And here old fashioned me would have thought it was a grand slam invitation!|pg||
nt|joest:  yes henry that is old fashioned :)|pg||
nt|joest:  I think the direct 5NT still has that meaning but that's about it|pg||
nt|marinesa: 6 of a suit by etter should be a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|joest:  everyone has less for their calls these days than they used to|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: So between the two players and the three of us we have 3 different ideas of what it means - I'm with Alex and Jack that it's choice of slams|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|Jacki: Welcome our Commentators, Bob Heitzman and Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|bobh1: hey marshall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Etter: "got anything?"|pg||
nt|marinesa: totally agree pick a slam, but 5-3-3-2 specifically|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Garner: "pretty good"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: scores thru 3 of 8 sets are now online -- thx Jan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||
nt|poohbear: Compton's pass surprises me. 4@h rates to be a better contract than 3NT and he has slam potential opposite 12 points when partner is marked with some @d cards|pg||
nt|poohbear: never really conveyed the strength of his suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Bramley asking about the lead - it's lower of touching, but would lead the J if interested in the 10 and the Q if interestd in the J (at least I think that's what he said)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cherilou: with favorable @S Mohan will make 1NT|pg||
nt|mildredb: Greco in the other room did infact play AK of @D - what a play!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Bob, Marshall|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Here is another chance for a technical play in the @H suit|pg||
nt|marinesa: rixi markus first wrote about the intra finesse|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Without any additional information the best chance for 1loser only is to play N for H10 doubleton|pg||
nt|marinesa: or 10 doubleton|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcmax:  That means declarer would play a low @H away from the A. and if N plays his honor, he next plays the Jack from dummy to pin N's 10|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cherilou: yet, as you can see John will lose 2 imps because they weren't in @S|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 1D here so no knowl;edge where length is|pg||
nt|peachy: if anywhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Each of these teams has two pairs playing souped up Precision and one (Jacobs-Beatty & Gitelman-Moss, who are out this quarter) playing standard|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobh1: hi Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "you play upside down, right?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT might go down|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|stewball: but I would rather play 1nt than 3 @s|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs has put the screen down to ask Diamond something - I couldn't hear what (which is good because that means Platnick couldn't either :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Although he's a lot younger than I am so maybe he could|pg||
nt|patricck: K@D instead of the k@S and 13 tricks would have been easy|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzfb: Probably asking about whether Platnick could have a stiff @d for the 1@d opening, since from the DBL of 3NT he thinks Diamond has the Q|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobh1: looks like -1|pg||
nt|joest:  note the start of the @HQ incase hearts were 5-0 onside|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: @CA lose @HK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cherilou: now only 1|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "should have known Diamond had the diamond"|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer is lucky that the defense cant run @ss|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|d2|nt|mildredb: I doubt he could have singleton @D in this auction & rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mildredb: George has many clever sayings|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: You're right of course - wouldn't rebid 1NT with stiff @d. But he was definitely doing his thinking before playing @d K not after|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: either @S is cashed or overtrick|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Roy definetely saw the double.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobh1: franco is looking at 5-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: so maybe they play the same after a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: or maybe wanted to stress that @d suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|cherilou: but you're down by 46--you need to bid that Vul game|pg||
mb|1C!|an|!cs or balanced|nt|jcmax:  Yes, very true Marinesa, or 10 doubleton. If N plays low declarer would finesse against the 10 and then again in the next round play the Jack from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: If you're talking about taking an intrafinesse, the players were all laughing about "have you ever seen one work at the table" and "it's in a book"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boards WILL be duplicated across both matches in the Semi-Final which begins Thursday|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C shows @C & @D|pg||

nt|poohbear: but not quite|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: yes, makes people feel like they are right there tableside|pg||
nt|marinesa: yes, it's in bols brillancy book the hand by rixi markus|pg||
nt|joest:  doesn't make on best d|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cherilou: any one know what 2@D is?|pg||
nt|stewball: not familiar with this 2@d treatment|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H is cute but beaten on double dummy.... 2 diamonds followed by A@S and Q@S|pg||
nt|marinesa: the tap will beat even that|pg||
nt|joest:  right.  but it is harder to beat than 5@c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stewball: i wonder what 2@h shows|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The truth is they all have seen several working and they all have taken several of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss alerted his Pass of the DBL, Gitelman didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: yes - much more fun :)|pg||
nt|marinesa: and yes i've had it work many times as i'm sure sabine has|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cherilou: hmmm--me either|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: They play transfers after 1M-1NT - I thought that 2@d showed either 4+ hearts or an accept of a NT invite, but Harris only wrote 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N knows that W has at most 3 hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: W certainly has his bid but it wont work out well for him|pg||
nt|bobh1: is 4@s makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 5 spades he would presumably want to play in spades or at least explore for best game, and since he responded 1S....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S goes down|pg||
nt|joest:  well this auction shows a good hand (not this good) with longer clubs and four hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 5 perhaps|pg||
nt|marinesa: but wouldn't 2nt leb still apply by steve theoretically  guess after overcall and cuebid maybe should still be constructive|pg||
nt|joest:  perhaps Howard is contemplating the devious 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 3@c wasn't alerted on either side of the screen; some play that it's stronger than a cue bid of the opponent's suit, but I don't think that applied here or they'd have alerted|pg||
nt|henryb:  btw would you bid 2@c or 2@d with Etter's hand? I would bid 2@d unless I played transfer responses|pg||
mb|4C|nt|peachy: North has shown some mild interest, I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, of course it's Diamond who's been thinking here, not Wold :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|jcmax:  I wonder whether NS here were on the same wavelength as to S's dbl over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Now Jacobus is asking about Moss' pass of the DBl and I'll try to see what G wrote (but he is leaning forward and blocking my view of it, sorry)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  It looks to me as if S intended it as showing @D and N thought it showed values|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H likely would have shown less|pg||
nt|mildredb: Jacobs not even willing to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|mildredb: this should end the auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: right wold had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|marinesa: for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: nobody invited him to the party|pg||
mb|p|nt|mouser:  nice restraint by Howie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Garner: "I've got a Jack ... actually, I've got 2 Jacks"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: yes, should, but maybe the diamond filler should have been shown, he does not have a bad minimum|pg||

nt|mildredb: of course, the slam in on a @D break & finding @H Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Before the screen went up, Jacobs asked Beatty how he had described 3NT and Beatty said "mild slam try" so they were in agreement. |pg||
nt|peachy: thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Then they discussed bids over the Precision 1@d and decided they would play that 2@d and 3@d are natural and with a Michaels hand they just bid 1@s and then bid hearts later|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|cherilou: since Harris knows morgan has @DK needs to return @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems ill-advised. the spades are poor and E has already passed 4C. of course there may be some ambiguity about how many clubs W has shown, but since he clearly has game values ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he ought to have only 4 clubs, and yet E was still willing to play 4C|pg||

nt|jcmax:  Let's say W wins the @D and switches to a @C|pg||
nt|marinesa: best d|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Now declarer can finesse in bothe @S and @H, but because of communication problems he can only get 3 @H tricks|pg||
nt|jcmax:  That means he would end up with 8 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: after 4@h got doubled and went PP, Jacobus started to take the tray away but Wold said "wait" and then "this is a partnership game" :) then bid 4NT|pg||

nt|bobh1: it says i think we're beating it|pg||
nt|bobh1: if his @hs were that good he would have overcalled|pg||
nt|jfeld: If it suggests a @H lead not so unreasonable, sort of a weird version of lead dummy's suit.|pg||
nt|jfeld: He know his partner is almost broke. I'm guessing he meant it as that.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "sorry - 3NT is only down 2, I should have stayed there"|pg||

nt|poohbear: same auction here|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Gazilli|nt|marinesa: double is probably staymen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus and Moss are now debating 4@hx - Jacobus says they had to get the diamond ruff to beat it; Moss disagrees; going back and forth for awhile|pg||
nt|marinesa: did they lead a trump in other room|pg||
nt|joest:  2@c = artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: curious that he ap[ologized for leaving 3N but not for leaving 4C which was his best haven|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and when i say "some"  i mean Bart & company :)|pg||
nt|joest:  2@d = art. 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|marinesa: wow|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c either a good hand or clubs|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|joest:  2@h = a good hand with 3+ hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Both Weinstein & Garner wrote long explanations of 2@c (and 2@d in Garner's case) but neither has handwriting I can read from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: jacobus a touch heavy for 4@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: but no harm no foul in this case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mark lives pressure bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: They're playing strong club so 4@s is very wide-ranging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marc|pg||
mb|2H!|an|3+ hearts|nt|bobh1: unless they play a strong @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: good save NS except for one small problem ::)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his notes actually say 3@C = preempt/mixed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 5+@C 5+@D|pg||
nt|mouser:  Neither has handwriting I could read sitting next to them|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think that 2@c was either natural or some good hand and 2@d asked and now 2@h shows a good hand with long spades, but not certain|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: 10 imps likely|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, they did it|pg||
nt|mildredb: anything Beatty wants to do, works|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs using his time as dummy to study his bidding notes :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: then 4@s is normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense just has to knock out @C before giving up the lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense needs to get @cs going otherwise they might disappear on @ss . But the 7 of @ss is a powerful card|pg||
mb|2N|an|NAT, FG|nt|bobh1: in fact the ability to jump to 4@s with a hand like this is one of the benefits of playing a strong @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: We have 2 strong club pairs here and 2 standard pairs in the other room|pg||
nt|joest:  2NT = natural GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: will E let his pard out?|pg||
nt|stewball: no|pg||
nt|cherilou: Bates finds the right lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 2@c showed diamonds and 2@d showed about 11-12 HCPs and said nothing about diamonds|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure what 2@c accomplished.effectively he bid 3nt over 1@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan puts the screen down to ask what their 1NT range is - Mohan says 14-16|pg||
nt|joest:  3@s = sixth spade|pg||
mb|3S!|an|6+ !ss|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|cherilou: he found out his partner had better than an 8-9 count with good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: nice try by diamond, but declarer's trumps are big enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess Beatty's deciding which hand he wants to be in, and how he's going to play the hand, guarding against bad breaks. He knows a vul game is an important hand so doesn't want ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: to miss anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that will be last time i beat Barry to the analysis of defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: i type too slow :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i type fast but think slow|pg||
nt|poohbear: Doesnt seem like much for Bramley to do except shift to a @c  . Is he pondering a trump shift?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: had a chance to beat it on heart lead-now it sd be over|pg||
nt|poohbear: or deciding that  alow @c is right :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah - just wondering if King or 6|pg||
nt|poohbear: got that one in first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the table, Bart is what some would call  'deliberate'|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hampson is studying this one though :)|pg||
nt|mouser:  Fortunate layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Weinstein explained that he has shown 6+ spades and 3+ hearts and Garner could have asked about a 4th heart but didn't so presumably doesn't have 4 hearts, but other than that ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Garner could have anything|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stewball: N may fall to the @d shift temptation|pg||
nt|marinesa: good decision by steve with howie holding 9 major suit cards|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|stewball: and does|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: We'll have a short break here while the director is called - Mohan had a cell phone which just rang.|pg||
nt|cherilou: when partner leads low card I think you're obliged to return that suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Director took the phone and said he'd be back presumably to tell them how many IMPs it will cost|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: Jan is right, we all can see that any line he chooses will work, but he has to do all the thinking without dbl dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: it is understandable than Platnick does not expect W to have D king, but what is the plan for beating 4S by returning any other suit but Ds?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|joest:  i suspect that the east-west lead conventions have pegged doubleton ace king there|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mildredb: this is a good coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I got some, if I didn't have coffee I'd have no personality whatsoever.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It's a good exercise to figure out what they're thinking, I find. Here, probably Diamond is trying to figure out a lie of the cards where he can beat 4@s or at least give declarer ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: a problem, and that's going to be hard so takes awhile|pg||
nt|poohbear: If Hampson trusts the bidding his plan was to take a winning @s finesse then draw one round of trumps and set up @ss then he would run them thru  North|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|poohbear: If North ruffed in he could draw the last trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: and dummy would be high|pg||
nt|joest:  so garner afraid of going down at once|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|poohbear: the losing @s finesse was not in the plan :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mildredb: this is like watching grass grow ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: And Beatty still trying to figure out who might have all the spades and what, if anything, he can do about it.|pg||
nt|peachy: Diamond was on the right track, it was possible partner had short diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|joest:  Weinstein sorry|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mildredb: should go quickly from here - @H |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: we will see this variation for down 1|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Good switch since Weinstein would have taken the diamond finesse for his contract if he found out about the spade loser before diamonds were played|pg||
nt|marinesa: technically ruffing d then pulling trumps is a little better|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h4|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|marinesa: and would have worked here|pg||
nt|mouser:  He will make it now|pg||
nt|joest:  yes a diamond ruff to hand would have made it but he still has a red sut squeeze|pg||
nt|marinesa: yeah will still survive|pg||
nt|marinesa: which howie will find|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Before the set, I commented to Roy Welland that I'd be a better Vugraph operator with a little champagne in me, and he gave me an entire (half) bottle, so if my typing ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: deteriorates, you can blame Roy --- it's delicious, by the way :)|pg||
nt|joest:  his wine always is from what I understand|pg||
nt|marinesa: send my glass over jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: true|pg||
nt|joest:  Howard can play a trump here pitching dummy's clubs and then the squeeze operates|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: or not :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marinesa: well defended|pg||
nt|joest:  in the other room, playing for a swing, welland and willenken have doubled off north south in 3NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: let's not get greedy|pg||
nt|joest:  that might have been prompted by the trump lead against 5@c on the prior hand but can't say for sure|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfb: Until the diamond return|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Interestingly at the other table the contract also was 2@C doubled. That's not exactly where one would expect the deal to be played looking at all 4 hands...|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfb: Weinstein: "I should probably ruff a diamond at trick 2, but if that worked the squeeze probably would too"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: In Precision, N can open 1S. In standard style, not everyone does|pg||
nt|marinesa: particularly since both pairs opened a club with 4 diamonds and 3 clubs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stewball: only if they play attitude leads,,surely a @d shift could have been right|pg||
nt|stewball: the problem was the 1@d opener perhaps|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mildredb: some might open 2@S in std, but perhaps he doesn't think the suit is good enuf or just not his style|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I was taught long ago that there isn't any space between 1 and 2 - if the hand isn't a 1@s bid, it's a 2@s bid, but some people have rules about suit quality so that doesn't apply|pg||
nt|ahollan1: (10)11-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: No I think other room opened a Precision diamond and then East bid 2@c to show both minors maybe?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Wold: "maybe too much"|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3D|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he appears to have made a good dec unless Marc made an inspired heart play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus asks about the lead - Platnick puts the screen down to whisper something, probably that it is usually 4th but might be different in partner's bid suit|pg||
nt|marinesa: i see |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: GItelman-Moss are the only "natural" pair playing now - other 3 are strong club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: First seat also can take liberties that would not be wise in second seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Of course that line is in a different place at different vuls and seats - I suspect Mildred & I would agree that at this vul in second seat, the N hand would clearly be a 2@s bid - ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: in first, it's less clear|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 4@s is fairly descriptive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is NOT 6@D 4@C  other than that unclear about minor dist|pg||
nt|mouser:  Steve might have made a spec x|pg||
nt|marinesa: not true with the heart return if etter held diamond guard since communication now broken so couldn't squeeze either out of the red suits only east|pg||
nt|curtis: been noticing lately that everytime 3nt gets doubled, it's cold|pg||
nt|marinesa: curtis the scores were wrong in the nickell match, right?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: I agree, seond seat vul 2S|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I thought the hand was worth 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Down 75?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only time they'll raise to 2@S with only 3 card support is the troublesome 3=4=5=1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cherilou: no problem with 1NT here--not the kind of boards NS want|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|marinesa: some clubbers play don't there so clubs and a higher|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: with only 70+ boards to play|pg||
nt|poohbear: The other reason to bid 2NT is it now allows partner to show 3 card @s support and avoid NT |pg||
pc|c5|nt|mildredb: looks like -1 & if so, Diamond will jump into lead by 1|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfb: The scores in the Nickell match were correct - everyone was complaining so I went in and looked at Rodwell's convention card and it matched the scoresheet :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcmax:  If declarer here draws trumps and then plays on @H he is bound to lose 3 heart tricks because of the bad breaks|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The natural line of play is trying to ruff some @H in dummy depending on how they break|pg||
nt|marinesa: think he will work out not to play trumps but ace and a heart with bidding and lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: well, slam would be cold if either one held the jack of hearts, and that wouldnt change anbyones bidding|pg||

pc|h8|nt|poohbear: Bart ducks a round in case @hs 6-3 .|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is there ANY way for him to guess @C?|pg||
nt|poohbear: hand records or peeking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or - anti-percentage play for a swing|pg||

nt|mildredb: Nickell 7, Harris 18 after 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Jan pointed out -- down 75|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcmax:  W cannot really tell whether his partner's @C 5 is a singleton or a doubleton. If it had been a singleton it could have been expensive not to cash another @C|pg||

nt|marinesa: welldone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred opened South 1N -- Wold in 8@H  -- exactly NOT how Jacobs wanted the swing to go|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-20|pg||

mb|p|nt|stewball: was he peeking at it jan?:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|stewball: bad luck for it to go off when you're peeking at it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|cherilou: He is not allowed to have in the room--major penalty--maybe 12 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Of course Mohan wasn't looking at his cell phone, but in order to avoid any issues the rules are very strict|pg||
nt|stewball: N may take a run at this....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: @HA will work |pg||
nt|mildredb: or low|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: judging by the stayman call, it would appear NS favor very sound values for a 1N overcall at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: true - and he gave that the most thought of all his plays :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: marc likes his hand|pg||
nt|reisig: Many uses of X here|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i wonder if the rules in europe are similar|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: In the Vanderbilt, Michael Kami had his cell phone in the playing room and it went off and I think it was 10 IMPs - luckily it was in a match they were winning by a lot|pg||
nt|stewball: anyone know?|pg||
nt|bobh1: its true that Wold should have sound values to overcall 1n red opp a passed hand|pg||
nt|jimkrek: good 7 vul when you can place most of the cards and pard can have up to 18 favors bidding in these situations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: devilish hand to defend, looks good for S|pg||
nt|bobh1: he prob is figuring where there's 8 tricks there should be 9 somehow|pg||
nt|bobh1: better to blast 3n than to invite and have partner accept reluctantly then get doubled|pg||
nt|jimkrek: and Marc AWAYS likes his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss: "all right with that, Marc, already" (leading trumps that is)|pg||
nt|marinesa: but he really has none of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Bates: "if you'd just made a try there...." general laughter|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: at mps he would probably not bid it this way|pg||
nt|joest:  better than 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Weinstein: "does this show extra values?" Kolesnik: "I think it shows some extra, not clear"|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mildredb: oops |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|mildredb: if going to lead @S, why overtake?|pg||
nt|peachy: both sides raised with a doiubleton in this hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|reisig: @d seems easy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: the defense benefits a bit from the fact that W led the heart deuce, so E knows no doubleton. but declarer is going to get very lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was busy inviting Steve Beatty to join us - the diamond was played promptly|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bobh1: or maybe if he had a different partner he might not bid it this way|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jimkrek: d back wd have made him sweat, but lucky club position wd always see him home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes. the heart does not look right to me. unlikely that S has a doubleton as with a good 3244 or whatever S would have doubled|pg||
nt|reisig: I was sure of the speed :)|pg||

nt|reisig: Hi Steve :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: this is a disgusting result for EW but their teammates in the other room might well do the same thing|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|poohbear: looks like 9 now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: predict low club exit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would squeeze W if 45 in pointeds|pg||
nt|bobh1: woops guess not|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 1NT opener not as solid as 1NT overcall vul vs not|pg||
nt|bobh1: different situation when 1n is an opening bid and not an overcall|pg||

nt|poohbear: partner had extras . 9 of @s and a third @h :)|pg||

nt|bobh1: yes his mood suddenly changed from the previous hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i approve totally of the opener. as for pass of 3H, the kings are well placed but it is still 8 LTC and spade finesse (maybe H finesse too, if any) rate to lose|pg||

nt|peachy: 13-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Interesting that Bramley, playing pretty much the same methods as platnick, chose to open 1@d on the East hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: the previous bd could be dangerous as eddie promoted a 14-count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but EW make 600 in 3N|pg||
nt|bobh1: u should try not to do that when your pd has a yarborough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they could easily win 5 IMPs for -400|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think that they play 14-16 NT (at least they told me they played the same as Greco-Hampson and they play 14-16. But Gitelman-Moss probably play 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Bramley to Hampson: "how were the clubs?|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: 14-17\|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  facing two heart bids...interesting|pg||
nt|marinesa: was 2nt transfer to clubs|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: they can make 3n--but they will probably not bid it|pg||
nt|poohbear: certainly a consideration given how light everyone opens and lack of a good way to describe this hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stewball: 1n-3n is for old folks like me|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "I only have 16 points" :)|pg||
nt|gowdy: hey   :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold asked Jacobus: "what was your 2NT bid" and Jacobus said "clubs" |pg||
nt|marinesa: since he has clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold said that was what he had told Moss, but wasn't sure.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|bobh1: and i guess dont is a good thing to be playing when you have this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but that partner is Marc Jacobus, and if he passed at favorable your chances of a good catch go down somewhat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=weak @C  or FG 2-suiter|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "3NT hasn't been faring well at this table" Morgan: "so you went low with 12, eh?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile you could go plus in hundreds by staying quiet. alternatively, your bid might tell them how to play a close game|pg||

mb|4H|nt|stewball: looks like a breather|pg||

mb|p|nt|marinesa: you type faster than me jan|pg||
nt|joest:  will Etter take a vul vs not overcall seriously? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jimkrek: looks like 2nt was system on -which is usually ds|pg||

nt|ahollan1: without DBL  3@C forced    not sure if DBL changes anything|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mildredb: now we see a different approach to wk 2s|pg||
nt|mildredb: J6th in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|peachy: diamond would not be a good lead here...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Perhaps these boards are a little difficult, because I see that the other room isn't ahead|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|marinesa: he he|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I think it is an overcall I would neglect to make too, and yes i can see that EW have 10 tricks in hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because the aceless E hand is likely to be better for suit play|pg||
nt|jimkrek: something to be said for Marc bidding 3hearts over 2nt as pass or ccorrect |pg||
nt|marlowepi: obviously that could get you too high though|pg||
nt|bobh1: on the -400 hand N with his yarborough bid stayman and went for only -300|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like this will be a good hand for Smith|pg||
nt|bobh1: i didnt even know smith was playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Compton didn't alert 3@c, but did write that 2NT forced 3@c|pg||
nt|joest:  amazing.   the one hand where trying to hit a home run would have worked and welland and willenken never bid :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|joest:  sometimes that happens when you are shell shocked from prior restults|pg||
nt|joest:  !results|pg||
pc|s3|nt|passell: awful contract but cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hampson: "from Texas, this one?" Guess they don't play 2@c-2NT the same :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzfb: DIamond: "might be cold on that lead" Jacobs then laughingly ground the diamond 3 into the table and Platnick said "standard signals?"|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jimkrek: well-now they can take a bunch of tricks-or it might make if they dont play a spade bk|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: though i guess the run of Ds will mangle S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you have to bid some awful games/slams  because so many good ones go down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow great lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not much choice now|pg||
nt|jimkrek: seems like with all those ds he is force to cash spade ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he i sthinking about low spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but N cant have another card|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he wd only need 3 spades to beat it anyway so it wd always be wrong to play a low spade back|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this hand if 2n was @ds then 3@s was probably shortness|pg||
nt|jimkrek: yes-was alerted as such|pg||
nt|bobh1: should E be so eager to play 3n with only Kx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold picked up his cards, which had been on the table, but then put them back down and thinking some more.|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he was hoping pard had 2 aces and he cd scramble 9 with 5ds in jeapardy|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess its as good a guess as anything|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 1n bid was 13-16 someone has told me|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Compton "take your A of clubs, partner" (as he cashed it (laughter)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|passell: when Compton wins the ace of hearts he has to lead one back to have any chance here|pg||
nt|poohbear: cant see Hampson misguessing that 1:)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobh1: so E had extra "junk"|pg||

pc|h6|nt|cherilou: NS are working hard to build a picture|pg||

nt|marlowepi: we have seen a disproportionate number of aceless opening bids in this set|pg||
nt|jimkrek: great lead to get maximum punishment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes on club lead mustpitch right to beat it at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus tried to find out who had the club A but no one said and so then he claimed -3 and everyone agreed and Wold just figured out it was really 4, so changed the result and when ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I get a chance I'll go get the bidding & play back in since it was interesting|pg||
mb|p!|an|<3 !ss|nt|stewball: non vul is not the same as invul|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris alerted Morgan's pass of 2@s but I don't know why|pg||
nt|mildredb: Harris still leads Nickell by 5, but has a huge board coming when Meckwell dbld Chorush/Koneru in 3@H making +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H nat FG|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously if Bramley PASS   1@C-1@H = 8-11 HCP saying NOTHING about @H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stewball: this 800 off the top|pg||
nt|jimkrek: agree...if you bid 3 s and partner passes it cant be bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: yes--he has only 4 tricks if they X|pg||
nt|cherilou: if they X and sit z:)|pg||
nt|stewball: but E has no spots so he might pull|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris to Bates: "we play pass-dbl inversion. He either has a penalty X or a strong hand|pg||
nt|cherilou: I agree-so what's taking so long?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Apparently they're on different wavelengths here|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes, being able to shrug off a horrible result is best |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: This delay is because Beatty was in the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Bramley: "this might not be right"|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: good lead  but dia 3-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Etter: "what'd I show, 4 card support?" Kolesnik: "8 card, I'm counting on 8"|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond asked me to tell you :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that really seems like a lot to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess N didnt think he was worth a slam try|pg||
nt|passell: 4hearts much safer|pg||
nt|poohbear: what do  you think of the pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Meant Hampson on the comment, of course - sorry!|pg||
nt|poohbear: again we see a pass of 3NT before the hand had a chance to express how good their @hs are|pg||
nt|poohbear: Greco thinking of Ducking the @c here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Greco definitely thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3-2 @ds he just claims|pg||
nt|poohbear: ducking the @c is right when @cs 6-2 and the dbltn has the 4@ds but he cant know they arent 5-3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: this is also a bit hard to swallow|pg||
nt|jimkrek: ah-different auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus asked if there was any explanation on the other side and Wold said "3@s was natural"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: different but equally suspect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I missed the auction when I was changing the result and when Wold told me I didn't hear right|pg||
nt|poohbear: That was his 8th trick|pg||
nt|poohbear: he had goos play for a 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Greco asked Compton "2@s is normal?" before ducking|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stewball: cant say I blame him|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cherilou: So it's back to the normal score |pg||
nt|stewball: if W is short they dont rate to make a profit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Gitelman's delayed 2@s bid bought the contract, where Bramley's immediate one didn't - we'll see whether that's good or bad|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfb: Wold was a passed hand, playing Precision|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like this lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan asks "Did you think we had any agreements here?" Harris: "yes, I thought we played Pass-DBL inversion here, so pass was either a penalty DBL or strong, but the 2NT follow up ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: doesn't fit with that so don't draw and inferences"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus-Wold in 4@S already -- and auction isn't over|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: numerous ways it can gain|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would hope not Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wold treated his hand as  12+ HCP with 5+@H   maybe Hampson would have done that too instead of nebulous 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss-Gitelman never in the auction so Jacobus HAS shown @D length|pg||
nt|poohbear: in other matches Nickell leads Harris by 4 . Fleisher pummelling Robinson by 75ish and Weinstein over Welland by 22|pg||
nt|passell: 6 dia cold|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond and Jacobs both went "hmmm" when Beatty showed out of clubs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss: "he can be 5-4 either way?" Wold: "yes"|pg||

nt|cherilou: 4 boards to go and a 20 imp difference--maybe some excitement lies ahead|pg||
nt|stewball: or do they search |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus and Wold discussing that they play transfers on this auction by UPH but not by PH but Wold wasn't certain so 3@s was a "safety bid"|pg||

nt|patricck: OK, that's the end of that I guess. I have to go now anyway, but it doesn't look as though I will miss a great fightback. Thanks everyone|pg||

mb|p|nt|passell: some early swing here|pg||

nt|poohbear: would at least try to have a bigger @c spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hampson: "what are your spot leads?" Bramley: "3rd and low"|pg||
nt|marinesa: we've all been there where we're stuck a little and things start off badly and the more we push the worse it gets, and these seasoned guys have been there before, you're right jack ...|pg||
nt|marinesa: they'll be disappointed but not surprised|pg||
nt|joest:  Kolesnik doing something quite normal with 2NT|pg||
nt|marinesa: howie always had lousy writing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|curtis: yes, i suppose disappointed is probably a better description |pg||

nt|poohbear: If I am going to gamble I will gamble all the way :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: partnerships should sort out what RDBL means as opposed to 3H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It was alerted but no-one asked; Diamond sort of pointed at the 2@s card, which is why I think it was a re-transfer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i just meant in general, all of us|pg||
nt|jimkrek: looks like 3nt and 4s can make but you have to double hook spades and in spades need abit of timing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess 3N makes but 4@s doesn't? |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jim plays 4@s better than I do :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do you have to double hook? cnt you just make small trumps?|pg||
nt|bobh1: W would seem to have a pass here so it may be academic|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it looks like a good hand to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i forgot their notrump range is 13-16|pg||
nt|jimkrek: isnt he maxe by their standards-and his aq of heats like the ak?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb:  I still don't know what this auction meant, might have been a choice of games with 5 spades and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi Nic|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is a Q of which game|pg||
nt|joest:  the defense will get off to a fast start here.. and a slow finish|pg||
nt|marinesa: right curtis|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sbeatty:  Declarer can claim at least 11 tricks by leading a low D at trick 2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marinesa: not that they had a lot of pickups really|pg||

nt|marlowepi: better to try that ploy in a close slam|pg||

nt|passell: he might get fancy in clubs and lead the J play for 10 x  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: however ----   if stiff Queen is @C, then 3@C|pg||
nt|passell: or stiff 8  very tough play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now DOES need 5@D |pg||
nt|passell: yes  very complicate as he knows greco has majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: greco could hold singleton @CT and @DQ|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do you guys do this AT THE TABLE|pg||
nt|passell: or sing 8 and dia Q|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: declarer should have no trouble making two, and might make more|pg||

nt|marinesa: he's home now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: He was home after the opening lead, wasn't he?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|stewball: i suppose its impossible to bid 2@s p/c with that S hand but one can dream|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stewball: drifting off a couple|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|stewball: or is it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think if he puts up jack and takes D hook and runs 2 hearts and 4 diamonds and club exit he would make it|pg||

nt|peachy: Last hand now, the show will continue shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: This is the last board of the segment, we'll probably be restarting about 10 minutes after both tables have finished|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s will make without a @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold: "6-5" Jacobus "6-4" Platnick "that's what you get for bidding with that bad hand" Jacobus: "you're right, should have passed it out"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I don't know the auction here, but the contract is 4@sx by S, so I'm|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Compton asks Greco: "you had one diamond and 2 clubs?" Greco nods and Compton: "could have made that"|pg||
nt|marinesa: yes|pg||

nt|joest:  last hand|pg||
nt|joest:  congrats to the Weinstein team|pg||

nt|ahollan1: catchall 2+ 1@D opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hampson: "cold with no finesses" Bramley: "especially with no finesses" Hampson "only with no finesses"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest:  Jan Martel:   thanks for the great job as an operator and even more for taking charge of running the trials|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfb: Thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I have lots of great help!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzfb: Compton - I thought they'd go the other way at the other table, and the two lines looked about equal, so I thought I'd try for the swing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stewball: this hand is not what EW are looking for|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Jan for a wonderful job, multitasking, both operator and organizer of these vugraphs.  |pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you spectators, the reason why we have these vugraphs in the first place. Welcome back soon.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: In this room, they still don't know the score and think these last boards are important|pg||
mb|4N|mb|5C|mb|p!|an|0 or 3 keycards|nt|peachy: 10 minutes, that is...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: If Marc ever passed a board out, everyone else would pass out|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: big decisions by both S and W|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "hope this was right; good luck"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Compton: "when you're hot, you're hot"|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: trump lead needed|pg||
nt|cherilou: hard to find the trump lead|pg||
nt|stewball: very|pg||
nt|stewball: if N started with 3@d a trump lead would be more attractive perhaps|pg||
nt|cherilou: Even with more "not good" results from other room it looks like Harris will win this match. Well done|pg||
nt|passell: anti percentage play since qx in either hand  but certainly not crazy|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus: "Sorry, I got distracted & pulled the wrong card, didn't mean to bid 2@s; not the contract they're playing at the other table, but haven't gone down yet"|pg||
nt|joest:  that's what I thought pass showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Weinstein thinks P should be 0 or 3, DBL 1 or 4; Garner thinks the reverse|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfb: just faking the auction - sorry - was getting the other rooms switched over to an internet connection that will hopefully work|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: yep they're in the Heat described by Zia as "nothing goes right"|pg||
nt|passell: hampson stole the pot responding 1spade  he feels in control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and yet not many imps on the scoreboard for this set -- just what might have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think he knew that Greco had Majors, so he was the only one likely to have a doubleton club|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|peachy: The results will of first segment in all matches will be available herw http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8 |pg||

nt|joest:  interesting heart spots|pg||
nt|joest:  Weinstein could even wind up finessing the five when it's all said and done|pg||
