nt|Vugraphzfj: Good to see beatty and jacobs can have a sense of humor about a mishap, they optimistically predicted they'd win 1 imp for it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: a heart partial E-W|pg||

mb|p|nt|caitlin: you need it, especially when down|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kjadams: problem with negative free bid...  It's not forcing.   He must have wanted to gamble game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: ok NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfj: interesting points, however, the fact he freely bid 5@h suggests he felt he didn't describe his hand accurately in the first place :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: can't imagine it would go 2@h ppp|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dougdscsu: declarer will likely attack @d, he doesnt have the entries to dummy to set up @hs|pg||

nt|caitlin: he has @SA as we may see club switch??|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|anamtebha:  if pard has 1@d the auction isn't dying at 2@h. There would be a raise or competition of some kind i think|pg||
nt|anamtebha:  I think it boils down to the imp score. E/W are trying to pick up imps|pg||
nt|kjadams: when it got to 5D, he could bet on stiff opposite.   only question is where is the rest of stuff...  spades and hearts = good.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: e-w had a misunderstanding it seems:   many play that double of 3rd seat white NT = penalty|pg||
nt|jlrice: i am not sure what they are playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: but will be able to beat this with 5 spades a hearrt and a club|pg||

nt|jlrice: will not be punished for the misunderstanding    could make 2S for 110   but will pick up 100 here  only 10 point difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: if double were conventional for e-w here, then it would show "shape suits"   either clubs and hearts or diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|jlrice: i wouldnt show that diamond suit  though|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: yes, but Hampson concealed the 3 on the first round.    With Bramley being a passed hand, I think Compton should hope for a favorable spade position|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|jlrice: NS has a ggood 5D contract   but EW will be competing in hearts|pg||
mb|2C|an|diamonds (either suit or lead + fit)|mb|4H|nt|jlrice: hampson/greco using transffer advvances and compton just blasts the 4H;  all seem normal|pg||
nt|jlrice: question is whether NS will do anything over 4H|pg||
nt|jlrice: diamond won 14 imps last hand when Jacobs took a 5C sac that did not do well|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: it is Greco still thinking|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  i would assume    he has a tough choice|pg||
nt|jlrice: and even if he bids   still not clear what to bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: i was not expecting 4S  |pg||
nt|jlrice: maybe he thinks that 2C is drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: no Greco explained same as Hampson|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: and compton lets them out of the 4S contract    |pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlrice: this will probably make|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: action hand here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Special thanks to our wonderful commentator Douglas Dey|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: thanks matt, you've been great|pg||
mb|2D|an|weak 2 bid|mb|3D|an|Majors|nt|dougdscsu: jacobs not shy about preempting again after the last board :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kjadams: He passes few 11 counts!|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 5@d from beatty now? or will he be thunderstruck from the last board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|anamtebha:  just in time for the last bd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :) yea the final contract was two hearts by south, just made|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: well he has a great hand for a @d preempt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the  pre-emption has had the "intended" effect this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|dougdscsu: well beatty was bidding 5@d to make this time|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|anamtebha:  sound 3n coming|pg||

pc|s6|nt|anamtebha:  10 with the Qx tight|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3s is eastern q|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kjadams: transfers the NT..|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|h4|nt|anamtebha:  lets see if he comes up with the @c lead|pg||
nt|anamtebha:  or shift|pg||
nt|kjadams: often right to put overcaller on lead and to protect partners short honors.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Thanks for tuning in everyone, and special thanks to our wonderful commentators John Adams and Anam Tebha|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the final segment of the day should resume in about 15 minutes following the completion of this round|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kjadams: club shift hard to find with west as dummy.   easier if east dummy.  |pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|d5|nt|anamtebha:  its not that much harder. he cant shift to a @H holding T 4th|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: can play a @c up now to reduce the damage to -2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|anamtebha:  its actually easier imo. He sees KJ9x. if E were dummy he'd see Axx he could still hope for a tenace with partner|pg||
