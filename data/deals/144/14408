nt|bobh1: we're down to the last segment of a pretty exciting match|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Welcome back everyone, should be quite a show, last segment the players had severe time issues, hopefully not so this segment|pg||
nt|bobh1: jon opens 1n with a 6-card minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results with 15 boards to play posted at  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|bobh1: seems normal to me but some avoid this|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i'll assume this is a penalty double|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i think that is michael's preferred treatment|pg||
nt|bobh1: probably they would redouble with some kind of 1-suiter|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: S has to bid with 55|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say DBL created force through 2@H|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h looks good|pg||
nt|kareno: I often open 1nt with six-card minor but I would have a weaker suit and more in the doubletons.  And hi all from Las Vegas :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: maybe not with best defense|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|mc|10|nt|kareno: Three rounds of hearts would work here for the defense.|pg||

mc|9|nt|debrose: At first glance I thought this was a bad hand for his theory, as a spade lead looks good|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|henryb:  Note this contract's only virtue is that it makes. It is actually very poor: about 18%|pg||
nt|henryb:  He could have improved his chances by playng a club to dummy and starting hearts from the table, which picks up stiff Ace and AJ doubleton with West|pg||
nt|henryb:  this way lets him pick up AJ doubleton in East|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning everyone|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Good morning debbie thanks for joining us, sorry for the late start|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: after 2 boards, we're only 1 board behind the other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobh1: that's good for us tho because we get to see the results|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|debrose: Good morning Matt.  I'm afraid I can't stay for the whole set|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: dont like this 2@d either|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Since it was a Precision 1@D opening in other room, East was unable to raise|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobh1: would bid 1n|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|kit: South might well have made a takeout double -- I think he should -- none vul, you don't win IMPs defending 2@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: they must be one of the few pairs around that have 2@d available as a simple raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as passed hand -- still need to choose 2@D  [over 1N]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: success hinges on guessing the @d J|pg||
nt|bobh1: also true in 1n|pg||
nt|debrose: Apparently Woolsey doesn't have a theory about what to lead vs. 3@C contracts, so he has to think|pg||
nt|debrose: He could lead either of partner's suits, but declarer has implied heart length/strength|pg||
pc|sA|nt|debrose: He could be considering a trump lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: but if Feldman PASS 2@D - doubt bidding over 1N|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|debrose: Spade !A, partner's suit and the one declarer is likely short in looks normal.  Declarer could have had Kx, but not likely|pg||
nt|debrose: I believe the @S5 is upside down encouragement, so Stewart doesn't need to decide whether or not to waste and honor|pg||
pc|c2|nt|debrose: Now that Woolsey sees dummy he'll stop and think about the hand, not automatically continue spades because partner encouraged|pg||
nt|debrose: He now decides playing trump to stop heart ruffs in dummy is the right idea - an idea I suspect he was considering even before he saw dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|debrose: Stansby wants to be in dummy to take a heart finesse, so wins the @CA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jlrice: but with the good in diamonds and the Jack of hearts onside   will still make this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobh1: but they should compete to 2@h|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|kit: since declarer doesn't have a known entry to dummy, it makes sense to play North for the jack of diamonds, the finesse he can take|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|lml: I just wonder if he really has one vulnerable though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually denies 4@H/@S, sometimes 3@D if not wanting to wrong-side NT|pg||
nt|lml: it wouldnt be my cup of tea|pg||
nt|jlrice: woolsey with a relatively light preempt (5 card Vul)    but given their style is pretty standard for them|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: if 15-17 1NT opening, South really should pass|pg||
nt|bobh1: michael could have passed but i think better to bid 1n|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's not ashamed of his opening bid|pg||
nt|kit: 11 HCP, and very bad ones -- many quacks, no aces, no 10's or 9's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: are not alot of the members of the Robinson team well known for their super agressive pre-empting style?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: its not just that it is 5 cards, he has a flattish hand and nothing on the side|pg||
nt|jlrice: this pair  is super aggressive preempting    not so much the otherr pairs i think|pg||
nt|lml: a club switch would be good here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: nice controlled stop|pg||
nt|kit: Good judgment by Feldman, and should pick up 5 IMPs -- declarer will set up a heart trick for  7|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe you should pass but red at imps would anyone actually do that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as mentioned last set -- i've never liked NF 2N jump|pg||
nt|bobh1: pass 1n opening by pd with the S hand|pg||
nt|kit: Nothing wrong with the NF 2NT bid, but this hand just isn't worth it|pg||
nt|lml: that was easy!|pg||
nt|jlrice: they preempt almost every 5 card major  NV and most reasonable ones Vul|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: played from the other side in Closed Room  -  Sonty led @DJ|pg||
nt|lml: the defense wants to remove the entry to East's hand for the spades|pg||
nt|lml: well this can easily go 2 down into not much the other way|pg||
nt|lml: and they missed the better spade spot|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: this game seems to have no play|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: After Stayman and 2@S response, East bid 4@S.  Not necessary -- if partner, who can also see the vulnerability, doesn't accept an invite you don't want to be in game.|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps red tho...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: yea, i switched networks :p|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|lml: it looks like N-S will end in the spade game|pg||
nt|jlrice: NS will likely get to 4S    and EW will have to find the diamond ruff off the top to set|pg||
nt|lml: the double of hearts will make that impossible|pg||
nt|jlrice: not likely to happen    especially if South is playing the hand|pg||
nt|lml: it wasn't likely in the first place|pg||
mb|3S|an|Super Accept, but not strongest|mb|p|nt|kit: that's just it -- partner will accept on any excuse -- so if he doesn't .......|pg||
nt|kit: much better call here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Kit, does down 20 affect that approach?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: sometimes you have to bid it "in case it makes"|pg||
nt|bobh1: good judgment by jon|pg||
nt|kit: not in the slightest -- you just try to play the best bridge you can|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: now he has to make it|pg||
nt|kit: looks like he should have 4 spades, 3 diamonds, 1 heart, 1 club.  No?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: I dont think I would have doubled for a heart lead.  I just don't know if it is actually the right one.|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes   especially since it isnt even longest suit|pg||
nt|jlrice: and i would be sick if it went XX   pass back to me|pg||
nt|lml: and it could quite easily. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|bobh1: yes this was not their best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Closed Room, Josh Sher led @H|pg||

nt|kit: now he will try to take pitch, but it gets ruffed and he is back in trouble.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like to lead our suits rather than theirs|pg||
nt|kit: I think now he has to overruff, cash ace of spades, cross to heart, and take his discard -- but he isn't going to find that line.|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont see why not|pg||
nt|kit: because sometimes the spade finesse is on|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: In the CR where they did not open the weak 2@H bid they landed in the normal spade spot which was a lot easier|pg||

pc|h8|nt|bobh1: now he's dead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Note that North conceals the jack of clubs -- remember South shifted to queen of clubs|pg||

nt|bobh1: seems odd to me for Feldman to sell out undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: stewart not suprised they chose spades  |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|lml: it looks like he will make 2.  He probably is going to lose 2 diamond, a heart and 2 spades|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlrice: this will not be the easiest contract to play   might have more problems if they pplay 3 rounds of diamonds now|pg||
nt|jlrice: potentially could lose 3 spades|pg||
nt|lml: actually that's okay in a way.  they are always making the @SJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|kit: Yes, Feldman might well have doubled.  They surely aren't making overtricks, and for all he knows they might be down 2 and his side cold for 3@S or even 4@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: he could also have redoubled|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobh1: whatever that means|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|bobh1: maybe it says to partner "help me decide what to do"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what change needed to North hand to open 4@S instead of 3@S?|pg||
nt|kit: you need a real 4-level preempt for 4@S opening (as opposed to other 4-level openings), since you are much more likely to be wearing it.|pg||
nt|kit: In other words, interchange North's majors and I might well open 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh   never thought about 4@S different than other 4s -- thx|pg||
nt|kit: but would not open 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about this hand not vul vs vul?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think if it were @hs rather than @ss you might consider it|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|bobh1: when u open 4@s sometimes they are endplayed into doubling you|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jlrice: now will be able to pitch a diamond on third club and play on hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobh1: when u open 4@h they have somewhere to go|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- or into just selling out|pg||
nt|lml: but you are right the third diamond would have been unpleasant and could have led to 1 down|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|bobh1: so you open up the option of them guessing wrongly|pg||

nt|kit: key to shift to diamond here -- I think he will find it.|pg||
nt|bobh1: no he's not selling out, but doubling is a different issue|pg||
nt|bobh1: that opens up the chance that partner might convert it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: and how bad is that?|pg||
nt|bobh1: depends on how many trumps he plays you for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and what other options?|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can still make if he plays for this exact shape, but he doesn't know where third diamond is.|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi partner opened 1@d so 4@d is an option|pg||
nt|kit: he can simply hope North has QJx of diamonds|pg||

nt|bobh1: the auction told him that|pg||
nt|kit: Well done by declarer, but if Feldman had played king of diamonds, might he not have had Kxx of hearts and Kx of diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky layout for declarer in both round suits|pg||
nt|kit: In which case, the winning line is to just draw trumps|pg||
nt|kit: This is a perfect example of playing the card you are known to hold.  Feldman failed to do so, and it might wind up costing him the match.|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a big board at this point in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S preempt -- after @SA defense was probably doomed  unless @SA @DQJ isn't worth Mixed Raise|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|an|11-13 if bal 2+!D|nt|bobh1: a kibitzer just commented that it shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to finish this match|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lml: I am in winkle heaven.. I called Ray in to show him|pg||
nt|jlrice: woolsey/stewart likely to get to game on this hand which will be tough to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: some people play transfers here to get the strong hand on lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: that would backfire on this hand i think|pg||
nt|kit: double shows spades and diamond tolerance I guess -- don't know how many spades it shows.|pg||
nt|jlrice: i have never heard this winkle term before   but I will take you word for it  :)|pg||
nt|lml: Terrence Reese originally coined it for a special type of squeeze|pg||
nt|lml: /endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: usually when its a major fewer are required|pg||
nt|kit: But if it shows 5, North may be tempted to take 4@S save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that DBL aka: Snapdragon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show's 4th suit + tolerance for partner's suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: yeah N's 1@d was interesting|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@d was an option|pg||
nt|kit: and if N-S take the save, they will pick up some badly needed IMPs|pg||
nt|bobh1: i can see the idea behind bidding only 1|pg||
nt|bobh1: its too late to preempt--both opps have already bid|pg||
nt|kit: Good argument for not bidding 2@D on North's hand is 4-card spade suit -- you don't want to shut out your own ranking suit.  And it may matter here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room Sontag's opening bid was Precision 2@D   11-15 HCP, 3-suit, short @D|pg||
nt|bobh1: and u do have 4 @ss so that suit could be your best vehicle for competing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Rosenberg seems to have decent suits for his preempts -- partially gleaned from failure to open Polish 2@S with @SKTxxx|pg||
nt|bobh1: right kit|pg||
nt|lml: the final position is such that neither play can win the trick|pg||
nt|lml: if East wins the club he is endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: so West has to rise with the @CK|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: got to go see how my team did -- enjoy the finish|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: setting up the club in dummy|pg||
nt|lml: so he either gives declarer the dummy |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: or the free diamond finesse|pg||
nt|lml: back to real life here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|lml: sort of a silly contract when you see all the hands|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: this will win them some imps which is better than a phantom usually does|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobh1: sure 4@h is cold after a @c lead if declarer eschews the @h finesse|pg||
nt|lml: and actually lucky for Robinson|pg||
nt|lml: if the diamond finesse was on they would have made 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: and 3NT was always down on a heart lead|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s9|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: without a spade lead you might make 5@D even when the diamond finesse loses|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d5|nt|bobh1: as many kibs are pointing out, this really isn't a phantom|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h is cold in practice because the best defense will often be found and cold in theory if declarer double dumies it against best defense|pg||
nt|bobh1: the best defense will seldom be found is what i meant to say|pg||
nt|bobh1: and the double dummy line is not that hard to ffind|pg||

nt|lml: yes if he plays for Woolsey to have all the outstanding cards he can make it|pg||
nt|lml: potentially in a 6 card ending Woolsey will have kept say 3 hearts and three clubs|pg||
nt|lml: he can then be put away in clubs|pg||
