mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|gavin:  in this auction a jump to 2NT can be lighter than the typical 18-19 balanced hand it would show if there was no competition|pg||

mb|p|nt|gavin:  levin has shown a better hand with his negative double than a simple 1 level response|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|me argent: i like EW auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Didn't seem like West had that much of a problem, with stiff queen of spades to help there|pg||
nt|barnets: south thinking of lead|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe @HQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: and bidding 2@C by W would deny 4 hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: in case Steve has a stiff K|pg||
nt|me argent: same auction in CR|pg||
nt|barnets: yes @HA also|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: declarer doesn't know where 9 of hearts is, so he likely will duck queen of hearts continuation|pg||

mb|3N|nt|pbundy: as is too often the case, the brilliant michael rosenberg corrects me|pg||
nt|harmon: even with hts lead clubs blocked an time to switch|pg||
nt|pbundy: lack of entries and blocked club suit|pg||
nt|mouser:  Plenty of time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E-W std carding, 4th best from suit with interest in developing, Smith Echo|pg||
nt|pbundy: some sneaky declarers in the audience are recommending that weinstein win the heart KING....  an attempt to throw ralph off the past to success|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|gavin:  wow that was a quick 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: it was, I was a bit suprised too :)|pg||
nt|barnets: what else ?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best description of his hand|pg||
nt|kit: well, he does have a 5-card suit he might bid|pg||
nt|me argent: 1nt was the least inapropriate bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gavin:  if rodwell slowly bid 1NT, levin would be able to narrow down his hand to 'problem hands', his speed takes away any of those inferences|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|gavin:  weinstein rather, his screen mate|pg||
nt|bigtrain: generally speaking roddy doesn't like overcalling in 5-card minor when there's a good alternative|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|kit: I think the combination of the stiff heart and only 1 spade stopper argues against the 1NT overcll|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Levin asking for a @H switch here I'm told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down attitude, std count  Smith vs NT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: smith or reverse smith?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: std Smith  --  unlike meckwell|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - when we have a break, can you explain the logic of  reverse attitude combined with std count?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|me argent: awkward hand for declarer but he is blessed with a gentle @C divison|pg||
nt|kit: simple -- the players aren't used to upside-down count, and find it difficult to adjust|pg||
nt|caitlin: smith and reverse smith http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/carding/smithsignals.html|pg||
nt|kit: it is clear that in theory, if playing upside-down attitude then upside-down count with it is better.|pg||

nt|kit: Weinstein not afraid to get in there despite the weak suit -- can't afford to pass on that strong a hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|gavin:  Redouble in competition is extremely important|pg||
nt|bigtrain: probably a rosencranz XX|pg||
nt|gavin:  to show values|pg||
nt|gavin:  no i doubt it, its probably saying he has a good ahnd|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2+ X i see|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gavin:  when playing against a pair like meckwell, the need to express your strength to your partner in competative auctions is highlighted|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: very good to help competitive decisions|pg||
nt|caitlin: for bidding like upside down count and attitude check www.bridgegys.com  Advantage is you don't play high card to tell pd y like that suit......you reserve those valuable cards and ...|pg||
nt|caitlin: use low card to encourage|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like they will stagger into 3NT -- probably go down, but has chances|pg||
nt|gavin:  yes it seems like their best spot was defending 2@S, but very difficult|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein might try 3@D here -- maybe 5@D comes home|pg||
nt|caitlin: 1@D catch all bid when no 1@C showing big hand or 5 cd major|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D is pretty decent|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|kit: the 1@D opening is basically a weak notrump, but could be on long diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Weinstein said he meant his X was penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Levin thought otherwise|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or 5@C and a 4-card M|pg||
nt|kit: Very important to have clear agreements on what low-level doubles such as this mean|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since meckwell play 2@C = 6+@C more hands have to be included in 1@D|pg||
nt|gavin:  it seems like it is either penalty or atleast a suggestion to penalize, would be a very strange spot to play a completely takeout double|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|me argent: now adays always dangerous to pass low level doubles|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: Levin may regret not having taken his club finesse when he could if Rodwell works out to shift to a heart now.|pg||
nt|me argent: everyone has their own ideas of what they mean|pg||
nt|caitlin: absolutely you X 2@H, it makes, you have doubled them into game|pg||
nt|kit: but still, you can't pass up +500's -- that is just as costly as doubling them into game.|pg||
nt|caitlin: true indeed|pg||
nt|caitlin: judgement is key|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm fond of saying you can't make a living at this game going -500...  i guess the inverse is true  :)|pg||
