nt|bagman: East might bid out his pattern by 3@C but that might be forcing and accepting the invitation|pg||
nt|bagman: He surely wants to bid 3@C nonforcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: They used to have some time limitations; at least when I did play ;)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bagman: East resisted the temptation to bid on|pg||
nt|jbgood: but 3 clubs might also be bid on a 3 carder in this pos, so..|pg||
nt|bagman: Yes, normally 3@C is 5-4-1-3 and values to accept the invitation|pg||
nt|bagman: That second part prevented E from bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can count to 3 clubs and 3 hearts and @DA; one is missing and both @C and @H need establishment|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bagman: He needs to time carefully the play, otherwise defenders might set up 2@D, 2@S, @H and @C|pg||
