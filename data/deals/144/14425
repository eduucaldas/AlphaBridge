nt|dougdscsu: pick ur poison|pg||
nt|gavin:  the most normal way to try to make 6 is just a @H finesse|pg||
nt|gavin:  this slam is very close to 75%|pg||
nt|gavin:  (need 1 of 2 finesses)|pg||
nt|gavin:  a little more business|pg||
nt|gavin:  probably more like 65% because u will need none of your suits to break badly|pg||
nt|gavin:  but the opponents have to make an opening lead, (the a@S could have been on lead, making it that much tougher)|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|algraves: well it is an ongoing debate these days but there are many downsides to not having your bid playing standard|pg||
nt|algraves: and the hidden cost of partner not trusting your response under a lot of pressure|pg||
nt|ritong: our part is supposed to bid his hand, not our|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|vdoubleu: EW can make club game so 4@d looks like a good result|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|vdoubleu: (for Harris)|pg||
nt|gavin:  the free bid by harris will propel their side to game|pg||
nt|gavin:  morgan will not stop below game after hearing his partner choose to bid 2@C|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ritong: meckstroth surprised everybody other room|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: True Henri:)|pg||
nt|ritong: same start, then gas out|pg||
nt|gavin:  they probably have a very specific agreement about that vulnerability and that spot for freebidding|pg||
nt|gavin:  that they can be very light|pg||
nt|gavin:  i would start with XX with morgan's hand|pg||
mb|r|nt|passell: sometime you have to gamble|pg||
nt|gavin:  get across to partner i have a big hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|gavin:  when playing this @C suit, your only chance for a loser is if 1 person holds all 3 @C|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Good job Adam!!(MtV):-)) ---alll day slogging away|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  so you just have to decide who is more likely to have 3 and who 0|pg||
nt|gavin:  and start by playing the correct honor to cater to it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  in this case, south has bid hearts and diamonds|pg||
nt|passell: not possible for Zia to have 3 on the auction|pg||
nt|gavin:  north sounds more like a balanced hands|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfk: thanks V, and everyone else, I'll be covering this match again tomorrow... so will see everyone soon I'm sure|pg||
nt|gavin:  at this point as declarer im quite happy that it was a low @D lead, it means that south at least has A@D, and probably one of the K or Q|pg||
nt|gavin:  because they didnt lead the A or K|pg||
nt|gavin:  so its looking like my finesses are onside|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|passell: very lucky hand not many entries to lead everything|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gavin:  still lots of work to do, the AJ doubleton of spades is what brings it home|pg||
nt|gavin:  ya, would have been easier with 2-1 clubs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|ritong: zia trying his best to muddy the picture|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  another reason for starting with a low club to the king is if its singleton Queen|pg||
nt|ritong: so far so good|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gavin:  you will be able to use two seperate dummy entries to draw trumps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gavin:  south's shape is very well definited now, either 3-5-5-0 or -4-5-4-0|pg||
nt|gavin:  defined|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|gavin:  if spades are 3-3 the easiest thing to do is spade to the T that will make it easy|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|gavin:  the support double puts south with exactly 5@H|pg||
nt|passell: yes that looks like best by far  makes with K of hearts offside|pg||
nt|passell: good play by north with AJ9 of spades to play the J without the king of hearts to give a losing option|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h8|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Marty asking about their NT range|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: he should have a complete count now... |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: he went for @ss 3/3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|passell: heart back makes him guess|pg||
nt|ritong: this is a very respectuous play|pg||
nt|ritong: it says " i think you can play @s J from AJx"|pg||
nt|gavin:  not enough in the deck for him to have opened vul 2nd chair without king of hearts|pg||
nt|passell: he would be up to that play--- it is Mr Hamman|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: big bob|pg||
nt|algraves: Zia is not 5-5 with K 5th of hearts|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He knows only AJ spades, Q clubs, soemthing in diamonds (not A/K, so ergo heart K|pg||
nt|passell: must have heart K to open  not Hampson and Greco|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Right|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  ya hamman vul playing standard 2nd chair, hes not opening some 3-3-4-3 11 count|pg||
nt|algraves: which is what playing spades to be 3-3 would mean rather than finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: he thinks Hamman probaby has the K@D though|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Ok, but so...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: this comes back to Zia's A@D play|pg||
nt|gavin:  ya he thinks hamman is AJx ?xx KJxx Qxx|pg||
nt|gavin:  still only 11, no chance|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That wld be only 10 (or at best) 11 pts|pg||
nt|caitlin: let's just tell Morgan what is obvious so we can all go to sleep|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That is not anything he wlda opened vul--2nd chair|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Marty asking about their opening style, and Zia said only 11 if he "really likes his hand"|pg||
nt|caitlin: Marty|pg||
nt|othered1: would northhave made support double on Ajx xxx KJxx qxx?|pg||
nt|passell: 2nd seat vul no chance Bob opens bal 11|pg||
nt|algraves: that gives Zia XXX, KXXXX, AQXXX, void, I dont see that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yep, I think he'll get this eventually|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Additionally, if Zia had that, he mighta taken a chance & dbled 5@c|pg||
nt|passell: long tough day  they have played great bridge|pg||
