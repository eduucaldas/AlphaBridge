mb|p|nt|kjadams: hate having to lead on these auctions.  that one hurt.|pg||
nt|caitlin: Walter (bigtrain) must be waiting for Nickell team as he is an expert on Meckstroth and Rodwell (Meckwell) bidding|pg||
nt|joest: this has to be a very bad hand|pg||
nt|joest: declarer probably has six hearts|pg||
nt|joest: but passed on the chance to bid a competitive 3@h last round|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mslair: ace of hearts opening lead beats 3n.t  nothing else|pg||

nt|joest: yes ace of hearts does it Mark|pg||
nt|joest: do you think that lead could be reasoned out?|pg||

nt|mslair: I don't think so |pg||

nt|migry: i would think they show pattern there after 3@h but i guess not|pg||
nt|joest: pretty good hand|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein needs more than the king of diamonds.  Maybe more than just another minor suit queen too|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: the auction next door, treating the north hand as a balanced NT did not work well|pg||
nt|mslair: 7-9 w/4  but something I have not seen|pg||
nt|mslair: 2d|pg||
nt|joest: I have seen 2@d as four card drury and 2@c as three|pg||
nt|joest: but these guys play lots of different things|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 2@D was natural -- would be heart support by UPH  , says Willenken|pg||
mb|4S|nt|migry: in spite of the 5-1 split this contract should make |pg||
nt|joest: i wonder if this blackwood or a cue bid|pg||
nt|joest: blackwood could not serve much purpose after partner has shown controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|joest: if Jonathan passes the worst he can do is a push. if he bids on (which I doubt) a push is the best he can accomplish|pg||
nt|joest: true  pointed out to me that just strip the blacks|pg||
nt|joest: 5 is cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: a good slam to get to|pg||

nt|larrymori: 5@h might do it now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club 9|pg||
nt|joest: so the Weinstein team will add some more to their 14-0 start|pg||

nt|larrymori: i like opening good 1nt ranges with a good suit as opposed to a small doubleton elsewhere, to try to help get to game|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: tough to know for sure they're such a new partnership|pg||
nt|joest: hard to see where the 3NT bid would com from|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: most experts play transfer advance in north seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: allowing 2@H to be a constructive spade raise|pg||

nt|joest: the auction could go many different ways here|pg||

mb|1D|nt|joest: not sure if this is 14-16 or an upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: upgrade|pg||
nt|joest: thx joe|pg||
nt|joest: so how would you go about this Mark|pg||
nt|joest: after the transfer that itis|pg||
nt|joest: would you consider 5@d as exclusion roman key card?|pg||
nt|mslair: texas followed by new suit is exclusion for most of the world|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: that would get this over quickly|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs, no matter what their normal responses, revert to 0-3, 1-4 after exclusion|pg||
nt|joest: after 5@d here, East would bid 5@s, one key card, west bids 5NT, east bids 6@c to show the king and voila|pg||
nt|mslair: not underwritten  although only 13 possible high card points... no ace of dia  can't fail to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: so far that is precisely the auction next door|pg||
nt|joest: that's true, asking about the club king may just be torturing partner|pg||
nt|mslair: very interesting to me to see a top pair miss 7 spades|pg||
nt|joest: they bid it next door on exactly the sequence we just discussed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: marginal hand for stayman|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = hearts|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mslair: particularly after 1n.t opening:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: may get a second chance|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d = mixed|pg||
nt|joest: that is a pretty good hand to pass with has west although admittedly what does one do?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: double=one minor or both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 1@d= hearts usually less than a game force which is normal with the south hand as they do open light|pg||
nt|migry: 2@h= normal heart support|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d is doubled for penalties in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: it may be clear tous to preference to 4@s but its hardly clear to west|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfg: wow|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: if I were west and all I did was pref to 4@s and then got whacked I would be disappointed|pg||
nt|joest: maybe he is reconsidering however|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NV but i think sher was worth a raise|pg||
nt|joest: the mark lair approach|pg||
nt|joest: in an expert partnership 4@d might have been a choice of games cue-bid over 4@c so that he did not have to make the nasty guess himself|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime, this has a lot of play|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: although even if Weinstein makes it he is losing a bunch|pg||
nt|joest: well not a bunch but 5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: 7 IMPs for Weinstein on board 64 they got them for 3X 800 versus 500 here|pg||

nt|mslair: can they bid to 6 clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: with this vul, the key for 2@d is really about suit quality|pg||
nt|joest: hands like this often do better when north starts with a forcing club raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: maybe that is not the best matchpoint action but at imps or total points or rubber bridge it has the merit of simplicity|pg||
nt|mslair: not good %  but makes 7 on this layout|pg||
