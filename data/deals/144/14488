nt|bjacobs: well, it's not exactly "full disclosure"|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a volley ball game description |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin really has a serious problem here - if that queen is singleton, which the odds suggest, he needs to cross to dummy to finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: Again, open room reached the same contract after a different auction.   Good efforts to stop at 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think he might indeed take the club finesse now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: @c ruff, draw trumps and run 9@H worked|pg||
nt|athene: with the spades wide open declarer can't get cute|pg||
nt|paulg:  he knows Piper has three or four hearts, and Wilkinson would not double with a singleton|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: West ruffed one of dummy's top hearts (on Board 1). Declarer had only one discard on the 13th heart - for his losing club - and could not afford to ruff the diamond loser with ...|pg||

nt|athene: but hard to know that really from south's point of view|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The Lithuanians let 5@D play on board 2 - likely afraid of pushing NS into a making slam - but 11 more to Italy |pg||
nt|bjacobs: that would be highly unethical, imo|pg||
nt|mbruun: Just kidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Lauria bid and made 3NT on Board 2, where we saw them pick up +120 in 2NT in this room.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NO|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: there are no live results as yet so pls stop asking us|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||
nt|athene: so double is reasonable|pg||
nt|daman: he chose the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels here,  I michaels on everything |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Include me out, as Sam Goldwyn once said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||

nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders took their @DA and declarer broached trumps with low to the queen and king, followed by the overruff.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice one|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S overcalled 2@h and EW played 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I had Adam sign it but he fell asleep|pg||

pc|s2|nt|brgpro: 2NT=GF bal. |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, not surprised with the amount of Mafia Wars he plays on FB|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: harfouche tries to make up for board 5. Sadly, this isnt the layout to do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: Then a @d ruff for 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: Was east's double simply negative or was it specific to @S?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|brgpro: he didnt show his @s at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Cashout for an OT here? @SJxx is fortunate :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Communications a little awkward here|pg||
nt|jtr: But clearing the @ss seems right as you say|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday there was a similar auction where several Italian kibs claimed they don't play Puppet over 2@D openings|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: i think it showed 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This one is not too trivial to play at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know...a hand that has NOTHING outside the @ss.....|pg||
nt|capercliff: what else Hedy? pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt go as a 1@s opening bid in 1st seat vuln for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need a lot to make game, if pd cannot bid over a weak 2 i am not going anywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck 2 @c and down 3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tez: nice lead|pg||
nt|daman: double partscore swing for Serbia on Board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  quite a lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: 4 or 5|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I see|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||
nt|brolucius: Win with the @HA, clear the spades (if there is a loser) and the defenders would then have to play a club to give you any entry problem.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|capercliff: he should have taken time on this one however, it was much better to play on @c's before playing a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: he may even had made it|pg||
nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isner and Mahut now at 61-60|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: So I think the whole hand gets down to the first point - you are going to need @HQ to drop doubleton|pg||
nt|mbruun: Two clublosers as expected|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he does only live about 2 miles from the site now!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  sometimes the opps have their bids|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|iceblue: How do you think about this 3@C? Jack|pg||
nt|atabey: would be a good auction if K of @h was offside with a @d lead|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: nightmare time for EW, for sure, these few boards|pg||
nt|mbruun: Looks like a quick push|pg||
nt|capercliff: not sure even a @c lead would beat it tho?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did hold a singleton heart, in fact, but chose not to cue-bid it because of the general minimum nature of his hand.|pg||

nt|henryb:  I have to leave you for Chicago|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Henry, ty|pg||

nt|capercliff: N is worth at least a curtiousy raise even if 1@s is non-forcing|pg||

nt|hedyg: -2|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: Piper is out for blood now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: of course he was|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not really sure what to say about this auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||

nt|jtr: As i said, in keeping with transfer responses|pg||
nt|athene: this was west's 4@S, i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As a passed hand, I think you are worth 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D also possible, but the spades look good|pg||
nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, they are solid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would 1 @S  but my better suit is @D's here |pg||
nt|mbruun: I just turned 21 yesterday|pg||

nt|athene: this was always likely|pg||

nt|andyv:  E would like to get into this auction but it will be difficult for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, you could argue that both N/S's bid correctly - one after the 1@H opening, the other after the weak 2|pg||

nt|capercliff: well it will be positive for Italy anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: By the way, specs, we have promised David not to comment on England's World Cup result last night. We rarely use the word "howler" during vugraph presentations|pg||

nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is transfer|pg||
nt|bagman: This should have been a quiet push :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Surprised that Bocci pulled it.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: 4@ds and 10ish|pg||
nt|capercliff: it seems Piper is prepared to bid 3N on anything|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT is not an invitational bid, it is a relay ... it says bid game if you have your first bid|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphznk: A kib expert on Italian methods tells me XX is @H worries|pg||
nt|bagman: Does anybody know what XX meant?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's not clear that even the lowly 2@S will make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceblue: interesting PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-1, our team is rubbish; you will see that tomorrow against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably the redbl may have been too expensive for him if they made it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, this contract isn't all that elegant|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|brgpro: i already had my money on England...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As long as he has the play to back it up :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: I am told that Iceland has extended its lead by 7 IMPs and 1 IMP on boards 8 and 9.|pg||
nt|jtr: Unusually unpartiotic of you David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am very partiotic and will be cheering them on.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|brolucius: At least you qualified, unlike Sweden and Norway, who have been strong in the past.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Regarding England, The Times headline said that is one spill the US won't object to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|mbruun: Can you make 2 Sp?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, if South covers @S9 with @SJ ("cover an honour with an honour") how does declarer make it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @S8|pg||
nt|mbruun: Seems like three spade losers if he covers the Sp 8|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|atabey: no @c lead makes easily. right?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4@c bid may prevent the @c lead|pg||
nt|atabey: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he picks up the @ds..|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: Zorlu is a great friend of Zia :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he denied @H and @s controls..|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|iceblue: I think W didnt know which was better, 2@S or 3@S, then he desided to PASS|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has to calculate whether it is worth rising with the @HQ to get West to draw dummy's last trump.|pg||
nt|atabey: usually zorlu has very good instincts|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR stopped in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||
nt|atabey: but this very hard |pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper is easily the best declarer in the Scotland team ... practice makes perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure he can get this right, is there a case to playing the double @d finesse instead of low to the J?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was there a case to play @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought that was risky|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs the @ds for his contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think the defence can stop 9 tricks as it happens|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: I checked the instructions on my various packets of heart pills and they made no mention of taking an extra dose before England world cup matches.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The winning contract was probably 1NT.  It could be reached if, for example, West opens 1NT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria is pretty disgruntled. Has been like that since the 3NTX|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|atabey: wd|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Piper loves to bid NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think you mean 'Piper loves to bid and play'|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||

nt|brolucius: East new the game was up (no pun intended) and cashed his available tricks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..knew..|pg||
nt|bagman: With better heart spots, South would have bid 3@H, I guess. He might also have done that vulnerable|pg||
nt|bagman: In the OR NS were forced to bid the laydown game|pg||
nt|paulg:  Precision bidding|pg||
nt|capercliff: well a big @c auction coming|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok blame the system :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Cliff, was it you saying 4@HX+1 would tie the match? :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Lauria and Versace seem to be playing a new defence to a strong club, based on canape overcalls|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|andyv:  a big pick up for Lebanon... interesting that their pick ups have been when they've been quiet:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: NS don't open 2@D as 18-19 BAL with 5cM?|pg||
mb|3H|an|*|nt|paulg:  i guess they were thinking more of Meckwell than Scotland|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|*|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Open room has recorded 2@H+2 on this board.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is not what it appears|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is either weak or strong with hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun: Notice Sementas initial pass with 12 bal and no aces|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: easily enough from the West hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is either a weak two in hearts or 5+@H with 18+ points|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||

nt|othered1: Bocci did cover the first @H from dummy, if that affects anything.|pg||
nt|daman: 7 more for Serbia|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: was not a trivial end position there, Lauria could have had Q7x of @h left and North would need to play a low @h to endplay him|pg||
nt|capercliff: anyone know if the tennis match is finally over, the one that started on uesday?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: Yes kibs, I know I should pay attention and that's why I do... if you really want to know: a TD came in and had an urgent question|pg||
nt|daman: up by 29 with 7 to play|pg||
nt|andyv:  12 tricks there with J@d falling|pg||
nt|capercliff: T|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 13 deals played in under the hour. If only all the players on BBO were so swift.|pg||
nt|hedyg: np Bas|pg||
mb|1D|nt|capercliff: im told 67-67, unbelievable|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hands so far are allowing Piper to control the tempo at the table .. i'm sure the Italians would like to keep him quiet for a couple of hands|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: take away his bidding box?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, when the opps generally play slower than you it can be a pretty powerful weapon|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It takes a lot of experience (which EW obviously have) to keep your own pace|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you do a great job! my favorite operator :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, that means a lot, given the amount of sessions I've seen you commentate, haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: that wasnt really a slow pass was it?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sp K is huge, but still 1 NT is stretchy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, it wasn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course the Scottish expectations for this match will be low so Piper does have free rein to try for a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I just figured that with all my typing I might as well enter the bidding real life when I'm typing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why did he pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: really dont like pass with Piper's hand, hes got 9 hcp and support for partners suit..|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
mb|3H|an|Alerted by Lauria|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets assume he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, 6@s is also there|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|bagman: Declarer should play for the drop in diamonds but people do finesse sometimes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl here could be devastating to declarer|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|bagman: This should go !A 4x diamonds and a club for easy make|pg||
nt|andyv:  let's see how W plays it|pg||
nt|bagman: It could go @HA, @DA, @C, @HK, @CQ and diamond finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush yet, but soon ....|pg||
nt|mbruun: May be difficult for defense to grab their heart tricks but seems like the only chance looking at dummy, when they can count nine tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c7|nt|jtr: Maybe a pass of 2NT was the wisest action|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: spad to the six?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good play by Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hiding his @SK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wouldn't like to be in South's shoes here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure South does either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, especially if she is wearing high heels|pg||
nt|mbruun: Would you return the 5 or the 6 of hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There are a number of clues, but that's all they are ... clues|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 5, playing 2/4|pg||
nt|mbruun: Its almost impossible for him after East has shown 5cH|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is very difficult; remember that East bid hearts|pg||
nt|mbruun: I beated you in typing Roland 1-197 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
pc|dK|pc|cT|pc|d5|nt|bagman: The moment of truth|pg||
nt|bagman: not yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like W is going to finesse|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|brolucius: East-West play Gazzilli, so 2@H was a limited rebid. (He would rebid 2@C on a stronger hand).|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North might have three diamonds to cash|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: 6@D can only be beat by a low @S and a @C return|pg||
nt|daman: 10 more for Serbia|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Any @S lead will do, unless you play Lavinthal leads, haha|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you wrote "him", so it doesn't count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: alas|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South is a woman|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h6|pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So let's all take notice of that clever clever play by Sementa ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes longer to type "her"|pg||
nt|mbruun: Declarer would probably have ducked the second diamond with JX in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because the keys are further apart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why? It's the same number of letters|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  W did well|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the match has become much tighter|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes it goes very fast and they pick up their bidding cards before Bas can see|pg||
nt|capercliff: any lead other than a @h would give the East hand enough entries to set up the @s's|pg||

nt|andyv:  I'm not sure that W didn't put off playing the @ds until she felt right about them... the @c play makes no sense otherwise (why risk a ruff?)|pg||

mb|p|nt|atabey: its a difficult job. not what it looks like|pg||

nt|brolucius: West is happy to bid, with two useful kings in partner's suits.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thank you|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: if 2NT could be this weak E had no business bidding 5@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d by N in OR was unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they don't have a narrow range for the action at this vul and east was taking a general direction shot.  But double of 3@D might bring partner back in on the right hand.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to be at the crossroads soon; is he going to play on the clubs or on the hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 10@h would have been a great card to find|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jtr: Looks like this is going to drift a few off at least|pg||
nt|othered1: And AKxx of their likely trumps is a lot better for defense than offense.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they are married, as Mike suggested in the beginning, he will hear about it all evening and night|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sementa finds a truly evil defensive play, putting South under all sorts of pressure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they have sorted this out much earlier than now |pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: The message we should all take away with us is that it is possible to play good bridge at high speed. (Easier to play bad bridge slowly, I agree.) |pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Orange (Dutch team's nickname) played badly as well, but at least we got out with 1-0 and 2-0 victories :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice the 1 @d bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2, not 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1level Italian overcalls can be very weak|pg||

nt|othered1: This is a coffee hand, but better brew it quickly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: I liked the one against us as well, Roland ;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3@C will be some sort of heart raise - perhaps a mini-splinter. |pg||

pc|h6|nt|jtr: Either West hasnt go a 3@c bid or East a 4@h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||

pc|h7|nt|mbruun: If partner has the fifth diamond 7 is cold. Difficult to investigate|pg||

pc|h8|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  so, 12 more imps for Italy|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer is in the nice position that it doesn't matter how many tricks he makes as long as he makes at least 6|pg||
nt|bagman: And he has 4 diamonds and @CA + @HA|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And @SJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Still plenty of vugraph today. The Swiss Cup Jean Besse from Geneva just started. 48 boards to be played there|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not a very good game to hope to slip through when facing Italy.|pg||
nt|jtr: There!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 3NT was a "serious" slam try, 4@S looks an underbid, but perhaps there is more to this than that |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Versace looked at me with a look of despair on his face and I shook my head, Italy out|pg||
nt|capercliff: and rightly taking his time|pg||

nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: This opens up a legitimate chance to make this; declarer goes up, picks the trumps with AK and leads a diamond up|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi has certainly made Madala work today:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer knows that W has at most KJ on the top of her clubs and, thus, most of the other high cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  still should lose a @s, @d and 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: spade and diamond both right  - AND he avoided the club lead ..but 3-1 trumps will still prove insurmountable, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is: "pass is for penalties if the passer is sitting OVER the suit bid - it is neutral if sitting UNDER the suit bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d asking for distribution|pg||
mb|4C|an|*|nt|hedyg: 2@s transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s standard relay I thk. with a very weak hand they bid 2@h|pg||
nt|othered1: other room found 4@S, to their regret as cards lie.|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wonder what 3@s means?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@S= short in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no stayman with 4 3 3 3|pg||
nt|daman: transportation is an issue on this hand|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|jtr: ah 2NT opened|pg||
nt|brgpro: everyday i learn something new.....what is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oops|pg||
nt|brgpro: and what is 1NT?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@c KC?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s 2 without?|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: It was a 2NT opener :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was opened (20-22 on their card).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing for Lithuania is that 1@DXX is not game, so no bonus|pg||
mb|6C|nt|athene: not trivial for declarer here at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: half of what he bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: other room didnt have the 2@d at their disposal|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: aha, that explains it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Bocchi only takes out one bidding card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas probably flirting with the Lavazza girls and got distracted|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Now West needs to go up and attack clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the British Andy Murray winning (he only becomes Scottish when he loses), Italy going out of the World Cup, perhaps a Scotland win here would be the lead in tomorrow's papers|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s showed 2 keycards and cuebid in @s|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice contract but potential gain of 2 imps if Scotland bid the inferior 6@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lauria speciality|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: but i don't see why he should find that|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d would have been 1 or 4, not showing cue in @d|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: interesting he didn't unblock the spade - now a club return is very bad surely|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|kiwi_joker: well, just goes to show. Madala the Magician strikes again|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: ok, no reason to get that right|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|daman: game over|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: and Lauria is a careful declarer|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: and their auction is what we'd see from many standard system players.  Some weak NTers might get to 3N after 3@S by east, but from the other side.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Scoring up: "We have 430" .... "How did you make an overtrick in 3NT"?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as 1@c can be a balanced 19-23, I reckon South thought that that was what North had, and that he would bid with any other type|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is a fun contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|bagman: He was right; there was no legitimate chance to make it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Guaranteed make, pretty much|pg||
nt|mbruun: He will get the diamonds right and make it for sure |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Have to bid it first, though|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 14 10 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And 2 without @S cue? 5NT?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: 4@H, cue in @H maybe in @s as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|atabey: and some luck too :) anyways they are far the best in europe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Some might X with the N hand because of the 4@H, anyone else?|pg||
nt|capercliff: ws 14 doubled?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I wonder how many teams contain a sponsor. The round-robin format makes that a more difficult proposition than it would be in such as the Bermuda Bowl. That is one reason why the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: USA have a poor record in the bridge Olympiad.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no raise to 3@H from North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four trumps to the queen and an ace....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: shell shocked perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it can happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I like 3@H - sort of offering a choice of contracts.  East has already shown his heart stopper, presumably|pg||

nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||

pc|d2|nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks, be back tomorrow|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: It was worth a think, since partner had forced to game opposite a blizzard. Slam would have been OK if the @DK was the @DA, but West could see which honor he had (on close ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: inspection).|pg||
