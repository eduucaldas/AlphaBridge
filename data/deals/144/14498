nt|migry: this may be a small swing to welland if they get too high in the other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team was originally seeded 20th out of 23 entering teams, a remarkable feat to be 15 boards away from the semis|pg||

nt|flash: for security reasons, each match has its own set of hands|pg||
mb|4C|nt|flash: that doesn't allow for comparisons across matches, but avoids many and severe headaches...|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: hi Jacki :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: roy thought 4n was quantitative|pg||
nt|bobh1: is that what chris intended?|pg||
nt|migry: it is quantitative|pg||
pc|d9|nt|flash: that would be the 'std' interpretation|pg||
nt|migry: they play 14-16 NT |pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil: Im pretty sure what everyone plays, but I'll look up their cc's to make sure |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|migry: so 17 (even prime 17) is not enough to DRIVE to slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: ok forgot about their slightly lighter range|pg||

nt|me argent: so far it seems alot is working out nicely for @D team|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: north at the other table didn't pass|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: maybe a @C switch now|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: in the faint hope that partner has the @C king and not the @H king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Franco thinking hard.   Perhaps he will play another heart and be the only table to hold it to ten tricks (showing us why he won the Platinum pairs!)|pg||

nt|migry: so EW will open 1@C with balanced hands that contain a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not to mention light|pg||
nt|migry: this is sort of a normal opening|pg||
nt|phil: true; but the defense could have taken the club earlier and achieved that, but the position is murky to South at T3|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3D|nt|migry: and you want to get that suit in|pg||
nt|bobh1: for them you mean right?|pg||
nt|migry: wouldn't be too happy if the opponents bid 1NT-3NT and take the first 9 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: this isnt right|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Usually at imps, you will be play safely for your contract - unless very sure it wil be ok to do otherwise|pg||
nt|phil: or maybe it is....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: for some reason people this week are questioning my input more than usual :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|migry: i would be happy to open that one even when playing "semi solid" openings|pg||
nt|migry: 1@h= S|pg||
nt|migry: not sure Roy saw the double by North|pg||
nt|bobh1: what would 1@s by roy show?|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: I think Diamond decided to use the favorable vulnerability to try and make life tough for N-S|pg||
nt|phil: hi Mini  :) |pg||
mb|4S|nt|migry: his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Roy definetely saw the double.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: franco is looking at 5-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: so maybe they play the same after a double|pg||
nt|phil: 2N feels like an underbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: or maybe wanted to stress that @d suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: no high cards but his partner is bidding his head off|pg||
nt|scotty: N might have tried 3N there - but it's definitely tougher than if Diamond had passed and left N-S to bid their 26 HCP to 3N|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: they have to guess the right lead here|pg||
nt|migry: good pass |pg||
nt|migry: east may try the KS and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|migry: A@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: probably they will get it right but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he leads the @s A Roy will be able to give suit pref|pg||
nt|migry: i bet on the AS lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|scotty: There is a lot of risk and randomness associated with Diamond's action there - but here he must be credited with generating a swing out of nothing|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d9|nt|flash: very costly at this stage|pg||
nt|bobh1: this was one no one was guessing he would lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|phil: a rare misstep for NS - they have been very strong for Weinstein|pg||
mc|11|nt|phil: Im kind of surprised Platnick didnt raise|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|me argent: @H position aint exactly chopped liver either|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: yes, actually everything works nicely here..|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: @S too|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|dan_ehh: but if the @D were slightly different, the contract would be down from the top|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: its a Wonderfull World|pg||
mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: I wonder what 2@S showed|pg||

pc|cK|nt|me argent: good point its always a pleasure listening to a commentator with such insite|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Sher "I could have bid 3nt myself, i just thought we had like this complete misfit, sorry p "|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Kolesnik led the @SA in the other room|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|scotty: North responds light, so as not to give E-W a free run|pg||
nt|phil: I know Josh Sher very well, and this comment doesnt surprise me - he instantly takes the charge which keeps the esprit d' corps intact|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: vulnerabilty and position ripe for stealing|pg||
mb|1N|nt|scotty: I like to play redeouble here as "competitive values, with doubleton in your suit"|pg||
nt|phil: any explanation on the xx? just cards? |pg||
nt|phil: good agreement to have|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: E might bid 3@d now and West....?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i believe written as doubleton heart but writting is microscopic|pg||
nt|phil: pass by Sher would also reveal a good hand, right? |pg||
mb|3N|nt|flash: the quick claim overwrote the lead here - it was a trump...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: I would actually play that 2@s is a better hand for spades - but that is not "standard"|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: gotcha|pg||
nt|scotty: I'll be very impressed if Platnick passes here|pg||
nt|cherilou: E might sit for this|pg||
nt|phil: Michael, would you take the xx as a force beyond 2@s? |pg||
nt|scotty: Very difficult to "get" the opponents at the 2-level when they open and you are 3-3 in their suit |pg||
pc|dA|nt|scotty: Not a force in any way|pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil: then I think Platnick's pass of 2@s is dangerous - now he has to play catch up|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|flash: Nickell now +76 vs Harris...   |pg||
nt|migry: "steaming"|pg||
nt|bobh1: yeah|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe not the best idea|pg||
nt|scotty: I wonder if Diamond was sure 4@d was natural?|pg||
nt|cherilou: what else would it be?|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't know, but he didn't raise.  He hadsn't shown any diamonds, and he (apparently) had shown a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|phil: like the last hand - a little NV action makes life tough for the pair with the cards |pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe he thought it was a splinter - or was at least a little worried|pg||
nt|cherilou: perhaps it was just a @H honor|pg||
nt|scotty: What is the N-S NT range?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jfeld: Hello|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi jason|pg||
nt|jfeld: Does double imply a @H lead?|pg||
nt|bobh1: now he has to make it|pg||
nt|migry: certainly not a @d lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: i dont think its lead directing at all|pg||
nt|bobh1: it says i think we're beating it|pg||
nt|bobh1: if his @hs were that good he would have overcalled|pg||
nt|jfeld: If it suggests a @H lead not so unreasonable, sort of a weird version of lead dummy's suit.|pg||
nt|jfeld: He know his partner is almost broke. I'm guessing he meant it as that.|pg||
nt|jfeld: with every suit stopped, actually pretty reasonable, especially as he knows he needs to generate a swing|pg||
nt|phil: 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i just looked at pad, i can confirm it showed 2 @H|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks Matt|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer can make here, by eloping with club ruffs.  But this is a very difficult hand to play|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|phil: feels like -1, the @cJ should help control the tap|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: everything is right on this hand, but etter doesn't know it, considering various options as he can't afford to lose a trick in hearts|pg||
nt|harmon: probably still his best option|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: with spades 3-3 and diamonds 4-3, he can afford to knock out the A@c and bank on spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hedge his bet, etter is asking about carding methods to try and smith etc. to try and get a read|pg||
pc|s7|nt|harmon: yes but it looks like d's 5-2 with erics false card|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|scotty: He doesn't rate to guess spades - N is almost a 2-1 favorite to hold the J|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|scotty: S has an easy trump return - staying passive|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|phil: does he need to guess spades, after A@h, @h? |pg||
pc|s9|nt|migry: i think it's very reasonable, knowing the suits don't break well for declarer|pg||
nt|jfeld: I'm getting many votes for both I've got everything sewn up, don't give anything away, and also lead a @h|pg||
nt|migry: i believe tha the double should ask for a @h here|pg||
nt|migry: north either has 3 hearts or 4 horrible ones- for me always 3|pg||
nt|jfeld: 3 for me too|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes most people rebid 2 @h with 6-4 even with a bad hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|scotty: S can be endplayed in trump to solve one problem - but tough to get everything right|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|nt|scotty: He needs to lose no trick to @sJ OR @dQ - tough|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|phil: dummy is feeling the pinch a little too|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Just try to avoid leading the @c K    :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: or Ace and a heart would be fatal|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: he might get his black kings mixed up|pg||
nt|me argent: uc lots of ways to bring this one home|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Moss has pulled out a couple different cards and put them back:  none feel quite right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: spades, hearts and trump all in the running|pg||

nt|flash: the difference when @Hs is the 2nd suit is that you may reach 4@H instead of stopping in 2@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you say the players are "arguing" about this Matt?|pg||
nt|scotty: Looks like a spade to the Q was an error, resulting in down - instead of a heart to endplay S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfj: roy felt misinformed in regards to his lead, feeling like if opps had a specific agreement that it showed 3@h|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|bobh1: i see|pg||
nt|jfeld: and fortunately for Chris and Roy no overtricks, which is less likely after the invitational sequence, and his hand.|pg||
nt|bobh1: well we don't know who informed whom of what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: b4 the lead franco asked johnathan if that shows a 3 card accept with hearts, which was confimred, but, as 3nt would make anyway, they had no recourse|pg||
nt|scotty: Fair slam here for E-W - after the overcall, @sA is very likely onside, so you just need to find @dQ - about 57.5% a priori|pg||
mb|4D|nt|harmon: agrressive bid by geoff at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: not a good slam here but it happens to make with that old adage 8 ever 9 never|pg||
nt|harmon: eric expecting more|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: In practice for an expert the odds in 6N are usually even better - you may get information to guide you when you play out the hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@d is natual here, not a raise - as if West opened another suit (since 1@d can be short)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|scotty: If E bids KC at some point, West COULD decide to show the trump Q - the fourth @d is big - he knows his partner is 5.  but it is a big risk|pg||

nt|scotty: You might think E was crazy to pass 6@c in the other room after W opened 1@d, but I think not|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 10 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: E was thinking his partner was 4-4 in minors, and could discard a heart loser on the 5th @d if he played in the 4-4 club fit|pg||
nt|cherilou: opening 4@H would have worked better on this hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team began play last Friday, and it seems Baseggio and Wesintein play a majority of the boards, fatigue certainly an issue with the grueling schedule|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 1@d= heart|pg||
nt|scotty: now there is an interesting question of 5@h or pass then 5@h|pg||
mb|2C!|an|8-10 HCP 5+ !c GF|mb|p|nt|scotty: Of course here, S will bid 5@h if N passes|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bobh1: presumably 1@s would imply better @cs|pg||
nt|migry: west could have bid 1@s to show 4-4 or 5-4 - 1@h shows a balanced minumum|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|flash: the lead gives Roy a chance?   @C lead into the opening bid too tough??|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|migry: 1@s just shows an unbalanced hand - nothing about club quality|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: but needed to play @Ss to take a couple pitches??|pg||
nt|flash: North back to same position as opening lead - @C or @HK to get rich; pointed suit no good|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Interestingly, in the Nickell match, on the previous board, Ralph Katz was in 6@d with north having bid a pre-emptive 2@s and thus misguessed the diamond suit for -1|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: needs a trump lead to set it it looks like|pg||
pc|d3|nt|migry: yeah sry was lookig  at this one|pg||

pc|c6|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|migry: unless they pick up some (a lot) of imps|pg||

nt|scotty: He may figure that, even if club void is more likely, if partner's void is in clubs his club holding might help beat slam even if he leads a @d.  Whereas if partner's void is in ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: The further the Weinstein team advances, the better i feel, they were the only team we beat in the round robin phase :)|pg||
nt|scotty: It is often profitable to preempt against strong artificial openings - opponents have less room to determine their fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 8 imps per board is not impossible if you get swingy hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe n/w should be pards,  and e/s |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: the @D's flop nicely for  e/w |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: you also need a fighting spirit which apparently is not junior's currently|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @H's sit well,  |pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Nickell +73 with 5 boards left|pg||
nt|scotty: 3@d probably "at least 1 4-card M"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely 3 nt here |pg||
mb|3D|nt|phil: I vaguely remember a Spingold match at Chicago in 05 (?) where a team was down by about 80 after 32, but lost|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does 6 @D make"|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 6@d is interesting and makeable if you get the spades right|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would have thought 4@c was gerber|pg||
nt|bobh1: for me it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only with the right view on spade suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: Matt,  what do you think,,  maybe e/w cant handle it all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hmm, on an 8 card fit, it's possible i suppose :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: looks like 5 realistically|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: 4h must be last train|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: as cards sit  3 nt probably better but E knows he is getting a club lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: greco was not happy with his pass "Hope ur not too good pard"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|migry: not sure how they play it - i think it's just a normal splinter|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: and worried about the enties maybe to W hand|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|bobh1: that should cause roy to devalue his max|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bobh1: the advantages are more in the extra auction possibilities it creates|pg||
nt|scotty: Light opening likely to propel E-W to 3N.  If S leads a low heart, it makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: made even with the club lead |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|migry: correct|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so much in the lead placement|pg||
nt|migry: and then some|pg||
nt|bobh1: when lefty intervenes the transfers help them more with lead placement|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "catch all" 1 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: in competition the transfers are so much better than bidding naturally|pg||
nt|migry: but also in uncontested autions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Weinstein seems to have effectively controlled the bleeding, making a little reboudn here|pg||
nt|sybarra: helps |pg||
pc|s2|nt|phil: and why wouldnt he? |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|scotty: Some might have acted over 2@d with S - either double or 2@h is possible (i think 2@h is preferable between those choices)|pg||
nt|phil: but its quite likely Weinstein will open the E hand 1N and also get to 3N from the other side|pg||

pc|sK|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Two boards remaining in this set, Play is scheduled to resume at 3:45 Central Time, which is approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes from now, hope to see everyone back for more action ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: dealer having lots of fun today!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: suddenly a tight match was just blown wide open in this set|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play it here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: What's your theory on 2 suited hands in the pre-emptive HCP range, at what point do u upgrade to 1@h instead of 2@h here shirley?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: after two days of sparring with each other|pg||
nt|migry: i don't think anything exciting is going to happen here and i have to try and get the rice out of my keyboard|pg||
nt|sybarra: yuk is my best description  (that is a technical term)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|scotty: Can make 6 here with perfect card reading - N is squeezed without the count if S ducks at trick one (simple squeeze if S wins trick 1)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: I can understand N bids,  (thinking he can not get into trouble) but afraid I am chicken and would have opened 2 @H|pg||

nt|migry: it doesn't always work |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Grand finale folks, special thanks to our wonderful commentators, Migry & Bob + others @h :) |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Thanks everyone for tuning in, and a special thanks to our commentator Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|sybarra: ths Matt, our terrific operator |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :), last board, final segment of the day will resume in approximately 10-15 minutes |pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Most North's, had they started with 5-card @s, would have pitched one at some point - so the position is actually guessable - pitch spade, @dAK, spade to dummy, @d to N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not impossible to overcome this deficit but not easy either|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfj: North just pointed out the margin was never more than about 20 the entire match, untill the end, a well faught battle|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: reminds me of some great boxing matches I've seen|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: 2 @h a diamond raise or asking for stop |pg||
mb|2N!|mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @S not n/s best spot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: kolesnik getting a little frisky :), i assume it's just general force showing spade stoppers or something?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|scotty: S should raise here - N showed a hand better than a 2@s bid, and S has 3 "working" cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|scotty: Good bid|pg||
