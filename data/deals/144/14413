nt|joest: this looks to be three pretty tame hands in a row|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|an|unbalanced hand|nt|joest: 1@d = distributional opener; at least four diamonds, typically five|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|joest: good sut though|pg||
nt|joest: Garner wants to play 4 opposite a minimum|pg||
nt|joest: unfortunately WEinstein has quite a bit morre and it would be a minor miracle if he passes this|pg||
nt|joest: the good news is that Garner will be playing it so Etter will have lead something other than hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  a minor miracle or a Major miracle?|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect pass from Howard because he already showed intentions and partner gave a shutout bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s is a shutout?|pg||
nt|joest: i'm presuming its Howard Weinstein thinking, not Etter|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h is a stronger option|pg||
nt|joest: it is a hand willing to play four spades opposite as little as a weak two in spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess he could keep bidding open with any lower level with a new suit etc|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so 4@s obv shutout|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|an|1 keycard|nt|h_karluk: in other words last resort|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  the only bids I know that are "shutouts" are 1N-3N and such like: where partner has provided a narrow definition of their hand and the bidder says "I know enough to place the contract"|pg||
