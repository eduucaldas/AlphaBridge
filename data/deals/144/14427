nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "guess I could have saved a trick or 2 with a better opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Cheri|pg||
nt|stewball: there are differing views as to how to go about this S hand when pard opens 1nt|pg||
nt|stewball: hi Cheri|pg||
nt|cherilou: Hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gets my vote too     16+ HCP unbal [or compensating playing strength]  or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Raija - never would have occurred to me|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcmax:  Sometimes one can also catch a defender off-guard covering the Jack in the N seat with H10x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 12+ HCP, 5+@C   they have immediate bid for 4441 but not 5440|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: mine is that I dont go looking for a major without a legit invite in NT|pg||
nt|stewball: Bates agrees it seems|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cherilou: I think it's really borderline VUL|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|peachy: vul, and with tricks, S prob raises|pg||
nt|peachy: ordinarily, 2NT in competition not to play but this is obviously an exception such rule (if they have it)\|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|stewball: really really very:)|pg||
nt|stewball: i HATE down 1 in 2nt|pg||
nt|mildredb: assuming @C lead will only make if Beatty guesses @D situation which will probably require x-ray vision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the rest of this auction will be natural|pg||
nt|poohbear: Its very easy to overbid good hands and underbid bad ones when playing strong @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman-Moss didn't even sniff for slam  1@H-1@S;3@H-4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this would be easy slam to reach playing relays|pg||
nt|poohbear: quite a raise with a @h void. Though could well be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: no running now, Mr, jacobs|pg||
nt|mildredb: what a dbl!  |pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: Platnick is thinking, pull, pull, pull :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|Jacki: Welcome our Commentators, Bob Heitzman and Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|bobh1: hey marshall|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: scores thru 3 of 8 sets are now online -- thx Jan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||
nt|poohbear: Compton's pass surprises me. 4@h rates to be a better contract than 3NT and he has slam potential opposite 12 points when partner is marked with some @d cards|pg||
nt|poohbear: never really conveyed the strength of his suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Bramley asking about the lead - it's lower of touching, but would lead the J if interested in the 10 and the Q if interestd in the J (at least I think that's what he said)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cherilou: with favorable @S Mohan will make 1NT|pg||
nt|mildredb: Greco in the other room did infact play AK of @D - what a play!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hi Bob, Marshall|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Here is another chance for a technical play in the @H suit|pg||
nt|marinesa: rixi markus first wrote about the intra finesse|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Without any additional information the best chance for 1loser only is to play N for H10 doubleton|pg||
nt|marinesa: or 10 doubleton|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcmax:  That means declarer would play a low @H away from the A. and if N plays his honor, he next plays the Jack from dummy to pin N's 10|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|cherilou: yet, as you can see John will lose 2 imps because they weren't in @S|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 1D here so no knowl;edge where length is|pg||
nt|peachy: if anywhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Each of these teams has two pairs playing souped up Precision and one (Jacobs-Beatty & Gitelman-Moss, who are out this quarter) playing standard|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "you play upside down, right?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT might go down|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|nt|stewball: but I would rather play 1nt than 3 @s|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs has put the screen down to ask Diamond something - I couldn't hear what (which is good because that means Platnick couldn't either :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Although he's a lot younger than I am so maybe he could|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfb: Probably asking about whether Platnick could have a stiff @d for the 1@d opening, since from the DBL of 3NT he thinks Diamond has the Q|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|bobh1: looks like -1|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: @CA lose @HK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherilou: now only 1|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzfb: Guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "should have known Diamond had the diamond"|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer is lucky that the defense cant run @ss|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|mildredb: I doubt he could have singleton @D in this auction & rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mildredb: George has many clever sayings|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: You're right of course - wouldn't rebid 1NT with stiff @d. But he was definitely doing his thinking before playing @d K not after|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: either @S is cashed or overtrick|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs: "well, you might make 3NT"|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Only this is not the layout here, where that would work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: There were problems with the first two boards (duplication) so we'll play them later|pg||
nt|poohbear: everyone friends here. I expect a snide comment from Hampson :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky -- this is only match playing that board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but you can watch other vugraph tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|2N|nt|cherilou: but you're down by 46--you need to bid that Vul game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax:  Yes, very true Marinesa, or 10 doubleton. If N plays low declarer would finesse against the 10 and then again in the next round play the Jack from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: If you're talking about taking an intrafinesse, the players were all laughing about "have you ever seen one work at the table" and "it's in a book"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boards WILL be duplicated across both matches in the Semi-Final which begins Thursday|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|mildredb: Jan is the greatest operator - always shares table comments w/ us - ty, Jan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D is catchall  2+@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: smoke em if you got em 3NT here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C shows @C & @D|pg||
nt|poohbear: around inv values|pg||
nt|poohbear: but not quite|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: yes, makes people feel like they are right there tableside|pg||
nt|marinesa: yes, it's in bols brillancy book the hand by rixi markus|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cherilou: any one know what 2@D is?|pg||
nt|stewball: not familiar with this 2@d treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i wonder what 2@h shows|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The truth is they all have seen several working and they all have taken several of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss alerted his Pass of the DBL, Gitelman didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: yes - much more fun :)|pg||
nt|marinesa: and yes i've had it work many times as i'm sure sabine has|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: hmmm--me either|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzfb: They play transfers after 1M-1NT - I thought that 2@d showed either 4+ hearts or an accept of a NT invite, but Harris only wrote 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N knows that W has at most 3 hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: W certainly has his bid but it wont work out well for him|pg||
nt|bobh1: is 4@s makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 5 spades he would presumably want to play in spades or at least explore for best game, and since he responded 1S....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S goes down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: North has shown some mild interest, I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, of course it's Diamond who's been thinking here, not Wold :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jcmax:  I wonder whether NS here were on the same wavelength as to S's dbl over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Now Jacobus is asking about Moss' pass of the DBl and I'll try to see what G wrote (but he is leaning forward and blocking my view of it, sorry)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  It looks to me as if S intended it as showing @D and N thought it showed values|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: 4H likely would have shown less|pg||
nt|mildredb: Jacobs not even willing to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|mildredb: this should end the auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: right wold had nothing to think about|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobh1: nobody invited him to the party|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, should, but maybe the diamond filler should have been shown, he does not have a bad minimum|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mildredb: some might play it is required below game|pg||
nt|mildredb: of course, the slam in on a @D break & finding @H Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Before the screen went up, Jacobs asked Beatty how he had described 3NT and Beatty said "mild slam try" so they were in agreement. |pg||
nt|peachy: thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Then they discussed bids over the Precision 1@d and decided they would play that 2@d and 3@d are natural and with a Michaels hand they just bid 1@s and then bid hearts later|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mildredb: Jacobs squad likely to win an imp|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|cherilou: since Harris knows morgan has @DK needs to return @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems ill-advised. the spades are poor and E has already passed 4C. of course there may be some ambiguity about how many clubs W has shown, but since he clearly has game values ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he ought to have only 4 clubs, and yet E was still willing to play 4C|pg||
mc|11|nt|mildredb: oh, sorry, they made 7 in other room, my apologies :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: they can't make 8, can they?|pg||

nt|mildredb: Harris is lead the Nickell team 18-1 after 3 bds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4CX is down one, and even then only because S gets to throw a spade on 3rd heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Diamond: "sorry - 3NT is only down 2, I should have stayed there"|pg||
nt|bobh1: so he jumped out of the frying pan into the fire|pg||

nt|poohbear: same auction here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|marinesa: double is probably staymen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus and Moss are now debating 4@hx - Jacobus says they had to get the diamond ruff to beat it; Moss disagrees; going back and forth for awhile|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: curious that he ap[ologized for leaving 3N but not for leaving 4C which was his best haven|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and when i say "some"  i mean Bart & company :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: jacobus a touch heavy for 4@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: but no harm no foul in this case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mark lives pressure bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: They're playing strong club so 4@s is very wide-ranging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marc|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: unless they play a strong @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: good save NS except for one small problem ::)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his notes actually say 3@C = preempt/mixed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 5+@C 5+@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mildredb: 10 imps likely|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, they did it|pg||
nt|mildredb: anything Beatty wants to do, works|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobs using his time as dummy to study his bidding notes :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: then 4@s is normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense just has to knock out @C before giving up the lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense needs to get @cs going otherwise they might disappear on @ss . But the 7 of @ss is a powerful card|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: in fact the ability to jump to 4@s with a hand like this is one of the benefits of playing a strong @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: We have 2 strong club pairs here and 2 standard pairs in the other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stewball: will E let his pard out?|pg||
nt|stewball: no|pg||
nt|cherilou: Bates finds the right lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 2@c showed diamonds and 2@d showed about 11-12 HCPs and said nothing about diamonds|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure what 2@c accomplished.effectively he bid 3nt over 1@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan puts the screen down to ask what their 1NT range is - Mohan says 14-16|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|cherilou: he found out his partner had better than an 8-9 count with good suit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: nice try by diamond, but declarer's trumps are big enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess Beatty's deciding which hand he wants to be in, and how he's going to play the hand, guarding against bad breaks. He knows a vul game is an important hand so doesn't want ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: to miss anything|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will be last time i beat Barry to the analysis of defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: i type too slow :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: Doesnt seem like much for Bramley to do except shift to a @c  . Is he pondering a trump shift?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jimkrek: had a chance to beat it on heart lead-now it sd be over|pg||
nt|poohbear: or deciding that  alow @c is right :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: a problem, and that's going to be hard so takes awhile|pg||
nt|poohbear: If Hampson trusts the bidding his plan was to take a winning @s finesse then draw one round of trumps and set up @ss then he would run them thru  North|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|poohbear: If North ruffed in he could draw the last trump|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: I am surprised. Must not have been tod 5-5|pg||
nt|poohbear: told|pg||
mb|1D!|an|can be short|mb|p|nt|peachy: In Precision, N can open 1S. In standard style, not everyone does|pg||
nt|marinesa: particularly since both pairs opened a club with 4 diamonds and 3 clubs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stewball: only if they play attitude leads,,surely a @d shift could have been right|pg||
nt|stewball: the problem was the 1@d opener perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: some might open 2@S in std, but perhaps he doesn't think the suit is good enuf or just not his style|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I was taught long ago that there isn't any space between 1 and 2 - if the hand isn't a 1@s bid, it's a 2@s bid, but some people have rules about suit quality so that doesn't apply|pg||
nt|ahollan1: (10)11-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mildredb: I agree w/ you Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: No I think other room opened a Precision diamond and then East bid 2@c to show both minors maybe?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|poohbear: WOW . Bart is aggressive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Wold: "maybe too much"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has an awful lot of controls for the blunderbuss call of 4S i think. as he holds spades, there is no rush, and no need to worry to much about further competition. i like pass or ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he appears to have made a good dec unless Marc made an inspired heart play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus asks about the lead - Platnick puts the screen down to whisper something, probably that it is usually 4th but might be different in partner's bid suit|pg||
nt|marinesa: i see |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: GItelman-Moss are the only "natural" pair playing now - other 3 are strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: First seat also can take liberties that would not be wise in second seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Of course that line is in a different place at different vuls and seats - I suspect Mildred & I would agree that at this vul in second seat, the N hand would clearly be a 2@s bid - ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: in first, it's less clear|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 4@s is fairly descriptive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is NOT 6@D 4@C  other than that unclear about minor dist|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: I agree, seond seat vul 2S|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I thought the hand was worth 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Down 75?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only time they'll raise to 2@S with only 3 card support is the troublesome 3=4=5=1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cherilou: no problem with 1NT here--not the kind of boards NS want|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marinesa: some clubbers play don't there so clubs and a higher|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with only 70+ boards to play|pg||
nt|poohbear: The other reason to bid 2NT is it now allows partner to show 3 card @s support and avoid NT |pg||
pc|hT|nt|mildredb: looks like -1 & if so, Diamond will jump into lead by 1|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|jcmax:  If declarer here draws trumps and then plays on @H he is bound to lose 3 heart tricks because of the bad breaks|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The natural line of play is trying to ruff some @H in dummy depending on how they break|pg||
nt|marinesa: think he will work out not to play trumps but ace and a heart with bidding and lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, slam would be cold if either one held the jack of hearts, and that wouldnt change anbyones bidding|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|cherilou: but EW are thrilled to have them|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|poohbear: Bart ducks a round in case @hs 6-3 .|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @c finesse then loses the defense would not be able to take their @h tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there ANY way for him to guess @C?|pg||
nt|poohbear: hand records or peeking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or - anti-percentage play for a swing|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|stewball: i'm not familiar with EW but Mohan Bates have been partners forever|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|stewball: I dont think I'd call the director just because a cellphone rang between hands|pg||
nt|mildredb: Nickell 7, Harris 18 after 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Jan pointed out -- down 75|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcmax:  W cannot really tell whether his partner's @C 5 is a singleton or a doubleton. If it had been a singleton it could have been expensive not to cash another @C|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzfb: At this event the players are not allowed to have any electronic devices in the playing rooms - because we're on Vugraph so it's possible to see the hands on a cell phone|pg||
pc|sA|nt|poohbear: true|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|marinesa: think eddie will work out q of clubs from akq with only diamond king for bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Wold asks about carding: "upside down"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Moss also said something about standard - probably suit preference, but he sort of mumbled|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|poohbear: but too early to start|pg||

nt|reisig: Many uses of X here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stewball: i wonder if the rules in europe are similar|pg||

nt|stewball: anyone know?|pg||
nt|bobh1: its true that Wold should have sound values to overcall 1n red opp a passed hand|pg||
nt|jimkrek: good 7 vul when you can place most of the cards and pard can have up to 18 favors bidding in these situations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: devilish hand to defend, looks good for S|pg||
nt|bobh1: he prob is figuring where there's 8 tricks there should be 9 somehow|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|nt|reisig: @d seems easy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: the defense benefits a bit from the fact that W led the heart deuce, so E knows no doubleton. but declarer is going to get very lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was busy inviting Steve Beatty to join us - the diamond was played promptly|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobh1: or maybe if he had a different partner he might not bid it this way|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jimkrek: d back wd have made him sweat, but lucky club position wd always see him home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes. the heart does not look right to me. unlikely that S has a doubleton as with a good 3244 or whatever S would have doubled|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfb: Harris: "3NT hasn't been faring well at this table" Morgan: "so you went low with 12, eh?"|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: if it were simple Q ask no doubt he would have answered by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: maybe the issue is that 4N is supposed to be to play and 5@C would be the Q ask.....Jacobus is leaning his head on the table right now|pg||

nt|poohbear: what do  you think of the pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Meant Hampson on the comment, of course - sorry!|pg||
nt|poohbear: again we see a pass of 3NT before the hand had a chance to express how good their @hs are|pg||
nt|poohbear: Greco thinking of Ducking the @c here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Greco definitely thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3-2 @ds he just claims|pg||
nt|poohbear: ducking the @c is right when @cs 6-2 and the dbltn has the 4@ds but he cant know they arent 5-3|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is also a bit hard to swallow|pg||
nt|jimkrek: ah-different auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus asked if there was any explanation on the other side and Wold said "3@s was natural"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: different but equally suspect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I missed the auction when I was changing the result and when Wold told me I didn't hear right|pg||
nt|poohbear: That was his 8th trick|pg||
nt|poohbear: he had goos play for a 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Greco asked Compton "2@s is normal?" before ducking|pg||
pc|c9|nt|stewball: cant say I blame him|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherilou: So it's back to the normal score |pg||
nt|stewball: if W is short they dont rate to make a profit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Gitelman's delayed 2@s bid bought the contract, where Bramley's immediate one didn't - we'll see whether that's good or bad|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzfb: Wold was a passed hand, playing Precision|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like this lead|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Morgan asks "Did you think we had any agreements here?" Harris: "yes, I thought we played Pass-DBL inversion here, so pass was either a penalty DBL or strong, but the 2NT follow up ...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: numerous ways it can gain|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would hope not Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wold treated his hand as  12+ HCP with 5+@H   maybe Hampson would have done that too instead of nebulous 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss-Gitelman never in the auction so Jacobus HAS shown @D length|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: It was alerted but no-one asked; Diamond sort of pointed at the 2@s card, which is why I think it was a re-transfer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i just meant in general, all of us|pg||
nt|jimkrek: looks like 3nt and 4s can make but you have to double hook spades and in spades need abit of timing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I guess 3N makes but 4@s doesn't? |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Jim plays 4@s better than I do :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so Nick, you always bid a bit more aggressivley when you have that card?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL =  a) 1-suit @C/@D  b) @H & @S  c) some strong hands|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: do you methods incorporate a queen-ask, just for clubs regardless of what the trump suit will be?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no more conservatively - usually cannot find it...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even in your own hand?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|niclecuyer: well then I can manage|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|niclecuyer: difficult hand for NS - bound to go down in whatever they attemps|pg||

pc|s2|nt|passell: another lucky 3nt  needs qx of clubs and dia|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|passell: might run dia j here|pg||
nt|passell: think he will play clubs first|pg||
nt|passell: not many dull hands in this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 5@C tricks, doesn't can afford @DK then finesse -- if not 5@C -- doesn't matter, not enough tricks|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|passell: he might get fancy in clubs and lead the J play for 10 x  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: however ----   if stiff Queen is @C, then 3@C|pg||
nt|passell: or stiff 8  very tough play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now DOES need 5@D |pg||
nt|passell: yes  very complicate as he knows greco has majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: greco could hold singleton @CT and @DQ|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do you guys do this AT THE TABLE|pg||
nt|passell: or sing 8 and dia Q|pg||

nt|peachy: Last hand now, the show will continue shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: This is the last board of the segment, we'll probably be restarting about 10 minutes after both tables have finished|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s will make without a @c lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|vugraphzfb: Compton - I thought they'd go the other way at the other table, and the two lines looked about equal, so I thought I'd try for the swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: this hand is not what EW are looking for|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Jan for a wonderful job, multitasking, both operator and organizer of these vugraphs.  |pg||

nt|cherilou: hard to find the trump lead|pg||
nt|stewball: very|pg||
nt|stewball: if N started with 3@d a trump lead would be more attractive perhaps|pg||
nt|cherilou: Even with more "not good" results from other room it looks like Harris will win this match. Well done|pg||
nt|passell: anti percentage play since qx in either hand  but certainly not crazy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfb: Jacobus: "Sorry, I got distracted & pulled the wrong card, didn't mean to bid 2@s; not the contract they're playing at the other table, but haven't gone down yet"|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: yep they're in the Heat described by Zia as "nothing goes right"|pg||
nt|passell: hampson stole the pot responding 1spade  he feels in control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and yet not many imps on the scoreboard for this set -- just what might have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think he knew that Greco had Majors, so he was the only one likely to have a doubleton club|pg||
