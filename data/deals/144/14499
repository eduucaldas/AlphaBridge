nt|kit: We'll see how many spades Meckstroth is willing to bid at unfaorable|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can't bid 2|pg||
mb|d|an|thrump X|nt|kit: Levin probably has to make a negative double, but he can't be too happy about it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|kit: This is already probably too high -- I don't think Levin has another call here|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|pbundy: a huge difference which major ralph decides to lead!|pg||
nt|pbundy: unfortunately, i think hearts more attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: as is too often the case, the brilliant michael rosenberg corrects me|pg||
nt|harmon: even with hts lead clubs blocked an time to switch|pg||
nt|pbundy: lack of entries and blocked club suit|pg||
nt|mouser:  Plenty of time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E-W std carding, 4th best from suit with interest in developing, Smith Echo|pg||
nt|pbundy: some sneaky declarers in the audience are recommending that weinstein win the heart KING....  an attempt to throw ralph off the past to success|pg||
nt|mouser:  good idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|gavin:  im sure they play 4@C as forcing here, too difficult to stop on a dime in 4@C, makes looking for slam much easier|pg||
nt|kit: So Levin has to either pass or force to game?|pg||
nt|gavin:  i am confident thats how they play|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|pbundy: lots of points for N/S but no game makes|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: From declarer's point of view there are still chances.  Ruff a spade, another club, AQx of clubs onside, spades 7-2, able to lose diamond trick to West, etc.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Kamil overcalled 2@S and is declaring 3@S|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure what Weinstein is playing for with this line of play|pg||
nt|kit: I guess if spades are 6-3 he could ruff both spades and wind up with a trump coup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match both rooms stopped in 4@C|pg||
nt|kit: or maybe win ace of diamonds, cash ace of hearts, diamond to king, queen of hearts, ruff diamond, spade ruff, good diamond through -- possible I guess|pg||

pc|sK|pc|c9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: no, he ruffed the spade first -- didn't expect that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: weinstein asks about suit pref -- "upside down and we never lie"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: I still don't see how he was planning to make on this approach -- maybe he is seeing something I'm missing|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: they play a Multi 2@d|pg||
nt|pbundy: thanks adam|pg||
nt|pbundy: 2@D preempts becoming something that belong in the smithsonian|pg||
nt|jlall: I think bob will just bid 4@S here and give up on slam to apply the pressure|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: he might have tried 4@D.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: even though the hand is a textbook splinter, it gives away info and helps them find saves etc, I like his bid|pg||
nt|pbundy: pretty decent hand, IMHO.  partner doesn't always have Q10xx opposite your stiff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yes, plus if Kamil had one less black card, and one more @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: it gives him room to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|mildredb: play should go very quickly|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pbundy: simply deciding which heart spot is best here|pg||
nt|mildredb: Nickell picks up 4 when 5@C went -1 in CR|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, the direct 3@S overcall worked better there pushing NS too high|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfc: Weinstein "I wanted to win @hK first trick, but that seemed *too* tricky"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=5+@S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pbundy: hi kit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If played by West, defense can win with low spade lead.  Declarer must duck, and then heart shift does it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|kit: Cards lie as favorably as they could for 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is because opening 2@D=Flannery so 1@H doesn't have 4@S unless reverse strength|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: On low diamond continuation, queen will win.  Declarer then has to decide what to do.  If he thinks diamonds 4-3, he should go after clubs|pg||
nt|kit: After that,he can test spades, saving heart finesse for last if spades don't split|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: If played by East, as is likely, then it looks cold|pg||
nt|pbundy: asked about alerts - it would seem that they had an inverted auction - with then showing stoppers|pg||
nt|mouser:  Hi Kit|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell hoping his partner has K10x of spades and a heart stop -- only chance from his point of view.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pbundy: we may still be impless after this hand, too|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck asking about style with 11 and 5-cd maj|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Martel relaxing as dummy, reading the newspaper while Stansby thinks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer doesn't know spades are splitting or if heart is on.  He is considering playing a third round of diamonds, and if diamonds 4-3 and they cash the fourth diamond maybe that ...|pg||
nt|kit: sets up a heart-spade squeeze.|pg||
nt|kit: And if West doesn't take the thirteenth diamond, then can safely lose a spade trick to East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- would Rod lead King from @DAKJT?   just wondering what declarer might infer from Meck's play in @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck's plays are standard here|pg||
nt|kit: It should be clear that diamonds are 4-3.  If 5-2, Rodwell would have continued the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Levin knows @D are 4-3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meck had to begin with either J62 or T62|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pbundy: a kib pointed out that the hand is cold from either side, even with a spade out.  rise - and cannot take 5 tricks on defense|pg||
nt|pbundy: levin has no entry to cash the spades.|pg||
nt|pbundy: THIS, however, is easier :)|pg||

nt|jlall: 1@S would work out better here|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  leading the A lets u see to smother the J on 2nd round|pg||
nt|mildredb: will he bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|jlall: i think 2@S from kamil now is perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: seems good|pg||
nt|jlall: don't really see what else he could do|pg||
nt|caitlin: BEST BID|pg||
nt|gavin:  yeah he has describe his hand very well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|caitlin: sorry for caps|pg||
nt|gavin:  (short @C, too strong to pass 2@H, not strong enough to force to game)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: fleisher has a lot of HCP, but hates his hand opposite short clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: he might try 3N though|pg||
nt|gavin:  seems stand out to bid 3NT knowing he has around 25 highs|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, partner has shown roughly 16-17 HCP so he knows its 25-26|pg||
nt|mildredb: I totally agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yeah, not many other options for him at this point|pg||
nt|jlall: with 25-26 i wouldnt worry about where the tricks are coming from, I'd just bid it|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  @HQx is a great holding to take tricks, the J@S is a nice help card|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  hamman may lead Q@S|pg||
nt|gavin:  may lead @D|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'm guessing @D|pg||
nt|gavin:  if @D for sure 4th best|pg||
nt|jlall: hamman likes very aggressive leads, but also non-genius leads so we'll see waht he'll do|pg||
nt|pbundy: the queen of spades has a good feel to it - despite how it plays out|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gavin:  Q@S isnt trying to be tricky|pg||
nt|gavin:  if you are going to lead spades|pg||
nt|jlall: went with the aggressive option|pg||
nt|gavin:  u cant lead the ace because its your only entry|pg||
nt|jlall: bob really hates passive leads, he is the most aggro leader I know of top players|pg||
nt|gavin:  need to lead the queen so partner can get you back in again (if declarer has a doubleton spade and partner 4)|pg||
nt|gavin:  low blocks the suit |pg||
nt|gavin:  and this auction called for spade lead because dummy has likely 3-4 @S and declarer cannot have more than 3 (didnt respond 1@S)|pg||
nt|gavin:  a @D lead sounds like its into declarers 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|gavin:  this was the only distribution that declarer has only 2@D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gavin:  maximum number of @S and @H|pg||
nt|gavin:  3@S 2@H|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gavin:  and 6@C|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer has ducked because hamman could also have AQT8 or something as a possible holding for this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: could be 3235 I suppose|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|jlall: then the queen would also be the nromal card|pg||
nt|gavin:  right 3-2-3-5,-2-2-3-6, my only point is that this is the ONLY case he has a doubleton @D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  so @D seems like a bad lead|pg||
nt|jlall: if hearts are running declarer can duck this club to guarantee the contract|pg||
nt|jlall: but if hearts arent running he might make by playing the queen|pg||
nt|jlall: and taking 2 spades, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, and 3 hearts|pg||
nt|gavin:  it definitely seems like spades are 3-3 from no spade return here|pg||
nt|jlall: yes|pg||
nt|jlall: but he just needs to know about the heart suit really|pg||
nt|gavin:  he is still considering that hamman may have lead from Qx of @S|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall: one clue that the CK might be on, with no CK zia might play a higher club back|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|mittmouse: after the last result in the bag he didnt want to be too agressive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: std leads and signals vs suits, 3rd-5th : for E_W|pg||
nt|me argent: i do not like 4@Hs with that north hand far too good|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|pbundy: of course, even at these colors could go for a big number with that shape when they don't have a slam their way|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: as kibs pointed out lucky 3n ew good sac in 4h |pg||
nt|kit: South will eventually have to guess clubs right for down 1.  I think he will -- 2 reasons....|pg||
nt|kit: One is he will likely have full count on hand, giving West 3 clubs|pg||
mb|2H|an|not super max; <3 hearts|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pbundy: would be shocking, i think, for someone to find their way to 3nt except by accident|pg||
nt|kit: Other is that East will be known to have 3 aces and another diamond card, so with queen of clubs might have opened 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E-W 3rd-5th vs suits, std signals|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 5@H asking|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H <3@H bad hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S is NAT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: 3NT looks normal contract -- far from cold however|pg||
nt|kit: On likely diamond lead to queen and king and diamond return, declarer has to win, cross to queen of hearts, cash ace of clubs pitching spade, lead a spade to king, and close his ...|pg||
nt|kit: eyes|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: trump lead will damage this contract, and quite findable on auction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mittmouse: but it does seem like u should have some play opposite akjxxxxx and out and partner is vulnerable and could have an 8th h and it may be cold|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: claimed on a show-up squeeze|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer will get a diamond ruff, totalling 6 trumps, 2 diamonds, 1 club, 1 spade|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: seems like declarer can win 10, AJ of diamonds, ruff diamond, ace of clubs, spade off|pg||
nt|kit: But if declarer doesn't cash the top diamonds first he goes down, as South would get ruff of fourth diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there any lie of cards that doesn't need trump 3-3?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer might also pitch losing diamond on ace of clubs and play for spades 3-3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Weinstein being honest -- he's shown even number of @D|pg||
nt|kit: But I think jack of diamonds, diamond ruff is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  upside-down attitude, std count|pg||
nt|kit: If trumps are 4-2, declarer would lose control going after 3-3 spade split anyway I believe|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S   it's a new approach to the game|pg||
mb|2N!|an|leb|nt|me argent: sorry 12 imps north saved an imp by making all the tricks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pbundy: anyone know the record for a low scoring match in the semis of TT's?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: West hand somewhat difficult to handle opposite 1NT opening in most methods -- how does one show both majors and invite?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mittmouse: 3h may stop him from bidding 3nt|pg||
nt|me argent: but not from bidding 3@Ss|pg||
nt|me argent: think he should just bid it less confusion that way|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If 2@H follow is invite, perfect, but most play it is weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: with that heart suit, i would feel comfortable just showing 4-4 shape.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y but u have to have a firm partnership agreement about that bid which i am sure they do|pg||
nt|mittmouse: practical|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: but yes; you are correct, kit in theory|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok - actually there is way to show stronger 1-suit @S, but that isn't as funny|pg||
nt|kit: not clear whether 4@S will make or not here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Declarer has 6 trumps, 2 clubs and a diamond for starters.  Can he get  10?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mittmouse: actually par is 4nt since 4s dbled is only down 1|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: on this hand, notrump is potentially in a lot of jeopardy, although it comes out very lucky|pg||
nt|pbundy: actually - in my partnership, we transfer to hearts then bid 2@S|pg||
nt|pbundy: nick also may sweat a while here trying to decide how to guess - while he cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|kit: He can set up a third club trick by playing North for QJ of clubs -- not so obvious|pg||
nt|kit: He is an entry short for to set up and cash the long diamond|pg||
nt|mittmouse: may have to run the 10 of c to makeit|pg||
nt|kit: Assuming Weinstein leads back a trump, which he surely should|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: this is the most agonizing guess of all -- I think he will go up king if only because he needs the entry for a heart play|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|pbundy: and - WE can see that he can make 3 - but - i am betting he does not!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: attitude leads for N-S|pg||
nt|kit: of course in 2NT he only needs 2 heart tricks, so will cross to dummy and lead heart to queen|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: this knocks out one of the entries prematurely|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think he will get this right|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has to guess the clubs.  If South has Jxx or Qxx, club to king and club to 10 works|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru board 36   Diamond over Weinstein   125-49|pg||
nt|mittmouse: right|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|kit: I don't think he will get it right, but we shall see.  Club to king and club to 10 looks more promising|pg||
nt|kit: Consider the 2NT call -- likely on 5-card heart suit I believe, but don't know their methods|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2N was either out in hearts or diamonds or invite+ with clubs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfc: Also Smith Echo|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|kit: he will go down a lot if heart hook loses, but does he really have a choice -- unless he is willing to settle for down 1.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Smith version played by Levin-Weinstein: high-low we like the opening lead|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pbundy: the imps are piling up now.  defenders X'd last hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: hmmmmm.  perhaps nick did take the heart hook after all!|pg||
nt|kit: as expected, he played South for honor doubleton or tripleton in clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|mittmouse: it only cost him a couple of imps to not finesse with the great result in the closed room|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised -- maybe it is the right mathematical play, but it is so against the grain to concede down 1.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: sorry - haven't used that word in a while|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think they play rightside up at trick1|pg||
nt|kit: He wants hearts continued if partner has 10 or 9, not otherwise.  Very deep.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: when Rodwell asked if this was "a suit pref context as well," wein said "yes, it is"|pg||
nt|kit: he might have felt he couldn't afford the 6 if declarer has 5|pg||
nt|kit: they play suit-preference at trick 1 -- apparently at notrump, or maybe when 6-card suit has been shown|pg||
nt|kit: so "middle" card would be encouraging|pg||
nt|kit: This does set up a second heart trick for declarer, which he will need|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will probably try to slip the 10 of diamonds through, but Weinstein will surely cover.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think play at trick 1  always suit pref  EXCEPT  a) when partner leads Rusinow [attitude]  b) dummy wins the trick  [count]|pg||
nt|kit: Clubs are favorable -- if he leads low first time from dummy, jack 2nd time.  But he doesn't know to do that -- he will lead low twice, catering to honor doubleton in South hand|pg||
nt|kit: for starters, dummy is squeezed here|pg||
nt|kit: is declarer still thinking at trick 2?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sry, lost connection but play was fortunately slow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: dec won the 2nd heart, passed the Dten, played the DJ which was covered and won; then a club from dummy to the Q and aclub back|pg||
nt|kit: thanks -- specs are back on trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sry, i lost connection but now show the plays to trick 7 or so (on my comp)|pg||
nt|kit: very surprised Weinstein didn't cover, though he does have some problem|pg||
nt|kit: they don't show on mine|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he covered the second diamond, the J|pg||
nt|kit: I meant that he didn't cover the 10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: after winning the 9 of clubs with the queen, Weinstein returned the C8 to the J....and Levin is thinking|pg||

nt|gavin:  I think you kinda have to|pg||

qx|o44|st||md|2SKQJ87H9DAJT7C832,SA5432HK87D852CJ5,SHAJT532D63CKT974,ST96HQ64DKQ94CAQ6|sv|n|nt|jlall: i guess if hamman had the SJ thatd give him 4432 and he always would have the Q and not A then|pg||
nt|jlall: and if south had it, it's just 50/50|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: like the 2@H opener because it's 2nd seat r/w, so I don't feel too superpowered for it|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|gavin:  hamman not going to play this one as quickly :)|pg||
nt|jlall: lol|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jlall: pretty normal play|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gavin:  6@S is very important to be lead at some point, it tells partner you have 3 of them so they know what to do |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|gavin:  unfortunately now e-w are endplayed to give declarer an entry|pg||
nt|jlall: some kibs are asking why not SK at trick 2: the reason is you have no entry back to dummy.|pg||
nt|gavin:  if he plays Q@C and a @C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pbundy: is ducking at trick 1 bizarre?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|gavin:  it would work out badly for him peg|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|gavin:  the trick doesnt help and the exit card does|pg||
nt|pbundy: i see|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|gavin:  now declarer can pick up trumps|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jlall: yes this is the type of hand you want to win the diamond so theyre endplayed later|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|gavin:  key to defense was cashing the diamond before playing a @S|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jlall: also, they might have Kx or KQxxxx|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jlall: you dont really need the extra trick|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|s8|pc|hK|pg||
mc|8|nt|gavin:  I actually think that kamil could have figured out that his partner had the J@C|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes dpesm|pg||
pg||
qx|c44|st||md|2SKQJ87H9DAJT7C832,SA5432HK87D852CJ5,SHAJT532D63CKT974,ST96HQ64DKQ94CAQ6|sv|n|nt|pbundy: so far this match has essentially been the 4@H hand with the lucky heart layout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: belay that -- was scheduled to begin in 10 min|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: some would open 2@D (or maybe even 3@D) on East hand - not Nickell's style.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|pbundy: truly awful spots|pg||
pc|d8|nt|me argent: 6@Cs not terrible|pg||
nt|me argent: @C finess probably better than 50%|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pbundy: hmm; this could possibly get n/s to game|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|h3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: will certainly get them to game.  The 2@S call was optimistic|pg||
nt|kit: But very unlucky they chose the suit which splits well -- now a heart ruff defeats this|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: Of course Nickell has to lead his singleton, but he does|pg||
nt|pbundy: down 2 - isn't it?  |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kolesnick opened 1@H -- everyone else 2@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pbundy: oops no; sorry|pg||
nt|kit: I think South didn't have to jump to 4@S -- why not 3@S and keep both suits in picture?|pg||
nt|harmon: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: North would know that hearts is likely right|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c2|nt|me argent: usually weak 2 bidders have an outside honour|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: Now king of clubs leaves defense helpless|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: asked if the double squeeze was on|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
mc|9|nt|vdoubleu: Well played|pg||
pg||
qx|o45|st||md|3SJ62HK532DK873CAJ,S87HAQ864DQJT6CQ9,SAQTH9DA952CT8543,SK9543HJT7D4CK762|sv|b|nt|gavin:  it would be abnormal for hamman to play a club to the King with KJ|pg||
nt|pbundy: ooops doesn't always promise the q|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah but he hesitated|pg||
nt|gavin:  still would be very weird|pg||
nt|jlall: so not impossible |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: yeah i agree|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|jlall: but im sure the hesi made him think hamman had the jack|pg||
nt|pbundy: a pickup on the "forget-non-transfer" hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: for nick|pg||
nt|jlall: not that hamman did not have his hesi, KT9xx is perfectly legit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: this is the last board of this set, we'll be back for the 4th segment at 6:10PM Central Time|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mildredb: i.e. 40 min from now|pg||
nt|gavin:  aggressive by hamman with only 4@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlall: very aggressive|pg||
nt|pbundy: that's what i was thinking......|pg||
nt|gavin:  he is a passed hand so partner wont take him for too much more|pg||
nt|gavin:  it just seems like he might not want to playt his hand at the 4 level|pg||
nt|jlall: zia is like... fml|pg||
nt|mildredb: except perhaps longer @D|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: well, no double no trouble i guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mildredb: wow, that lead surprises me|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|jlall: Thanks to Gavin Wolpert, Peggy Kaplan, Mildred Breed|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  ty justin|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jlall: yes I would have expected a spade lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|gavin:  pls remember to visit my new website, www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jlall: down 2|pg||
mc|8|nt|mildredb: thx all - was exciting :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: bye|pg||
pg||
qx|c45|st||md|3SJ62HK532DK873CAJ,S87HAQ864DQJT6CQ9,SAQTH9DA952CT8543,SK9543HJT7D4CK762|sv|b|nt|kit: Chance for Nickell to get back some IMPs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: both e/w in the other room might have chosen differently to get to the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|kit: Here West started with takeout double, so East can expect spade support.|pg||
nt|kit: But East may think West just has strong 1-suiter.  He has a problem, as the best trump suit hasn't been determined.|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see why West has to gobble up valuable space by jumping.  surely 2@H must be forcing.|pg||
nt|pbundy: if he had a 6 card suit i could see it.  after the cue bid, not sure why he did this with only 5.|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course - i don't presume to second guess ralph katz, either!|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: personally i cannot help on that since i dont play squeezes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think Nickell is planning on bidding diamonds, then spades, then maybe 5NT pick a slam or something like that|pg||
nt|pbundy: lots of kibs mentioning that it would seem the odds great to get to SOME small slam at least|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - they all make|pg||
nt|kit: So they will probably get to some slam just on momentum|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it seems like 7h is the best contract|pg||
nt|caitlin: will be nice pickup for Nickell|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm not sure what ralph is supposed to bid now, however|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike last year, this trials will only qualify 1 team that will be USA1 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2010 World Champ events in Philadelphia are NOT country-specific|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit: so Nickell has left his KQxxx of the major on the shelf|pg||
nt|peachy: sry, uanswered that|pg||
nt|pbundy: lots of guessing from everyone as to what their bids actually mean.  of course, we're not sure that they are on the same wavelength here.|pg||
nt|kit: Note, btw, that South did open the light 1@C.  Had he passed, E-W would have had an easier auction.  Opponents don't bid as well when they don't get to open.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: This will probably get them to 6@D -- not the greatest, but it does make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next year trials will determine ONLY USA2 for 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|kit: pretty tough to stop below 4@D on these cards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|me argent: same intelligent auction in OR|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mittmouse: ok|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; it may not have been pretty but it got most of the job done.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unofficially   Diamond 134  Weinstein 79|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|mc|8|nt|ahollan1: don't go too far -- restart should be pretty soon|pg||
