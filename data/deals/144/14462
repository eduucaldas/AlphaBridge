mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This should be a good match|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Quite a thin double, vulnerable...|pg||
nt|xenya: hmm that's interesting -- does N's pass show willingness to defend 3@Cxx?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I think North's pass indicates no particular preference|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: 'you got us into this - you can get us out'|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: East decided double was too dangerous|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: don't think he can make it -- in fact he would do very well to get out for -1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He has not picked the best line in the spade suit, I fear|pg||
nt|cuttysark: probably not expecting the 4-1 heart break when East did not double|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|xenya: maybe he needn't have touched spades at all -- something on the cross-ruff lines looks better?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I think he would get the same score if he doubled :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: 2@D showing 18-19 balanced?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I shall boldly predict that he makes this|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D must show balanced 18+, and 2@S is artificial GF (my guess)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: maybe 2@S is just a Puppet to 2NT to make sure partner plays it|pg||

nt|jeanhari: taking his chances.. (south could have had a difficult discard|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a @D discard would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jeanhari: time for the dutch to win a match after a very dissapointing start of the tournament|pg||
nt|xenya: S has a comple count on N's hand i think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - have been out and unaware of the early results. Where is the website?|pg||
nt|xenya: *complete|pg||
nt|xenya: so a @C  pitch is safe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If @DQ is singleton, as it surely must be, he has at least 4 clubs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you, Jean|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but not all pages working as they should be|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s6|nt|jeanhari: do we have no scores from the other room?|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps N would have done better to discard @SK early to clarify spade position|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - that is the sort of discard I like to see from partner - one that oaints a big picture|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: anyway it's 1 down -- as it was at the start |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so NS made 9 tricks in spades in the other room|pg||

nt|xenya: *heart|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But the 4 is missing...|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still, he would surely play the ten if he wanted a diamond|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but the 6 sure not the highest|pg||
nt|xenya:  still ut could hardly be W's highest heart|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unlikely to lead Jack from J64|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so we assume -1, Bauke Muller more often takes his time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I have had the pleasure of playing against him, and can vouch for that :)|pg||
