nt|migry: so EW will open 1@C with balanced hands that contain a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not to mention light|pg||
nt|migry: this is sort of a normal opening|pg||
nt|phil: true; but the defense could have taken the club earlier and achieved that, but the position is murky to South at T3|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|2+!d 11-15|nt|migry: and you want to get that suit in|pg||
nt|bobh1: for them you mean right?|pg||
nt|migry: wouldn't be too happy if the opponents bid 1NT-3NT and take the first 9 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: this isnt right|pg||
mb|2C|nt|scotty: Usually at imps, you will be play safely for your contract - unless very sure it wil be ok to do otherwise|pg||
nt|phil: or maybe it is....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: for some reason people this week are questioning my input more than usual :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: i would be happy to open that one even when playing "semi solid" openings|pg||
nt|migry: 1@h= S|pg||
nt|migry: not sure Roy saw the double by North|pg||
nt|bobh1: what would 1@s by roy show?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|scotty: I think Diamond decided to use the favorable vulnerability to try and make life tough for N-S|pg||
nt|phil: hi Mini  :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Roy definetely saw the double.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobh1: franco is looking at 5-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: so maybe they play the same after a double|pg||
nt|phil: 2N feels like an underbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: or maybe wanted to stress that @d suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: no high cards but his partner is bidding his head off|pg||
nt|scotty: N might have tried 3N there - but it's definitely tougher than if Diamond had passed and left N-S to bid their 26 HCP to 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: they have to guess the right lead here|pg||
nt|migry: good pass |pg||
nt|migry: east may try the KS and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|migry: A@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: probably they will get it right but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he leads the @s A Roy will be able to give suit pref|pg||
nt|migry: i bet on the AS lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|scotty: There is a lot of risk and randomness associated with Diamond's action there - but here he must be credited with generating a swing out of nothing|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|flash: very costly at this stage|pg||
nt|bobh1: this was one no one was guessing he would lead|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|phil: a rare misstep for NS - they have been very strong for Weinstein|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|phil: Im kind of surprised Platnick didnt raise|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|scotty: Well partner could have the same hand with a king less - and then game rates to be poor|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|h2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|cherilou: Hi all|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d8|pc|h4|nt|scotty: Platnick didn't raise because 1@d can be 2.  So with 3-cards in their suit, passing looks sensible - partner can reopen with short clubs|pg||
nt|phil: my point is sometimes the 1@d opener actually has diamonds, and from East's standpoint, 5@d may be cheap vs 4@s|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Sher "I could have bid 3nt myself, i just thought we had like this complete misfit, sorry p "|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|flash: Kolesnik led the @SA in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|scotty: North responds light, so as not to give E-W a free run|pg||
nt|phil: I know Josh Sher very well, and this comment doesnt surprise me - he instantly takes the charge which keeps the esprit d' corps intact|pg||
mb|d|an|3 card !s support|nt|phil: vulnerabilty and position ripe for stealing|pg||
mb|r!|nt|scotty: I like to play redeouble here as "competitive values, with doubleton in your suit"|pg||
nt|phil: any explanation on the xx? just cards? |pg||
nt|phil: good agreement to have|pg||
mb|2S|nt|scotty: E might bid 3@d now and West....?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i believe written as doubleton heart but writting is microscopic|pg||
nt|phil: pass by Sher would also reveal a good hand, right? |pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: the quick claim overwrote the lead here - it was a trump...|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|scotty: I would actually play that 2@s is a better hand for spades - but that is not "standard"|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: gotcha|pg||
nt|scotty: I'll be very impressed if Platnick passes here|pg||
nt|cherilou: E might sit for this|pg||
nt|phil: Michael, would you take the xx as a force beyond 2@s? |pg||
nt|scotty: Very difficult to "get" the opponents at the 2-level when they open and you are 3-3 in their suit |pg||
mb|4D|nt|scotty: Not a force in any way|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: then I think Platnick's pass of 2@s is dangerous - now he has to play catch up|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: Nickell now +76 vs Harris...   |pg||
nt|migry: "steaming"|pg||
nt|bobh1: yeah|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe not the best idea|pg||
nt|scotty: I wonder if Diamond was sure 4@d was natural?|pg||
nt|cherilou: what else would it be?|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't know, but he didn't raise.  He hadsn't shown any diamonds, and he (apparently) had shown a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|phil: like the last hand - a little NV action makes life tough for the pair with the cards |pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe he thought it was a splinter - or was at least a little worried|pg||
nt|cherilou: perhaps it was just a @H honor|pg||
nt|scotty: What is the N-S NT range?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jfeld: Hello|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi jason|pg||
nt|jfeld: Does double imply a @H lead?|pg||
nt|bobh1: now he has to make it|pg||
nt|migry: certainly not a @d lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: i dont think its lead directing at all|pg||
nt|bobh1: it says i think we're beating it|pg||
nt|bobh1: if his @hs were that good he would have overcalled|pg||
nt|jfeld: If it suggests a @H lead not so unreasonable, sort of a weird version of lead dummy's suit.|pg||
nt|jfeld: He know his partner is almost broke. I'm guessing he meant it as that.|pg||
nt|jfeld: with every suit stopped, actually pretty reasonable, especially as he knows he needs to generate a swing|pg||
nt|phil: 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i just looked at pad, i can confirm it showed 2 @H|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks Matt|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer can make here, by eloping with club ruffs.  But this is a very difficult hand to play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|phil: feels like -1, the @cJ should help control the tap|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|scotty: He doesn't rate to guess spades - N is almost a 2-1 favorite to hold the J|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|scotty: S has an easy trump return - staying passive|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|phil: does he need to guess spades, after A@h, @h? |pg||
pc|dA|nt|migry: i think it's very reasonable, knowing the suits don't break well for declarer|pg||
nt|jfeld: I'm getting many votes for both I've got everything sewn up, don't give anything away, and also lead a @h|pg||
nt|migry: i believe tha the double should ask for a @h here|pg||
nt|migry: north either has 3 hearts or 4 horrible ones- for me always 3|pg||
nt|jfeld: 3 for me too|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes most people rebid 2 @h with 6-4 even with a bad hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|scotty: S can be endplayed in trump to solve one problem - but tough to get everything right|pg||

nt|flash: 4 IMPs on the scoreboard; cost the extra IMP with the Closed Room in 4@Ss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: there is an argument between the players, about 3@h |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: wether or not it showed 3@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: or a weak 6-4|pg||
nt|bobh1: considering the state of the match a justifiable gamble i think|pg||
nt|flash: as Bob mentioned, it's usual to rebid 2@H with 4, no matter how weak the hand|pg||
nt|flash: (that's the exception to the usual way to handle 6-4 hands)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|flash: 2@S tends to be a limit raise (or better) in @Ds|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|flash: again, a partnership will have decided what Pass and 3@D show there|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|flash: 6@D depends on finding the trump Queen?  (and the @SA onside, which the auction showed)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|marinesa: and i wouldn't find it, i'd play them for shortness, so i'd go down|pg||
nt|marinesa: bet 5nt is pick a slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: or suggesting protecting his @SK|pg||
nt|flash: a bit strange?  (since @Ds is apparently the only suit in play??)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|marinesa: so how is partner to know this is to play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not for play, but suggesting 6N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: discussing agreement about 3@D bid -- extra shape says Weinstein (but apparently not Baseggio)|pg||
nt|flash: this isn't a regular partnership and we seem to have hit a gaping hole in their agreements|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: a couple of holes on this auction -- right, they haven't played all that much together (as far as I know)|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think the issue is the   of @Ds in the West hand and would use Pass to show 3 and 3@D to show 4, both in the context of a minimum|pg||
nt|marinesa: i think bassegio must have thought it was a choise of clubs or diamonds, maybe pard has 4d and 5c|pg||
nt|flash: if the 4th @D constitutes extra shape, then i'm with Johnathan|pg||
nt|flash: E-W tried 4@H on 19...   a surprising 8 IMPs to Weinstein|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: bassegio:  |pg||

nt|flash: the difference when @Hs is the 2nd suit is that you may reach 4@H instead of stopping in 2@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you say the players are "arguing" about this Matt?|pg||
nt|scotty: Looks like a spade to the Q was an error, resulting in down - instead of a heart to endplay S|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Vugraphzfj: roy felt misinformed in regards to his lead, feeling like if opps had a specific agreement that it showed 3@h|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D!|nt|bobh1: i see|pg||
nt|jfeld: and fortunately for Chris and Roy no overtricks, which is less likely after the invitational sequence, and his hand.|pg||
nt|bobh1: well we don't know who informed whom of what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: b4 the lead franco asked johnathan if that shows a 3 card accept with hearts, which was confimred, but, as 3nt would make anyway, they had no recourse|pg||
nt|scotty: Fair slam here for E-W - after the overcall, @sA is very likely onside, so you just need to find @dQ - about 57.5% a priori|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|cherilou: not a good slam here but it happens to make with that old adage 8 ever 9 never|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: In practice for an expert the odds in 6N are usually even better - you may get information to guide you when you play out the hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@d is natual here, not a raise - as if West opened another suit (since 1@d can be short)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|scotty: If E bids KC at some point, West COULD decide to show the trump Q - the fourth @d is big - he knows his partner is 5.  but it is a big risk|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: The further the Weinstein team advances, the better i feel, they were the only team we beat in the round robin phase :)|pg||
nt|scotty: It is often profitable to preempt against strong artificial openings - opponents have less room to determine their fit|pg||

nt|bobh1: yes i actually think its kind of random|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps a glimmer of light for Weinstein|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+ !d 11-15|nt|passell: lots of advantages|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|phil: it would be nice to get a little momentum for the next few boards going into the next set|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: the advantages are more in the extra auction possibilities it creates|pg||
nt|scotty: Light opening likely to propel E-W to 3N.  If S leads a low heart, it makes|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|migry: correct|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so much in the lead placement|pg||
nt|migry: and then some|pg||
nt|bobh1: when lefty intervenes the transfers help them more with lead placement|pg||
mb|3N|nt|migry: in competition the transfers are so much better than bidding naturally|pg||
nt|migry: but also in uncontested autions|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: and why wouldnt he? |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: Some might have acted over 2@d with S - either double or 2@h is possible (i think 2@h is preferable between those choices)|pg||
nt|phil: but its quite likely Weinstein will open the E hand 1N and also get to 3N from the other side|pg||
nt|scotty: there is a pretty good case for leading a high heart here.....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|scotty: Or a high spade!|pg||
