mb|p|nt|jtr: The way i play it is 99% forcing as 1@h is unlimited|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see.|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: lol at the Impage :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Useful to have all those @cs concealed|pg||

nt|othered1: In other room west tried a simple raise, perhaps constructive.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: When in, Fayad needs to play A@S .. but Madala has given him impression he could have Kx still left. Always good to put doubt in defenders' minds!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||

nt|athene: oh well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, they said -3 just before I entered the claim. Versace shielded his last couple of cards so I was going out on a limb|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceblue: Muiderberg 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: 6@d needs @hA to be on...|pg||
nt|brolucius: That deal is worthy of another look afterwards. Very instructive that Bocchi established the spades before playing on trumps. |pg||
nt|brgpro: not that bad but hard to reach|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
mb|d!|an|4/5!H|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|andyv:  nicely played|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 more imps to Italy which has climbed to a 27 imp lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  E would like to get into this auction but it will be difficult for him|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: By the way, specs, we have promised David not to comment on England's World Cup result last night. We rarely use the word "howler" during vugraph presentations|pg||
nt|daman: now a @S game for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is transfer|pg||
nt|bagman: This should have been a quiet push :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
mb|r|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Surprised that Bocci pulled it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@ds and 10ish|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: A kib expert on Italian methods tells me XX is @H worries|pg||
nt|bagman: Does anybody know what XX meant?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|iceblue: interesting PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-1, our team is rubbish; you will see that tomorrow against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably the redbl may have been too expensive for him if they made it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, this contract isn't all that elegant|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: i already had my money on England...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: I am told that Iceland has extended its lead by 7 IMPs and 1 IMP on boards 8 and 9.|pg||
nt|jtr: Unusually unpartiotic of you David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am very partiotic and will be cheering them on.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: At least you qualified, unlike Sweden and Norway, who have been strong in the past.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Regarding England, The Times headline said that is one spill the US won't object to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|atabey: no @c lead makes easily. right?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4@c bid may prevent the @c lead|pg||
nt|atabey: yes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: Zorlu is a great friend of Zia :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he denied @H and @s controls..|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|othered1: Good leads against slam, so far.  But it still will make with winning @S guess.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|iceblue: I think W didnt know which was better, 2@S or 3@S, then he desided to PASS|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: East has to calculate whether it is worth rising with the @HQ to get West to draw dummy's last trump.|pg||
nt|atabey: usually zorlu has very good instincts|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR stopped in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||
nt|atabey: but this very hard |pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: I checked the instructions on my various packets of heart pills and they made no mention of taking an extra dose before England world cup matches.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||

nt|vugraphznk: CR made 3NT+ on  11 I am told (thank you kibs)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok A9xx in E but is that likely?|pg||
nt|bagman: In 1NT the defense could have taken 3 hearts and the AK A |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brgpro: X shows 5+m and 4M?|pg||
nt|othered1: 14-16 1N|pg||
nt|hedyg: upgraded 1NT|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brgpro: seems it showed @s |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 27 and 26 IMPs difference is 1 VP too btw Andy :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  W bid 3@S here and N dbld in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Are you slandering my intel?! :P|pg||
nt|daman: not so sure that was best|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|athene: he is prepared to give up his third trump trick to cut down on ruffs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|atabey: they play 15-17 NT. only white against red 14-16. so their 1NT rebid there is 11-13|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey i said : unlikely. i am just looking for a case to play Q@s|pg||
nt|athene: it all comes to the same thing|pg||
nt|daman: he always had 2 more @D tricks    I wonder why he sacrificed one of then|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|tez: hi:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jtr: Of course the entry isnt vital if you play Ax@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: but after @s lead, he will have to take @c finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  S certainly has a problem here with the non-forcing 3@c bid|pg||

nt|brolucius: East new the game was up (no pun intended) and cashed his available tricks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..knew..|pg||
nt|bagman: With better heart spots, South would have bid 3@H, I guess. He might also have done that vulnerable|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  a big pick up for Lebanon... interesting that their pick ups have been when they've been quiet:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: NS don't open 2@D as 18-19 BAL with 5cM?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||

pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||

nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||

nt|bagman: not yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like W is going to finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: East-West play Gazzilli, so 2@H was a limited rebid. (He would rebid 2@C on a stronger hand).|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: 6@D can only be beat by a low @S and a @C return|pg||

pc|s4|nt|bagman: This removes the entry to @DK|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: This opens up a legitimate chance to make this; declarer goes up, picks the trumps with AK and leads a diamond up|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi has certainly made Madala work today:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer knows that W has at most KJ on the top of her clubs and, thus, most of the other high cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  still should lose a @s, @d and 2@c|pg||

pc|h5|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Bocchi only takes out one bidding card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas probably flirting with the Lavazza girls and got distracted|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bagman: Now West needs to go up and attack clubs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: but i don't see why he should find that|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|pg||
