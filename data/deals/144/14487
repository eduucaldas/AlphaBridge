nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||

nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||

mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||
nt|haans: standard bidding in 2nd hand no 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||

nt|rnmalik: can NS make a slam?|pg||
nt|andersk: @C lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||

nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||

nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||

mb|1S|mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
