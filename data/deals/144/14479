nt|mbruun: Hey|pg||
mb|1N|mb|4D|nt|atabey: board 1 was a push. after a 1@s opening|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D opening by EW, would show a strongish balanced hand.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand for N/S ... actually 6@C is a good contract, but it might not make|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have a web site for these trials? |pg||
nt|mbruun: 6 D on a clubfinesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: or this tourney |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 18-19 balanced yes|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: I wouldn't consider it with Jxx and Qxxx M anyway, even if I could open weak 2, would you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine there being a banner on www.eurobridge.org|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The URL is in my profile as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 6@C, if you can avoid the heart lead, you can even lose the club finesse and maybe make.  As it turns out, there are other issues involved|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||
nt|mbruun: 4 NT should suggest 6-4 here, while 5C is 5-5|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Vugraphznk: NS seem to be a tad agitated...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 9 tricks not imemdiately visible|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Greenwood|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hoi Bas|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like a normal 3rd seat 1 @d opening to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Bas |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If I'm gonna open west's hand, I'd like to bid 2@D.  But that's a big if.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||
mb|d|nt|jtr: 2@s shwoing a minimum hand with @ss and @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: showing|pg||
nt|boz_: ala fantunes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Looks like 9 tricks or so with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|atabey: zorlu will have to guess @hs|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jtr: problems|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||

nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: Again, open room reached the same contract after a different auction.   Good efforts to stop at 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think he might indeed take the club finesse now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: @c ruff, draw trumps and run 9@H worked|pg||
nt|athene: with the spades wide open declarer can't get cute|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: West ruffed one of dummy's top hearts (on Board 1). Declarer had only one discard on the 13th heart - for his losing club - and could not afford to ruff the diamond loser with ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: dummy's bare @SK because West would then score the @SQ.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: just cash your winners|pg||
pc|dT|nt|atabey: played wisely. could be complications if trumps were 4-2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|brolucius: I expect we will hear what happened somehow...|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||

nt|athene: but hard to know that really from south's point of view|pg||
nt|mbruun: These guys are professionals|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Lithuanians let 5@D play on board 2 - likely afraid of pushing NS into a making slam - but 11 more to Italy |pg||
nt|bjacobs: that would be highly unethical, imo|pg||
nt|mbruun: Just kidding|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Lauria bid and made 3NT on Board 2, where we saw them pick up +120 in 2NT in this room.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NO|pg||
mb|2S|an|*|mb|d|nt|hedyg: there are no live results as yet so pls stop asking us|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||
nt|athene: so double is reasonable|pg||
nt|daman: he chose the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels here,  I michaels on everything |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Include me out, as Sam Goldwyn once said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Final contract 6NT= without @D lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looking at only the N/S hands, you want to be in 6@C ... go figure|pg||

nt|iceblue: This is the last round|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is just the price you pay for inverted minors.|pg||
nt|athene: competing to 3 over 3 would be very wrong if north had fewer clubs|pg||
nt|athene: another 2@D opener - if he is given the chance|pg||

nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I would usually defer to him:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South scored a club overruff to defeat 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=good raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: harfouche tries to make up for board 5. Sadly, this isnt the layout to do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Then a @d ruff for 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: Was east's double simply negative or was it specific to @S?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brgpro: he didnt show his @s at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Cashout for an OT here? @SJxx is fortunate :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Communications a little awkward here|pg||
nt|jtr: But clearing the @ss seems right as you say|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday there was a similar auction where several Italian kibs claimed they don't play Puppet over 2@D openings|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: i think it showed 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This one is not too trivial to play at all|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tez: nice lead|pg||
nt|daman: double partscore swing for Serbia on Board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  quite a lead|pg||

pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I see|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||
nt|brolucius: Win with the @HA, clear the spades (if there is a loser) and the defenders would then have to play a club to give you any entry problem.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think the whole hand gets down to the first point - you are going to need @HQ to drop doubleton|pg||
nt|mbruun: Two clublosers as expected|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  I wouldn't|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  sometimes the opps have their bids|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: lauria can afford the spade finesse now|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|brgpro: i dont know their style, but lauria-versace will bid 2@d, showing 6+@h|pg||
nt|jtr: X shows 4+@hs suually as an extension of transfer responses|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you dbl and take the same tricks, it's 14 imps... but, if you warn declarer of the suit break and it goes down only 1 (8 imps) or makes 14 imps against you... not a good return for your dbl|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: quite right|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW making 8 tricks in 5@C?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS *can* pick up 800 off this|pg||
nt|andyv:  it appears so|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ..but south's is a hand that lookes right to declare, not defend|pg||

nt|andyv:  N should respect the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 7@h/7@s ok but how?|pg||
nt|daman: this should fail on a @C lead|pg||
mb|2N|an|Forcing|nt|brgpro: well, i would think X shows 5+@h...other wise we cant explain the 2@h bid from S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks suspiciously natural, that 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Currently conversion to IMPs would mean a 25-1 victory to Italy|pg||
nt|sybarra: protecting the aqxx of @H and the K's |pg||
nt|mdgraham: England could have done with that against Slovenia in the footy yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: You can look back at it later. Declarer led towards his club honor, hoping to find the ace on his right.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brgpro: well, he has 4@s as well,....so, opps can't have a cheap contract here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|iceblue: How do you think about this 3@C? Jack|pg||
nt|atabey: would be a good auction if K of @h was offside with a @d lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H over 2@H would show a stronger hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nightmare time for EW, for sure, these few boards|pg||
nt|mbruun: Looks like a quick push|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did hold a singleton heart, in fact, but chose not to cue-bid it because of the general minimum nature of his hand.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT asking, 3NT= 15+ 5-2-4-2 or 5-3-4-1|pg||

mb|1S|nt|iceblue: Muiderberg 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: 6@d needs @hA to be on...|pg||
nt|brolucius: That deal is worthy of another look afterwards. Very instructive that Bocchi established the spades before playing on trumps. |pg||
nt|brgpro: not that bad but hard to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: German term|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|h3|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||

nt|athene: this was west's 4@S, i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As a passed hand, I think you are worth 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D also possible, but the spades look good|pg||
nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, they are solid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would 1 @S  but my better suit is @D's here |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: No one likes a 4333 except for when the opps have one|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Regarding England, The Times headline said that is one spill the US won't object to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|mbruun: Can you make 2 Sp?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, if South covers @S9 with @SJ ("cover an honour with an honour") how does declarer make it?|pg||

nt|atabey: usually zorlu has very good instincts|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||

nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|atabey: they play 15-17 NT. only white against red 14-16. so their 1NT rebid there is 11-13|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||

nt|daman: 7 more for Serbia|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: Yes kibs, I know I should pay attention and that's why I do... if you really want to know: a TD came in and had an urgent question|pg||
nt|daman: up by 29 with 7 to play|pg||
nt|andyv:  12 tricks there with J@d falling|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 13 deals played in under the hour. If only all the players on BBO were so swift.|pg||

mb|2C|an|Gazzili|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sp K is huge, but still 1 NT is stretchy|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets assume he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, 6@s is also there|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|bagman: Declarer should play for the drop in diamonds but people do finesse sometimes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl here could be devastating to declarer|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|bagman: This should go !A 4x diamonds and a club for easy make|pg||
nt|andyv:  let's see how W plays it|pg||
nt|bagman: It could go @HA, @DA, @C, @HK, @CQ and diamond finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush yet, but soon ....|pg||
nt|mbruun: May be difficult for defense to grab their heart tricks but seems like the only chance looking at dummy, when they can count nine tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|jtr: Maybe a pass of 2NT was the wisest action|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: spad to the six?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good play by Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hiding his @SK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wouldn't like to be in South's shoes here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure South does either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, especially if she is wearing high heels|pg||
nt|mbruun: Would you return the 5 or the 6 of hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There are a number of clues, but that's all they are ... clues|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 5, playing 2/4|pg||
nt|mbruun: Its almost impossible for him after East has shown 5cH|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is very difficult; remember that East bid hearts|pg||
nt|mbruun: I beated you in typing Roland 1-197 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|bagman: The moment of truth|pg||
nt|bagman: not yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like W is going to finesse|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|brolucius: East-West play Gazzilli, so 2@H was a limited rebid. (He would rebid 2@C on a stronger hand).|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North might have three diamonds to cash|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: 6@D can only be beat by a low @S and a @C return|pg||
nt|daman: 10 more for Serbia|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Any @S lead will do, unless you play Lavinthal leads, haha|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you wrote "him", so it doesn't count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: alas|pg||

nt|bjacobs: So let's all take notice of that clever clever play by Sementa ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes longer to type "her"|pg||
nt|mbruun: Declarer would probably have ducked the second diamond with JX in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because the keys are further apart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why? It's the same number of letters|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Either West hasnt go a 3@c bid or East a 4@h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||

nt|brgpro: anyone is interested to talk about table tennis?:)|pg||

mb|5S|nt|athene: i don't see much chance of declarer getting his hearts away on spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun: If partner has the fifth diamond 7 is cold. Difficult to investigate|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  so, 12 more imps for Italy|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not a very good game to hope to slip through when facing Italy.|pg||

nt|mbruun: 430|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Excellent - the Lithuanians bid the spade slam  |pg||

pc|c6|nt|jtr: Is this the right board?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent bridge, many redoubles|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would want to bid one of my majors here but seems to be a mix up?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: This is likely to go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c overcall by W might not be a favorite by all|pg||
nt|bagman: Requires something like @DA and diamond and then heart finesse to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will have this hand to discuss at length later as well|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bagman: This removes the entry to @DK|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: This opens up a legitimate chance to make this; declarer goes up, picks the trumps with AK and leads a diamond up|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi has certainly made Madala work today:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer knows that W has at most KJ on the top of her clubs and, thus, most of the other high cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  still should lose a @s, @d and 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: spade and diamond both right  - AND he avoided the club lead ..but 3-1 trumps will still prove insurmountable, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is: "pass is for penalties if the passer is sitting OVER the suit bid - it is neutral if sitting UNDER the suit bid"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: 2@s transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s standard relay I thk. with a very weak hand they bid 2@h|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Oops|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: It was a 2NT opener :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was opened (20-22 on their card).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing for Lithuania is that 1@DXX is not game, so no bonus|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: not trivial for declarer here at all|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jtr: half of what he bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: other room didnt have the 2@d at their disposal|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brgpro: aha, that explains it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Bocchi only takes out one bidding card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas probably flirting with the Lavazza girls and got distracted|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bagman: Now West needs to go up and attack clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: but i don't see why he should find that|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: interesting he didn't unblock the spade - now a club return is very bad surely|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

mc|8|nt|Walddk2: Scoring up: "We have 430" .... "How did you make an overtrick in 3NT"?|pg||

nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||

nt|hedyg: he was probably looking for a slam opposite AK@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was explained to Duboin as natural|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Hmmm Not really|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could be worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: If the E hand could be my average, I'd sign up|pg||

nt|hedyg: if S had bid 3@h (splinter) then maybe......|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. It's been pretty unavailing for the Lithuanians, I'm afraid|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us in a most entertaining set of boards... the bridge may not have been perfect but there was a lot of excitement.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm with you on that one Andy|pg||

nt|bagman: Probably an easy hand to end the set. Declarer can make 11 tricks in hearts without a diamond lead and 10 with |pg||
nt|m_niemi: sry, priv|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If we knew what that meant, we'd probably agree |pg||

nt|andyv:  re:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, sure, partnership bidding is the key to being successful at bridge :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How did I go?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: thanks to our outstanding operator in Ostend,Bas van Beijsterveldt  !to my excellent fellow commentators Ed Shapiro, Tezcan Sen and Yalcin Atabey  for donating their time and ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: lol, wb|pg||
nt|andyv:  1600 viewers here... thanks to all the specs for joining us and helping us with their comments and questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy bidding followed by easy play, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: thanks to Bill Frisby and Tezcan Sen for their analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Be advised: we're starting one hour earlier tomorrow, 9:30 AM local time and 8:30 AM London|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jtr: Having already shown a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems hard to believe that GIB thinks 4@S can make, but there it is|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||
