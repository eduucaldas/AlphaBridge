nt|april7: S might open in 3d|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Peter Lund and Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting that the same players seem to be facing off set after set.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: board  1 should be a major  fight  @h agains @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The layout isn't friendly for N-S in a heart contract. On a good day you make game|pg||
nt|stewball: 3nt better than 4 @s here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jbgood: hmm....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not board 1 then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they on 2 or 3 maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: re hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@h doubled is par|pg||
nt|april7: partscore of 3@C by NS|pg||
nt|pelu: the players are soonback after only 5 minbreak - I exp 15-10 min - well done by players (and TDs)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder why Fantoni didnt open 2 @s - isnt that according to system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: is any bid here going to be natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|blum1956: surprisingly enough N's hand does not qualigy for the opening bid (1@s is forsing, 2@s being probably not for that kind of shape?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think there is any making game for N/S|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@s should be 10-13 unbalanced with 5+ spades - dosnt that fit?|pg||
nt|blum1956: clearly the biddin is not correctly sent|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 1@h opening and no support from W?|pg||
nt|jbgood: or they play something else than we see? (wrong download?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 commentators and no one knows what is going on|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is normal, Mike:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries, I am in touch with Gianluca Frola from the FIGB|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is looking into it|pg||
nt|ady: north opening a mute point|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: some  action required with South's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not an unreasonable game when you are 25 IMPs behind with 16 boards to go|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but n/s dont have to be in game|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the basic system of n/s?|pg||
nt|deltadash: they may not get past 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Quiet start to the day, a straightforward 4@H. Cards well placed|pg||
nt|april7: now NS might reach an unmakable game|pg||
nt|flash: hello, all - a most impressive display be Angelini|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: presumeably 2@H   shows hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mule?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Nunes adopts what we cal the staircase strategy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf  for the Fantunes convention card|pg||
nt|flash: by...   and some hands worth writing up   :)|pg||
nt|stewball: going to be hard to manage|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: can someone please explain the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: q2N seems odd why not redouble for rescue what if pard had 3 spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh sorry that explains|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has a chance without a @s lead. Declarer can knock out @hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: now an invite or the classic punt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rinaldi will obviously accept an invite|pg||
mb|3C|nt|flash: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf   for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 9-losers hands should not strain to open, especially when you don;t even get to name a suit you would like to see led|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is important to buy the contract on that kind of board whatever the level is|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Garbosi cannot be fouled and Nunes will have to bid  par contract as Michael pointed earlier|pg||
nt|blum1956: keypoint...|pg||
nt|april7: now 3@C by N and pass by S|pg||
nt|tomi2: i cant imagine anybody passing a partscore here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|flash: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|flash: for N-S|pg||
nt|stewball: this may be forcing in @s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: well so so far David ur prediction was correct N/S will not make 3N because they arent in it !!|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, hearts plus minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: D six growing up fast|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 4 cl  is advance cuebid  shows  heart supp |pg||
nt|othered1: I think 2@C was game forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is GF and they wil game, thas why they play bridge|pg||
nt|april7: should they play "weak" openings then 3@C by S is passableor also 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: are we in a Gazilli auction?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Jim|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: my understanding of these proceedings is comparable to my understanding of Italian...|pg||
nt|jbgood: Cero|pg||
nt|flash: hi, Ralf|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We can all see that the cards on our screen do not match the hand they are playing|pg||
nt|jbgood: as Flash says: the board displayed is, indeed, Board 1 - it matches the auction which was displayed last time; as Roland indicated, this auction goes with another board...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they are playing board 2 or 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same problem in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: So Roland, we just wait and see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 has been redealt, that's why|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not inclined to go into detail|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: South kow s 1 he has only 2 defensive tricks 2  he cannot be expensive in 6 @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: even thing of redoubling !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Thinks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
nt|deltadash: obviously it's PUSH time|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - good morning from Copenhagen|pg||
nt|tokay1975: they may land in 5h  making  still|pg||
nt|tomi2: this auction can not be non forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: Helness-Helgemo in 3Nt - @s3 lead|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not sure I understand why you must get to game with 12-11 both balanced|pg||
nt|tomi2: opener+opener = game, once north has opened 1@C he has to live with the consequences|pg||
nt|othered1: Convention card says 2@C is GF, balanced or @C  support|pg||
nt|tomi2: either +400 or -nx50|pg||
nt|Walddk3: At least they have right-sided notrump |pg||
nt|Walddk3: But it may not be enough|pg||
nt|april7: S must steal a @D trick if @S are led|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The trouble is that these guys have played before|pg||
nt|othered1: How many partnerships that open junk have adjusted their response structure accordingly?  I haven't seen many, they just pay off to occasional overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not fair, really|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an easy lead for Duboin|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but in the other room i expect the same to happen|pg||
nt|tomi2: bidding by bocchi somehow suggests 3145, so south might think of 5@C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: It looks like Allegra has somthing to work with|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told that breaking news about this match is on  www.bridgetopcis.com |pg||
nt|flash: i haven't had a chance to look, but...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: club switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 down; even Fantoni can play this fast :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes! well done by both sides up to this moment. Still E needed to avoid the diamond lead which was easy enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either @DA is onside or it's not|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: end play in  @d Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 5@C is just dead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: This really isn't a good display of their system|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: One goes away on a spade, so not sure which endplay|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
nt|april7: why must N open?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Give Bocchi @SA instead of KJ and slam would have made. Goes to show how the 4321 scale is flawed. A = 4, KJ = 4|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction - even if it gives away a trump trick, it usually comes back |pg||
nt|lestergold: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW 5cM. 4cD, 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa has those nice clubs in dummy he has no way of enjoying|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown's Law:  the lower the level of the doubled partial, the faster the trump lead...   :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East had really better take his heart ruff while he can |pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may well diagnose the bad breaks now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Losing 2 diamonds when the ace is off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi, sorry I'm late|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: Hi|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @d  ace is obviously off side considering East final double|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|tomi2: because he has an opener|pg||
nt|april7: to many losers|pg||
nt|pelu: by system they open 11+, so..|pg||
nt|april7: then N must open!:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 11 with a 5 card suit headed by an honoer and intermediates, no point in the doubleton|pg||
nt|pelu: sometimes u end up in bad games - and just get a flat board - u opp are also in game :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|flash: www.bridgetopics.com   looked like a typo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio played always strong club - now they chenged the system, seeing the open of 1@C by Failla|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown was one of the early electees to Canada's Hall of Fame |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ace rather than small would win when S has stiff king, but risk is blocking the suit and having heart entry knocked out before clubs can get untangled|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|pelu: the slam still need only 1 @c-loser|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lebridgeur: sorry not well waked up forgot ace of @s discard:(|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|Walddk3: Helgemo just took his 8 top tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|blum1956: @dA may be singleton offside (just exchange most of minor suit cards between EW)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sure|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500 which wouldnt have been tragic if n/s could make 3n |pg||
nt|Walddk3: He did not even try to lead a diamond up|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: E trying to save a trick if W has KJxxx of spades, as a club here would endplay him|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2: i would expect 75% of the top 50 pairs in the world to be in 3nt on that one|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jbgood: good morning|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|pc|dT|pg||

nt|ady: lead change   asit might regularly in such a close match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here we go|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Sabine :) i think, instead, will be a great match (also if after dinner) :)|pg||
nt|april7: but perhaps if S should open in 3d|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry, you can't divide 50 by 4 :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: quiet partial to start|pg||
nt|kit: South has strength for 1NT overcall, but with that flat hand there is danger of going for a number if West has the balance of strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 was a 7-IMP swing to Allegra as we see on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Straightforward 3NT to bid - anything but straightforward to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: E-W don't have a weak 2-bid in the Majors available|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: 20-20 again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but this time E really DOES have an opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final the score is  Angelini 144 - 83 Varese|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|kit: Still, if he passes he will just be guessing later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C apparently for majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@C no doubt promises both majors|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  some sort of stayman?|pg||
nt|flash: so we'll have a different auction than in the Closed Room|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: east has a better opening than north had last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: all cards favourable for EW on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: soouth has found best lead giving bowt away|pg||
nt|ady: best lead     nothing given|pg||
nt|flash: sorry - Duboin-Sementa E-W in the Open Room|pg||
nt|stewball: best to avoid stayman when the trumps are 5/0|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|blum1956: happy 3NT for NS - will Fantoni-Nunes bid it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morning Jon|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is usually right against this auction|pg||
nt|april7: another weak hand which must be opened,but this time there is a slam in @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: OR in 6@S by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Angelini has three Norwegians in the team, Helness, Helgemo and Brogeland .... but no longer Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|jcmax: There are two common treatments really when partner has opened 1 of a minor and the opponents overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: no half measures with north|pg||
nt|kit: 3NTjust plain an overbid -- I don't see any reason for it unless more expected from 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|jcmax: 1) always 2 of the same minor shows both majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K9x in @H and K1065 in majors are good cards after the INFORMATION - typical by Bocchi to understand the situation at the table|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks made in OR  playing in one|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2) always 2 of the other minor shows both majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: and 3) always 2 @C shows both majors .)|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told that a protest has been filed concerning the make-up of the Angelini team|pg||
nt|flash: there are 3 Norwegians playing and the rules may limit the number of foreign players to 2|pg||
nt|pelu: o tx - I am commentator|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D can be 22-24 balanced|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: EW, with very high requirements for an opening 1-suit, open 1N, 12-14 on some off-shape hands.  5-4 OK, if not both majors, as are at least some 4-4-4-1s.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Easier to remember|pg||
nt|kit: I wonger why West led 9 -- seems like might waste an important spot with little upside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you would have if RHO had opened 1NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tomi2: 1100?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This is not cheap|pg||
nt|pelu: 1100 is ok against 1430|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1100 yes, so still a gain for Angelini|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shall we guess on -300?|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer does have some real chances here, and he knows pretty much where all the cards are from the bidding which is helpful|pg||
nt|stewball: dont you hate it when your singleton is the 2|pg||
nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|stewball: and the udca crowd chips in...|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N was a transfer to @D, used on many kinds of hands.|pg||
nt|stewball: this is far from obvious|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|othered1: East doesn't have a real handle on where are the high cards, since west has only shown @D length.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: will try for J@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without the overcall at 2@C probably pass by North|pg||
nt|ady: double part score swing to Allegra hand 1  so if they make this  will be off to a great start|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Madala, knowing A in @S in West can play seeing all honors|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmmm, it seems to me that would be a big discrepancy. Pass or 3NT. surely there is also something in between.|pg||
nt|kit: Best for declarer now is probably to lead diamond to jack, then queen of clubs from hand -- if East takes it, declarer has dummy entry for black winners|pg||
nt|ady: was 1@D    1NT passed out in OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Peter! Nice to see you:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|deltadash: sounds right to me :)|pg||
nt|kit: There might not be something in between after the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Staymanish auction may steer helgemo away from the heart lead|pg||
nt|othered1: With the @HK coming down, you can't beat this, anyway.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: didnt|pg||
nt|ady: tht would finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who say you should double a 2NT opener if it goes pass-pass|pg||
nt|ady: passive diamond looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all say that but no-one does|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa wants to retaion all his endplay options here hoping that defenders will be forced to give him his 8th trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: south best tho to continue as he started |pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, it's easy to be brave on paper|pg||
nt|ady: may well be   if he cashes all diamonds and then Q@S and 10@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: best for east to conceal his hand very difficult for defenders this way|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: then @SJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yep, with dummy showing 4@H (I assume puppet), the heart lead is unappetizing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: we can see that anything bit a diamond now is fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or at least -200|pg||
nt|kit: so far so good -- now queen of clubs|pg||
nt|flash: same contract in the Open Room, but having opened 2@S, Sementa led the @DQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcmax: I was referring to if W had passed 1NT. surely most top pairs have a method then to express a hand that cannot force to game, but may be interested.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Funnily enough E-W never found their heart fit in the other room, because Helgemo had a systemic 1@H opening|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: 8@H ?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he would have been better "cashing" queen of clubs before squandering this exit|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like East has to pitch a club here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: well -2 i think is more likely|pg||
nt|kit: yes, 8@H does look like the right play -- surrounding the 7.  Veru unusual card combination|pg||
nt|jcmax: W is in a very awkward position now. Not an easy switch. Everything helps declarer except one card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If anyone can, Helgi can|pg||
nt|jcmax: But Helgemo has incredible imagination at the bridge table. he sees positions, nobody else has even heard of before!|pg||
nt|kit: He should have a pretty good idea about the distribution from East's discards and the line of play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: needs to play king|pg||
nt|jcmax: With the @H J he has chosen to play on the psychological chance of declarer misguessing the @H-layout.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But does he know who has the 10?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He doesn't|pg||
nt|kit: he certainly will find that -- and from long thought about shift, he will deduce where 10 of hearts is|pg||
nt|ady: no    easier seeing all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great hand|pg||
nt|kit: it sure is|pg||
nt|jcmax: There is a good chance that declarer will guess W doesn't have the @H10.  with the @H10 the switch would have come faster.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree with Sabine|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with J10 in @H the return would be faster|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays king  east  return a low diamond?|pg||
nt|kit: the point about the speed of the shift is a good one.  Even at the highest levels, inferences can be drawn from more than just the cards played.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Also with the the JT w might have switched to the 10 instead. or alternatively after the long pause to a low one!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So when you have J10 you should tank before leading the jack when you see the 9 in dummy?|pg||
nt|kit: not for deceptive purposes -- that would be against the rules|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer draws his own inferences at his own risk -- but here he might well get it right|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR: lead @H to 9, and @HK to A|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: not many tricks for the defense - missed game?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: Also, simply on restricted choice -- from J10 might have led either|pg||
nt|pelu: hi Ralf - it was a "privat" comment - invitation for a team match :)|pg||
nt|flash: Boye Brogeland is partnering Angelini|pg||
nt|flash: we've mostly seen the 'heavyweights' slugging it out|pg||
nt|pelu: decl can endplay East to give him the 8. trick on @sQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: and then a @D from Comella from the K = easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That @HK is a nice try ... and with @H8 falling, it might just be enough to bring the contract home|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: Semneta hasa  legendary reputation for his card play|pg||
nt|kit: now the expected duck of queen of clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm being told that small @C at trick 2 would have beaten this after @D return.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: not an auspicious start for the trailing team|pg||
mc|10|nt|pelu: still only 8 tricks : 2@s+2@h+3@c+1@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: 12-14, a max hand really'|pg||

nt|marlowepi: nice 2H opener here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: helps protect spade queen on defense too|pg||

nt|jbgood: very difficult|pg||
nt|blum1956: 24|pg||

nt|lestergold: only 9 well forgive him roland!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Giusy?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the NT range, Giusy?|pg||
nt|jcmax: I think it would have made. e would have had no good return|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, how do you want Helness to defend from there?|pg||
nt|april7: not necessarily|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H |pg||
nt|flash: 21-22 BAL; Puppet Stayman and Xfers|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks as far I can see. N has length in @s as well as @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in @h of course|pg||
nt|pelu: if u are in 6@H u need the the hand with 4 card ! also have 3@hs|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 card @s|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: looks likely for n/s to play 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D multi - possible weaker that 2@H or 2@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: I was referring to ady's comment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree with Sabine|pg||
nt|othered1: Correct analysis:  then you pitch last @C and ruff @D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this looks a routine 3nt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: still very difficult after opps open 1 NT |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H how?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades, 5 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|kit: That was my conclusion also -- that would have made after king of hearts play|pg||
nt|april7: the 12th  trick is missing |pg||
nt|flash: Duboin-Sementa are on their way to slam|pg||
nt|pfbr: @H@H@H! Happy Birthday Roland @H@H@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe an upgraded 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Safe to win and take a @s finess|pg||
nt|ady: return low diamond   then duck Q@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @c for majors  NS make 3 @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile this looks like a coffee brek hand|pg||
nt|pelu: Helgemo in 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: all roads lead to at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: i could use some help with this sequence - both Easts followed the Xfer with a 3@S call...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like a relay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a trial instead of 3nt |pg||
nt|flash: from the explanation of the 4@C call which followed in the Open Room, it appears to ask about @H length and show at least a slam try|pg||
nt|flash: this would allow West to rebid 3NT with a doubleton @H|pg||
nt|othered1: A somewhat light opening by north|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: certainly not likkely to produce the excitement of the last hand|pg||
nt|pelu: a Roland-slam - make on @C-finess + @HA in East|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like if you can get a couple of @C ruffs it's there and that may depend on opening lead.|pg||
nt|april7: I dout that he will make if defence doesn't slip|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The difference is that 3nt is an alternative to 4@h (2- or 3-card suppport) and 3@s will ask for more information|pg||
nt|flash: for those not playing these methods, East might have to rebid 4@D to show the pattern and go past 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and this is the negative answer in my opinion|pg||
nt|pelu: why not a cue in 4@C?|pg||
nt|vincenzo1: 3@S is like a transfer for 3NT (I think that 3NT from Fulvio shows 4 Spades)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Peter. do you see the bidding like me?|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|pelu: yes Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Ed|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Vincenzo...    there's only so much we can get from the convention cards and notes   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: dbl by Failla can bid a very strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: Funny how often low from KQ9xx is right rather than a top one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: Could the light opening be a consequence of what happened on the previous board?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you will be endplayed a second later|pg||
nt|kit: right Roland|pg||
nt|ady: what does declarer do?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or @HQ in East ... but in true Roland style, East has both, so no misguess is possible|pg||
nt|pelu: the Roland-rule : if makes = a god slam :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: lucky slam 2-2 cards right|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure lucky - but still easy make :)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS also in 3NT in OR - as expected|pg||
nt|othered1: What was the lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wow - missing the @C cue??|pg||
nt|flash: so 4@H shows at least 3-card support, but, as our commentators have suggested seems not to do justice to the hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Kit|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead vand ducck first @H from table|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that all bids after 1@S = alert :)|pg||
nt|othered1: @DJ, I'm told |pg||
nt|tomi2: btw, connected to this match there is a lot of politiscs going on... Lauria-Versace who had been on the Angelini Team for decades left the team for several reasons. They build up a ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: new team with a French sponsor (Zaleski). So Angelini has hired Hlness-Helgemo and additionaly Brogeland from Norway to play in his team. Now their opps from the semifinal ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: complain, that the contitions of contest allow only 2 foreign players to play in a team. Does anybody have more information...?|pg||
nt|pelu: cold with @Ds 4-2, so bad luck to to down|pg||
nt|othered1: How good is 6@H?|pg||
nt|stewball: @d @d @s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: even with that favourable lead E may find it hard to come to nine|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S is in my view misguided. hoping to stay low is false economy, because bidding spades may be the MOST likely way to get N excited|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: overboard   2 off|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: with 3@H give a hand very strong|pg||
nt|kit: or does dummy get squeezed at a critical juncture?|pg||
nt|flash: for those puzzled by the delays before the bids appear, our operator enters the North and East bids only after East has called|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and it´s also only a @d lead, which can create problems|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like8 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may be a realy bid in this sequence|pg||
nt|othered1: Fact is, on NS cards, t his is a slam that should be bid.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: 3@S means a very weak hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent to land on feet after 2S|pg||
nt|kit: very complicated|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is correct, counting over 5@C|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d from W hand had a chance unlike 5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: relay :)|pg||
nt|april7: ofcourse you mustbe in 6,but unfortunate distribution|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tomi2: reminds me of some football matches back in the 90's that were ruled in favor to the losing team because of 4 non- european players playing... Norway is not an EU member, that ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: might affect the whole thing, since the "Bosman" rules should also applay for Bridge and they are (as far as I know) only for members of the EU|pg||
pc|s8|nt|othered1: with @S break and @H break, no?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: another good board for 4th highest of longest and strongest|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Geoffrey - a small @h|pg||
nt|ady: I dont think it makes|pg||
nt|flash: so North would have Passed in tempo and East taken time to consider the auction; nothing nefarious afoot|pg||
nt|pelu: exelent for Roland (making) - but I am not so good in calculations - @H3-2 + @S 4-3 and even worse om a @D-lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on a @d lead less than 40% but otherwise more than 50% roughly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: Best chance is to first play on @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: Why did Duboin not overcalled 1@d? It could be useful sometimes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: make 3Nt also with Qxxx xxx Jxx xxx at the partner|pg||
nt|jcmax: thinking is not knowing :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: no reason to pick the heart push thus|pg||
nt|kit: Now whichever hand gets forced, declarer can arrange the entries to draw trumps from the other hand and then run the hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: The play : What can East discard when decl play 3x@S? squeezed in 3 suits!|pg||
nt|pelu: @c9 in S!|pg||
nt|othered1: East gets squeezed without the count on 3 trumps and can't find comfortable discards with south's @C9 being a threat, too|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Exactly what happened at the other table|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant cost to play a club to start with and tghen see what happens|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes, that is what I ment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If E had one more D and one less round card, 6C would be on after normal defense|pg||
nt|deltadash: wonder how many years that has been 'the lead'?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next time declarer has AJ opposite 10x and everyone asks: why did he not lead a top heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: pl - can u tell me: what is 2@s?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: controls?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blum1956: now the diamond discard looked safe|pg||
nt|kit: Might have been right to just bid 3NT after partner bids 2@S, with 8 top tricks, 4-4 spade fit might be worse anyway|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one down surely|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, will always be West hand forced|pg||
nt|pelu: acc S set up a @H-tricks - @H to K and smal to !A|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3@h by Failla take the chance to find the slam in @C, so i agree with that bid|pg||

nt|roswolf: now if a low heart is found against 3nt in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C can be 18-19 balanced|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did we make a simulation? What works best in the long run from KQxxx and KQxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normal result, the 4-1 trump break dooms 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Matter of style whether or not to overcall on North hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 NT here looks more promising|pg||

mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be balanced hand|pg||
nt|kit: South has difficult problem, with no suit to Q-bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C natural (normal in Italy against 1@C with only 2@c)|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps it is right to play that a bid of the other minor is a Q here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes and for 9 tricks you have to take the correct finess|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S doomed |pg||
nt|othered1: Slam here is on little more than @H finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: But I don t expect them to get close to it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a much easier 3n here for E/W|pg||
nt|ady: might get too high|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: just playing it as forcing is likely to be good enough, no?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is a good bid - North could have 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: and here a shooting e/w might try a slam|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like that's the path we're on|pg||
nt|pfbr: .|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- bad fit in the clubs couples with 4-1 spade split|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 3 hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: last board 2@c showed both majors - does really 2 @d show even more major cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: well, partner needs to know if it shows diamonds or not|pg||
nt|ady: unless defence slips  3NT has 5 tricks of the top|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 1Nt raise with a top honor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They proceed as if Helness had bid 1@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is the spot here ...and I guess they will probably get there|pg||
nt|othered1: Why wasn't west a 2@S opener?|pg||
nt|april7: slam is again on by a squeeze against W in @S and @C|pg||
nt|othered1: Oh, sorry|pg||
nt|vincenzo: is 10-13|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play constructive 2@S openings|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D is forcing one round|pg||
nt|lestergold: players normally play for the drop if there is no other indicator|pg||
nt|pelu: Nunes could not open - they dont have weak 2-s in major|pg||
nt|othered1: Another, standard for Fantunes, off-shape 1N|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: giving the stop for 3Nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah i see, you mean doing it even with shorter diamonds. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but North nothing in @S ...|pg||
nt|kit: they have pinpointed the spade weakness, so will likely stop in time at 4@C|pg||
nt|tokay1975: antonio has very good cards  against 64 in majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Despite both of them having very un-notrumpy shape|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: exactly Marshall|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: like a support double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which in effect he did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, a spade lead might be problematic|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfect defence against 2H could be quite bloody|pg||
nt|jcmax: !NT could also have been a transfer to @C|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't know what the best tratment is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Treatment even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The one you are comfortable with I suppose|pg||
nt|jcmax: Treatment for what, roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will probably win and play club at trick 2, setting up source of tricks first is usually best technique.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: Good 3@S bid -- if partner has 3 small spades, that might be enough|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is a risk - ask half stop to bid Nt|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead against 4@s gives some chances to the defense|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d on 1@c opening  2@c was after one NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer must be careful|pg||
nt|mr murray: someone better take green card out soon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's not going to happen for a while|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on the fall of @cJ is not so bad|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is certainly the right contract ... |pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it is by no means easy to get to, as East, looking at his hand|pg||
nt|pelu: Buratti-Comella in 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spec is suggesting 4@H ... a Moysian fit only Mrs Moyse could love|pg||
nt|flash: 1@D is still a sound opener, even in 3rd chair|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: as kind kiubs tell me: 2 @c shows 5-4 and 2@d 5-5|pg||
nt|ady: a lucky lay and n/s can make 4@H    but not  in the bidding in both rooms|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: I don't think South will think Jx is enough|pg||
nt|ady: might lead a heart     but will have time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: *kibs|pg||
nt|ady: can get 1 heart discarded from dummy   but still too much to do|pg||
nt|stewball: Helness didnt find the @s at trick 3 on the last brd|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: would need A in @D in South - with this layout E/W make 5 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for Qxx of spades upstairs...but even then likely to need 44 spades in EW hands|pg||
nt|kit: Heart lead wrong only if North has 7 clubs -- but that is quite possible|pg||
nt|blum1956: It proved easy enough to stop the opps from making a vulnerable game |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a push |pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S shifts to @c - many tricks to the defence|pg||
nt|pelu: @C now and down 3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: on the previous hand if a low heart is led Declarer playing the ACE does block the suit but declarers have been known to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|pelu: let see the defense: for sure @HK - if N now will kill dummy with a @d . then 3NT make!|pg||
nt|mr murray: looks like spade beats it. shouldn't make a passive lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blum1956: In both rooms|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: If North had Qxx in spades, North would have bid 3NT -- that is why I don't like South's 3NT call|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well bid, I would sy ... they bid suits 8 times, then 3NT|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tokay1975: i am not sure if 4cl was somekind of turbo  asking aces |pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: West can afford to pitch 2 diamonds, 1 heart, 1 spade.  East must keep all of his spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might not have bid 3S with Qxx of spades and KQJxxx of clubs (and D ace instead)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: What do you like 1NT to be? 1. Extra values - 2. Support for hearts - 3. Clubs    take your pick your favourite partner. As long as you have an agreement all is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double of 1NT that is|pg||
nt|kit: declarer simply playing for 3-2 spade split and 4-3 heart split (so no overruff on third round of hearts)|pg||
nt|ady: yes   home now if spades behave|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: i meant, he might not have bid 3N, sorry|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: This should be easy defense -- they know declarer starts with 8 top tricks, so the necessary assumptions are easy.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: but of course i agree about the 3N call being ill-judged|pg||
nt|kit: Also, declarer shouldn't have king of spades -- with that, would have bid 3NT, not 3@H.|pg||
nt|blum1956: Certainly it is dangerous to double the 1@s opening with Failla's hand, but to pass is also dangerous sometimes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think W never can make with 4-1 in @h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: with diamonds 3-3 declarer is home|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jbgood: he will settle for 9 now I guess|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: wd by Bocchi|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s5|nt|kit: accurate discarding by both defenders|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if East would have 3@S (with Jxx in South), the lead @H help the declarer to make 3Nt (squeeze against West) - he must keep at 6 cards 3@S 2@h so declarer can play @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which certainly strengthens argument for spade lead|pg||
nt|kit: good point Giorgio|pg||

nt|bridge_one: all players are very experienced|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Pass by N a bit surprising|pg||
nt|blum1956: EW just need to discover their spades miscontrol|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this level one expects that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had better not get beyond 4@S here with this trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but they are missing the trump Q so shouldnt bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but 5 is too many|pg||
nt|roswolf: may get to 5@S though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: une bonne défense  à 5 @h ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 4-0 I´m not awake yet (at 17.45!!!)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Come to London my friend, you'll gain an hour|pg||
mb|3N|nt|blum1956: Here the Fantoni-Nunes system works - 2@h instead of 1@h preempts the opponents' spades|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: in 4 @s Imeant against 4 @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South African Texas|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I´ll do Roland!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry, ignore that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this double can help NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the double should sound a warning note|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 4dia is trnsf splinter?  but this  is tooweak |pg||
nt|kit: Normal 2@S contract, rather unlucky to go down|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is really well done by NS in the other room to stop in 2@S. what a disappointment to have to go down!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is takeout of spades. Notmal treatment I would think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: North isn't worth more than a 2@S call I don't think, which KQ of diamonds doubleton|pg||
nt|othered1: Here north eschewed the weak 2, though it's roughly in range|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a low partscore in @H or @c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lebridgeur: right   Michael  easier after 1 :h opening  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that Fantoni already showed 14+ when he opened 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: cautios in both rooms|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: 2S now by E ?|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is quite possible. I still believe many players would consider bidding more than 3@S. so just bidding 2@S seems good judgment to me.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is sufficient - 6 losers are too much |pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: is 2@D forcing here?  Not clear|pg||
nt|ady: hand 19 11 imps to Villa   6NT failing in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like East thinks it is.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by North depending on italian style - |pg||
nt|tokay1975: if that is 10 12 splinter  i thk not easy to stop in 4sp by notrh|pg||
nt|roswolf: that should be finis|pg||

nt|tokay1975: dbl helped them|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think west made a wrong choice by doubling|pg||
nt|stewball: Nunes must have thot that either S was falsecarding or that they play the same from 982 as 98|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: club lead reasonable -- spade lead would also have been reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Subtract some for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|mr murray: sometimes 2/1 has to be violated when misfit|pg||
nt|pelu: 800 in 3@sX|pg||
nt|april7: in 4@H by N, n must duck first trick if @S is lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: Hard to see West doing anything here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding Qx of hearts makes a 2-level preempt a bit more attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: very safe level!!|pg||
nt|flash: i'll leave you in the good hands/voices of Ed, Peter and Ralf|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: 2@C was gazilli so 3@D showed 18+ with @H and @D|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @c was aither natural or 17+|pg||
nt|blum1956: Besides the EW's 10-card fitthe double of 2@c worked better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As a spectator says, you can make 5, but it is unlikely to happen|pg||
nt|kit: There is danger if East continues clubs -- West may wrongly play a third round, not knowing that East's trumpt tricks are natural|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jbgood: *either|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a leadc!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this takes out K@c entry to the second spade trick amongst other things|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D i think isn't forcing (probably they use a kind of roudy (2@C forcing generic)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W clearly though 2D NF|pg||
nt|april7: very expensive 3@S contract|pg||
nt|pelu: 1. D = 3 card @H, 2. X = GF|pg||
nt|othered1: A bit high on two basically flat hands|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blum1956: The unbid suit!|pg||
nt|kit: This seems optimistic -- isn't East expected to have a weak notrump, considering the pass over 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Another example of the flawed 4-3-2-1 scale. A = 4 hcp (contract makes), KJ = also 4 hcp (contract goes down). The ace is seriously underrated in that scale|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: now N can |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbgood: excactly|pg||
nt|jbgood: (sry abaout my spelling)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: scusami, mano 1 3sa per EO |pg||
nt|lestergold: hope east is noth thinking of switching|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It's easy to remember but it does not reflect the true value of the honours|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|kit: West made no such mistake, however|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is worth 16.5 on the KNR|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: if he thought 2D was NF, and EW play support doubles, he may be reading E for a better hand|pg||
nt|ady: poor judgement by west to raise to 3NT after east showed minimum passing the intervention of spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, if that is what P showed|pg||
nt|kit: They have enough stoppers -- just not enough winners.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard 3 @d aon @h and crossruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Duboin would not have ducked that diamond against 5, we will never know|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW did not bid the slam on board 4 in the open room|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe he will escape for 500 only? if i could play like fantoni, I would like to be declarer every board :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: if I would gain IMPS on all boards where i play such ugly 3MX xontracts... ;)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AKQJxx+xxx+KQ+xx|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcmax: Some players might consider bidding 2NT with the N hand. and really. the only realistic game is 3NT. I could make on a good day.|pg||
nt|othered1: As in the previous set, Allegra has jumped out to a lead on the set, closing up the match.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: after 1D-play Fantoni need to play @C to K - then N can be a sort of endplayed on @CQ - but normal play would be to finess after @cQ|pg||
nt|othered1: How many of the top players are point counters on other than flat NT-type hands?|pg||
nt|othered1: My guess, almost none.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|blum1956: If declarer had won the first trick he could endplay West. But now he is 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kit: North ducked first spade so he had better control of things|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing support doubles and E was not sure about 2D, he could have waffled with a heart preference, having denied them of them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: denied three of them|pg||
nt|kit: If he hadn't declarer might have come home with 2 clubs, 4 diamonds, 2 spades, 1 heart if defense not careful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i need to proofread before i hit send:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: perhaps a misunderstand about 2Nt|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: well but any understanding about 2N would be produced by misunderstandings about Pass and/or 2D i think|pg||
nt|kit: 9 of spades suit-preference, showing club strength rather than heart strength|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: is there a position here where west eventually has to provide Nunes with a helicopter back to his 9th trick?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|pelu: but when N did'nt discard a @C East can have some indication of the layout|pg||
nt|pelu: I count before opening a hand - a normal hand in 1. and 2. seat I like 11 and 5 card suot or 12+|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only chance to make from Fantonis position is that N has @dQJ10 and is squeezed |pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Declarer has to trust this card and play a heartup to get out for down 1.|pg||
nt|pelu: now ruff and play a @h|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: 8 tricks even with A@H right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: not like this!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|blum1956: The position ended after Nunes ducked the 1st trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: happens in the best families...|pg||
nt|othered1: now ruff @C and play trumps, but nothing good happens|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and is playing on that chance|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: now he may go down 2|pg||
nt|april7: good play taking the K and now small @C|pg||
nt|tomi2: after the bidding and the @D show out the full layout is clear to Fantoni|pg||
nt|tomi2: south has 5 dias and showed 3 hearts so he had 5 clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Madala has to play a smal @C end then Fantoni in the hot seat|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this was not NS's best defense|pg||
nt|tomi2: then Madala opened the bidding and doubled later, so honors should be kind of located too|pg||
nt|april7: but S could have AQ of @C and feels endplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: Ed where in the defense would u play diff?|pg||
nt|tomi2: then N has not enough points for his double of 2@S, he would simply bid 3@H non invitational|pg||
nt|othered1: I think @H then low @C would have worked, as at that point east didn't have hand double dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pelu: here we go|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: North needs to pitch a heart here -- I think he can work that out.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N also clearly convinced E has a better hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|pelu: strange after the bidding N is favorit to @SK (only 5 HCP in @C and bidding 2-0-1|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: North can assume his partner has either ace of hearts or king of clubs, else declarer has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how a heart pitch could cost whatever the layout.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes and also E would have had a 2N opener|pg||
nt|ady: hand 20  3NT was made in OR for 10 imp swing to Allegra|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is marked with doubleton heart so heart pitch could not cost|pg||

mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: Activity from South!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK; so you count @HQ as a top trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not how I learned to count them|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a number of specs have done so|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will of course lead first spade from dummy, in case North has stiff ace or AJx.|pg||
nt|jcmax: hmmmm. is 3N natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: CC does not go that far|pg||
nt|kit: might depend on what 3@D is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seam natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without cue in @H|pg||
nt|kit: if 3@D is natural, 3NT certainly isn't|pg||
nt|othered1: this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That makes 8 tricks easy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: i feel a 3n coming ion here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C can be a balanced hand about 20 hcp with others type of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is charmed to hear 2C on his right|pg||
nt|jbgood: you like the spade bid?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 5 can be made on any lead  and defense but not percentage   i thk|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Better to have 3nt on E because a @h lead is rather celar from N|pg||
nt|deltadash: friendly hand here, every suit breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT was limit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: clear...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lebridgeur: I am not keen but greeen against red |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: red cards flying across the table|pg||
nt|deltadash: or well placed :)|pg||
nt|pelu: a!§D-lead could defeat 3@H - in OR @c-lead and a @D loser on @cs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks after this lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did not learn to look at the opponents cards either|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks 500ish.|pg||
nt|stewball: i would not bet against Nunes making 3nt had he bid it|pg||
nt|stewball: the pace reflects the score.....|pg||
nt|othered1: Things, lie relatively well.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: 2NT bal 20:-|pg||
nt|ady: this booked for down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard for N to pass 2C.... :):)|pg||
nt|kit: difficult lead for West|pg||
nt|lestergold: top tricks are what actually cash had @ds not broken there would have been less|pg||
nt|othered1: What was the 2N response?  Looks weird, since it could misposition NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 15 is logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't look at all 4 hands, do you Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i look out of the window like i did at school and got whacked all the time |pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H making in OR in Board 21|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H makable on guessing the @H position and no @D lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: last making spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3NT from S makes probably as East is squeezed for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probability about it 3 rounds of heart a spade swirch then east has to find 4 discards on the clubs and is mullered|pg||
nt|blum1956: But that was not clear for Nunes in the course of bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT might have made on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he can come to 9 tricks in time?|pg||
nt|jcmax: At this vulnerability some players might fancy a 3@H bid with the N hand over 2NT, just for the lead. But that would also depend on whether 2NT was GF or just inv+. it's more ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: dangerous to bid when it is invitaional+.|pg||
nt|kit: I am told that 3@D is natural, 3NT is not -- just shows no single suit|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H looks really aggressive nonvul, to my eyes|pg||
nt|pelu: the winning lead - for declayer|pg||
nt|othered1: Since 1@C isn't very meaningful, it's difficult to charge east's lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: North needs a way to show a diamond suit, and South needs a way to find out how good they are  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Kit, i think 2Nt raise without singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: same bidding to 3@h in OR|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: Very well thought out choice IMO|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 18 was more interesting than many of us thought. In the mid-game with 5 tricks in the bag and a spade came back from Helgemo, Madala could have made it when he won @SA ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (correctly) if he had exited with a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo must get out with a heart to dummy's jack (Helness pitches a low diamond), Now declarer takes a losing diamond finesse and a forced suicide squeeze materialises. Perforce, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo must exit in diamonds and the squuezes Helness in the black suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cute|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Try to go through the play in MOVIE|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after Madala wins @SA|pg||
nt|othered1: This will be 5 to Angelini.|pg||
nt|othered1: not meaningful as to @C holding|pg||
nt|othered1: It was painfully slow when Angelini was ahead by dozens.|pg||
nt|stewball: do they have time clocks in Europe?|pg||
nt|stewball: Madaal is hating the whole thing|pg||
nt|stewball: Madala|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they kick in when it runs slower than 15 minutes a board :)|pg||
nt|stewball: maybe Madala is attemping the sominex coup|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@c looked better than 6@s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: suggested 2N was a control-showing response, but that seems odd due to potential positioning on a flatish hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, 2@C-3@c (+ve in @d)-3@D (how good)- some step response to show all three top honours|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: so 11 out, and deservedly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course there are tose who would say that a grand which depends on a 3/2 break should not be bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the results merchants and in thiscase teammates wont be happy|pg||
nt|blum1956: It does not - only 4 diamonds with East |pg||
nt|april7: I don't think that anybody could guess the @H here|pg||
nt|othered1: Try @C now, since east likely can't get in?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|blum1956: too much|pg||
nt|deltadash: Right Roland - won't be easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT denied shortage|pg||
nt|tokay1975: exactly  right  last 2 cards sp and a cl  dummy  rx in clubs. torr cannot protect both|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was really a devastating opening lead from Madala|pg||
nt|jtr: I can only manage that when i am drunk|pg||
nt|jtr: sry|pg||
nt|stewball: pass the Guiness|pg||
nt|stewball: eventually he is going to play @c|pg||
nt|stewball: he just doesnt know it yet|pg||
nt|othered1: Good point from Flash:  Fantoni's 2@S opener showed 9+ - 13; so Madala can't confidently place the @CK  (@DAK could be split either way)|pg||
nt|stewball: so what alternative does he have|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in my system i use 2@H/@S by North to give 5cards with maximum 3 hcp|pg||
nt|blum1956: there is a choice - normally it is better to play 1NT then to defend it. But this vulnerability may be exclusive so Fantoni passed. EW prefere to defend 1@s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lebridgeur: previous board open room  one @h opening  one @s overcall but 4 @h was the final contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Good point Sabine -- I think 3@H is the percentage action, and I hope I would have been awake enough at the table to find it.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzrq: our cclub leading  (wcg   1,  Matunga  2,  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club switch now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: But not so easy|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Next time you are S with AK9 of hearts and they lead a low heart, remember to win with the ace and lead back the nine. W ducked here...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: facing this dummy i meant|pg||
nt|kit: But you would never do that, as don't expect West to have led from J10xx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but what do you have to lose? if they are 32 you are still fine|pg||
nt|ady: must take winners now|pg||
nt|ady: at least must take A@S if cashing trump winner|pg||
nt|roswolf: club switch needed i think|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: Nunes getting lots of tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Pulga had switch to a club, the defence would have been a tempo ahead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: W has time to play a @s from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now declarer has time to set up a spade trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 5, Bocchi-Madala also stopped in 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lebridgeur: urgent to ruff @s Jack|pg||
nt|othered1: not much if they're going to attack @C . . .|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: well done|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and play trump if not overruffed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was a very difficult defence, mind you|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|blum1956: not needed this time - 10 tricks always|pg||
nt|kit: But if playing the suit yourself, with AK9 in closed hand opposite 87xxx, lead Ace, and if honor fall on right, continue with 9 and watch LHO sweat.|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - still needs an alert defense to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not all that clear that it wasn't right to set up partner's heart|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lebridgeur: Jack of @h is alright for time being|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

nt|vincenzo: 1@D is 14+ .....for fantunes|pg||
nt|othered1: The rally  continues|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Ed, but still a lot to do|pg||
nt|othered1: Will west overcall?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Much better than odds on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as 3-2 in itself is 68%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult for South, in a way. 2NT did not exactly sound like an almost-solid five-card suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes what i meant is against the yardstick for b idding a grand which is higer than 505 requirement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To se how defence should be, N could have playes low on @d10 and watched discard from S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Close to game in notrumps, hearts or diamonds, but I'm not sure if any of them quite fetch|pg||
nt|othered1: 40+ boards gives them enough time, if they can keep this form (and fortune)|pg||
nt|pelu: Helness in "N after @hQ and a small @H to king and A could have meded 2NT - but did'nt read the end-position|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: on   5 that is|pg||
nt|kit: If North passes, should East balance assuming he has a way to show majors?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: How many @s from N? 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: teh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@D perhaps|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: nice lie for declarer|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should, but many would disagree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would if my majoprs were reversed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 505|pg||
nt|othered1: POInted out,correctly I think, that best spot is 6N by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i feel a frying pan into the fire possibility here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50%|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt shows heart support?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like a very long pause before bidding here in N - s know thta pd has a difficult bidding problem|pg||
nt|april7: I am willing to bet that EW will bid the slam!If W shows 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N has play even if the @S don't come in|pg||
nt|othered1: I laike the simple auction in the OR|pg||
nt|stewball: prefer 2@h to 2@c|pg||
nt|othered1: But not everyone allows a raise on 3, even HHx.|pg||
nt|stewball: with this hand i insist on it:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I try to, but eventually have to play partner's way, since those that demand 4-cars support are lost without the agreement.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: well someone is headed for it but i dont know whom,|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have splintered|pg||
nt|kit: Another dull hand coming up -- makes up for the exciting 3NT we saw earlier|pg||
nt|ady: nice practical bid in 4th seat|pg||
nt|jcmax: Helness no doubt is a big believer in "bid what you think you can make" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: what difference if majors reversed?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pd will bid my long suit with equal lengths|pg||
nt|kit: if 2@C shows majors, 2@D by partner asks which is longer|pg||
nt|blum1956: now EW may stop short of game|pg||
nt|kit: I like the third seat 4@H opening.  There doesn't figure to be a slam, 4@H is probably the right contract, and it puts pressure on opponents|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall with doubleton in @S|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, 4th seat -- but same principles|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have a good save in 5@D   but could hardly enter at that level|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to find 6@d now|pg||
nt|othered1: How good can the 2@C rebid be?|pg||
nt|stewball: with a bad suit it can be pretty good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with W. Dbl for me on 2@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: very interesting...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do know now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will attackclubs first I think|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT down on a club lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: they will find the slam after the 14+ opener and the strong jump, I think these hands fits well in their methods|pg||
nt|stewball: but here,thinking is an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile with NS vul your chances of decent score defending 1N are not dismal|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: lost 5 IMP in bidding regained 4 in play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: do you want to be there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|pelu: here that 2@H is not as strong as normal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so?|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe more difficult to find 6@D after a weak NT without interference letting east upgrade @S void|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: not down on any lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: count again|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N from west actually looks pretty good|pg||
nt|blum1956: Well, not 15 top tricks as on the previous board but 9 I can count|pg||
nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|ady: yes    sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: irony here is 3n is a lot better a contract than 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: but you cannot accuse anyone of mis bidding here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no problem with that is there?  As long as South does not "take advantage"|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right - but extra pressure on S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgebase.com/tools/handviewer.html?s=s76daq7ct&w=sthtdkj86&n=hjd53ck87&e=sq5d94cj9   is the ending I was talking about on 18. South exits with a spade to West who gets ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: out with a heart (East and South both pitching diamonds)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: 6@h looks easy with 2-2 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North could not afford to duck that diamond, Ralf. Then declarer can abandon the suit and turn his attention to clubs while he is keeping North off lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very interesting|pg||
nt|pelu: and 6@D almost need @H 3-3|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mr murray: thoroghly disgusting contract yhat will make|pg||
nt|othered1: Other sound opening styles, even if not always 14+, would make east comfortable to make slam tries.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand 5@c|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW weren't quite in tune here.  Wonder where the problem was|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a 5-card @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|blum1956: looks close|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is too good to give up on defending so double of 2@c seems right|pg||
nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: better spades and a weaker hand for the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|othered1: kOn long run expectations, yes, but 2@H needs to be very unlucky to go minus|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unless E/W take the first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mr murray: true|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: I guess club finesse now, then spade to jack|pg||
nt|ady: now club to the 10 ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|deltadash: this one is a pretty cut and dried 6H|pg||
nt|othered1: That card by south doesn't figure to be deceiving|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jcmax: It may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it does have huge psychological advantages. The opponents never quite know what to expect. it could be anything.|pg||
nt|april7: in 6NT either @D or @S must break|pg||
nt|othered1: This could be very close to a standard auction, so far, though the bids would not have the same meaning (through 4@H)|pg||
nt|april7: without heart lead 13 tricks in NT by force|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: well 4@h went 3 light it appears|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: So winning the jack was correct, but ...|pg||
nt|othered1: It looks like not having a strong JS available complicates the auction significantly. |pg||
nt|pelu: as u see on the bidding from OR East was in 3@S before GF here 2@S = GF|pg||
nt|tomi2: is this a "Turbo" sequence? a spec asks and I ask myself too...|pg||
nt|vincenzo: turbo|pg||
nt|tomi2: so 4NT indicates 2 keycards by Fantoni, yes?|pg||
nt|pelu: Fantoni just need @DK OR @cQ by pd for the slam|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: First hurdle|pg||
nt|vincenzo: yes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jbgood: all scores are in now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C  1 or 4|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  they have to cash  first 5 tricks  . but  i thk  they will  after the bidding|pg||
nt|mr murray: yes they will|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, East plays a club back, West cashes @SA to see what ha[[ems|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When North discards, West "sees"|pg||
nt|april7: thats the worst contract if E should pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would expect better clubs with west for this bid, but I use 5NT as pick a slam on such auction, that would have been my bid|pg||
nt|pelu: but 4@S from Sementa over pd 3NT look a little pessimistic|pg||
nt|othered1: I would add the OR's auctions to my samples of 4th suit forcing auctions gone awry.|pg||
nt|april7: e will bid 6@S or 6NT|pg||
nt|pelu: if u play WJS u could bid 3@S over 2@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would have taken Sementas 3@S followed by 4@S as a mild slamtry with good spades, so imo Duboin could bid on with AKAK, I dont know if he had shown that|pg||
nt|othered1: You can *always* find the way around the 4th suit forcing morass, but you wind up doing it in the post-mortem too often.  If these guys can't handle it, it's not playable by us ...|pg||
nt|othered1: lesser mortals.|pg||
nt|pelu: here Fantoni feat that pd is woid in @S and has a very good @C-suit|pg||
nt|vincenzo: credo di no ... 3 picche è solo 6° ... ho giuseppe alle spalle ...|pg||
nt|april7: then he should bid 6NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 6nt he cant ruff neither a spade nor a dia to get his tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: I must admit I would pass 6 clubs If that is strongly encouraging to play and not just an offer (as i mentioned this depends on the other methods you have available)|pg||
nt|vincenzo: network problems ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Fantoni has 3 options: Pass, 6@S and 6NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2 things: first of all I see that 6nt is on on this actual layout because jxx is comming down and Nunes has a spade card, but I try to imagine what I would do in Fantoni's seat ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: without seeing the full layout|pg||
pc|h6|nt|blum1956: What system do Sementa-Duboin play? If the 1@h opening is restricted to 15-16 HCP then 2NT was a better rebid. Otherwise it looks not easy to reach 3NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And you have not missed a slam opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He does not have  A A K|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ady: e/w here will be very pleased to get a plus   when they might have lost a game swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h a gross contract apparently gross overbidding|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|pelu: now decl has to make the right play in @c - almost 50-50|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2) they play with screens, so Bocchi and Fantoni are on the same side of the screen. They will put they bidding cards on the tray and they will be visible at the same time for west ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and south, probably our operator is in the corner and waits until both have bid, so it was not Bocchi thinking so long...|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 IMP on @cQ|pg||
nt|vincenzo: fulvio was thinking|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|lestergold: as I often say to David a bit liem certain club member we both know|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Dont agree Roland! I play @cK and if declarer ducks play @cQ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c8|nt|othered1: 2@D, second seat vul, gets the suit length in immediately, too.  1@D doesn't.|pg||
nt|pelu: but u can win with @CQ 4. in S but not in N - |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: 4NT are not for sure for minor - but a 2 suited hand - could be @C + @H - and then Nynes prefer @Cs|pg||
mc|7|nt|lestergold: east wouldnt like his club holding opposite a weak 2 tho!|pg||

nt|roswolf: and now some distribution|pg||
nt|deltadash: that was probably the last nail in the coffin|pg||
nt|deltadash: An ACTION hand|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR NS stopped in 3@D after 3@S from S = 5@s+4m or 6@s - 10-13 HCP|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S opening, sorry|pg||
nt|tomi2: on @HQ lead NS might have forced Nunes to ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: could be passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa will be surprised to discover he gauined 5 imps here|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D-2N-3@C (feature) - 3N.  Not tricky at all.|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 1cl 4h?|pg||
nt|roswolf: where do you want to play this -4@H?|pg||
nt|tomi2: then he is down to KJ sec, I think its best then to lead towards dummy because you pik up singleton queen onside|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone understand the NS auction inthe OR?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: only 10 imps exchanged in the first 6 boards - not much really|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: Nunes considering|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N opened a much worse hand than this already, and vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u play such simple common sense bridge Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Normal weak NT here, though their system allows some funny shapes (like 4-4-41)|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry saw this one wrong, west was playing|pg||
nt|pelu: Thomas - played by West u cant force dummy's @Cs|pg||
nt|tomi2: but Bocchi tried :)|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: not enough   ...for our and your fun|pg||
nt|blum1956: this board also not exciting|pg||
nt|ady: need not to get overboard in spades|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: zalicytowa³em 4 kier i by³em przygotowany ¿e jak partner zapyta o dame atu to powiem ¿e mam na tego 7 kiera|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A good setup for the Fantunes methods|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3 diamonds great spot|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2nt shows dias?|pg||
nt|tomi2: or any signoff in a minor?|pg||
nt|othered1: Card says "transfer with many kinds of hands|pg||
nt|tomi2: 50% say dias 50% one minor :)|pg||
nt|vincenzo: 2SA maybe week in @c or week in @D or other type of hands|pg||
nt|april7: a save by 5@D over 4 in a M  could be to expensive|pg||
nt|othered1: South is making a call that he thinks will get partner to bid a major (or other specific agreement).   Since they're a good partnership, it shoudn't be an on0the-spot invention.|pg||
nt|vincenzo: if 2 suites he has clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: South knows that the auction at the other table won't be like this.  And I think he must act.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: two keyboards half a brain here|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS SOWS EXTREME DISTRIBUTION I ASSUME|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C is the 15+ balanced variety,  here.  1@H transfer to @S 0-11 pts.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|blum1956: Sementa is right to underestimate his hand now by not bidding 4@s immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: his stiff K@c does not look like pulling its weight|pg||
nt|blum1956: But Duboin shows extras|pg||
nt|tomi2: they are a relatively new partnership compared to others on their level|pg||
nt|tomi2: Meckwell have this on page 463 in their system book :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And north takes out the takeout double|pg||
nt|stewball: 2@c must have been 2 suited|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: West might have shoved in a 1@S overcall -- relatively safe, and might do some good.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Free lesson in Polish|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3sp shows 65 but not super just enough  to play a game|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|othered1: But aren't these auctions you should discuss before unleashing one on partner at the table?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why? because E don´t know anything about xxx in @s by W|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: this one is only one loser away from the normal threshold, and N has the suit he is opening, so much better than his first exhibit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 hcp enough for game nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When do the invite, if ever?|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting question is whether North should speculate a double.  I know almost nobody does, but it wouldn't surprise me if it were percentage action.|pg||
nt|jcmax: I was just about to say the same thing, Kit :)|pg||
nt|kit: great minds think alike (sometimes)|pg||
nt|jcmax: It's the kind of action one might choose when one is very much into it or very hungry. Not so likely after dinner.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Helg can make this terrible 3Nt|pg||
nt|pelu: diff system that u need to X with 6-5 in red|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What a treat. Four of Europe's, and the world's, finest players at this table on a Sunday morning|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: lack of decebt spade stop may have prompted south to be conservative|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lebridgeur: I  would bid 1@h with East cards   partner is bound to have majors|pg||
nt|tokay1975: he had no better bid probably  when 3dia is limit  with 55 or 65|pg||
nt|othered1: What safe play will Bocchi seek?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|deltadash: I could use a few of those Roland, thx :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Which contract do you prefer 4@h or 4@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond force may make declarer feel ubcomfortable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it need start with @H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: i@d doubled might have been exciting:)|pg||
nt|othered1: What are the extras?|pg||
nt|blum1956: Ask Duboin|pg||
nt|roswolf: might well just cash the major suit ak's and claim|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcmax: No doubt his best chance would be magic :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: i have a feeling that there isa defence to beat 3@h but probably needs an intitial club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Saturday, sorry, I was ahead of myself|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Getting older :(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But the good news is, Roland, a day less older than you thought!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like the lead is about to double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so far 39-0 in this set........|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: Board 17 might have help prompt his conservatism too|pg||
nt|ady: same contract OR|pg||
nt|tokay1975: to shift  trumps second   trick is better i thk .now declarer just needs 7trump tricks to make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can play A in @S (otherwise KQ good)|pg||
nt|kit: still only 8 tricks I think -- North goes up|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: ducking a spade maybe, but this is real bridge|pg||
nt|tomi2: madala must bid something, every bid could cause confusing, he cant pass because he does not know what bid is agreed as majors, so he picks the one, that wouldbe majors in similar ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: auctions|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: Nuneshipiong to achieve that rarity a ruff with a stiff trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: at end of day its hard in an imp game to stay our of game when you have 23/24/25 ish high card points between you and an 8 card fir|pg||
nt|stewball: why Helgemo didnt defend 1nt is another question entirely|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: 6@H easily bid in the other room on board 7; it seems all over and we get the dream final: Allegra vs Angelini, starting at 21.15 local time tonight, in about 3 hours from now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @H @h for A and @h - now @d @d @d @D @S|pg||
nt|kit: best declarer can get is 4 diamonds, 2 clubs, and 2 in one of the majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: make Q in @C in the end game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't see it|pg||
nt|kit: North goes up ace of hearts, clears clubs, and that is that.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no - can play @C |pg||
pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: sry|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: This could get tricky because of the wide range of shapes allowed for 2@H.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: he will if west now tries to ruff a spade|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks looks easy now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fantoni must know that pard has returned a singleton so ruffing with the j@h is guiaranteed defeat|pg||
nt|lestergold: pardon raif its off|pg||
nt|lestergold: ruff A@H|pg||
nt|wstuart: rhow many bds?|pg||
nt|othered1: Coiuld west have @S9x and 4@D?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 16 boards in every set|pg||
nt|othered1: 2 more @C can put declarer to a guess in trumps|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: you know thecards may be spitting in ur face but u know it will be  bid in the other room and unlikely to be a disaster|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is not the end of the day at the moment, just half-past-three|pg||
nt|tokay1975: agree roland  that match will be  very exited between very strong teams|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: should make just 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: the duck make declarer's life quite difficult|pg||
nt|kit: declarer can set up 3 hearts, 2 spades, 1 club, 1 diamond, but he is afraid opponents may have enough tricks first|pg||
nt|ady: may plau wedt for doubleton honor in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: er Michael I have the frfanchise on all the appaling jokes here|pg||
nt|kit: If North ducks, then it can be made|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: As cards lie pretty much anything will work, but he doesn't know that.|pg||
nt|ady: that works as they |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a great shame Helness didn't leave Helgemo on lead:  @C5, @C3, @C2, @C4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: Maybe 2@C would have beaten this independent of declarer's play|pg||
nt|othered1: It's not clear declarer has an obvious line from here.|pg||
nt|pelu: no - but I dont exp that he can find the line to go down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dK now|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think that works.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S plays @dK defence is helpless|pg||
nt|othered1: @H back?|pg||
nt|pelu: come on Raff :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if W plays a @h, i can ruff and pöay @dK and discard a @c and play @cJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: On merit, too. :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks easier on this board as the cards lie|pg||
nt|bridge_one: alwyas 3@C and 2A|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well all academic on that line|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Doesnt help. W can finess for @hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: was there a risk in returning to hand with a club and advancing say the t@h?|pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like 9 tricks now. Probably NS should have played trumps three times after winning the @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that these guys have played before|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He could have, of course, but he had the diamond switch to make|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Unfair|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: This is logical -- defense won't be able to set up 2 club tricks, so declarer will get his 7 tricks first|pg||
nt|blum1956: ))|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: That was my defense.  Not sure now that trump back weren't better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ruff with @s8, ruff a @d and play @c|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@s down 1 played by Helgemo|pg||
nt|othered1: At this point, Bocchi simply has to read the exact hand.  It wouldn't be a huge upset if he does, but he may be wondering why the defense has gone this way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I goe the best line fromn a kib. Ruff with @sQ and finess in @s discard @cj and....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: got...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: should go down now   cash 2 spades and then club|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|kit: Although still problems -- what gets pitchec from dummy on last spade?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: no overcall|pg||
nt|kit: maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E did well to play club king not queen but to no avail|pg||
nt|kit: or maybe West believed his partner's king of clubs and played his partner for king of diamonds?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as you said, Kit, the overcall might get rewarded:)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s need to find their way to a diamond contract    somewhat difficult|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: unfit  is the proposal from many spec|pg||
nt|lestergold: truth of them tatre is that real life at the table isnt a bidding com,petition biggest fear of players ina teams game is failing to bid a making game not going off in an unlucky ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: one|pg||
nt|othered1: You may stay out of that with a weak NT opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: or as mu dog says: sniff it ... bid it...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The philosophy these days is to leave no possible game unbid..|pg||
nt|kit: yes, they have that nasty habit of counting tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Really, if 2N was forcing, south can pass then cue-bid whatever natural suit was bid, no?|pg||
nt|othered1: In the absence of an agreement|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then partner will not expect such a great hand in case slam will be good, say he has some good fit and aces...|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - :(:( - no @C-lead|pg||
nt|othered1: The rally has become serious.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jacksond: there are hands where only makeable grand slam is in the 3/3 fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: I also think it is unfair to Moyse that his name is connected to all weird trump fits - the 4-3 fit is actually a fit:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and also some impossible ones as well|pg||
nt|jcmax: An awkward hand to open if one doesn't play a strong club system|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How to bid 7@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|kit: there is a grand, but they will be doing well to get to a small|pg||
nt|ady: I think possibly 6@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: Standard practice is to just open 1@C anyway. Most times one gets another chance. sometimes partner has Qxxxx in spades and out and the bidding stops in 1@C|pg||
nt|kit: particularly since there will be plenty of enemy interference|pg||
nt|othered1: 49-0 is quite a run|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|lestergold: inevitably|pg||
nt|othered1: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|blum1956: Another test. this time for NS. Will they reach 4@h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its abit like criminal justice- if you are going to make sure you convict allk theguilty ones you will have to convict a few innocent iones|pg||
nt|othered1: south will move over any type of support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent hand for a Bergen raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 5cM|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess there has to be one that's decent|pg||
nt|lestergold: or the converse if you want to make sure you dont convict an innocent one you release many of the guilty ones|pg||
nt|kit: wonder what 3@C shows?|pg||
nt|kit: I am told it shows black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 5+@C / 5+other|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is hard to imagine S would really bypass the @S-suit with his hand. so 2-suiter makes a lot of sense.|pg||
nt|kit: If so, they will easily get to some slam|pg||
nt|jcmax: yes, it would indeed be a scoop for the system!|pg||
nt|kit: but finding the grand looks impossible to me -- but you never know -- maybe 5@D by North, 5@H by South?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if north bid 5@D i bet they find grand slam in @C|pg||
nt|ady: as long as if they bid a grand it is in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: they will certainly bid it in clubs if South has shown black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Definitely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bocchi knows that 7@S can only be right if they have 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! but another 22......|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: 2H or 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrr: the contract is 3nt by north ..bidding differnt as cards were picked in wrong axis|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|blum1956: the absolutely maximal hand with Fantoni|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT by Sementa  pinpointing distribution for South|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfave vul that is a brave one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bocchi count 12 tricks because can't imagine 6 @S in South|pg||
nt|kit: Leaping to slam without some kind of investigation is almost always wrong IMO, and this hand is no exception|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he was going to slam anyway, why not 5@D en route one could ask|pg||
nt|jcmax: I doubt Bocchi was seriously considering a grand slam. If his partner's distribution were 5521, then small slam would be on the @D finesse, which would rate to be offside on the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: bidding.|pg||
nt|kit: exactly Roland.  6@C won't run away from him.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the void in @H could exist but isn't sufficient - need also K in @D Q in @s without 6 cards in @S|pg||
nt|kit: but why couldn't partner have stiff diamond and Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|kit: the point is that it can't hurt to try|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that sounds all very well. But then when he gets 5@H over 5@D how does he know his partner has 6@S and 5@C and not vice versa? 6@C is a very practical bid.|pg||
nt|kit: If he bids 5@D and follows with 6@C over 5@H, his partner will know there was grand interest since 5@D forced to 6@C if clubs trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A fair slam here, and it looks to be on (just)|pg||
nt|othered1: There are 10 lucky tricks for NS here.|pg||
mb|r|nt|kit: 2@S might survive anyway -- not sure|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if 1diamond is hearts  2cl is  obvious bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lebridgeur: op|pg||
nt|blum1956: IThere are some problems in the play thanks to the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|jbgood: a reasonable contract though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: optimism by both EW   should be one down|pg||
nt|lestergold: or foolhardy?|pg||
nt|kit: I'll grant that it is unlikely partner will bid the grand -- but if partner does you will have gained, otherwise you break even|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But very very thin|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C cn be top carded down, on 3-3@D split|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: easy play for decl in OR @D from N to king - and now 8 toptricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: In OR east was able to bid a mere 2N|pg||
nt|mr murray: club ace on always makes even off makes on most layouts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well shape is everythimng points count for little by comparison|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 10-13 unbalanced - yes, 3 NT makes. Spades behave!|pg||
nt|blum1956: In Russia we play 2NT opening for minors|pg||
nt|tokay1975: south  knows  the distrubution of north |pg||
nt|april7: at some point the @H must be opened, might do it now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|blum1956: The declarer needs to realise early that he must discard the 3rd club on the heart rather than ruffing one|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: interesting choice of lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it seems to me that a trump lead sinks 6@D if the club ace is off |pg||
nt|ralfwil: so many rounds of bidding to reach 4@h.....|pg||
nt|othered1: a few more imps headed to Allegra|pg||
nt|othered1: Rather, an imp or two.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blum1956: But the defenders may play clubs themselfe so the trump coup is needed|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the trump coup just does not work against best defense|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes as South may discard two hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is likely to get the trumps right here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: clming 4 in 5 seconds|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer properly attacking his side suit first -- he needs to develop diamond tricks in all variations.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nd 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: spec say: why dont N bid 3@C - he know his pd with 3 card @C|pg||
nt|pelu: or 4 card c!|pg||
nt|othered1: so you never bid 1N with 3=3=5=2?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1:  a common consequence of 2-suited bids when you don't buy the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hi|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even a spade lead is dangerous ... declarer could easily lose control as he tries to ruff the clubs good|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lebridgeur: Queen of @c now  and South must discard @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it is all a question of would holds the 10 of @d from North point of wiew   not that clear|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway I cannot find a sensible alternative for North. But Fantoni is better...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West did well to hide his 10 of @h   both red tens are essential for the defense  @s could be right !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Not that easy to see that 10 of @s could do harm to the defense|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: difficult for the team that must win any IMP to play with this kinds of hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, in 2S he can afford to suffer a ruff|pg||
nt|mr murray: still pretty good. Would always want to be there although probably only makes 601/2% of time:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess this is the "game force, balanced" version of 2@C.|pg||
nt|othered1: Then they need the rest of the auction to sort things out|pg||
nt|othered1: No theoretical reason not to take this approach if you have room to bid out your hands.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: call it 40%|pg||
nt|pelu: yes I do but N can exp that pd after 2@D by West max has 4 card @D|pg||
nt|pelu: EW are in Red so 99% sure they have 8-fit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: keep your hands off that @DA, South |pg||
nt|othered1: declarer doesn't know (as we do) that he's safe|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: Lead seems normal -- surely safer than diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see we have almost 1500 specs which is a lot for a weekday early afternoon|pg||
nt|pelu: and down 1 now|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I think you might struggle to get this slam to even money, but it's a complicated calculation - too hard for me|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tokay1975: yes but in closed cards south knows  55 in minors and opener . north may have  rdxxx cl or something more|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to stay out of slam i thk|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I agree ... it's normal for South to bid it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: also 6@D in OR|pg||
nt|mr murray: sure|pg||
nt|mr murray: this calibre players will always get there|pg||
nt|tokay1975: agree|pg||
nt|mr murray: should |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: looks to be heading for same result as OR|pg||
nt|pelu: even in the club most players would be in 6@D after 1@D - 1@H - 2@C - 2@S (4.suit) 3@C - Now S know 3-3 and he will just ask for key-cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... the light opening propels South.  Now imagine South is the dealer and opens 1@D ... it's all a lot harder for North, who doesn't know that South has A-AK in the majors to ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cover his losers there|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even here, with all the good things that have happened, South needs clubs to divide 4-3, which is only about a 65% cvhance|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lebridgeur: made now I told you that it was a very tricky defensive|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: OK, 6, finessing for @S 10|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956: It takes time to make all the calculations (mostly conditional) at the table. And you are noy always right(|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: it looked as if W hesitated before playing the @h Queen, maybe that put Fantoni off?|pg||

nt|jcmax: True Kit. But how does s then Know tha his holding of QJTxxx,-, xx Qxxxx makes a grand. Whereas QJTxxx,-, xx Qxxxxx wouldn't make a slam?|pg||
nt|kit: He couldn't.  But if South held QJ10xx, A, Kx, Qxxxx I'll bet he would know.|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes he has extra chance  against 52 clubs and diamonds in good side|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Correct ... he will still make on some 5-2 club breaks|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: unlucky 4@H for e/w  if 2 spades are casshed|pg||
nt|othered1: Allegra seems to have slowed down the Angeline onslaught.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this room is 5 boards behind, but as far as I saw this in Italy directors don't rule so ard on time issues. In Germany its more a problem for slow players|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the heart lead might not prove that safe. for example, dummy might have Q9x|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I cannot see any position to have a problem  to play Queen of @h  and South gave the count|pg||
nt|jcmax: I doubt that would be a 3@C bid in their methods.|pg||
nt|ady: its easy from here   but north cannot know of the 6th spade in south hand  with only 10 black cards  even with void heart  or even ace  what about possible diamond loser|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but here u can give -10 IMPs to both teams :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think Nunes-Fantoni are the much slower pair here|pg||
nt|othered1: East preempted in OR, changing the auction considerably|pg||
nt|othered1: And that could affect the play if east stays out here.|pg||
nt|pelu: no problem with 10 tricks for N i 4@S - easy play om all leads|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@C won't be fun to play if it's bid and north sits a double.|pg||
nt|pelu: can Bocchi bid 4@c as splinter?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If he had a count, N misplayed @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Who is thinking, north or east?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: looks like a strong NT to me|pg||
nt|othered1: EW in the other room have gone for some substantial, undoubled numbers.|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl showing a max?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think they would have gotten there on the actual hand -- all I'm saying is that there is nothing to lose by trying.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D xfert |pg||
nt|othered1: Or both?|pg||
nt|pelu: prob most N|pg||
nt|april7: y, thats a handicap which might come up, pass or bid 5 @S|pg||
nt|stewball: a breather..time for tea|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: spec ask: if w duck the @C? then No need to play @CK to make on cross-ruff - if he play @c10 then down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: with trumps 4-1 very sticky|pg||
nt|ady: seems went down 4 OR|pg||
nt|jcmax: You see I am going to play with Norberto in a few weeks. I have to defend his actions. :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: true Sabine :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think this will go off in practice|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10-13 and unbalanced, 5+ spades for Nunes opening|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teach him something, Sabine :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|blum1956: Less expensive than 5@h (-990 instead of -1100)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they will get to 4@h here too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|blum1956: only a trump lead and a heart return guarantee the success of the defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: if Nunes disards dims on this which seems natural when east gets in with spade ace its heart heart ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think S will make now. Discard 2 @h and play 3 rounds oof @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: belay that....|pg||
nt|othered1: east might get fatally tapped on continued @S plays for extra undertricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West may be tempted by 5@d now - may think singleton spade with East |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like Villa are starting to fall behind a bit |pg||
nt|othered1: Is that pass forcing?  I don't think it should be.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Duboin cannot bid any more he may doubl;e of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like they did against Newcastle a few weeks ago?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: max and maj|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: difficult decision for west|pg||
nt|othered1: West's double like permits him to correct @C to @D (at a low level) without showing extras.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jbgood: better line|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lebridgeur: this results could be well duplicated in open room|pg||
nt|kit: Opening lead could be key here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: yes and this couold be 500 and a hefty 14 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: But, not surprisingly, west solves it correctly|pg||
nt|ady: nice result for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think south has a 2@H anyway|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes dbl  is to  with max |pg||
nt|kit: And that was the loser|pg||
nt|pelu: a heavy 2@S bid|pg||
nt|othered1: On last h and, note that contract was played by south in the OR and got low @S lead, so declarer didn't face Bocchi's problem|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: not much for the crowd here...let's open the Cinzano or Primitivo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Impossible a swing with this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be these world class operators wont get this defence wrong|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Super result for E/W here ... successfully staying low on a very tempting vulnerable setup|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: declarer can take quick spadepitch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last set of 16 boards tomorrow at 10.00 Central European Time|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: actually even my dog would probabbly get it right |pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s may well be a make from Duboin's point of view - for example one trick in each side suit and that's all. Therefore to double that was  not an easy decision|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to show where his values lay|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt made in  board 9 againsta  bad defence|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzrr: bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now Nunes may just discard hearts and play diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: cash 4 in right oprder and ruff|pg||
nt|stewball: Happy Bday to Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks John|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: south might well have unblocked the @DK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: Failla hoping .... against hope|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: might only make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not impossible a priori -- 6N makes without heart lead|pg||
nt|kit: But still uppercut danger|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have no other opening for a 4441 hand within the 12-14 range|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: But west has a pretty good record of making winning decisions|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with the ruff in @S he must play @C - obliged|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mr murray: very heavy but is perfect on layout|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: A @s switch now will defeat!|pg||
nt|kit: however, then ace of diamond, diamond ruff, heart to king, low heart|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: may still be a trump promotion  |pg||
nt|kit: and this is not double-dummy -- he has full count of hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need try A in @H in west|pg||
nt|ady: should play 4th club after ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Another possibility is to play fourth round of clubs now|pg||
nt|kit: I guess simplest is to play heart now, then ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Duboin led a club in the other room after Fantoni opened 1NT (12-14) and Nunes responded 3@C (5-card Stayman ask)|pg||
nt|kit: Going back toopening lead, West had clue that his partner didn't double the artificial 2@D call, so maybe he should have avoided diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fairness, would anyone double with just @DQ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also small @H now - if A np, else A@D @D ruff and @H again - no way to beat with KQ@H in the dummy|pg||
nt|kit: no, but with QJxx(x) they would|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: not withn Duboing and nthen smell of blood in his nostrils|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW A SORT OF DEFENSIVE CROSSRUFF|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry to shout|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: well nunes has found the a trump switch by west at that point would have defeated surely|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and also the finesse in @s - so a dream ...|pg||
nt|pelu: if u dont play 2-0-1 GF then 2@D from W and rase 2@S to 3|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: since otherwise largely a guess between diamond and spade lead, perhaps the failure to double 2@D should tip the scales|pg||
nt|stewball: they dont seem to be shy with offshape nt openers regardless|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: that  is a dangerous opponent its fair to say |pg||
nt|roswolf: not a good card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6322  5422  4441 all possible, not 5-4 in the majors, though|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: too late now|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps   leaders pulling away|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|deltadash: wrong club :(|pg||
nt|stewball: seen a few today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are systemic|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: Nunes did well to discard hearats rather than dims|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|blum1956: The  trump switch did not defeat as Nunes could set uo a heart trick|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I mean that Nunes misplayed the contract by playing a @h from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes good point|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: also here a easy game for N/S |pg||

nt|blum1956: Bye|pg||
nt|lestergold: keep the jokes rolling Michael |pg||
nt|blum1956: sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Dbl of 5@H in OR kept them out of the good six.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW seem to have missed their cold slam next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H 11 tricks, next case|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S doesn't get a spade lead necessarily -- support and honor holdings are two different things.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As pointed out, 4@S would be two too high, saving me!|pg||
nt|othered1: Auction in open room looks quite standard.  If long @D promised, maybe a 2@D preference could be considered.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: a game try of 41H seems appropriate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S to give the lead is possible in MP, in IMP can be dangerous - i think better to use a convention, like dbl to give the lead @S (and not for @D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: But NS have a good save in 7m (esp @D)|pg||
nt|othered1: This type of shape is why Bocchi didn't have a clear read on the hand where he double-dummied the @S late.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: same bidding to 2@s in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: heart lead, spade knocked out, another low heart, then W squeezed late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D would show spades|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 6@H doubled with overtrick may gain points|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out that EW in OR had kept themselves out of slam, then were doubled|pg||
nt|blum1956: Will Sementa figure out that his partner has just one side card, not two&|pg||
nt|othered1: In an auction with both sides bidding up with double fits, just buying the contract may be enough to win the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting here that North has stayed out of this auction. |pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR the double NS fit was known.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Perhaps he has no descriptive action - not that anything seems particularly obvious |pg||
nt|othered1: 1@c presumably with the intent of rebidding 1N to show a generic balanced 15+ hand?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Where is that button?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D was transfer to @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes   correct|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S running diamonds before spades so as to end in dummy|pg||
nt|blum1956: will Nunes remove this?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that's really an interesting point. When it looks like your opponents are going to outbid I don't think it makes much sense to support partner just for the sake of supporting ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: him. I prefer when it conveys a message. |pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S in OR = 8-10 HCP and 3 card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The most unusual aspect of the Fantunes system is that they have no weak 2's available, unless you think 10-13 is weak. I think the rest of us have some kind of weak 2 on our card, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: either a natural 2x or a Multi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi is not a naughty word in Europe|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: Fantoni warned off from further action with his decent hand|pg||
nt|ady: 1st round west overcalled 1@H in OR   north doubled   |pg||
nt|othered1: What was 2N?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2 keycards and a void - they should have a special bid for that case|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some kind of relay you would think|pg||
nt|othered1: I doubt 2N was natural. Other than that I've had suggestions of various hands, from cue-bid to, asks other suit, to shows @H fit.  Maybe 2@D means something other than simple ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Michaels?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2 key cards and a void could still have 2 minor losers of course|pg||
nt|othered1: Does 3@H look aggressive given his @H bad position?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Is the 1@h 3rd in hand also strong by their system?|pg||
nt|ady: cashes the diamonds before completing the spades |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: another  4@s made  |pg||
nt|othered1: It's suggested they play Ghestem and that 2@D is specific to majors.|pg||
nt|deltadash: who's got the button???? lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's state that the blind lead is difficult. Or as Jan Wohlin, Swedish top player and author wrote in one of his books: "Don't ever lead, it's too difficult!"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm struggling to find a defence to beat 4@H ... is there one?|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: please tell|pg||
nt|bjacobs: lots of suggestions coming my way!|pg||
nt|pelu: try @H A and @H = only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I think there is a winner in them ... the low spade lead from North|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: good sacrifice in @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me- yes! this 5-card @h are bad honours|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|kit: I'm surprised that, holding KQx hearts and 4-3-3-3 that North bothered looking for 4-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: will north duck the first @H?|pg||
nt|stewball: wrong guess but it wont cost|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: no - but may be|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: both   ruff @d :):)|pg||
nt|blum1956: It was a difficult task for Nunes. His hand is worst possible from the defensive point of view but he knows few about partner's hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one spec  points that 4 @s  goes down on the " obvious" @s lead he is right on principle|pg||
nt|blum1956: But in this vulnerability he probably loses only 200 if 5@h proves to be wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 2@D is majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then he can get in, cross to partner's @CQ and take two more spades|pg||
nt|pelu: i count - but pl corect me : now 5@Hs + 3@D + 1@S|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry S has to follow 4 times in @D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: yes one way or another should have been able to bid 3N with finality, |pg||
nt|kit: Seems to me much more likely that both contracts will take 9 tricks than that 10 in spades and only 8 in notrump.|pg||
nt|pelu: after a @C-lead to A @H to A and @D 9 to J in N|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: I think there is almost no such thing as a truly "blind" lead -- there are always some clues|pg||
nt|jcmax: Andy robson once told me that all his partner's were brilliant opening leaders. Now you maybe can work out why :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: isn´t there a small danger to have a 4-card major as side suit?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Tricky isn't it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but will make|pg||
nt|othered1: another @Cneeded now or east may get endplayed in trumps later|pg||
nt|pelu: down 5 but no X :)|pg||
nt|othered1: rather,w with trumps for @C lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: I surrender :(:(:(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, we won't see the play in that tantalizing 4@H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: South was fortunate to get heart lead if he was going to misguess clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: 5@H doubled  then losing points|pg||
nt|blum1956: If 4NT is RKCB then it was enough to show 2 keycards with @hQ (which Duboin surely has)|pg||
nt|othered1: Must south overtake to beat this?|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess n ot|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while.  Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lebridgeur: nt so sure  South was right to pass  with  KQJ  in @h opposite a 6 or 7 cards suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: these high level desicions are impossible to get right all the time|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|stewball: @s coming|pg||
nt|othered1: north may wind up with quite a few tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: Could the small heart and the trump switch help ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|stewball: or4 not|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: no squeeze now|pg||
nt|stewball: playing Nunes for trump KQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: if E holds his giant hearts|pg||
nt|ady: got heart lead in OR   also miss guessed the club|pg||
nt|kit: West afraid declarermight be sneaking a diamond through from KQJ, and tht his partner has natural trump trick|pg||
nt|kit: He is trying to see if ducking the diamond and letting partner lead a club can do any good|pg||
nt|jcmax: Guys, my son has 5 friends visiting who just decided they want to stay overnight. I need to get some order in the chaos. sorry about that. I hope you all enjoy the rest of the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: show. good night all!|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will conclude that it won't be of value -- if declarer has only 3 spades the contract won't be making anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good night Sabine and thanks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hope you've got a big garden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, priv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last segment today. Four more tomorrow and the last set Sunday morning local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Four other nations offer broadcasts over the wekend: England, France, Japan and India, so plenty to choose from|pg||
nt|kit: is he still thinking operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For vugraph schedule, please go to  http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may operator is sleeping ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|kit: surprising to see him having this much difficulty -- the logic appear straightforward.  If declarer has 3 spades and not solid diamonds, the contract isn't making, so might as well ...|pg||
nt|kit: go up ace.  Unless I'm missing something.|pg||
nt|kit: Can anybody find a layout where ducking can gain (from West's point of view)?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: Very well done.  Slam after an opening bid is always a good effort.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 4N= turbo (even no keys DA) 5 c = ask in suit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: just 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Fine slam, difficult to bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: N showing a 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|othered1: With the opponents pushing hard, just a shot and I don't know how either can find the 4@C tricks.|pg||
nt|stewball: they\ve managed to get through 11 hands in 100 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only if Bocchi bids 4@S now, 3@S is hardly enough|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Straightforward 3NT, not much to write home about|pg||
nt|ady: e/w did well to lose 50 in OR    3 hearts making n/s|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H fine contract here, but heart finesse is off.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 12-14|pg||
nt|kit: I think N-S in other room did well to sell to 3@S|pg||
nt|jbgood: Varese gaining ground with the last two ..|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: transfer I presume|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes 8 imps. And 12 more on the board were Fantoni allowed 5@d to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: mayhem may eventuate here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a spade raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3C?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a stretch in OR   held to 7 trricks on trump lead   though difficult from KX|pg||
nt|othered1: double seems normal, |pg||
nt|othered1: Double, in theory, is for takeout of @H on these auctions.  South has extras to justify it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stronger than 3@S|pg||
nt|kit: does anybody know what 2@Cis?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|ady: seems for majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GF with clubs or balanced|pg||
nt|kit: ty|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D = F1|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D = 0-6, 5+@S, 4+@H|pg||
nt|pelu: help! what is 2@D?|pg||
nt|pelu: tx, Ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: EW convention card: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S may do the trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: 3 @c not on my cc - puppet?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes, I think a direct raise would show a good hand |pg||
nt|othered1: Now south's 5@S would have been invitational, but south gave north lots of room|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Fantunes play 12-14 in all positions, can be 6322, 5422 and even 4441 shape, not 5-4 in the majors, though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - but calling 4@H not easy for e/w don't call 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C generic forcing without 5 cards out|pg||
nt|kit: North also bidding his small doubleton -- interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|ady: all to end in £NT|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like  £  better|pg||
nt|ady: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: plenty of them|pg||
nt|kit: yes, 3NT it surely will be regardless of methods, unless somebody has an accident|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: 3@S sign off opposite an invite|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s miss their fit|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is a transfer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South can try a DBL here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: made :)|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S a totally unnecessary overbid IMO -- opponents have already exchanged information, so what is the point?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: then 5 @h is too optimistic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is a strong bid. You don't pre-empt over a pre-empt|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: overstatement by west   probably tht 4@H making  so made advanced sacrifice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is hairy as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The question is: how can declarer set up his clubs without losing control?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks hopeless, but note, he has only 2 losers ... perhaps he can afford to lose 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|mr murray: doesn't matter what he does he will make it|pg||
nt|mr murray: cards very friendly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm pretty sure that's an inaccurate statement!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He can't simply play clubs from dummy, because East can get a club ruff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: Did Garbosi forget their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am told 2 @h is two way  weak support in @s or stong with @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only 10imps difference with 36 boards to go   but this one could be bad for Garbosi|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the 4@s bid should of course imply the weak spade support hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead beats 5@s, other leads probably do not|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like that weak nt is back|pg||
nt|mr murray: heart to hand and club up|pg||
nt|othered1: We;re only guessing at development at this point (convention cards go only so far) but it looks like west may have shown shape and more than a minimum (0)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: transfer seems like it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: let us see |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1500 kibs watching this match here on BBO - quite a crowd!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @d attracting  on the bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: If North leads a heart the declarer wins and plays on diamonds. If the defense plays trumps twice the diamond suit works otherwise two hearts may be ruffed|pg||
nt|othered1: over 3@C, south's hand does look defensive and there's nothing certain about any offensive action|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the key will be to discard the blocking club on a trump at some stage|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means support in @H limit or + - i agree 4@S can be too much|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should just bid 3@S -- his partner will have better idea whether or not 4@H is making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: And opponents haven't bid to 4@H yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: if S has "Limit + " chances of 4S goading N into 5H are greatly reduced|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well done    no declarer task very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead triumph|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @s and @c  should easier now|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might have been a little more enterprising -he might have doubled 2nt to show values in the minors - but he no doubt is deflated by the poor run of boards|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer doesn't have 9 top tricks here.  |pg||
nt|kit: I think he goes up ace of hearts and attacks clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tempting to let it ride but they lead 3rd from any holding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@H and @C|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|othered1: Lots of tricks in NT if @H block|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you like 1nt on this hand Roland? I don´t|pg||
nt|deltadash: me 3|pg||
mb|1N|nt|blum1956: anyway EW must finish in 4@s (maybe doubled) and will need the trump guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: ongoing debate whether to ocall or dbl with that S hand|pg||
nt|stewball: in the old days dbl was auto|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: It's systemic, so I can't really comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H = transfer?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but they must find their 3nt with 11 tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@D would not have been natural|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Pinning the stiff 8 would certainly be great|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, I can't answer everyone ... anyway, no point talking to me - I don't know how to make that last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Can't you just take a couple of diamond ruffs, coming to 5 trumps, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 1 diamond -- unless trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: easy game, isn't it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes:)|pg||

nt|kit: Maybe on club lead the entries are short for that|pg||
nt|ady: deceptive heartlead maybe  |pg||
nt|kit: But still, setting up fifth heart is enough -- 4 spades, 2 clubs, 1 diamond, 3 hearts.  Even 4-1 split doesn't matter.|pg||

nt|kit: although the tempo he lost by ducking the diamond may have been costly|pg||

nt|pelu: NS can expect to be down in this segment - but that could be only with 15-20 IMP=, if pd's have a good card|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: draw trumps defence plays a diamond  and forces last trump with a diamond|pg||
nt|othered1: Start with the 15+ balanced variety of 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A good hand for the Raptor 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: 21 combined hcp   2NT   n/s OR   optimistic|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All right, board 29:  heart at trick 2, club to the jack (or king), then another club,  ruff the diamond, play a third club|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: possible slam|pg||
nt|kit: possible swing here if slam is reached|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you interferar  by bidding 1@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4 of a major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: people open and respond on such light hands these days that you need 1NT "sandwich" as strong balanced - but whether a flat 15-count is worth it is debatable|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 2@S if allowed to play    small loss|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: sry folks, have to leave you. Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: he has a good hand - 5-card suit, controls|pg||

nt|jbgood: even 2 nt will not make ¨- neither would 2 @c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then West has no more diamonds, and you can win @SA, draw trumps and claim|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|blum1956: 4@s is better than 3@c|pg||
nt|stewball: 2@c must be artificial|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, either natural or 16+|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: 2H response would sometimes work out well by protecting club holding (or in other ways), but usually right to show 4-card support immediately|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not a  bad contract but   @s far behaving|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: try crossruff - trump coup may probably work in the ending. But Nunes is not aware of the trump position|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   may go down   but not 3 down    £@S   should be fown  so another pick up for Villa|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best lead....|pg||
nt|roswolf: this bidding looks odd as many transfer responses are|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would expect north to play nt a vast majority of the time|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: entrys to hand may be awkward|pg||
nt|roswolf: will be awkward|pg||
nt|deltadash: the entire hand looks awkward to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: setting up the spade suit seems to appeal to many specs - i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: not a lot of defense in the East hand therefore not suitable for trupping|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well done to "Private" who provided the winning solution|pg||
nt|othered1: What has north done that gives south something to think about?|pg||
nt|stewball: Madala in his prepass huddle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NT is wrong-sided, Helgemo wisely went for diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 defensive tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|stewball: I dont think 3nt is an obvious bid on either auction|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: A heart lead is safer on this hand but i understand west's reluctance to lead it|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer seems to agree too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that Helgemo did not think 3NT was in jeopardy, he was looking for a diamond slam. Samme applies here I suspect|pg||
nt|stewball: agreed|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: The play is rather clear, play on @d and @h. Otherwise you will lose 2@s 1 @h, 1@c and 1@c|pg||
nt|othered1: Specs -- they're not playing control-showing responses to 1@C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Interesting board 13 in the other room. I'd like to know why Helgemo dropped the stiff @SK offside in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Dubion in OR   finessed 2nd round of hearts  |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: operator ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: he hears you|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: Bocchi has shown the same as Helness did with his 2@H reverse|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Table feel I suppose|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South was afraid about to play slam knowing North without singleton and limited strength|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was just a detour so to speak|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Against the odds|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||

nt|blum1956: 4@h also works|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  also |pg||
nt|othered1: Getting to 4@S isn't very impressive.  Getting to 3, unluckily down on @C ruff, is less of a charge|pg||

nt|blum1956: Now this shold be easy for Duboin provided that Sement shows diamond suit ans short spades|pg||
nt|ady: paaarently transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: CC says Stayman, transfers, shortness at 3-level - not much on second-round actions|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@C is 5+@D + 4@H or 6@D+1@C, 3@D is relay, 3@S in short in spades with 5+@D + 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: That describes 12 of east's cards very well.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt i think showed clubs|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kit: Continued debate whether South should bid Stayman with 4-3-3-3.  Takes a lot for 4 of a major to take 10 tricks while 3NT 8.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: hovewer i think 1@S by East obliged (if 1@H stnd)|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why North didn't bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C, if natural, shouldn't excite west too much.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's GF :)|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, then west's excitement level is irrelevant.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: RD ?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like this 2@S call one bit -- partner might not even have 4 spades, and wrong hand gets tapped.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s 3 cards after pass at 1@H rdbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he did the exact smae thing before you got here Kit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can pass now|pg||
nt|kit: ah, good point Giorgio|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  19|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  now making game either in hearts or diamonds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to set pressure on declarer Peter?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s natural to play @c10 to @cj and take some finess in @h|pg||
nt|othered1: But do you really have to bid game on this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: not that dull|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @s lead can create problems for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Nort must duck a heart |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes and then?|pg||
nt|blum1956: any lead may create ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i see he may have difficulties in establishing and enjoying 2 @hs|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: ... but the spade king:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess you don't.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a spec opines that 2nt might be 2way either sygnoff in clubs or setting in spades |pg||
nt|deltadash: I think we're on the fast track now|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is certain now = wrong again:(|pg||
nt|deltadash: Oh, well, Geoff, we've all been there many times and will be again :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never in the picture in the other room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably let @h9 run|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not GF apparently|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: Has east limited his hand yet?|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@H a fine slam - 7@H need @CK in S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, East might give it a whirl ... there are some other chances as well|pg||
nt|tokay1975: picks  up diamonds even they are 42  with 32 trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that it is normal for NS to bid 1@S in N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|blum1956: Even if he ruffs high should go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: not possible to ruff two clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: I like east's approach to this hand.  West has a dead, flat minimum and could be much better for 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush, club ruff can wait|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, the 4th @S will keep it from making, I think.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: On the same logic, shouldn't East be able to work out opponents are in 7-card fit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we trying for a grand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not|pg||
nt|deltadash: I think we're done now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer's hopes will be up when defense doesn't run clubs, but the 4-2 heart split defeats him|pg||
nt|kit: I would think that South would promise 4-card spade suit for this sequence, but maybe not.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still a trick short, no? Spades 4-1|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: the best bid by S over partner's second double is RD, asking N to bid something:)|pg||
nt|pelu: the scedule: next match 17.15 - but will be delayed - and then 21.15 - 6. segment - if played - to morrow 10.00|pg||

nt|bjacobs: After all, West is quite a good declarer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: oh, sorry -- didn't see who had bid 3@H|pg||
nt|pelu: 1) @H lead for sure = only 1 @C-ruff - @CK onside 50% @D 3-3 <%|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps you can set up the diamonds even if they are 4-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So  I think this contract is about 80+%|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes  easy  against 42  diamonds  enough entrys|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You don't need to take even a single club ruff|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can you see any solution after this lead and N ducks @h?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|bridge_one: a conservative pass at 2@S by North could be made in this auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now discard a @D seam the best line|pg||
nt|kit: Not surprisingly, this hand plays a lot better in clubs than in spades|pg||
nt|kit: yes, diamond discards seem right -- but with spades 4-2 I don't think that will be good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it won't help him to pitch two hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about the discard. i think ruff with queen of spades then lead jack maybe|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: not so dull commentators curse strikes|pg||
nt|othered1: this speeds things up|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: with 10@S in South this line it is OK|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: that will be a flat board. It rarely pays to be so passive as NS in the open room. 4@s is not that bad after all|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C in OR   way overboard   fortunate to escape double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna. Great job!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our commentators, Kit Woolsey, David Edwin, Giorgio Mauri and Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: may end in 3NT |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally our appreciation to the FIGB and Gianluca Frola for organizing this broadcast|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our commentators, Ed Shapiro and John Stewart|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kit: 3NT is quite possible, and looks like it will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N opened those other junky hands, i am surprised he passed this one, which actually has some positive features|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - 3nt is a normal contract here|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 9 trick level not  good for e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of spects have "no name" in profil - most commentators will not answer "John Do's" - pl be polite a update your profil :(:(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the FIGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO. Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show, greatly appreciated by ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx all, good night|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 21 hcp  and no fit   an unlikely contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Dinner break now, back in 1 hour and 50 minutes, at 21.15 local time|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Roland - also for your nevertireing work for BBO!|pg||
nt|kit: "normal" on 22 high is a strong statement :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very good set for  angelini now  duboin sementha will be back next session|pg||
nt|bjacobs: there's a break now - next set due to start in 2 hours, 20 minutes|pg||
nt|othered1: Will north raise?|pg||
nt|othered1: Rather, would north have raised if west had stayed out?|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of italians dont agree - 1@S sh be 5+|pg||
nt|othered1: non-vul, many modern players tend to respond on south's hand without anywhere near classical requirements|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: thks all - collegues & spectators|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not as strong a statement as this auctrion|pg||
mb|1S|nt|blum1956: It id possible to make 10 in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unless bid from hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: AKQ109x can make 6 tricks in many layout ....|pg||
nt|ady: hopeless on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west can clear the diamonds now|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even 5@d is in danger but Fantoni probably does not exclude that 6@d are on the table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nothing more to do in this match, so I wish you all a nice weekend. Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|deltadash: Bye Ralf and thx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play will resume at 10.00 local time tomorrow, in about 10½ hours from now. Last set of 16 boards. Welcome back then|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: damp squib ending|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: yes, rather unlucky this time|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder if West should have taken a shot and doublet -- he knows clubs aren't running if that's declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am still a bit agog at the auction|pg||
nt|ady: even if west switches to a spade   should go down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S must think they are down by 50|pg||
nt|ady: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT looks doomed on diamond lead.  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|0  bamba: ma|pg||
nt|ady: is this last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|lebridgeur: natural ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, Michael, JP and Jon|pg||
nt|othered1: This, perhaps, being the counterpart of the last hand where north bid without a fit.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play will resume at 10.00 local time tomorrow, in about 10½ hours from now. Welcome back then|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: opening 3@C  in OR   followed by 3@D  and then 4@C    hence same contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This contract is no Gimme|pg||
nt|pelu: 5+ HCP - not 5 card suit - sorry for confusion - so many would pass on the Bocchi hand - OK?:):)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: trying to make    diamond to queen now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes well done to allegra|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 0.3  ace =4 NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: thanks all, colleagues and spectators|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO. Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|ady: I believe this is last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: will be disappointed  when clubs fail|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he will probably need to finesse the diamonds to make it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: now around down 3|pg||
nt|tokay1975: maybe both  cl and dia  finesse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lebridgeur:  the match still in contention 27 imps   32 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lunch break now. Restart in 2 hours and 15 minutes, at 14.30 local time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: double finesse in diamonds is the best chance|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||

nt|Walddk2: May I suggest that you bookmark that site where all times are local to *you*. That will save me from lots of questions about where, when and what. Thank you|pg||
nt|kit: He will cross to dummy and lead queen of hearts, hoping that North has K10.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ty all for watching - bye !|pg||
nt|kit: It will go KA.  Then he runs clubs and plays another heart.  The count will make it clear that North started with 2 hearts, so cash for down 1.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Madala has had some incredibly difficult play problems in this set|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: declarer think West without control in @C for the switch in @S at second trick|pg||
nt|ady: well thx specs and all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what happens when you sit South|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|blum1956: done|pg||
nt|blum1956: by all|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: a 3 Norsemen Italian team - I am sure we will see them in the final|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|kit: It might be right to lead low heart from dummy in case North has stiff king.  If North has K10x, he gets squeezed anywy|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching. We hope you enjoyed your stay in the vugraph room and look forward to welcoming you on another BBO presentation|pg||
nt|kit: and Helness worked that out!  Very well done.|pg||
nt|kit: At least I think he worked it out.|pg||
nt|kit: But the fact that he is thinking here isn't a good sign|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Broadcast from New Zealand in progress|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: Can S find @dQ now when W has shown at least 9 black cards?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: obviosly he did|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: I think he will make it, because the heart break will be revealed in time to force him into the club finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx all, bye|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Good guess although they play 80 boards in the semi-finals|pg||
