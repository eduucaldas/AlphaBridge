nt|effebi: il nobile giusto, quello del compagno, avrebbe battuto.|pg||
nt|toniemme: anche qui  un eventuale suing dettato dalle diverse scelte di sistema ..l'apertura di 2@D indirizza BM verso un contratto migliore rispetto al 4@H di chiusa|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|deltadash: Hi everyone and good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland, Diane and Geoffrey|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Ralf|pg||
nt|deltadash: Looks like we're going to ease into it with this hand - not much action|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: board  1 should be a major  fight  @h agains @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The layout isn't friendly for N-S in a heart contract. On a good day you make game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: hmm....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not board 1 then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they on 2 or 3 maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: re hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@h doubled is par|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder why Fantoni didnt open 2 @s - isnt that according to system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: is any bid here going to be natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|blum1956: surprisingly enough N's hand does not qualigy for the opening bid (1@s is forsing, 2@s being probably not for that kind of shape?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think there is any making game for N/S|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@s should be 10-13 unbalanced with 5+ spades - dosnt that fit?|pg||
nt|blum1956: clearly the biddin is not correctly sent|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 1@h opening and no support from W?|pg||
nt|jbgood: or they play something else than we see? (wrong download?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 commentators and no one knows what is going on|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is normal, Mike:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries, I am in touch with Gianluca Frola from the FIGB|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is looking into it|pg||
nt|ady: north opening a mute point|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: some  action required with South's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not an unreasonable game when you are 25 IMPs behind with 16 boards to go|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but n/s dont have to be in game|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the basic system of n/s?|pg||
nt|deltadash: they may not get past 1NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: presumeably 2@H   shows hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mule?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Nunes adopts what we cal the staircase strategy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf  for the Fantunes convention card|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: can someone please explain the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: q2N seems odd why not redouble for rescue what if pard had 3 spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh sorry that explains|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has a chance without a @s lead. Declarer can knock out @hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: now an invite or the classic punt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rinaldi will obviously accept an invite|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 9-losers hands should not strain to open, especially when you don;t even get to name a suit you would like to see led|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is important to buy the contract on that kind of board whatever the level is|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Garbosi cannot be fouled and Nunes will have to bid  par contract as Michael pointed earlier|pg||
nt|blum1956: keypoint...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: well so so far David ur prediction was correct N/S will not make 3N because they arent in it !!|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, hearts plus minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: D six growing up fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: my understanding of these proceedings is comparable to my understanding of Italian...|pg||
nt|jbgood: Cero|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We can all see that the cards on our screen do not match the hand they are playing|pg||
nt|jbgood: as Flash says: the board displayed is, indeed, Board 1 - it matches the auction which was displayed last time; as Roland indicated, this auction goes with another board...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they are playing board 2 or 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same problem in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: So Roland, we just wait and see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 has been redealt, that's why|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not inclined to go into detail|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: South kow s 1 he has only 2 defensive tricks 2  he cannot be expensive in 6 @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: even thing of redoubling !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Thinks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
nt|deltadash: obviously it's PUSH time|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an easy lead for Duboin|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but in the other room i expect the same to happen|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: club switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 down; even Fantoni can play this fast :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes! well done by both sides up to this moment. Still E needed to avoid the diamond lead which was easy enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either @DA is onside or it's not|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: end play in  @d Roland?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: One goes away on a spade, so not sure which endplay|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction - even if it gives away a trump trick, it usually comes back |pg||
nt|lestergold: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW 5cM. 4cD, 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa has those nice clubs in dummy he has no way of enjoying|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown's Law:  the lower the level of the doubled partial, the faster the trump lead...   :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East had really better take his heart ruff while he can |pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may well diagnose the bad breaks now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Losing 2 diamonds when the ace is off|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: Hi|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @d  ace is obviously off side considering East final double|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio played always strong club - now they chenged the system, seeing the open of 1@C by Failla|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown was one of the early electees to Canada's Hall of Fame |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ace rather than small would win when S has stiff king, but risk is blocking the suit and having heart entry knocked out before clubs can get untangled|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|lebridgeur: sorry not well waked up forgot ace of @s discard:(|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hQ|pc|d3|nt|blum1956: @dA may be singleton offside (just exchange most of minor suit cards between EW)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500 which wouldnt have been tragic if n/s could make 3n |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: E trying to save a trick if W has KJxxx of spades, as a club here would endplay him|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Morning Jon|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is usually right against this auction|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Angelini has three Norwegians in the team, Helness, Helgemo and Brogeland .... but no longer Lauria-Versace|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|deltadash: sounds right to me :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: didnt|pg||
nt|ady: tht would finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who say you should double a 2NT opener if it goes pass-pass|pg||
nt|ady: passive diamond looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all say that but no-one does|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa wants to retaion all his endplay options here hoping that defenders will be forced to give him his 8th trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: south best tho to continue as he started |pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, it's easy to be brave on paper|pg||
nt|ady: may well be   if he cashes all diamonds and then Q@S and 10@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: best for east to conceal his hand very difficult for defenders this way|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can see that anything bit a diamond now is fatal for the defence|pg||

pc|h2|pc|dT|nt|blum1956: Normally they play Lebensohl in that position/ I wonder whether 3@c from Nunes was positive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we are about the last one in France NOT to open 1 nt with 5 cardsmajors:)|pg||
nt|ady: can end play south for 9th trick|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What is the NT range, Giusy?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2 spades, 5 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Maybe an upgraded 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Safe to win and take a @s finess|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: even with that favourable lead E may find it hard to come to nine|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: overboard   2 off|pg||

nt|marlowepi: If E had one more D and one less round card, 6C would be on after normal defense|pg||

pc|d8|nt|blum1956: now the diamond discard looked safe|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, though at that point N had hardly showed a great hand so 2S didnt need to be a dreadful hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h by Failla take the chance to find the slam in @C, so i agree with that bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse strikes who cares|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very little between finessing and going for the drop. 52-48 for the drop, a priori|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ady: just a part score  n/s|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did we make a simulation? What works best in the long run from KQxxx and KQxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 NT here looks more promising|pg||

mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be balanced hand|pg||
nt|kit: South has difficult problem, with no suit to Q-bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C natural (normal in Italy against 1@C with only 2@c)|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps it is right to play that a bid of the other minor is a Q here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes and for 9 tricks you have to take the correct finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a much easier 3n here for E/W|pg||
nt|ady: might get too high|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: just playing it as forcing is likely to be good enough, no?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is a good bid - North could have 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: and here a shooting e/w might try a slam|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like that's the path we're on|pg||
nt|pfbr: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: last board 2@c showed both majors - does really 2 @d show even more major cards?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: well, partner needs to know if it shows diamonds or not|pg||
nt|ady: unless defence slips  3NT has 5 tricks of the top|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D is forcing one round|pg||
nt|lestergold: players normally play for the drop if there is no other indicator|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: giving the stop for 3Nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah i see, you mean doing it even with shorter diamonds. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but North nothing in @S ...|pg||
nt|kit: they have pinpointed the spade weakness, so will likely stop in time at 4@C|pg||
nt|tokay1975: antonio has very good cards  against 64 in majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: exactly Marshall|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: perfect defence against 2H could be quite bloody|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: Good 3@S bid -- if partner has 3 small spades, that might be enough|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is a risk - ask half stop to bid Nt|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead against 4@s gives some chances to the defense|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d on 1@c opening  2@c was after one NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer must be careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: as kind kiubs tell me: 2 @c shows 5-4 and 2@d 5-5|pg||
nt|ady: a lucky lay and n/s can make 4@H    but not  in the bidding in both rooms|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kit: I don't think South will think Jx is enough|pg||
nt|ady: might lead a heart     but will have time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: *kibs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: would need A in @D in South - with this layout E/W make 5 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for Qxx of spades upstairs...but even then likely to need 44 spades in EW hands|pg||
nt|kit: Heart lead wrong only if North has 7 clubs -- but that is quite possible|pg||
nt|blum1956: It proved easy enough to stop the opps from making a vulnerable game |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a push |pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: on the previous hand if a low heart is led Declarer playing the ACE does block the suit but declarers have been known to do the wrong thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: In both rooms|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kit: If North had Qxx in spades, North would have bid 3NT -- that is why I don't like South's 3NT call|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tokay1975: no room to ask for  queen of trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well e/w here did shoot the slam but now can he make it?|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|tokay1975: i am not sure if 4cl was somekind of turbo  asking aces |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: West can afford to pitch 2 diamonds, 1 heart, 1 spade.  East must keep all of his spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might not have bid 3S with Qxx of spades and KQJxxx of clubs (and D ace instead)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: i meant, he might not have bid 3N, sorry|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|nt|kit: This should be easy defense -- they know declarer starts with 8 top tricks, so the necessary assumptions are easy.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but of course i agree about the 3N call being ill-judged|pg||
nt|kit: Also, declarer shouldn't have king of spades -- with that, would have bid 3NT, not 3@H.|pg||
nt|blum1956: Certainly it is dangerous to double the 1@s opening with Failla's hand, but to pass is also dangerous sometimes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think W never can make with 4-1 in @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: with diamonds 3-3 declarer is home|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: he will settle for 9 now I guess|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: accurate discarding by both defenders|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if East would have 3@S (with Jxx in South), the lead @H help the declarer to make 3Nt (squeeze against West) - he must keep at 6 cards 3@S 2@h so declarer can play @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which certainly strengthens argument for spade lead|pg||

nt|blum1956: If declarer had won the first trick he could endplay West. But now he is 1 trick short|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if playing support doubles and E was not sure about 2D, he could have waffled with a heart preference, having denied them of them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: denied three of them|pg||

nt|bridge_one: perhaps a misunderstand about 2Nt|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: Activity from South!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK; so you count @HQ as a top trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not how I learned to count them|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a number of specs have done so|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: i feel a 3n coming ion here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C can be a balanced hand about 20 hcp with others type of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is charmed to hear 2C on his right|pg||
nt|jbgood: you like the spade bid?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 5 can be made on any lead  and defense but not percentage   i thk|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Better to have 3nt on E because a @h lead is rather celar from N|pg||
nt|deltadash: friendly hand here, every suit breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT was limit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: clear...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lebridgeur: I am not keen but greeen against red |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: red cards flying across the table|pg||
nt|deltadash: or well placed :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did not learn to look at the opponents cards either|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: 2NT bal 20:-|pg||
nt|ady: this booked for down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard for N to pass 2C.... :):)|pg||
nt|kit: difficult lead for West|pg||
nt|lestergold: top tricks are what actually cash had @ds not broken there would have been less|pg||
nt|othered1: What was the 2N response?  Looks weird, since it could misposition NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 15 is logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't look at all 4 hands, do you Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i look out of the window like i did at school and got whacked all the time |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: last making spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3NT from S makes probably as East is squeezed for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probability about it 3 rounds of heart a spade swirch then east has to find 4 discards on the clubs and is mullered|pg||
nt|blum1956: But that was not clear for Nunes in the course of bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT might have made on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he can come to 9 tricks in time?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: North needs a way to show a diamond suit, and South needs a way to find out how good they are  |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: Very well thought out choice IMO|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@c looked better than 6@s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: suggested 2N was a control-showing response, but that seems odd due to potential positioning on a flatish hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, 2@C-3@c (+ve in @d)-3@D (how good)- some step response to show all three top honours|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: so 11 out, and deservedly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course there are tose who would say that a grand which depends on a 3/2 break should not be bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the results merchants and in thiscase teammates wont be happy|pg||
nt|blum1956: It does not - only 4 diamonds with East |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|blum1956: too much|pg||
nt|deltadash: Right Roland - won't be easy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in my system i use 2@H/@S by North to give 5cards with maximum 3 hcp|pg||
nt|blum1956: there is a choice - normally it is better to play 1NT then to defend it. But this vulnerability may be exclusive so Fantoni passed. EW prefere to defend 1@s|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lebridgeur: previous board open room  one @h opening  one @s overcall but 4 @h was the final contract|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzrq: our cclub leading  (wcg   1,  Matunga  2,  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club switch now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: But not so easy|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Next time you are S with AK9 of hearts and they lead a low heart, remember to win with the ace and lead back the nine. W ducked here...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: facing this dummy i meant|pg||
nt|kit: But you would never do that, as don't expect West to have led from J10xx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but what do you have to lose? if they are 32 you are still fine|pg||
nt|ady: must take winners now|pg||
nt|ady: at least must take A@S if cashing trump winner|pg||
nt|roswolf: club switch needed i think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: Nunes getting lots of tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Pulga had switch to a club, the defence would have been a tempo ahead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: W has time to play a @s from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now declarer has time to set up a spade trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 5, Bocchi-Madala also stopped in 4@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lebridgeur: urgent to ruff @s Jack|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: well done|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and play trump if not overruffed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was a very difficult defence, mind you|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|nt|blum1956: not needed this time - 10 tricks always|pg||
nt|kit: But if playing the suit yourself, with AK9 in closed hand opposite 87xxx, lead Ace, and if honor fall on right, continue with 9 and watch LHO sweat.|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - still needs an alert defense to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not all that clear that it wasn't right to set up partner's heart|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lebridgeur: Jack of @h is alright for time being|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: i don;t like winning the D ace. surely S has the queen, so why give him an entry to dummy in diamonds?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E is discarding after N|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lebridgeur: made !!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: right, but it isnt really different when they lead a heart to the queen, you do the same|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: too late|pg||
nt|jbgood: so THAT is why he bid 1 @s:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: neither E nor W saw the danger|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|cT|nt|vugraphzrr: bye all see ya in 10mins|pg||

nt|roswolf: another slam hand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Much better than odds on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as 3-2 in itself is 68%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult for South, in a way. 2NT did not exactly sound like an almost-solid five-card suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes what i meant is against the yardstick for b idding a grand which is higer than 505 requirement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To se how defence should be, N could have playes low on @d10 and watched discard from S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: on   5 that is|pg||

mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: teh|pg||

nt|lestergold: 505|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i feel a frying pan into the fire possibility here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50%|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt shows heart support?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: well someone is headed for it but i dont know whom,|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have splintered|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: what difference if majors reversed?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pd will bid my long suit with equal lengths|pg||
nt|kit: if 2@C shows majors, 2@D by partner asks which is longer|pg||
nt|blum1956: now EW may stop short of game|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with W. Dbl for me on 2@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: very interesting...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do know now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will attackclubs first I think|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT down on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile with NS vul your chances of decent score defending 1N are not dismal|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: lost 5 IMP in bidding regained 4 in play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: do you want to be there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: not down on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: count again|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N from west actually looks pretty good|pg||
nt|blum1956: Well, not 15 top tricks as on the previous board but 9 I can count|pg||
nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|ady: yes    sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: irony here is 3n is a lot better a contract than 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: but you cannot accuse anyone of mis bidding here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: 6@h looks easy with 2-2 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North could not afford to duck that diamond, Ralf. Then declarer can abandon the suit and turn his attention to clubs while he is keeping North off lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|blum1956: looks close|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is too good to give up on defending so double of 2@c seems right|pg||
nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: better spades and a weaker hand for the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|othered1: kOn long run expectations, yes, but 2@H needs to be very unlucky to go minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I guess club finesse now, then spade to jack|pg||
nt|ady: now club to the 10 ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|deltadash: this one is a pretty cut and dried 6H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|lestergold: well 4@h went 3 light it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So winning the jack was correct, but ...|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: all scores are in now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C  1 or 4|pg||
mb|5H|nt|blum1956: What system do Sementa-Duboin play? If the 1@h opening is restricted to 15-16 HCP then 2NT was a better rebid. Otherwise it looks not easy to reach 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: playing spades first|pg||
nt|kit: this order doesn't feel right to me, but it works okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H sign-off opposite 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 4 you are supposed to raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|deltadash: this would be a BIG 'oops'!!!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: e/w here will be very pleased to get a plus   when they might have lost a game swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h a gross contract apparently gross overbidding|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|blum1956: The @cQ in the second trick was better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blum1956: That's why I prefer Precision or old-fashioned Polish club to the natural system|pg||
nt|lestergold: as I often say to David a bit liem certain club member we both know|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny that a disciplined weak 2D may get you to 3N, since east wouild have strong reason to upgrade KJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ady: defenders will have to conced a heart |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: west opened 1@D in OR   as many would     they still could not find 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Dont agree Roland! I play @cK and if declarer ducks play @cQ|pg||

nt|marlowepi: E did well to play club king not queen but to no avail|pg||
nt|kit: or maybe West believed his partner's king of clubs and played his partner for king of diamonds?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as you said, Kit, the overcall might get rewarded:)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s need to find their way to a diamond contract    somewhat difficult|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: unfit  is the proposal from many spec|pg||
nt|lestergold: truth of them tatre is that real life at the table isnt a bidding com,petition biggest fear of players ina teams game is failing to bid a making game not going off in an unlucky ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: one|pg||
nt|othered1: You may stay out of that with a weak NT opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: or as mu dog says: sniff it ... bid it...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The philosophy these days is to leave no possible game unbid..|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jacksond: there are hands where only makeable grand slam is in the 3/3 fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: I also think it is unfair to Moyse that his name is connected to all weird trump fits - the 4-3 fit is actually a fit:)|pg||

nt|othered1: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|blum1956: Another test. this time for NS. Will they reach 4@h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its abit like criminal justice- if you are going to make sure you convict allk theguilty ones you will have to convict a few innocent iones|pg||
nt|othered1: south will move over any type of support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent hand for a Bergen raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 5cM|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess there has to be one that's decent|pg||
nt|lestergold: or the converse if you want to make sure you dont convict an innocent one you release many of the guilty ones|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: 2H or 2S|pg||

pc|sA|nt|kit: 2@S might survive anyway -- not sure|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if 1diamond is hearts  2cl is  obvious bid|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lebridgeur: op|pg||
nt|blum1956: IThere are some problems in the play thanks to the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|jbgood: a reasonable contract though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: optimism by both EW   should be one down|pg||
nt|lestergold: or foolhardy?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR east was able to bid a mere 2N|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: well shape is everythimng points count for little by comparison|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: 10-13 unbalanced - yes, 3 NT makes. Spades behave!|pg||
nt|blum1956: In Russia we play 2NT opening for minors|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: The declarer needs to realise early that he must discard the 3rd club on the heart rather than ruffing one|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting choice of lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blum1956: But the defenders may play clubs themselfe so the trump coup is needed|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the trump coup just does not work against best defense|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes as South may discard two hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is likely to get the trumps right here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: clming 4 in 5 seconds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: Declarer properly attacking his side suit first -- he needs to develop diamond tricks in all variations.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nd 10 tricks|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lebridgeur: Queen of @c now  and South must discard @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it is all a question of would holds the 10 of @d from North point of wiew   not that clear|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway I cannot find a sensible alternative for North. But Fantoni is better...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West did well to hide his 10 of @h   both red tens are essential for the defense  @s could be right !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Not that easy to see that 10 of @s could do harm to the defense|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: difficult for the team that must win any IMP to play with this kinds of hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, in 2S he can afford to suffer a ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the heart lead might not prove that safe. for example, dummy might have Q9x|pg||

mb|2D|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: looks like a strong NT to me|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think this will go off in practice|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10-13 and unbalanced, 5+ spades for Nunes opening|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Less expensive than 5@h (-990 instead of -1100)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they will get to 4@h here too|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: only a trump lead and a heart return guarantee the success of the defense|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I think S will make now. Discard 2 @h and play 3 rounds oof @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: belay that....|pg||
nt|othered1: east might get fatally tapped on continued @S plays for extra undertricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West may be tempted by 5@d now - may think singleton spade with East |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like Villa are starting to fall behind a bit |pg||
nt|othered1: Is that pass forcing?  I don't think it should be.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||

nt|blum1956: 4@s may well be a make from Duboin's point of view - for example one trick in each side suit and that's all. Therefore to double that was  not an easy decision|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to show where his values lay|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt made in  board 9 againsta  bad defence|pg||

mb|4H|nt|roswolf: a game try of 41H seems appropriate|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: But NS have a good save in 7m (esp @D)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: heart lead, spade knocked out, another low heart, then W squeezed late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D would show spades|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 6@H doubled with overtrick may gain points|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out that EW in OR had kept themselves out of slam, then were doubled|pg||
nt|blum1956: Will Sementa figure out that his partner has just one side card, not two&|pg||
nt|othered1: In an auction with both sides bidding up with double fits, just buying the contract may be enough to win the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting here that North has stayed out of this auction. |pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR the double NS fit was known.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Perhaps he has no descriptive action - not that anything seems particularly obvious |pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Where is that button?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: yes   correct|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S running diamonds before spades so as to end in dummy|pg||
nt|blum1956: will Nunes remove this?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: Fantoni warned off from further action with his decent hand|pg||
nt|ady: 1st round west overcalled 1@H in OR   north doubled   |pg||
nt|othered1: What was 2N?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2 keycards and a void - they should have a special bid for that case|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some kind of relay you would think|pg||
nt|othered1: I doubt 2N was natural. Other than that I've had suggestions of various hands, from cue-bid to, asks other suit, to shows @H fit.  Maybe 2@D means something other than simple ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Michaels?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2 key cards and a void could still have 2 minor losers of course|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|blum1956: Is the 1@h 3rd in hand also strong by their system?|pg||
nt|ady: cashes the diamonds before completing the spades |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: another  4@s made  |pg||
nt|othered1: It's suggested they play Ghestem and that 2@D is specific to majors.|pg||
nt|deltadash: who's got the button???? lol|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lebridgeur: good sacrifice in @h|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|kit: I'm surprised that, holding KQx hearts and 4-3-3-3 that North bothered looking for 4-4 spade fit|pg||

nt|jbgood: no - but may be|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: both   ruff @d :):)|pg||
nt|blum1956: It was a difficult task for Nunes. His hand is worst possible from the defensive point of view but he knows few about partner's hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one spec  points that 4 @s  goes down on the " obvious" @s lead he is right on principle|pg||
nt|blum1956: But in this vulnerability he probably loses only 200 if 5@h proves to be wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 2@D is majors|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: yes one way or another should have been able to bid 3N with finality, |pg||

pc|h8|nt|blum1956: Did Garbosi forget their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am told 2 @h is two way  weak support in @s or stong with @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only 10imps difference with 36 boards to go   but this one could be bad for Garbosi|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the 4@s bid should of course imply the weak spade support hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead beats 5@s, other leads probably do not|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like that weak nt is back|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: transfer seems like it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: let us see |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1500 kibs watching this match here on BBO - quite a crowd!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @d attracting  on the bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: If North leads a heart the declarer wins and plays on diamonds. If the defense plays trumps twice the diamond suit works otherwise two hearts may be ruffed|pg||
nt|othered1: over 3@C, south's hand does look defensive and there's nothing certain about any offensive action|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means support in @H limit or + - i agree 4@S can be too much|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should just bid 3@S -- his partner will have better idea whether or not 4@H is making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: And opponents haven't bid to 4@H yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: !|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S has "Limit + " chances of 4S goading N into 5H are greatly reduced|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well done    no declarer task very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead triumph|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @s and @c  should easier now|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might have been a little more enterprising -he might have doubled 2nt to show values in the minors - but he no doubt is deflated by the poor run of boards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: asking for 5crd majors, or a possible 4441|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|blum1956: Even the trump is OK |pg||
nt|ady: should make this for a push|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: 3@S is then a transfer to 3NT|pg||

nt|ady: 21 combined hcp   2NT   n/s OR   optimistic|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: possible slam|pg||
nt|kit: possible swing here if slam is reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4 of a major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: people open and respond on such light hands these days that you need 1NT "sandwich" as strong balanced - but whether a flat 15-count is worth it is debatable|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 2@S if allowed to play    small loss|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jbgood: sry folks, have to leave you. Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: he has a good hand - 5-card suit, controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S will call slam|pg||
nt|ady: only nade 11 tricks OR     must has miss guessed hearts|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lestergold: 3 @c and 3! aces for defence look avaialble here|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 nt will not make ¨- neither would 2 @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|blum1956: 4@s is better than 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2H response would sometimes work out well by protecting club holding (or in other ways), but usually right to show 4-card support immediately|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not a  bad contract but   @s far behaving|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: try crossruff - trump coup may probably work in the ending. But Nunes is not aware of the trump position|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   may go down   but not 3 down    £@S   should be fown  so another pick up for Villa|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best lead....|pg||
nt|roswolf: this bidding looks odd as many transfer responses are|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would expect north to play nt a vast majority of the time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: entrys to hand may be awkward|pg||
nt|roswolf: will be awkward|pg||
nt|deltadash: the entire hand looks awkward to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: setting up the spade suit seems to appeal to many specs - i agree|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blum1956: not a lot of defense in the East hand therefore not suitable for trupping|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: A heart lead is safer on this hand but i understand west's reluctance to lead it|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer seems to agree too|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: The play is rather clear, play on @d and @h. Otherwise you will lose 2@s 1 @h, 1@c and 1@c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Interesting board 13 in the other room. I'd like to know why Helgemo dropped the stiff @SK offside in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Dubion in OR   finessed 2nd round of hearts  |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: operator ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: he hears you|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Table feel I suppose|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South was afraid about to play slam knowing North without singleton and limited strength|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed ralf|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Against the odds|pg||
pc|d9|nt|blum1956: 3@d makes with a diamond guess only|pg||

nt|blum1956: Now this shold be easy for Duboin provided that Sement shows diamond suit ans short spades|pg||
nt|ady: paaarently transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: CC says Stayman, transfers, shortness at 3-level - not much on second-round actions|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@C is 5+@D + 4@H or 6@D+1@C, 3@D is relay, 3@S in short in spades with 5+@D + 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: That describes 12 of east's cards very well.|pg||

mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: RD ?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like this 2@S call one bit -- partner might not even have 4 spades, and wrong hand gets tapped.|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: not that dull|pg||

nt|blum1956: Nort must duck a heart |pg||

nt|blum1956: any lead may create ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i see he may have difficulties in establishing and enjoying 2 @hs|pg||
nt|kit: But I'm still not so sure I like it|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jbgood: ... but the spade king:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a spec opines that 2nt might be 2way either sygnoff in clubs or setting in spades |pg||

nt|roswolf: slam is certain now = wrong again:(|pg||
nt|deltadash: Oh, well, Geoff, we've all been there many times and will be again :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never in the picture in the other room|pg||
mb|5D|nt|othered1: Has east limited his hand yet?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Even if he ruffs high should go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: not possible to ruff two clubs|pg||

nt|roswolf: are we trying for a grand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not|pg||
nt|deltadash: I think we're done now|pg||

nt|bridge_one: a conservative pass at 2@S by North could be made in this auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now discard a @D seam the best line|pg||
nt|kit: Not surprisingly, this hand plays a lot better in clubs than in spades|pg||
nt|kit: yes, diamond discards seem right -- but with spades 4-2 I don't think that will be good enough|pg||

nt|ady: another partial|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Giusy Di Dio. Great Job! Our appreciation to the organisers , The FIGB (Gianluca Frola)for ensuring ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Diane, Ralf, Mustapha and Roland for their company and wit and to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|deltadash: specs are pointing out that a @d lead would have made a big difference|pg||
mb|1N|nt|blum1956: that will be a flat board. It rarely pays to be so passive as NS in the open room. 4@s is not that bad after all|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C in OR   way overboard   fortunate to escape double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kit: 3NT is quite possible, and looks like it will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N opened those other junky hands, i am surprised he passed this one, which actually has some positive features|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - 3nt is a normal contract here|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 9 trick level not  good for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 21 hcp  and no fit   an unlikely contract|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Dinner break now, back in 1 hour and 50 minutes, at 21.15 local time|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Roland - also for your nevertireing work for BBO!|pg||
nt|kit: "normal" on 22 high is a strong statement :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: thks all - collegues & spectators|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not as strong a statement as this auctrion|pg||
mb|2H|nt|blum1956: It id possible to make 10 in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unless bid from hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: AKQ109x can make 6 tricks in many layout ....|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: west can clear the diamonds now|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even 5@d is in danger but Fantoni probably does not exclude that 6@d are on the table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nothing more to do in this match, so I wish you all a nice weekend. Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|deltadash: Bye Ralf and thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: damp squib ending|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: yes, rather unlucky this time|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder if West should have taken a shot and doublet -- he knows clubs aren't running if that's declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am still a bit agog at the auction|pg||
nt|ady: even if west switches to a spade   should go down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S must think they are down by 50|pg||
nt|ady: maybe down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|0  bamba: ma|pg||
nt|ady: is this last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx to all:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lebridgeur: natural ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, Michael, JP and Jon|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: opening 3@C  in OR   followed by 3@D  and then 4@C    hence same contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: trying to make    diamond to queen now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes well done to allegra|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|lebridgeur: 0.3  ace =4 NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lunch break now. Restart in 2 hours and 15 minutes, at 14.30 local time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: double finesse in diamonds is the best chance|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: declarer think West without control in @C for the switch in @S at second trick|pg||
