nt|ady: 4@H   may be made  with a squeeze in diamonds and spades  on south|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: i believe e/w are playing a natural 5 card major system|pg||

nt|vugraphzrt: Nevena|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: sorry  already 10 tricks    can made an 11th|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 1@S overcall is yuck and vul too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceking: Normal play here will lead to one down i predict 4 round of clubs-try AK of spades No Q drop and lose to heart finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: south doesnt even have a ggod quality suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzrz: now declarer sees diamonds 5-3.. he migt go for endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: good|pg||
nt|ady: I would expect east to make 11 tricks|pg||

nt|mdgraham: is there an upside to overcalling 1@S on that hand?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: None, imho|pg||
nt|georgia19: nasty contract to play, but unavoidable to be in it|pg||
nt|roswolf: another trappy hand for e/w|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: agree  - weak suit, weak hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: yup, another -1 game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difference was that on board 1 declarer's Kx was worth a trick; on board 2 it wasn't|pg||
nt|roswolf: preempting to the limit|pg||
mb|5D|nt|iceking: 11 rule though indicated diamonds were 5-3 so he should gone for endplay maybe but he knows Páll is very tricky could lead from any card from any holdings|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: should be rather easy to get to 7s after this start|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: in the closed room south opened a strong club|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: and when north responded 2n, south bid 3c intended as stayman/baron, but north took it as natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: as Raggi normally plays very honest carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: he probably got confused by d2 at trick 2|pg||
nt|ady: only possible game   4@S  for n/s|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|ady: 5@D   has 3 losers with bad trump split|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass imo|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   can make as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: kept e/w quiet anyway|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzrt: waterloe "hope im not too good"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with four-card support, it's pushing the boundaries to raise to 3@H as West, particularly with three small spades |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i think south took the correct view on this hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|georgia19: well I hadn't expected Crouch to do that - and he's got away with it undoubled - not that it matters|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: EW will be happy with what they get - they will observe 4@H goes down|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: he will check if spades 40 ... if not, then he will claim|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: yes he might well say that and perhaps vul he would have gone for it|pg||

nt|cuttysark: hard to blame West for having a punt a 3NT - partner's heart stopper could be slightly better|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|djneill:  East has two choices - the quick steal of a @c (followed by 6@d, 1@s to make contract), or the pressure-cooker, which is better?|pg||
nt|ewj: it could be quite a bit worse though?|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: look destined for 3NT  e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: another difficult hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzrz: a very good result for ew in closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: after west opened, east didnt stop below 6|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: well an easy game to bid but may be trickier to play|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|iceking: 1nt and end there|pg||
nt|ady: could just get overboard   finding 9 card diamond fit     limit 11 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: now i agree with that overcall - good quality suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: coffee board not much in this one |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|iceking: oh boy going for range asking with 9hcp |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i bet 2sp was misbid |pg||
nt|iceking: when you play range asking stayman 2sp here shows 10-11hcp 4sp|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: their version is a little different... 2s is 13-15 wth 4s|pg||
nt|iceking: yes 2d all min|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: or that is what north said|pg||
nt|iceking: correct|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: north gets the slam scent|pg||
nt|ady: n/s limit is 10 tricks on a diamond lead   so n/s have to be careful not to go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after 1M-2N (raise), can use double as a minor plus the other major - here 3@H pre-empts diamonds, if that is your fit|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it's like the song the West Ham fans sing - we're going down, we're going down, (etc)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But it's an error, end of story|pg||

nt|georgia19: i'll just have to get more up to date|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Best treatment in my opinion is to ignore the double and respond as you would have without a double. So 1@S, natural and forcing|pg||
