mb|4H|nt|lestergold: Good evening Guy David and Chick|pg||
nt|dburn: may not be practical to show his clubs instead of his spade support, and he can't do both|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 9 hcp in the majors, minors not a good description|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like they're trying to create havoc for the leaders.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but it has created problems for E-W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|dburn: because partner might raise 4@c to five when 4@s is a much better contract|pg||

nt|chick: hello Mike|pg||

pc|d4|nt|joest: maybe not if the range is 14-16|pg||

nt|lestergold: funnily enuf cannot cost bennet now to duck this @d|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: and he will get a pleasant surprise|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: the defenders may have to give him that heart anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but he needs to guess the position|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||

nt|jallerton: 87-82|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Preciously fast at this table|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: declarer might have played clubs like that if he had @CA10xxx and no entry|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: but if he really needed four club tricks for his contract he would surely take another finesse|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C!|nt|jallerton: Wise 1NT overcall.  In th other room, Bennett passed, and then his partner did not believe he was this strong|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|athene: 2@C is hearts and another?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass does not appeal against NV opps|pg||
nt|athene: playing an asptro-like defence, since neither side has announced any suits?|pg||

pc|cT|pc|h6|nt|jallerton: or maybe only 10 here after that "undo" in clubs!|pg||
nt|athene: dealing with nebulous 1@C openers is one of the most important topics in modern bidding - you see people shut out of the auction all the time|pg||

nt|jcwla: No, North has nothing to add.|pg||
nt|lestergold: not at ll easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: that was slightly counter-indicated - with @sQJ10x @hAxxxx  @dxx @cAx, South might have bid over the weak no trump|pg||

mb|3C|nt|henryb:  overbid with 2@s or underbid with 2@d?|pg||
nt|joest: interesting. In USA inverted in competition not that common|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not going to be easy now for East-West to reach 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|joest: if you play 2@d is a normal raise, you just bid 2@d :)|pg||
nt|dburn: yet another example of how easy it is for nebulous one of a minor openings to steal from the opponents|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: this one won't be a challenge|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: Green not showing a great deal of respect for his partner's entry at 3 level at unfavourable vul|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|blum1956: The typical bidding here nowdays is 1NT-(2@s)-3NT-all pass|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, East should probably have bid 1NT over 1@c even if he couldn't bid a natural 2@c|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|joest: right.  For pairs that open 1NT with six card minors, with 5-4 in the minor etc. :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nice spade spots dummy has|pg||
nt|jallerton: a thin game - the play is the thing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: It's about avoiding two club losers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and still be able to pick up trumps|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the best defence will be to lead diamonds repeatedly|pg||
nt|athene: giving ruff-and-discards, trying to weaken declarer's trumps|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what the plural of "ruff-and-discard" should be :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Score is 87-93. 4 IMPs to Bowles after a TD ruling not included on the scoreboard|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: Excellent 6@S now|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@s is certainly reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 4@s reasonable for North-South here, but not so easy to bid|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|joest: on this layout you might need mirrors to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  too good for Roland, who would want to be in 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I changed my approach and came up with Roland's Rule|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes?|pg||
nt|blum1956: not that easy to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Only bid the slams that make and remember to pick the right strain"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Feel free to add it to your CC|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that Bob Hamman got to that one first|pg||
nt|blum1956: spades 4-1 and the @cJ fourth|pg||
nt|joest: Roland I believe you should also add "and ask the opponents to put their cards face up on the table"|pg||
nt|joest: that will permit you to hook the club ten on this board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is routine play|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d spades and another|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: that puts a damper on 4@s for ns|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@h "not four spades"|pg||
nt|dburn: and the rest more or less inevitable|pg||
nt|dburn: although it would not be wrong for North to have raised|pg||
nt|deltadash: agree David|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  Or if you are Deep Finesse|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: if west opens @d not playing say a weak nt its still going to bne hard to reach 4@s south will not place a high calue on Qx @d|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, you have to give partner some rope for bidding over an opposing 1NT, but especially when that opening is weak, not all that much rope|pg||
nt|chick: N's holding in the "other" suit (presumably a minor) is not very helpful in spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|joest: I think you can make it without hooking the club but it is also some 'good card reading'|pg||
nt|henryb:  Meanwhile E-W are busy relaying|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s requires reasonable behaviour in both black suits its not that great a contract|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  The yellow outlines on bids mean that the bid was alerted at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are grey in the Win version|pg||
nt|joest: henry has long marched to his own drummer Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S will take even longer to play than to bid|pg||
nt|joest: as has been pointed out to me, with hearts 33 you will make it on most normal lines|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Remember that West will be declarer here. How do you play on a diamond lead?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  and it becomes trivial after N leads the @dQ, as you pitch one of the @h losers immediately, the other later on the @dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: E said W showed 8-9PC|pg||
nt|blum1956: but declarer may try something in order not to depend on guessing the @sQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: You can even make it if you ruff but it will be more complicated|pg||
nt|blum1956: and he does - which probably leads to the defeat|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: So why did he not let this run, Henry?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: might not have made on this line either - not that this line is wrong|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Verhees is a strong player|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d6|pc|h2|nt|jcwla: Seemingly if there is any chance for another pair to win this event Verhees must fail in this slam.|pg||
nt|joest: now you need to take an anti% view it seems to me|pg||
nt|henryb:  Does anyone know how far ahead they are after match 10?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 697-342|pg||
nt|joest: way way ahed|pg||
nt|joest: *ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 355 IMPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ for standings|pg||
nt|blum1956: It seems he needs a club finesse now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In theory you could lose 60 IMPs on this deal alone. 5 x 12 IMPs|pg||

nt|jallerton: lead changes hands again 97-93 to Hillman|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had a heart fit, wouldn't he have just raised hearts most of the time?|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|athene: and even if he has, he can't run the hearts until he has done something about west's @SKxx|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: Not quite. It has now ben announced that 4 IMPs have changed hands, so adding 4 IMPs to Bowles is correct, but one must also subtract 4 IMPs from Hilllman|pg||
nt|athene: declarer perhaps was thinking of @DQxx with declarer in which case there might be a discard of one of dummy's clubs on the @DQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but then cashing the @CA is still not necessary - only cashing @CA and @CK if partner has that card|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Before the ruling, Hillman had 4 IKMPs on the board in question. That has been changed to 4 IMPs to the other side|pg||

nt|joest: there is a natural discinlination however to 'go down' at trick one although admittedly taking a pitch there isn't doing exactly that|pg||

nt|athene: west might have visions of 5minor now|pg||
nt|athene: his hand is pretty good facing short spades|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: but east is a passed hand - you would want to catch him with a five-card minor to want to be in 5|pg||

nt|jallerton: 5@C has too much work to do anyway.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much, there is even a risk of going 2 down|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer needs the @d finesse, but is 99% sure that it is wrong|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to throw the diamonds on hearts, he has to draw trumps, and then he just has no tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rosen was thinking for a while before he passed. Of doubling one would assume|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he was a minor-suit jack short of a double, i guess, on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even a minor-suit ten|pg||

nt|dburn: Howard and Bowles did bid 3NT on 35 (Howard overcalled 1NT after 1@c), so Bowles regains the lead by two|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: east west need to "save" in 5@d|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|joest: hearts plays much better for n-s|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Would everyone open this hand?|pg||
nt|joest: not I I'm afraid|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the slam, it seems to me that if Briggida has given you the @dK she means you to use it to some purpose|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wat unfave vul not shy|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT looks a bit odd - supposed to be either a limit raise to 3@s or a hand too weak for a constructive raise to 2@s (or just natural without spades)|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Osborne didn't like those minor-suit queens and is treating it as a bad raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|chick: I'd agree with that, it IS a bad raise to 2@S :)|pg||
nt|deltadash: for sure :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not unreasonable Hinden wise to pass a trump lead woujld not be nice against 3@s|pg||
nt|dburn: I am told that a Director's ruling has resulted in an award of 4 IMPs to Bowles, who therefore lead by six|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably doubled by west|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: I would open 2@H, 8-11 both majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: Many pairs have no option to open weak with 55 in majors. So they choose between pass and 1@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@c looks like hard work|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: it does, and I am not quite sure why Green bid it - trying for five of a minor facing a hand that could not open the bidding seems uppish|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if partner had a fifth trump I guess five might not be so bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think it can be made on this layout even if he guesses the clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|joest: i guess I'm old fashioned.  I can always pass and then enter with a minor suit cue bid|pg||
nt|joest: but if I bid 1@s we could easily get too high if partner takes me seriously|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or a takeout double|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant affo9rd to draw trumps because spades will force him out|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: Jones and Rosen did find game on 36, and Jones played it well for 10 IMPs to Hillman and the lead by four|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should have appreciated that most of pard's high card assets were bound to be in hearts for this takeout double|pg||
nt|dburn: one set to go after this - anyone's match, and the bridge has been pretty good as well as exciting|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: Osborne may be reluctant to let Hinden ruff declarer's "losing" diamond|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|joest: and when there has already been onepass to me, the odds have increased partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|dburn: but it was probably his only effective defence - that @hJ is a good card for Green to have|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|dburn: no doubt Osborne hoped Hinden had it - the odds were pretty good that she did, after all|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT made in comfort on a @C lead in CR.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s7|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|lestergold: sadly for n/s didnt go off in open|pg||

pc|h9|nt|blum1956: So 1@s prevails over pass. Even the heart game was excellent|pg||
