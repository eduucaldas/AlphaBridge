nt|vugraphzrm: Evening everybody. Again, sorry for the late start.....|pg||
nt|athene: the east hand is pretty suitable for hearts with an ace and a side singleton |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrt2000: EW now unlikely to get to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland has appeared just in time to enciourage tn/s to bid the spade slam needing a good view in @d|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks and possibly 12 for n/s in spades|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: 6@s or 6@d on a guess|pg||

nt|robinswr: but west could be 5-5 in clubs and hearts |pg||

nt|ralfwil: If you play 6@s the guess id easier, because @s are 3-1 and you cannot pick up @dQxx in front|pg||
nt|ady: North made a good forcing pass if 5@H   and with void heart Graham Osborne took the push to the 5 level|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|robinswr: east should have bid 1nt. don't raise unless you can accept at least one game try|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: cannot see this making, without a lot of help from the opponents anyway!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: interesting that east might have bid 1nt - i was thinking WEST might open 1nt instead of 1@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: i must say that this is agressive bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: East uncertain what kind of game try was made.....|pg||
nt|athene: you can't count your heart honours and your ruffing value as two separate things really|pg||
nt|mrt2000: the lure of the vulnerable game!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Osborne is a well known expert player certainkly in top 20 or 30 in England|pg||

pc|s7|nt|athene: now @C10 throwing @DJ?|pg||
nt|athene: but north can simply play another club and let south kill the winner|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, but it doesn't really help|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|athene: at least that does mean they can't draw east's third trump to stop a spade ruff|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: Sarah in deep thought. Just touched the @C8|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: And reconsidered|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredrik Björnlund is from Sweden originally. He used to partner Peter Fredin. That was not a success|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: We are in Acol-land as you see|pg||
nt|robinswr: i was wondering what the rebid was going to be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-card majors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s from S?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|Walddk2: Major before minor|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: will they stop in 5@D?|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s best defend now|pg||
nt|ady: ne/w climing overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: 3@H described as distributional spade raise|pg||
mb|4H|nt|robinswr: 1heart - 1spade leads to bad auctions|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hard for me to understand that this does not show 5 hearts|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: what is your opening bid with 4441? I prefer highest minor|pg||
pc|c4|nt|robinswr: thornton could have describe his hand by bidding 3spades over 2diamonds if that was a splinter|pg||
nt|mrt2000: makes a @S lead to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: south might regret not doubling 3@S|pg||
nt|mrt2000: which is why I think S should have X'd 3@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|robinswr: if he doubled 3spades, they might not get to 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't they get one more chance?|pg||
nt|athene: he has a pretty good hand - no way they are playing 3@SXX up one or anything like that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do|pg||
nt|mrt2000: possibly so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Björnlund will surely switch to a spade|pg||
nt|athene: west should perhaps rise with the @CQ to try to induce a club continuation rather than a spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: e/w way out of reach|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: what asilly contract and a serious contravention of Burn's law|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: He's playing in the next room. I can get him??|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he should be called|pg||
nt|ady: west  could have considered passing 2nd round with an aceless wonder 12 hcp inclusingf stiff king of opps suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: @S9 being fingered|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: now the @H10|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|ady: wish I had such worries when defending|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d switch from N and crossruff in the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Both Todd and Sheehan have their fingers in their mouths!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: perhaps it's a bit transparent but it doesn't hurt to try these things|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: It can't hurt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrt2000: N better unblock here|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: @DA is the percentage play now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It caters for singleton king in either hand|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ady: n/s have very little to make   might be struggling to make 1NT on a heart lead|pg||

nt|robinswr: but he has to get rid of his club loser|pg||
nt|mrt2000: ruff it in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: when a defender has long trumps like this you can often grab 8 tricks or so with fast winners and ruffs and then you know the defender is down to all trumps and he has to ruff ...|pg||
nt|athene: something and lead into you at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: South muttering to himself|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then no communication to hand. Better to pitch it on a diamond|pg||
