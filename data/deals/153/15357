nt|ahollan1: how strong does east need to be for 2N?   or maybe that is used as lebensohl-like|pg||
nt|rv: some might have bid 3@s as pre-emptive or mixed raise on 1@s, that would have made the auction more interesting |pg||

nt|rv: 3@s has taken away too much bidding space|pg||
nt|dweeb: 2s was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: after North's 4@h, South can definitely commit to 5 level, strange 4@s indeed|pg||

nt|ahollan1: don't be confused by NS profiles ---  North is the only PAM   South is Wayne [bbo=cascades]|pg||
nt|rv: after a 8+card major fit is found in GF auction, a bid of 3n by either side of partnership shows one of serious (extras) or non-serious (no extras, just courtsey cue)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: queestion is what shd Burrows bid over 4h-cant bid 4nt with void, a bid of 5C may mislead-may be 5S then?|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: all is well that ends well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C didn't establish game force, but I suspect 3@S did -- and probably exactly 3@S support|pg||
nt|rv: Pam's 5@d was a brave bid, maybe this NS partnership do play non-serious 3n and Burrows's 4d did show sufficient extras|pg||
nt|rv: I can't see Pam bidding 5@d otherwise expecially with her poor trumps, she can't be sure 5 level is safe unless partner is showing extras|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: it is a moot point -whether 3 aces should fuel so many bids-but result is fine|pg||
