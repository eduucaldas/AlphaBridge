mb|1D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|rv: East is likely to bid 3@c here and not pass this double|pg||

mb|p|mb|6D|nt|Walddk3: No result entered on board 1 in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: over 2s X, it is worthwhile to play some convention like Lebensohl in E seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how strong does east need to be for 2N?   or maybe that is used as lebensohl-like|pg||
nt|rv: some might have bid 3@s as pre-emptive or mixed raise on 1@s, that would have made the auction more interesting |pg||
nt|psridhar: if 3c can be on 3 hcp or 9 like here, it is tough guessing for W|pg||

nt|rv: 3@s has taken away too much bidding space|pg||

nt|rv: after North's 4@h, South can definitely commit to 5 level, strange 4@s indeed|pg||
nt|psridhar: Burrows probably was discouraged by his cl void|pg||
nt|psridhar: but it seems N is not yet finished|pg||
nt|rv: yes @c void not good, but 4@h very good for Burrows right?|pg||
nt|dweeb: 50/50 vote as to whether Pam goes on|pg||
nt|vugraphzru: long pause|pg||
nt|dweeb: 1/2 the room didn't vote|pg||
nt|rv: I don't think North will go on unless Burrows's 4@d showed extras (if they are playing non-serious 3n)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't be confused by NS profiles ---  North is the only PAM   South is Wayne [bbo=cascades]|pg||
nt|rv: after a 8+card major fit is found in GF auction, a bid of 3n by either side of partnership shows one of serious (extras) or non-serious (no extras, just courtsey cue)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ignore the scores, they are all from the first half|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|psridhar: queestion is what shd Burrows bid over 4h-cant bid 4nt with void, a bid of 5C may mislead-may be 5S then?|pg||

nt|vugraphzru: nope|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|psridhar: all is well that ends well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C didn't establish game force, but I suspect 3@S did -- and probably exactly 3@S support|pg||
nt|rv: Pam's 5@d was a brave bid, maybe this NS partnership do play non-serious 3n and Burrows's 4d did show sufficient extras|pg||
nt|rv: I can't see Pam bidding 5@d otherwise expecially with her poor trumps, she can't be sure 5 level is safe unless partner is showing extras|pg||
nt|psridhar: sure , but the imp scoring is not listening|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psridhar: it is a moot point -whether 3 aces should fuel so many bids-but result is fine|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|dweeb: Wayne and Pam play a frivolous 3NT|pg||

nt|rv: ok, this auction does make some sense in that case, if 3n is frivolous in GF auction with major fit, then direct 4 level cue by passing 3n should show extras|pg||
