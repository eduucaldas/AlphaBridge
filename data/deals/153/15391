mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: good morning all|pg||

nt|daman: soft board to start off|pg||

mb|3D|an| |nt|Walddk4: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are Crouch-Patterson and I have their somewhat complicated system in front of me|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland and Geoffrey |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We may need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Crouch is pitiful on BBO and one of our regular commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 14-16 in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Kath   David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Hi all. Welcome to Solihull|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty   especially on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we saw Townsend & Bakhshi put up a great performance this time yesterday|pg||
nt|daman: Italians always double with hands like East   points before shape|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good evening all|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|daman: I would have passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|pelu: I know - but u are not italiean :9|pg||
nt|daman: I like lasagna    does that count?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S can take 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lots of transfer responses on a strong club base|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|stc: 3@d probably a sort of Bergen|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: anyone know the results?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did they keep it up?|pg||
nt|lestergold: all strong players here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: david are there any results online?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: FEGARTY beat ROBERTS 25-5; PRYOR beat BIRD 25-5; COOPER beat SHILLITOE 23-7; DHONDY beat COPE 18-11 (Cope was penalised 1 VP for slow play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Players seem very chipper for such an early hour|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 nt or 2 @S not much further |pg||
nt|josj: 2@S seems too high already|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h are 3-3 and a @s discard. @d are 3-3 and also a finess after the lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: this lead can help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You got the results before you asked, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's very impressive yes :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: another double fit in the Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: West doing a lot of bidding |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again ralf :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|josj: but it also looks very much a normal contract|pg||
nt|stc: as you can see 4@s by S has good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the results : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Bonjour Laure, Constantin|pg||
nt|Walddk8: and Jos|pg||
nt|josj: Bonjour Laure, Roland, Constantin|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: just for remin you : 1 match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: can make 6 now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: predictable lead which stes up 3 heart tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Sandqvist - McIntosh are members of the England open team, and Crouch-Patterson have won the Camrose Trophy for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: both very good pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqcist originally from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to be a bit careful here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: spade loser soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 after 20 boards: Teltscher +19 IMPs v Rosen, Senior +7 IMPs v Small, Crouch +8 IMPs v Hinden, Hackett P +3 IMPs v DeBotton|pg||
nt|josj: the 2nd @D loser likely to disappear but the @H ruff not...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzqj: remind|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: Michelle must have been having kittens with that awful south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w could be candidates for one of the strongest mixed pairs on the planet|pg||
nt|daman: that's a pretty broad statement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: Cooper +36 v Dhondy, Cope +27 v Pryor, Roberts +19 v Bird, Fegarty +1 v Shillitoe|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: I have to say I don't agree|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: wisely |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Constantin Stancescu|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: yes easier to play the ace and finesse |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but he sin't  doing that |pg||
nt|garnetts: Must admit I cannot see much wrong with 1@H and if I had managed to bid 2@H --then 3@D wouldn't have been on my mind |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: In the balancing position here 2@H should be say a decent six card suit and a reasonable hand --what used to be called intermediate |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: the ace of clubs wont run away|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Constantin|pg||
nt|josj: hi Constantin|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks with a correct play in @c|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: yes it will |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 9 of spades and the good @D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@c, 2@h, 2@s and 1@d = 9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also welcome to our operator, Nicky|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: This line is scary. It's not a good idea to shorten the long hand when you also have fit in a side suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should hold his cards up lol  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing bad will happen here, but on a different layout ....|pg||
nt|haans: tme for a clubs ruff|pg||
nt|haans: time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  has to make 4@C tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 'double dummy' @d lead would probably be only lead to put declarer undr serious pressure here|pg||
nt|ady: may only make 9 obvious tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mwigor: funeral just finished|pg||
nt|yo_yo: your son is in the OR Mike|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mwigor: oops sorry that was meant to be private|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: It's often a good idea to set up your side suit first|pg||
nt|ralfwil: declarer wil have a good count now for playing @c the right way|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: @C to J now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and cross fingers|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N with 4@s, 4@h, 3@d and 2@c.....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's going to be a long night ralf :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Raif Roland Kath and all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: does osborne have a complete count here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and of course also hej Rolkand:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry Roland....|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume hes in a massive tank|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yés N with 4432|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: He certainly is|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this event is over 3 weekends  and the winner gets to play in the Camrose |pg||
nt|yo_yo: (partially self - funded)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is he considering the possibiolity that North has qx @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E is thinking about playing N with @cQx|pg||
nt|mwigor: if he has a complete count (i havent been watching then @hK @d9 is best|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|ady: west will get a count after north shows with 3 trumps   but with singleton Q@D cannot go wrong  in any event|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mwigor: sorry no one loser too many|pg||

nt|ady: 3@D    3NT   likely staert|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg of course a legend and Ms.Senior one of the world's leading lady players|pg||
nt|lestergold: against the long standing partnerhsip of cooke and garvey|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from rainy central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: My second session - will try harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: so uneventful at end of the day |pg||
nt|josj: I cannot help thinking they just missed game on  1|pg||
nt|stc: I expect 4@h -1 here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
nt|daman: I have never heard of the legend and I subscribed to IPBM for years|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey a great bit slightly wild talent|pg||
nt|daman: I have heard of Nevena|pg||
nt|stc: or even 4@s by EW|pg||
nt|stc: in fact 4@s is a making save !|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg is a world class player|pg||
nt|daman: you said legend    he is not a legend|pg||
nt|daman: and I have a plethora of specs who agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a matter of opinion |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h are in, not easy to find|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
nt|daman: he might be a legend in GB|pg||
nt|josj: yes, 5@D should go down by ducking @HA once|pg||
nt|josj: and defeating 5@C is even easier|pg||
nt|stc: and 5@d a phantom save !|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Le classement after 2 matches: Payen 45, Doussot 44, Cronier 42, Laffineur 40, Piganeau 33|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 : After 40 boards Small +39IMPs v Senior, Rosen +33IMPs v Teltscher, Crouch +5IMPs v Hinden, DeBotton +3IMPs v Hackett P|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: fantastic pass from West    winning action|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: why not open weak 2@s? Or Multi? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  12-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: er my son has a louder voice and is a lot bigger!|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Classement = standings|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: ok then very well known player :)|pg||
nt|daman: cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is originally from swedn and plays a great deal internationally especially the S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the US|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You have never heard of Nevena Senior, George?|pg||
nt|pelu: but long way from US to Canada :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2 : After 40 boards Cope +18IMPs v Pryor, Dhondy +16IMPs v Cooper, Shillitoe +11IMPs v Fagarty, Bird +6IMPs v Roberts|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone make sense of this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might find 4 @H if W bids @H now |pg||
nt|josj: but how would you play 4@H on a @S lead?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: Sure I have|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
nt|daman: sctoll up|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bonjour à tous  and hello all |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead would let it thru|pg||
nt|daman: r*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you said you had not|pg||
nt|sybarra: true, probably not as easy it looks from here|pg||
nt|josj: well, in 3nt you just need to steal 1 @H trick :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, heard, sorry|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: can't remember her maiden name|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: Demtinev or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Delova|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrrmmmmm|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: but it works well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call me naive, but I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|blum1956: no way to go down in 4@s (almost)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C lead in other room|pg||
nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6-card or player ))))|pg||
nt|garnetts: They do--and in my view their card play rarely live up to their expectations--a triumph of hope over experience |pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: Might there have been a pass by east to start this?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: lost it N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no alert from S on 1@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: désolée pour ces problèmes ....|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bon jour|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Carl |pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to our operator Laure|pg||

pc|dT|nt|sybarra: same contract in the other room |pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: now -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dop u agree with Townsend'spass david?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: Best play from E is to discard @s6 on next @c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: maybe Townsend tht 3@D likley if east had anything   that +300 would not be a great loss  and if partner had nothing would gain |pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: a very odd view imo|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N is of course a normal and goo contract very unlucky that apart form spades all other 3  Qs badly placed for dclarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3nt will go down now. N has not enough of entries to finess in all suits|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East will be in trouble soon|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: declarer cashing out and maybe hoping for a mistake|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: and that´s why E should discard @s6 on @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes discarding on clubs but Small has to read the position not easy|pg||
nt|josj: unlikely to happen|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good start for N-S|pg||

nt|sharkey: another slam...|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Cliff|pg||
nt|sybarra: jeanpaul, and clifff,  good to see both of you|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: hello every one on the 1st board he declarant received the spade lead|pg||
nt|josj: looked a normal result anyway|pg||
nt|josj: and the inevitable @S loser...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: some work to do to make 4@S in EW, it might well go down|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s doomed because of the bad split in @H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: Both sides deserved to suffer for getting to 3NT--life is never fair lol|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the dreaded multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: weak only version|pg||
nt|sharkey: merci Laure|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: de rien :) |pg||
nt|capercliff: N/S may do well not to push them into this slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C is suited as alerted |pg||
nt|sybarra: does E realize how good his hand it for W?|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS has a @H or @C sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: the 1st board : 1nt-p-2@s (4@h and no @s)-x-3nt ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 11-15 at least  0  diamonds|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we call it precised Michael in France|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: sorry  seeing things  I tht diamonds 4-4 last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but once again... if E had discarded @s6 he is discarding behind declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellselway may take him seriously here and go too far|pg||
nt|sharkey: i like 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes sets them on the right path (Hopefully) |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they should reach the @d slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Li Jie bid 5@D on his own next door|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surpised N didnt bid over 3@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: either x or 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 4 @H works also?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Amazing auction really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: operator  can you explain the alerts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hopwever  6@d is on ice|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good AFTERNOON |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Mike!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GM all, sorry i am a bit late, computer very slow booting up today|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as pd undertsnads....|pg||
nt|sybarra: now he can cue @H's |pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud bid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good  potential save in 7 @c   par contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure N should bid at all, 7@c is a good save but who is to say they will bid slam?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: he choosed  the lowest cue bid I think  Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes makes sense, |pg||
nt|sybarra: (lowest cue first) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D   3@D   5@D  he bid. Partner was silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: i guess you have to open that dog (4333)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Ed & Mike|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at leats 5 @c by N now|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: will Gui give them 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: well E/W do have 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it worked they kept them out of the laydown slam |pg||
nt|daman: good stuff to reach game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Ed and Marshall|pg||
nt|sharkey: W knows a @H cue shos 1. round control - no purpose showing 2. control knowing pd is 55|pg||
nt|stc: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: but things may happen ....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any reason to make 4@S  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denies 6 in a minor unless a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D can have 6 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Scores from first stanza|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup not a good 13 count but an opening within the meaning of the Act|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Teltscher 86 Hackett 29, Senior 13 Rosen 49, Hinden 35 Small 41, Crouch 40 de Botton 52|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the multi does seem to work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 combined but work to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: but E didnt|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: may happen ....|pg||
nt|josj: q.e.d.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: 2@D presumably asks for the better major|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time 3NT looks slightly better|pg||
nt|garnetts: East sees no reason to do anything other than bid 3NT--things are well placed for 4@H--best lead from North though |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 4@H not 3NT sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: with W do you lead low ht or q? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small should have good 6 to bad 8|pg||
nt|daman: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 top losers and 2 out  of 3 black losers in Hallberg's hand which need to be disposed of one way or the other|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike and Marshall|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: bid  South you have no defensive trick at all|pg||
nt|capercliff: some would play a X bu N now says "I would like to bid 7@c"|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not this pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: hello everybody we are here for the fench national championship|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a good club view would help the cause of n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: might on a club lead even then not certain |pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: Q in pards bid suit i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours there is a lot of equity in messing up the u]auction as n/s have done|pg||
nt|capercliff: that way he includes partner in deciding whether to bid or not|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: this pickles you pard |pg||
nt|josj: game was not missed on  1 in CR...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: we can talk about that :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@C = fit to @D and values in @C|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|stc: even Xed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: a trump attack was needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry first time at this|pg||
nt|daman: he is gin for game|pg||
nt|daman: can make 5 really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he is lucky here can ruff 2 losers in dummy and just about negotiate |pg||
nt|daman: yes   maybe only makes 4    not enough soldiers for an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful when returning to hand ruffing the third@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: however has no choice as @da drops|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DK he can discard the last @S-loser - so give up 2 @Hs - but has to take @HA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting metaphor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you guess hearts (you don't), it's 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: I lead the Q but who am I ?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont beligve 12 - but 10!|pg||
nt|daman:     not 680|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus 1 i was expecting plus 2 imposs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Soryy result not right|pg||
nt|daman: maybe 620|pg||
nt|lestergold: 650 my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 impossible|pg||
nt|daman: I think he has to lose a @S in the wash|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant place 3 black losers om two @Hs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: hi ralf & scores of specs....it's not just the players that have scores:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well Sandqvist ?Tosh a relatively newish partnership|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lebridgeur: 13 tricks on this lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: @S guess now?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: shirley. shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: suit pref?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small has left the table to put on a jumper|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: in the other room teammates de botton and malinowski the latter a world class player de botton a world class sponsor and enthusiast of the game|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: probably "negotiating" the 8 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: and 3 rounds of @c will set E under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sandqvist a brilliant but slightly wild card  of a player has a world silver medal to his credit|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|garnetts: best defence in my view tap declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can now see 6 of the 6 to bad 8 points on N|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|josj: low @C now...|pg||
nt|stc: strange play, I would have play @c before so many trump rounds|pg||
nt|josj: so would I|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: good swing for Hackett|pg||
nt|roswolf: has he really blocked the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: he has the ace of @H to get back unless patterson leads one |pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart now will block them for good|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I don't think the Clubs are blocked, didn't see what card was played|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah, ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah my faith in tosh is restored |pg||
nt|stc: no he must guess @c|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: Lacroix is extremely nervous on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: at|pg||
nt|stc: In fact many things happened, oops, reoops and normal score !|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: A heart to the King and North will do well to duck |pg||
nt|sybarra: argh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this was a mistake as I see it - for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: Holland and Brunner partnership in real life Holland a fin player used to partner the late Arnstrong qell respected player |pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: cannot really cost that much can it --this might now end play South |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that club switch ever going to happen?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now E can discard his @hQ and 3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: much more difficult to get to game in the other room|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|garnetts: That was good play--better than relying on just 3-2 hearts |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|blum1956: South hand was too bad for the 2@s opening the in the previous board but West hand perfect for a vulnerable overcall this time))|pg||

nt|lestergold: Small is having a field day at the wheel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you a weak 2 would have worked equally well |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its no0t a victory for the multi as such merely a victory for the barrage that took place|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe a lowly trump promoted in south |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW? |pg||
nt|daman: being aggressive?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Michelle Brunner a frequent member of English distaff international team|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow usually plays with hackett senior very experienced senior player i dont know much about Levy|pg||
nt|josj: this time, 4@H does look easy...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||

nt|josj: he who makes the last mistake loses the pot...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: SZ thinking about digging graves|pg||
nt|ady: part score here    likley 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: now the hand is scored as -1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: -1 is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: which hand? the last?|pg||
nt|pelu: how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is this david levy?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it was clear that North had nothing except @c support for passing 3 @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont know if EW can bid 5@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: one match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@H!? What a strange choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This mountain that SZ had to climb is suddenly taking on the appearance of Everest|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot think how West declared 5@H next door |pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that with the TOD west thought east had four |pg||
nt|daman: I think you might look at their card Nicky|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Yang psyched a pass over the Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1,  e/w lost an imp here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|daman: ask them the result|pg||
nt|josj: 13 boards seems an odd number...any reason for that?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: no it 's a match of 26 boards divided by 2 :)|pg||
nt|stc: A lack of concentration from declarer, I see no other explanation|pg||
nt|josj: this time, 6@C seems the best slam but it won't make whereas 6@S will|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: agressive non bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: No auction given in the movie|pg||
mb|4S|nt|blum1956: again the 3NT-4 Major choice|pg||
nt|othered1: Why alert the double,  Standard to double 1N for takout of @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to get to I think |pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: diamond lead beats this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s. time enough to find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the rosen team fresh from having given the senior team a serious pasting|pg||
nt|ady: wrong red suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i predict|pg||
nt|daman: would we all have bid 3NT with 3334 9 count?|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told that -1 was claimed at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg still has his workl cut out for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: from someone who is at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are two tens i think normal to bid vul game at ips with west's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North can't really sit this,  since his double wasn't based on defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was wondering about the alert on Michelle's pass over 1C last time. maybe she alerts all her bids|pg||
nt|othered1: his redouble, rather|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure he cant sit this. he has good defence, knows he is facing spade shortness and five hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N makes on the cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Goes down if NS get their @S trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 Nt is alright too|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 3 nt  with  j987 |pg||
nt|josj: I have to admit this makes sense...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: but i can ask if you want|pg||
nt|josj: probably it's the time schedule|pg||
nt|josj: 52 boards a day, this way, not 56 which might be too long|pg||
nt|josj: half an hour extra|pg||
nt|josj: nd use iof screens always slowing down the proceedings|pg||
nt|stc: 5@h will win 4 IMP|pg||
nt|josj: and|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe she was swayed by her two 10's|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, slam is just against the odds|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: yes a spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: E's @h spots are just good enough to deny the defence 4 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT down on @H lead & @S switch?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - misread|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: from the frying pan.... into ,,,, the fire....|pg||
nt|othered1: The double, in practice, tends to deny a fit at all, but north's @S suit doesn't need a lot of support.  |pg||
nt|sharkey: placed @SK behind @SQ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a bit nerve wracking  however |pg||
nt|capercliff: no Carl, declarer gets his @d trick before defence sets up a @s|pg||
nt|josj: this  is going to be a real push|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bakhshi has to alert  as he could have a longer @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H    needs club lead  to definately beat it|pg||
nt|josj: on  2 in CR NS took the final phantom save: 5@H v. 5@D|pg||
nt|josj: but 4@S on this oe looks a coffee hand so that's what I will do...|pg||
nt|josj: one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: 4@H also made in the other room on board 1, with an overtrick even|pg||
nt|othered1: Not at all -- isn't 2@H makable?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: this might beat it too|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: SZ scores :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the bidding in CR is so strange, that the operator dont wont to give it :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has two trumps and above all, EW are vul & 2D X is not game so even if they make it there is a limit to how bad it can be. N has shown a good hand so if S doesnt want to move ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: towards game I think it is reasonable for N to pass the double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 2@h is not so far away|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hm as i expected Sandqvist is worried about the defensive potential of his con tribution|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @h now and small return|pg||
nt|capercliff: but E knows who has the K now|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: @d switch good enuf?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the teltscher team seemed to be way in front  yesterday|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: this will be a quick match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Halberg will make it with the help from the lead now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: high @h would be  encouraging for this pair the 6  is not clear the 10 would be best hoping for AK9  in South|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: has time to try the club as well|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: would not affect the result here|pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all, sorry, I hadn't seen the broadcast already started :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bas :)|pg||

nt|neobas: Heya Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT CR as well|pg||
nt|neobas: Hej Carl|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good afternoon Bas|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead also enough    only one discard of a club  so down 1|pg||
nt|josj: discard @H is best|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: A spade was led to the ace and one returned. Curtains|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|daman: he almost has to fall into it now    no?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: was so much easier to beat the hand from this vantage point |pg||

nt|sybarra: now the @H lead from E |pg||
nt|neobas: Who here believes North should pass 1@H to allow partner to X?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: No--but the Q@C seemed a very rapid play |pg||
nt|blum1956: not an easy decision for North spade lead probably made from J10|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: apparently david gold still contemplating the @SA|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view too fast to work out options |pg||
nt|lestergold: must show one of the majors or tyransfer?|pg||
nt|stc: indeed|pg||
nt|josj: the X should warn Chemla|pg||
nt|sybarra: the qj, and the kq  holding may also slow them down |pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT here. Impressed?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card drury?|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think makeable with @H lead|pg||
nt|neobas: It is something every regular partnership should've discussed in my opinion|pg||
nt|stc: some play here XX showing support|pg||
nt|josj: I would XX here...|pg||
nt|stc: W endplayed on the lead !|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: a third in hand opening but 1nt looks bold at these colours and with a sketchy stop|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is the wildness of garvey at unfavouravle vul he makes a bid that many of us wouldnt even do at favourable|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|haans: no :)|pg||
nt|josj: it depends: most of the participants here stayed in nearby-hotels overnight, I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: thank everybody to being here ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: jst for remind : 1 match = 2 segments of13 boards|pg||
nt|stc: W will suffer at each card|pg||
nt|josj: and poor E never gets in with his established @C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: once you have a reputation...it is difficult to deviate|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will get a plus score on this occasion for his efforts|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very tamely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h will go down after 4 rounds óf @c, otherwise makeable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you can if playing support XX |pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: You can't sit still with a 17 count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a quick one down?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push i expect|pg||
nt|ady: this should go ddown on the lay    3NT  may have mad with Q@D right though a an unlikely club lead would beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the weak No trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tosh backing in with a Q and a QJ i think very dangerous|pg||
nt|capercliff: hold up the @h twice and play 3 rounds of @c's, what does E pitch?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   no distribution for an action but 1 NT is possible  1 @s  would weak with dsitribution|pg||
nt|neobas: W on lead won't make a difference, I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: no a quick 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: a passive lead mind you would let it thru but unlikely|pg||
nt|neobas: Same lead CR|pg||
nt|capercliff: double dummy can get out for -1 i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: pitch @D - limited communications after 4 times @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has to get the unblock in also |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to do but the lead has created a trick and the spades are playabel for one loser|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: yes Roland - and I can make 6 on a non-@c-lead :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have been more impressed if you could have made 6@C on the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dangerous weak 2 with 6 solid tricks in ones hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|capercliff: declarer knows E is 4-3 in the majors now|pg||
nt|neobas: South in the CR ducked the lead twice, played a @C to hand and a @D to the K, after which defence could cash 3@Hs and 3@Ds|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose it is not clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT asked East to choose a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Crouch knows that diamonds 5-0 now after the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will play the hand accordingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry what amn i talking about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Qx a particularly doubtful value|pg||
nt|capercliff: and after 4 rounds of @c's will have full outlay|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for partner to read this|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can only make on a spade lead which is likely|pg||
nt|josj: Chemla not interested...|pg||
nt|sybarra: aceless wonder hand|pg||
nt|josj: 10 tricks seem far away but 9 should be there|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: yes and the side suit is @h!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a @d trick may be created  as they lie|pg||
nt|sharkey: actually East pitches after dummy so wont make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: two yes for one no :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch knows that Tosh has nothing. Otherwise North has no double|pg||
nt|sybarra: except with no @D lead, maybe shows S has none?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north cant be faulted but south will be ashamed|pg||
nt|othered1: Good pint, Shirley|pg||
nt|othered1: point|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is on the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pint sounds OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe the pint is better at this hour for us|pg||
nt|sybarra: 940 am here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may need a heart switch now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed someone eill need a blood transfusion after this|pg||
nt|stc: And quantin let W do the work for him|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: @S lead would have beaten this |pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooops  Gold did return a low @S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|josj: @D goes on a @C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what their methods were over 1NT  ---tempting to bid if you get both suits in |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lebridgeur: most   declarer can get is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: that cant be right|pg||
nt|capercliff: E did not switch to a @c?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and declarer did not play a @h voluntarily?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: that is a textbook error of course|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe a double psychology play :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|stc: @s now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: another 13 imps to Teltscher|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think 3N is a likely spot here|pg||
nt|daman: Mike    I have noticed a marked imrpovement with your spelling    are you dating a Grammar teacher?    or are you just typing slower?    lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: at unfave vul i cant see the point of the bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, and especially with a double. what if W redoubles? now you may get hurt in a variety of ways|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: E has to NOT play trumps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts and 3 clubs, or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is certain re diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: 12 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you are very kind Mike!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i never heard of a weak 2  8-12|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming the 5-0 trump split playing clubs which is the natural thing to do will make the positiom clear|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|daman: not at all like the old days|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well practice|pg||
nt|daman: hehehe|pg||
nt|sybarra: stranger and stanger |pg||
nt|josj: @S looks better as W will not easily be thrown in again then|pg||
nt|stc: sqzd on the last @s|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|sybarra: maybe getting ready to put E in somehow |pg||
nt|capercliff: if declarer had the @s instead of the 8 he would make this|pg||
nt|capercliff: 9@s|pg||
nt|capercliff: a @c now and what will E pitch?|pg||
nt|neobas: A small @S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: He would have a chance but that would be the case  on any defense|pg||
nt|capercliff: then he would make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: this may not be good enough|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: On the last hand I really like the pass of 2@D --an intelligent psych |pg||
nt|lestergold: this doesnt make sense|pg||
nt|daman: tell us a bit about the 4some at the other table Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely that club wasnt ducked by the defence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Now it is again|pg||
nt|roswolf: but that was a clear error by north|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace and a @H now?|pg||
nt|othered1: south did echo in @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: does that help?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or a diamond to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will be endplayed twice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it is also easy|pg||
nt|othered1: And east's double of 2@S had to be on more than just the @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: in either red suit - declarer's choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is to try to go plus instead of minus, but i agree that with that collection of rubbish he is aiming at an extremely narrow target|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer didnt want to squeeze dummy on the last @c|pg||
nt|neobas: Has to play @Ss now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well spotted|pg||
nt|sybarra: and has to be low spade doesnt it? |pg||
nt|neobas: Yes|pg||
nt|neobas: He might take the @DA for -1 in Teams but I think he has the lay of the hand at this point|pg||
nt|capercliff: he should get this right|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I think any @s  do|pg||
nt|capercliff: he knows S has 3 more @d's without the Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually you might be right on JP |pg||
nt|neobas: Correct, because, as Cliff said, Declarer does not have the @ST|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: I hope everyone noted how long North spent working out the options in the OR--it is a real lesson of using your brain in crucial situations |pg||
nt|sharkey: Playing @C squeezed E; but also destroyed communications for declarer |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|sybarra: I think E has the count on declarers hand |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but it was fine play by declarer to create the illusion that South had @CK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to he queen, then the ace and a small one|pg||
nt|roswolf: good practical bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looking like someone who had  xx|pg||
nt|othered1: Sure, fine play by east, but north could have worked it out anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: so now what does N do?|pg||
nt|sybarra: el stucko |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Starts crying?|pg||
nt|othered1: So north was playing east for 2=5=4=2?|pg||
nt|roswolf: grin and bear it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|josj: W must feel quite unhappy...|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: chicken|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: great lesson hand  |pg||

nt|ady: grand slam time|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Brian senior and sandra penfold another formidable mixed partnership King a very respected player Small always appears in premier league and trials but would not rank him as ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: top ten in Uk|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Both  sides played well|pg||
nt|neobas: Strange play on the hand but 3 IMPs to Delfour|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done |pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a coffee break hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we start a "new match" so to speak |pg||
nt|sybarra: losing an imp |pg||
nt|sybarra: hope not to costly in the end |pg||
nt|josj: as will W in CR...|pg||
nt|stc: not MP|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: god slam here|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect grand - will they find it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and for me - never both majors|pg||
nt|daman: I think the score will sort itself out in the fullness of time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: we need to cut Nicky some slack    this is her first time as a vugraph operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: Brian mainly known for his supremacy as a match point player world class|pg||
nt|daman: he is very good|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a very good player altogether|pg||
nt|daman: all pass?|pg||
nt|daman: or would you bid 2NT with the North hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: senior of  course a very fine bridge journalist produces all the world championshiop reports excellent|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: 5@D was a fine save against 6@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 2@H shows this then it might take a very short time to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: and great thinking as declarer,  didnt panic |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed was my teammate in my Camrose match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive always foujhnd Small to be an undisciplined player at this level which ismperhaps why altho he is up there competing ion the premier league every year rarely m,akes it into the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: top 4 if ever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well  it was a weak @H suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h e/w looks normal|pg||
nt|neobas: Let's hope for NS North doesn't get pushy|pg||
nt|neobas: Might just open 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 small hts by N not exactly appetizing for going beyond 4 @S |pg||
nt|stc: if w open 3@h NS may end in 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: Board 3 was a push because N made the best lead, a trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|garnetts: tough to get to 6@C but maybe not after that opening |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16 opp  7   difficult|pg||
nt|blum1956: using the negative free style North should bid 2@h and then the life becomes easy|pg||
nt|ady: only 23 hcp   but great fit  and source of tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: splinter  or fit jump  or voidwood  which?|pg||
nt|blum1956: but NS probably do not use it|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is hoping to buy a contract for his side))|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does the X show @S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if they do go to 3H you cant rate your chances of beating iot very highly. and if they do go down 50, what have you won? risk-reward ratio very dicey|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes --almost certainly spades with @D toleranace |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: It is a n 11 match round robin on 3 week end so victory points are at stake|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: surely the dbl means more than "not penalty"!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they must have some more meaning than "not penalty"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will show off the strong club system|pg||
nt|neobas: 2@D a Game Forcing opening, it seems|pg||
nt|neobas: As for the subsequent bids, I am at a loss :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: or multi not sure|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, I am not sure what is going on here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: might just bid 6@C and hope for the best |pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: or jump to 4@C GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did North double over 2@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not double I mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another tough call for Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|garnetts: When people used to play monet doubles --there were many times a psychic penaltry double was used--good time for it here for example :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tradegy too as its frigid|pg||
nt|daman: it is gin|pg||
nt|capercliff: does anyone know their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: game   forcing ace  of @d  shown by 3 @d bid|pg||
nt|josj: nearly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Does that not show both red suits?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe better cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: like everyone else I have no idea what to do with hands like west--so might as well gamble|pg||
nt|othered1: There are 7's and there are 7's.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT 17-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this is not plain sailing|pg||
nt|lestergold: here we see Towsned can bid aggressively when he wants to|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im trying to work out can this be made double dummy even?|pg||
nt|lestergold: answer is i dont think that makes ten tricks as cardsw lie here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult when the @S dont break|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i think tiownsend overbid herec partner didnt even have tio have 4 reasonable,hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bakhshi knows the @S dont break from the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 3@c expresses his values after the double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most would bid 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: why?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19 points? |pg||
nt|lestergold: west'shand is full of holes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 points opposie a pssoble yarborough maybe with a 3 card suit is not mandatory game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in either major|pg||
nt|neobas: According to kibs 2@D is GF, 3@D shows @DA and 3@Ss|pg||
nt|neobas: In which case I wonder what 4@D is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4-2 spade split gives this an excellent play    would Bakhshi except an invitation ?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure NS play Michael 5+/4+ - S has absolut minimum, but very friendly steup for N|pg||
nt|othered1: dicey is a very kind way to put it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: now they know nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Especially with the state of the match - harking back to the debate earlier about tactics|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not hard since North choose to bid 3@H--5NT will do it now |pg||
nt|blum1956: either exclusion Blackwood  (if NS use one) or just RKCB and hope for  the @dA with EW|pg||
nt|ady: disappointing|pg||
nt|josj: @S split very nicely here so np for declarer|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reached the par contract now, 6@DX|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not yet Roland |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very polite David |pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: He surely is not contemplating 6NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is considering what to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: length is the paramountg consideration|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@D?  Puppet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so yes, Ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: Last year Cooke and Garvey were in the winning Camrose team which was I expect a culmination of their drwam for years|pg||
nt|daman: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh comes from the "Scots wha' hae wi' Wallace bled" school|pg||
nt|othered1: Your line here?  Cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: im askwed if 2@h is forcing here i would say it was forcing in most partnerships ithese days|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously must be in theirs|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they play 2@c multi and 2@d  Gf ace showing answers|pg||
nt|capercliff: flat board-next|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: North can likely infer that @S are 3-3 at most in EW  hands|pg||
nt|stc: 3@h makes, so 3@s is not bad, could make|pg||
nt|stc: probably not|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: 5 small @H and a bust and it has a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a moot point borderline my point is that Towsend sholuld have consulted|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky that hearts are 3-3. He can test if @CJ10 doubleton first by cashing one of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has always believed that he was the world's number one not noted for his modesty but to be fair i have always felt that he had a great talent for then game but in sufficent ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: discipline to sustain a position at the top table|pg||
nt|neobas: To a junior like me that seems like a rather old-fashioned system. Obviously I don't know it in-depth but Ace-showing answers are something of the past in my book :)|pg||
nt|josj: @C is best now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: but would he get the right result with a 4-2 spade split  if just consulting|pg||
nt|neobas: It got them to the right spot though|pg||
nt|stc: A@s and @d was the double dummy defense|pg||
nt|josj: but not easy to find|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: trump next I imagine |pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CJ to indicate values in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: @cJ for @S|pg||
nt|garnetts: trump is best--the spade can wait |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter and I must have been partners|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: a double followed by a 3 level cue bid tells pard that he doesnt need much to bid game posession ofa 5 CARD SUIT WOULD THEN BE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT|pg||
nt|ady: I agree if east had just 3 small hearts and a bust then 4 hearts could cost a big number|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ssorry butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|daman: we have our share of those on this side of the pond as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry slight exaggeration but we are allowed to tease garvey|pg||
nt|neobas: Be right back|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||

nt|josj: but def. can do little harm as N can ruff @DA with his @SA...|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but now the A@d is a trick again|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: but oh well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is very good play|pg||
nt|stc: ruff, Q@H, trump|pg||

nt|josj: but does not seem a logical line|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he doesn't know|pg||

nt|stc: he already played S for AK@s|pg||
nt|josj: yes but the chinese finesse looked a bit odd|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: extremely strange bid for the player of Brunner's level|pg||
nt|lestergold: better not continue these!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: top diamond or even a trump by south would do|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think bakhshi can set up a long dim and enjoy without losing trump comntrol|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it matters  if Townsend pulls 1 trumpt    can discard a club on K@S   and has time to ruff a spade and a club|pg||

nt|yo_yo: round robin  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Henry|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Henry!  Why  the distinction?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a bidding test here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H CR|pg||
nt|sybarra: should never make 5 |pg||
nt|josj: I can see 3 top losers :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too |pg||
nt|josj: even without glasses on|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defense can get their act together|pg||
nt|stc: end a swing, EW did not enter at all in CR|pg||
mb|1C|nt|capercliff: 6@h is the top spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer has certainly been friendly to slams |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on  previous deal four @d  showed   @s acceptance with no other thing to cue|pg||
nt|josj: unlikely to disappear|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: first weekend of 3|pg||
nt|othered1: here south passedthe ugly 12-ount|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after clubs can use 2D as art 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@d makes as well of course|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contracts rely on @h being 3-2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope pard knows you use rock crusing 3 level bids|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha Shirley|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: part score hand    n/s  in spades best|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: he is vulnberable  and only 6 cards  sensible in first position|pg||
nt|neobas: 6@D it is, it seems|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: 15 opp 15 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean slam for these boys?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: SZ coming|pg||
nt|garnetts: Tough hand for North --|pg||
nt|yo_yo: redouble is for blood i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double now look fine |pg||
nt|blum1956: EW probably catched up|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes xx was punitive|pg||
nt|sybarra: singleton honors worth ?  (zip)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike Bell also passed 3@D in the OR on 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  because after 1@c ... you have 2@d available as an artificial force|pg||
nt|othered1: Sounds reasonable, but I don't think I've seen that in action.  Don't get around much any more, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had probably played on establish the @d suit by winning the first @c by @cQ and played a @d to @dA and ruffed a @d another @c to K ruffed another @d and discarded @sJ on @cA and ...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that played @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  which you don't after 1@d and 3@c as an artificial force uses up a lot of room|pg||
nt|neobas: Second as well, in my opinion Meyer|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is vul,  so make can expect a "good" hand |pg||
nt|sharkey: W opened 1@D CR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Yes bas of course|pg||
nt|josj: now the NS @S tend to disappear|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like Gan's choice of 1NT in the closed room, rather than double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Anyone for 1NT on the West cards raher then dbl? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jxx often a nice holding|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to see the @H-stop in 3Nt - in CR West reopen 1NT - so......|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there something wrong with X byt N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that the absence of a 7th club does not deter the Garve from a vul 3 level pre=empt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not sure of their sys here but i assume 1C is some sort of artificial bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like 3N doesn'thave much play at all on @H lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S raising @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i understood this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam looks well below 59%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2¬@h doesnt mke|pg||
nt|ady: North decided to keep out of bidding     not unreasonable|pg||
nt|daman: I have an appointment in 10 minutes    so I will have to flee this match at that point|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 or 7? - as long as the suit is QJ109xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: however his cheeky opening has pushed e/w into  a pretty hpel;ess 3n|pg||
nt|pelu: woprked foine here - no chance in 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: matter of style/agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west considering 3@C   not an immediate success|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect lead!|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done|pg||
nt|stc: looking for trouble|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: only 2@D on 14 HCP???????????????|pg||
nt|sybarra: Simon Cope says:  no - relay shape ask I am pretty sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 60%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50% i mean|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S?|pg||
nt|neobas: I think I'd open 1@D and 3@D equally as frequent|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and stopped in 5    not satisfactory test :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: It may be difficult to get to slam unless W opens 3@D|pg||
nt|capercliff: the only downside to opening 3@d is that you are 3-3 in the majors|pg||
nt|stc: -2 even with friendly breaks in trump|pg||
pc|d6|nt|neobas: I feel W has used the brakes too much in CR|pg||
nt|josj: yes E left the gate open but NS did not exploit it |pg||
pc|d3|nt|josj: nicely done|pg||
nt|josj: the agreements are OK|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree, especially when you see where double leads to|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers unavoidable|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I said it before and I will say it again. The EBU must require that all convention cards are submitted and then put on display on the website. It is unreasonable that commentators ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: must guess what certain bids mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll have a word with Max Bavin|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I agree with both of you  !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: I would rather have passed the double than bid 2@D |pg||
nt|haans: original bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: I have found that the cc's typically posted are only part of the story,  but would be nice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead for King|pg||
nt|henryb:  you only think that because he rebid 1N and not 2, Mike|pg||
nt|stc: first swing of the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 cards suits "up the line"  but with both,  I think X might be right |pg||
nt|josj: looks like playing mp|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit i would not have preotected with halberg's hand altho h ewas influnced by holding 9 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: close his eyes and play the top tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: hope for the best |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so I prefer to open 3 @d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: (also in little tiny print) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that I have the EW card. I have because Crouch sent it to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Most don't get terribly deep into relay development|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took me 5 minutes to download the comprehensive version of the EW CC|pg||
nt|sybarra: the cc's hardly give the details for relays,  agree ED |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a shorter version I have on hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect Precision, with 2S inviting game in NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the1N rebid must show 18-1i9 points to explain the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2N looks safe enuf|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Couldn't see a card there|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it is reasonable to assume that  Henry |pg||
nt|lestergold: playing natural club south would rebid 2N|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes me too|pg||
nt|sharkey: W felt "guilty" due to his light opener in CR I think|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: i would have tried 3@D :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or even open 1@d maybe?|pg||
nt|capercliff: in 2nd seat|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blum1956: ruff out, play trumps and then a spade|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes of course Haans :) rofl |pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have tried 2@H with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland explained to me that out operators are new to this and it is very tought job--in my view Darren is doing brilliantly so far --may not be able to note all alerts this first ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: time |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Cheers, I am new but Roger is an old hand, you'll have David and Ant later who are both experts!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: making 5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: Roland and I would have been in 3NT because we would have bid 1NT as west --so there |pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of going for a number would have detered me|pg||
nt|pelu: but some would pass the X - if pd strong then 500-800 |pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 imps about to appear for the Teltscher team|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt favorite|pg||
nt|sybarra: take no finesses|pg||
nt|sybarra: at yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: *at least yet |pg||

nt|reisig: Somehow - I get partners that remind me!!|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Would you open 3@D if Non Vul?|pg||
nt|stc: sure, I don't think that N was really happy when bidding 2@s !|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: long dim takes care of one club loser but that is still 1 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: no devils coup available|pg||
nt|ady: this may be down 2    but definately 1  so nothing much lost for n/s being kept out of the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldnt be 2 off just needs to get the timing right for one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult for players of this calibre|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am askedf how old is garvey|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stc: of course X in S should show @s|pg||
nt|josj: yes, only way to show them in this auction|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|pelu: to all spects: pl. a name in your profil - most commentators dont chat with "John Do's"|pg||
nt|neobas: He brought six tricks and three card support to the table, I'd say I have nothing to be guilty about|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@d doesn't tell pard anything about his hand really|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: looks like 800|pg||
nt|athene: of course there are textbooks which would frown on that 3@C opener, but having the texture in the suit is worth a lot|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: well i guess mid late forties but always looked about 25 to me|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: taken the max --well done |pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: claim?|pg||
nt|athene: @CQJ109xx is going to be a 2-loser suit mostly even if partner hasn't got a fit|pg||
nt|athene: better than e.g. @CK97432 which might indeed get really killed|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes the average junior look like an old age pensioner|pg||
nt|neobas: @H pitch looks scary|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|blum1956: a swing for Hackett this time probably|pg||
nt|stc: But, on the bidding, EW may have even 4@h to play|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: I think 1NT is the most descriptive bid,as it does not promise a @H stop|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: best way to find 3nt  is not caring about stoppers|pg||
nt|ady: looks like the defence wont be able to get 2 club tricks    the 4th diamond will be a discard|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ady: 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: unassuming cue bid not game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this may lead to game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surprised Bakhshi didnt double to show those @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may likem his diamond fit|pg||
nt|reisig: no alert for 2@h?|pg||
nt|pelu: I would hate to open 1@D on the N-hand :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Garvey deals out quite a lot of death against anyone but the toughest opposition|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: minor  openings at 3 level  should  be some how constructive if partner has not passed|pg||
nt|sybarra: pusilanimous bid of 3,  |pg||
nt|capercliff: i like the 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @H also |pg||
nt|stc: Top french pairs a very conservative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: systematic requirements i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H - let them guess|pg||
nt|neobas: Well, I would too, so that's why I expected South to bid 3 :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: @h lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: and may be it makes too|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: It's like 20/20 cricket, run rate required per over almost 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the category of "oh good"........|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: too strong  is South for 3@h|pg||
nt|capercliff: no problem now I think, only a @h lead would give declarer problems|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it makes on a cross-ruff?|pg||
nt|sybarra: its close to making,  sometimes pard has some clubs to add to mine |pg||
nt|capercliff: i think 4@h is pretty standard|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - just use @HA first trick|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: at last a penalty double bid as penalty taken as penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: transfer weak twos --interesting |pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
nt|pelu: I know it the system - but still :)|pg||
nt|athene: they play strong club, 5-card majors, multi 2@D, so 1@D is very loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s wants to be played by south asltho here as A@h is right doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I'm sorry, we have to restart this room|pg||
nt|stc: see N in CR passing 3@c|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||
nt|lestergold: why show hearts when they have alre4ady located spade fit|pg||
nt|stc: in fact in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dont worry Nicky anyoje takes on vugraph is very brave|pg||
nt|neobas: Hmm, on second thought maybe not|pg||
nt|capercliff: that might not be good enough, because declarer will eventually have to go out to a @d|pg||
nt|stc: Quantin-Bompis open very light and as a consequence do not X part scores - same as Meckwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he has a simple bid to show a good raise in spade4s|pg||
nt|henryb:  West is close to too strong for a 2N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this decision to open 2N here is going to lead to game and i dont think can make|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is a pro-am bid, in my eyes.  Partner has no idea of trick potential in @D contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I think 2N would be fine if the hand were different:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: Holland 3@C  for major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see the point of a transfer weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Francis Hinden made 4@H  well done to her|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Frances|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s deny a @h cue?|pg||
nt|pelu: Sorry - I was weong they are "close" now|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluckly west's hand is better than some 20 counts but has hit an unfortunate misfit minimum opposite|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: doesnt it just give opps an extra bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gained 12 imps for her team on 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt venture into this auction with that pile of festering horse manure with a gun to my head|pg||
nt|capercliff: and a second trump comes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: specs want to undertsand teh system|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone explain it|pg||
nt|lestergold: heavily artificial of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 21H must show spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n support 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d cue i assum|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key is the nebulous 1D opening and the 2@h response|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there a reason they opened 1 @S in both rooms? not 1 @H?|pg||
nt|josj: yes, higher from 5-5 |pg||
nt|stc: other type of pairs will be in 3 or even 4@h which may be in on a sunny day|pg||
nt|josj: no matter how many they go down...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Roland, but in 20/20 10 per over is eminently achievable - especially if an inform Gilchrist is batting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah by South  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n good support im toldthe rest is fairly starightforward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually 2N is OK if pd is a passed hand. but facing an unlimited partner you are just begging to miss a slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that question |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|capercliff: now he can afford to go out to a @d and retain trump control|pg||
nt|neobas: Only a @H will set it now|pg||
nt|sybarra: testing  E now|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think it can be beat now|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S asking for @H-control?|pg||
nt|henryb:  mainly unlucky that the diamond suit doesn't run|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the point I was dancing around|pg||
nt|lestergold: Holland too good in the majors to pass 2N|pg||
nt|neobas: Well done|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: old fashioned forcing nt might have solved this problem ending in 2 @D's or so |pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately i think with Towsned's minimum 12 count and awful spade suit his 3@d bid which is effectivbely a game try was an overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case 3NT is the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@H|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe im wrong|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the  @d   duck was fatal should have  cross ruffed|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: i would think it must be by impication|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|neobas: I think that would've led to only nine tricks Meyer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT would have been 5-11  NF|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: also you do not really need to ask for ther Q@H as you know North is not queen high for his actions |pg||
nt|garnetts: He is almost certain to have the ace |pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed very unlucky not an unreasonable bidding sequence|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe I am wrong as well :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: it was agood auction |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: This can go 2 down of Shi finds the diamond shift|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|garnetts: east needs to count here --North has played it very well so far |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i know, Ed, but i felt more like kick-boxing than dancing:)|pg||
nt|josj: 3@D should go down as well...if def. take their 4 tops and play @C from E|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Not easy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: coujld easily be duplicated |pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: N had to lose a diamond at some point, so put the defense to test fast |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: I am not sure they can do that with 5 hearts as they have 2@D available for 9+ with hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: their system is different|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  notice that even 2N is down since West gets squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry wrong descard there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, Artur might open 2N, but i predict 1D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well spotted henry--that makes 2 hands in a row where declarer could get squeezed|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|haans: hold on to @DQ|pg||

nt|lestergold: in fact with Jx of clubs  merely a good 11 count |pg||

nt|henryb:  but many would respond 1@s, and West will then rebid 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or 2C depending on gadgetry in arsenal|pg||

nt|vugraphzqj: A match is : 2 x 13 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: with 10 min break|pg||

mb|2D|an| |nt|sybarra: even their system,  wonder if 1 nt was an option |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont think team mates will be compeltely happy with some of e/ws actio9ns here|pg||
nt|capercliff: a @d at trick 2 would have been much better, but not if W had the K and Q|pg||
mb|3H|nt|capercliff: the J@d could have been the 10th trick|pg||
nt|neobas: I think with @DKQ West would've split anyway|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes of course bt the J sets up now:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like a "big club"  2 @C,   6clubs and can have 4 card major |pg||
nt|lestergold: this 1@c opener is obviousoly not strong club so what is it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps something Polish or romanesque|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D now?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: unless I am wrong - a fair chance- by crossruffing  declarer  makes on a coup en passant |pg||
nt|stc: a heavy weak two|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is on, tough for Crouch to raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a very lucky game|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@C is obscene with that hand whatever it shows|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  likely spot e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here is a misfitting hand for N/S with e/w having little chance to enter the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You don't have a club loser|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they will like board 3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S undoubled in OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  apparently N-S are playing some sort of two or hree-way 11c|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think maybe Polish so im advised by someone who should know!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multiple hand types covered under 1C umbrella, sometimes strong sometimes ordinary|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think you're correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no the ace?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That goes away on a diamond after you have cashed 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: double is the winning action|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/wwill get a plus score in any case|pg||
nt|neobas: Kib suggesting a trump promotion is trick 10 (4@S 3@C 1@D 1@H + the promotion)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: NS dont play support doubles  ( one of my favourite conventions)|pg||

nt|lestergold: a very cosmopolitan world|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in honor of Malinowski?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course Malinowski used to partner Sandqvist|pg||
nt|lestergold: got world silver medal together in teams in bejing|pg||
nt|othered1: East looks to  have transferred, t hen retransferred over progressive 2N rebid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2008 Sandqvist's greatest achievement and no mean achievement|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/walready overbaord|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Long Pause.....|pg||
nt|sharkey: Also makes same manner on @H lead I think|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is all double dummy, if W had the KQ of @d's declarers line is correct|pg||
nt|capercliff: not unreasonable as W opened 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to have the same 8 tricks,  can not see a 9th|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: some care is needed to make 4@H here--there are potential problems |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H can be made with open cards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: penalty doubles seem to be like buses, none for hours, and then 2 together :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N making 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee break hand|pg||
nt|neobas: This looks to be -1, barring defensive errors|pg||
nt|sharkey: cross ruff denedent on @HK being with W only I think - regarless of @DKQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: *dependent|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, but if W has the KQ@d the location of the K@h is irrelevent|pg||
nt|capercliff: as W cannot attack trump|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - then you're betting on two cards being "right" instead of only one|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: though methods prevented NS from finding their fit -- in fact par is 110 NS -- EW have voluntarily gotten too high. surely S would have reopened with a double, though, had the EW ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bidding subsided in 2H. 100% clear that he would have in light of his reopening X on the earlier hand with far less|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unlikely gross overcookment by this experienced partnership|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 50 again  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to the ace, one round of hearts and three rounds of diamonds pitching the club loser|pg||

nt|ady: as the cards lay can make 12 tricks on any lead|pg||

nt|garnetts: good morning Henry |pg||
nt|blum1956: not on that particular board, Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi; just thought I'd throw in an easy one|pg||
nt|garnetts: cash AK's and cross ruff looks best to me |pg||
nt|ady: can make on a sort of cross ruff|pg||
nt|garnetts: that always lets South make her small trumps ---|pg||
nt|garnetts: might go off if somehting gets ruffed but not likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be 100 here |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Division 1 after 20 boards: Teltscher +19 IMPs v Rosen, Senior +7 IMPs v Small, Crouch +8 IMPs v Hinden, Hackett P +3 IMPs v DeBotton|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a bit surprising that W began her campaign with a spade from dummy. best chance for down one would seem to be winning first trick in hand and leading a club. N failure to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lead a spade on that auction suggests S has a spade honor so realistically cant hope to make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam|pg||
nt|josj: another partscore hand: 3@H for NS and 3@D in EW should go off...but|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: 6 @c  better   nine trumps better than 8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: "on a partly self funding basis"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 hours 50 mins is standard for a 20 board match with screen  (thanks Max)|pg||

nt|lestergold: is this really the auction?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Claiming now|pg||
nt|lestergold: even my dog claimed 6 already|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: must be an austerity measure due to the credit crunch|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that doesnt seem fair|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction would make sense if 2D had a particular meaning. but the oeprator already said some bids were omitted|pg||
nt|lestergold: partnership of this calbre should get to the slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: David isn;t playing in this match, but we do get to hear about Mike's dog:):)|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least try to get there |pg||
nt|lestergold: David will tell you that our dog is the best bridge player in the family|pg||

nt|lestergold: our dog even has his own face book|pg||
nt|lestergold: and manyh firends|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to find a trial bid on N, perhaps 2nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: like the aunts' cat in "Adventures in Card Play" :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: felix tyhe dog|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is tosh who must surely recognise the slammish nature of his hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|stc: touch and go|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blum1956: the NS cards fit together beautifully. Only 24 HCP of flat distribution but 4@h absolutely on top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that 1@H rebid by opener is any 20+ hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i gather they play a polish kind of club but i was told at the start they were playing std!!!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More economical|pg||
nt|roswolf: another argument for publishing cc's|pg||

nt|pelu: would u X in N - spec when pd is a passed hand? - if pd bid @H u are in trouble|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: Gui-Yang bid that deal as many beginners would|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice lead. Declarer has to win, and now a @c switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: club switch tho and has to guess hearts mayve dangerous to duck rgua spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: now co tract in danger|pg||
nt|lestergold: discard on spade ace useless|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a blind spot I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Cameron must find the @H now|pg||
nt|lestergold: up with ace of spades and establish those dims quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: in these situations people hardly ever lead away fromn unsupported k its the most dangerous of qall leads|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|othered1: 6@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: that should stop the @C lead against 6N|pg||
nt|roswolf: a prelude to disaster|pg||
nt|neobas: This was the expected auction I guess|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|neobas: I know a couple of people who say: "When RHO opens 1@C overcall 1@S first and see what you have second" :)|pg||
nt|josj: you might make 12 tricks but slam is pretty high (as always...)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: you have to be rich to play bridge nowadays|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S unluckily puts the @CKQ on lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: a wheel has come off i think if spades were the agreed trump suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N bid 6 nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East is  Hallberg     South is   Garvey|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please enter the names, Nicky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: if your pard style is to make light off shape doubles and uj knwop pard won't punish you I think its  risk versus reqward ratio just about acceptable|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Well, it does take a club lead to defeat slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Stabbing at the 6-level isn't a pleasant exercise|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe 2@C was not Gazzili?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  with 3-2 trumps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I was thinking 6NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops there goes another one|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @c  3 or 4  ...or 5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzdb: Big sigh from declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 6@H bid on board 9 in OR    should be some welcome imps for Hacket|pg||

nt|vugraphzdb: Brunner|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: I still don't think he can make it because spades are 4-2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: Problem with 1C opening - often it doesnt show @C thus many times ignored in favor of 5-3 in M|pg||

nt|yo_yo: he did well!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@s goes for 800 on any lead in practice|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@C N could bid 1@D - or even 1@S - but I would never X|pg||
nt|lestergold: he wnts to be in 6 almost whenever his partner has 5 hearts with the two missing to honours|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once N makes a positive response, which I assume 1H was, he doesnt have all that much extra. S is the one with all the controls. i can see a lot of pairs missing that slam|pg||
nt|neobas: I play 2@C in this situation at 95% Forcing... p can only pass with 5+ @Cs and a very minimal hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: theory with black 55 is to open  strong hand 1@c and 1@s with weak ones|pg||

nt|josj: N holds the wrong ace|pg||

nt|stc: W will not lead A@c against 4@s, but against 6 of course|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: I told you, the Hacketts would bid 4@H on board 9|pg||

nt|othered1: is double meaningful?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but slam seems to be far away from north's point of view|pg||

mb|3S|nt|lestergold: i must admit i prefer to ocercall a spade and apolgise for mixing up a club with my spades!|pg||
nt|neobas: W faced with either underbidding with 2@S or overbidding with 3@S if they don't have fancy gadgets|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: over the top     5 a problem|pg||

nt|Walddk2: "Find my void"|pg||
nt|sybarra: (your longest suit) |pg||
nt|lestergold: i think i prefe double by N with 4 good spades|pg||
nt|stc: Part score swing on 9, N opened a light 1@s and EW entered the auction to play 4@c|pg||
mb|5D|an|bwd|nt|lestergold: on an entertainment basis Garvey ism probably the most watchable player on the planet|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @c    was NF     that is why I am in favour of 1 @c opening   east had not enough for 3@c rebid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam CR - 6@H|pg||
nt|neobas: I think Slam is on...|pg||
nt|sybarra: in slam have to smohter the 10 of @H's |pg||
nt|neobas: 2NT "two places to play" I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: on 10 the twins avoided the slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not giving that as option for W |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Liggins-Whittaker did|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok same difference:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT bid to protect @SK but he does not have enough tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N doesn't have a play I can see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but double followed bye @D might not be forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however should be headed for the club game either way|pg||
nt|lestergold: selway should downvalue with so much in clubs opposite the splinter|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you splinter with the South hand?|pg||
nt|ady: north not really interested in more than game with such good club values opposite a shortage|pg||
nt|neobas: Now correcting to 3@D to show @H+@D|pg||
nt|josj: might end up in 3@HX|pg||
nt|josj: exclusion BW|pg||
nt|stc: yes, a very useful convention|pg||
nt|stc: when partner understands it|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lestergold: Of course my dog howled when he heard the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: dbl defeats me as a bid--4@D seems logical --but dbl?   |pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@C in response is odd too--might get passed so 4@D maybe  |pg||
nt|blum1956: again that antiLaw board - 22 total trumps but far less total tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfect hand for it|pg||
nt|neobas: Aggressive Double by West here in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: straight off the chest|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: north bidding a grand -surely a surplus of imagination|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" (e/w) dont double when we got them where we want them |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it might have made when we get a week with two Fridays|pg||
nt|lestergold: landed right spot|pg||
nt|ady: 5 level would have been dangerous |pg||
nt|josj: another oops coming up, Constantin? :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: Culbertson put forward a theory of symetrical distributions--where there was a shapely hand with a singleton likely to be another similar hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a month of sundays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SA is perhaps a little insulting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't doubled, but west clearly would have doubled 7@D.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of why not? shortening some one some where|pg||
nt|roswolf: why - when opps bid this way insults are deserved|pg||
nt|othered1: Only very slightly nsulting.  This hasn't exactly been a confident auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch has no defence against 7@D or 7NT so he can't double 7@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: the imp score wont be too different even if doubled!|pg||
nt|josj: no, he does...|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: N has to show his good 5-card @h before S can act|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not keen on the heart lead. to me best chance of beating 3S on this auction would be to lead a minor king, try to get an ace out of dummy before hearts are set up|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think we saw the actual auction wasa problem with it operator wise o think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E very likely to have 6 hearts on this auction, not something like Axxxx.|pg||
nt|neobas: Effective 4@S bid here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: pesky taht @H's break badl |pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: No basis in this mathmatically though |pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@c was challenging as opposite to 6|pg||
nt|neobas: Though it didn't help in the CR|pg||
nt|sybarra: or play it this way,  this will work also|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: depends if you are sure East is short in @h on the bidding    probable|pg||
nt|sybarra: *badly|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: 4 or 5 imps, possibly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A quiet 2 down it seems|pg||

nt|lestergold: auction|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: must play a spade now |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: sees would have to drop K@D  and then end play east with ace king and another spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: got it all accross without getting above 4 level|pg||

nt|blum1956: just to find the opponents in the hearts game|pg||
nt|ady: now juming in at the 3 level   seems odd|pg||
nt|yo_yo: double now?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I see they follow Meyer's line of opening 1@S with weak 5-5 hands|pg||
nt|neobas: Heya Constantin|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: Senior has the space tov stick 2@h in here at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Michelle bids a Jacoby 2NT agreeing @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like an old rubber bridge moan to me--you were not good enough to bid two but you could bid three  :) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: John might get the @H wrong now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C or @H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 1 hes vulnerable 2 he only has 3 hearts and 3 he is minimum point count |pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: well the light opening bid as against a "weak " 2 may prove dividende here|pg||
nt|sybarra: my typical trump support for pard (E hand) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: tempting for osbourne to bid on but he did his work with the preempt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has N denied 4@H i wonder|pg||
nt|ady: can make 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the play-record here was wrong and N has 4 @Hs in the end|pg||
nt|georgia19: I guess, never mind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: confess i would open the W hand at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and second round double expresses his hand now very well|pg||
nt|georgia19: 2@d showing one major|pg||
nt|othered1: open with?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless playing 2H = 9-12 or the like|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: in this case   not an advantage  because 3 @c could be stronger|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: folks I got crunched for time,  so must leave.....see you all later or tomorrow as the case may be @H@H@H  |pg||
nt|josj: tomorrow is later too, cu :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Thank you Shirley :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Garvey has looked at the vulnerbaility and respected it for once but as it happens i think 2@s rolls in|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Palau worked that it showed distribution and not strength with the adverse bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: after a @S to K in CR decl play for the double-finess in @d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: cross ruffs galore  coming|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 4@H on east's hand here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|ady: 5 lekely to go down for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: Holland judged well to take what they can|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: 2 places to play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT is that "choose your minor"?|pg||
nt|lestergold: first round double abnd south would have easily gone overboard in hearts|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: good lead|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|garnetts: has no other option here |pg||
nt|yo_yo: gtg now, bye everyone  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks Mike/Ralf|pg||
nt|yo_yo: David |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@h is makeable on a @s lead and a lucky @hKx in front|pg||
nt|othered1: double by south is one of the stranger bids I"ve seen|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, yes, but he has to be thinking there is something odd about the W auction, since she passed as dealer and does not have 4 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like 3@h on west's hand here|pg||
nt|josj: they have been playing quite fast, as the 13th board will come up after just 1hr. 10 min. of play|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: in my opinion it is merely maximum for 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry N dbl|pg||
nt|othered1: Without complicated methods, 3@H looks OK to me.  If  you play weak jump shifts by passed  hand, 2@H may do.  But you have to keep major focus on @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is simply not a 3 level bid whenever partner has no heart fit likely to get into trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: as here and with a vengeance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you dont bid 3H on this hand, what passed hand WOULD bid it? it is already a borderline opener as it is|pg||
nt|othered1: And isn't 4@H a reasonable spot, whatdo you think is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: West checking system card|pg||

nt|yo_yo: maybe it's the good @H that stopped Townsend opening 2@S|pg||

nt|lestergold: well i promise 4 H or a hand good enuf to cope with any acrtion by my pard|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: last board for this segment |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: thank you everybody and sew you in few minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: ...|pg||
nt|stc: just one oops for S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: and the last one for this segment of the 2nd match|pg||
nt|josj: much more fun this way, Laure :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: And the last but not the least|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: Last board for this segment|pg||
nt|josj: play will continue after this 13th and final board of the segment in 35 mins. from now|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: see you in 35 minutes for this other segment of this match|pg||
nt|josj: that;s at 11.55 local time|pg||
nt|stc: because of several boards with "no card play" at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: Thank Jos ...|pg||
mb|p!|mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: I played against him for 2 hours here the other day. Most of the time he was light or off-shape for his actions|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: even if this is not the case the opponents will be often in trouble in the hearts game the opener having that kind of a hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam bidding has been the main difference|pg||
nt|sharkey: merci Laure|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha, no problem Laure :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: If West had opned 2@S is North really going to double?  Certainly won't bid 3@H |pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps for Hacket on board 9  where 6@H went down 1 in open room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what?  no agreement? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone protect with the West hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Roland here is a fine slam for you to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: grand slam on ice!!!|pg||
nt|othered1: OK weak NT, even vul.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clear 1N, especially with 33 in majors|pg||
nt|neobas: Having operated many times I have made many more mistakes than one :)|pg||
nt|josj: good|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|lestergold: i borrow a point and protect|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry not quite grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Laure,  great job |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: another possible slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: really?|pg||
nt|lestergold: biut 6 on ice|pg||
nt|georgia19: I think they'll get there, hopefully ony to 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think may pairs would bid 6 on these cards|pg||
nt|pelu: the last slam gave - as exp - 11 IMPs to Small|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a very ciommon british disease this love of the wak no  trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the spades are very dodgy|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess west can justify 2@H because of the stiff @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c from W?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh overcall not so clear but not likely to get nailed even when it could, and may disrupt EW just enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i wouldnt play it with gun to my head but very widespread in uk|pg||
nt|josj: ty Laure and cu later, this afternoon|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: It looks as if Twonsend thinks this shows a hand that would have made a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play the double as penalty of a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could be in difficulty here if e/w keep doubling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play it shows @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a slam below par obviously when you must play that suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: :) ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx fellow commentators for you time |pg||
nt|josj: ty Constantin|pg||
nt|stc: bye|pg||
nt|josj: ty all kibz. :)|pg||
nt|josj: for watching us; we hope you enjoyed it|pg||
nt|josj: as I expected: a routine 3nt and a routine -1 (or more...)|pg||
nt|stc: many points but no play ! 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is out of reach|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: if east can double showing values  west will surely pass|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is quite a lucky result in OR|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: are we into relays?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like (again)|pg||
nt|lestergold: extra values but even 5@s is alittle precarious|pg||
nt|georgia19: got that wrong then|pg||
nt|lestergold: but above 12.855 Roland|pg||
nt|georgia19: Garvey not interested over weak NT|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup, well done Laure :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I prefer the agreement that x is pens after a weak notrump and a suit after a strong/medium notrump |pg||
nt|yo_yo: oooops   true,  no agreement :)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s of the hook|pg||
nt|georgia19: Steve taking over, now you might get some intelligent comments from here....|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: bye    EW make 3@c|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Shirley, for your wit as well :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d  just forcing showing 5 @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back very shortly after comparison |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: Small has a sign off now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small's diamond suit does not like like slam, material|pg||
nt|othered1: It looks like natural @C opening there motivated west to push with such a good fit for @C|pg||
nt|neobas: And to the kibs for keeping us alert and providing us with extra insights :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6:10 am Los Angeles, 9:10 am New York, 15.10 Paris, 2:10 pm London, 11:10 pm Sydney|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: Garvey is wild about getting into auctions early but doens rotuinely overbid in these situations|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: where did N find that X???|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR|pg||
nt|blum1956: Against weak NT it is better to play "diamonds or strong, starting from a strong NT"|pg||
nt|josj: the 2nd segment of 13 boards shoujld start in about 20 mins. at 19.00 hrs. local|pg||
nt|stc: NS could take the first 8 tricks !!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: thank you everybody, i hope i will see you in 20 minutes ... for the 2ND segement of this match|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|garnetts: Some decided to dbl 3NT next door--someone should have redoubled |pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks look a lot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: This is truely poor bridge from EW--|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's not better about either, just depends which hand comes along|pg||
nt|ady: might well make on the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however I would have expected a pair of such quality as townsend Bakhshi to have discussed this one|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well time to put brakes on as cards lie 11 tricks ok |pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think the brakes are going on|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: I believe the technical term is Desperation Double :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Not sure I understand this auction|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW 3 NT CR|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Au revoir Laure :)|pg||
nt|stc: it will be seven|pg||
nt|josj: à demain, Laure :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the resul : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Laure, Constantin, Jos and Shirley :)|pg||
nt|neobas: And of course the kibs :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lebridgeur: not forcing after east's initial pass 3@c would be forcing otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: i hope i will see you in few minues for the2nd segment off this match|pg||
nt|neobas: 3NT is down on a @S lead it seems|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|stc: even 4@h may make (loosing 2@hs and 1@d)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: well kin'sare on|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: Here east may get squeezed in the minors for 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h bid by the darimng Malinowski who probably adds on three points for his own card play|pg||
nt|lestergold: which im afraid isa  more reliable method of hand evaluation than some|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny, but if you play support doubles, allowing east to distinguish between 3 and 4-card support, you'll likely stay out.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|georgia19: or not!|pg||
nt|georgia19: hi all|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|garnetts: it should be incumbent upon players wanting to represent their country to have sorted this out |pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are a newish partnership|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H favourable this should make|pg||
nt|blum1956: the strongest part of the weak NT - you make the opponents not to know their HCP's. They often land in 22-23 HCP 3NT. Still you nead to beat that.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: King's were on but Small is still plunging headlong there|pg||
nt|lestergold: very un disciplined in my view|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: its a not even good enuf for roland im trying to work out how the cards would have to lie for thsi slam to be makeable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must win @cA if S plays a small from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will know that from the lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: well I am moaning the lead was awful--and South should have doubled |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: sorry but the players hided theirs cards ....|pg||
nt|neobas: No problem :) Thanks Laure!|pg||
nt|stc: anyway the result is normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: bye everybody|pg||
nt|josj: I can imagine they are hiding their cards oin this board...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: see you in few minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: bye bye|pg||
nt|josj: maybe 3nt is a little too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: et thank you again|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|garnetts: South must double to keep EDW honest and North on track--so he doesn't look elsewhere for a lead like he has |pg||
nt|ady: e/w have useful lower diamond pips|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: I am corrected, Townsend/Bakhshi not a "newish" partner|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a NEW partnership|pg||
nt|blum1956: the game of bridge is not that all for high card points|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS doing well for EW on this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is interesting and instructional to see play like this and where it stems from---North started with a bad lead because he though his side needed to find fast tricks  |pg||
nt|blum1956: West must establish a trick in a minor suit  to discard his 4th heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: If Souht had doubled then his opening lead would have been like ace and another heart |pg||
nt|garnetts: this would also have left dec to get on with it and he would have no chance |pg||
nt|garnetts: Shows that bridge relies upon so many tells -|pg||
nt|blum1956: is he going not to play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D  would have been killing switch if 9 was with south|pg||
nt|ady: has to cover or will go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to be in 6 on that possibility |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike, but must still be done|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: Noa, but on this favorable lie of EW cards, it scores|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: king will try it but Osborne will be awake im sure|pg||
