mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi again Geoff|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  not making  |pg||
nt|deltadash: me 2 - can't say I blame him either|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: no because coole's trumps ensure that the losing spadews cant all be ruiffed|pg||
nt|deltadash: what do we know??? lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good morning specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: surprisingly disciplined pass from Garvey |pg||
nt|ady: what can Garvey do about 3NT at level vulnerability   has to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Forrester "ridiculous this, sorry"|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Mike|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: north has shown 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a complex strong club system with a lot of relay responses|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: expect lots of transfers as well...|pg||
nt|lestergold: David you an i have to pass but Garvey does not al;ways pass when you have to pass!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do you have the EW names please operator?|pg||
nt|georgia19: Hi, geoff, assume E/W are Nevena Senior and Hallburg|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Greetings to everyone for the 2nd stanza of this weekend's Premier League|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far more commentators than specs|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcarroll: Morning Geoffrey|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway has led away from an AQ and nhit pard so a k,iller|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8 tricks with club finesse|pg||
nt|ady: lopsside no-trump opening by North     likely to fail in spite of K@C well placed     but may go through if North plays a diamond now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: defence just need to be awake if a diamond is played|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: handling the 4-1 trump break will be tricky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may try to sneak a heart through before playing spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi david|pg||
nt|roswolf: and mike:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|ady: diamond switch might have worried declarer  to lay down ace and king of trumps|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: Selwqay will not be hanging about if @d played|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: west is a lady world champion who i used to play with a lot|pg||
nt|georgia19: Just the spades to ruff after losing one|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: declarer needs a little care|pg||
nt|roswolf: still needs|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: Key play|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: which is duly taken|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: once the 6 card club suit is revealed defenders wont go wrong    but Sandquist trying to make with spade finesse    |pg||
nt|lestergold: Sandqvist on first board is demionstrating his reputation for somewhat wild bids|pg||
mc|7|nt|lestergold: and on this occasion he is likely to ne punished|pg||
nt|roswolf: they usually work though|pg||
pg||

nt|Walddk2: www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010january-July/Pleague/index.htm  for standings after 3 matches|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass 1@D maybe|pg||
nt|eggy: He might double that too :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jtr: oh Justin opened|pg||
nt|eggy: A good advert for the Woolsey theory of leading to NT - never lead from broken sequences|pg||
nt|jtr: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well this is hilarious|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems a fair enough double in that position|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|eggy: especially as Justin was super maximum for his pass|pg||
nt|eggy: so he won't get carried away without shape|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jtr: That is why the double is safer facing a passed hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: But then we wouldnt have had the pleasure of watching a 1@d contract:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one could make me travel to Manchester to play 1@D. I can do that at home|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jtr: It is no doubt raining there as well|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||

nt|roswolf: fair point david|pg||
nt|mdgraham: stronger men would have wilted..|pg||
nt|roswolf: but playing with brian senior needs perhaps more bravery!:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lyijng badly here for E/W|pg||
nt|lestergold: at top level they do not work often enuf|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might be a tasty sandwich here|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: So first IMP to HF Verðbrféf and off we go:)|pg||
nt|ady: low partial for e/w  in spades|pg||
mb|1D|nt|iceking: 1NT 14-16hcp |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: straightforward 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   may be made  with a squeeze in diamonds and spades  on south|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 1@C nt nat or bal|pg||
nt|roswolf: even nick will pass here|pg||
nt|ady: not a lot on here    3@C e/w |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dont really want toget above two level|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: east might have re-opened|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no real way for EW to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt by east?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: i believe e/w are playing a natural 5 card major system|pg||
nt|georgia19: hmm, some work to get this one on the card|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: other Senior, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Nevena|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: Selway happy to defend 1@d. Possibly might have reopened with 1NT |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H resumably transfer rebid to spades?|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H  relay I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: som,e moght borrow a point nd balance with 1N with E at fave vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: If Tosh scrambles 7 tricks here Selway will regret not having done so|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence likkely to be endplayed once or twice|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: sorry  already 10 tricks    can made an 11th|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 1@S overcall is yuck and vul too|pg||
nt|lestergold: the problemn with these light openers is when partner has an almost opening bid himself|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: Normal play here will lead to one down i predict 4 round of clubs-try AK of spades No Q drop and lose to heart finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: south doesnt even have a ggod quality suit|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: now declarer sees diamonds 5-3.. he migt go for endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: good|pg||
nt|ady: I would expect east to make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: nevena is a fine player and normally her declarer play is superb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 2@D @C @s TO LOSE|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzrz: that is 4x clubs, KA spades, diamond|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like we're done|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: arrived in a good spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 unopposed bids to reach 2@s|pg||
nt|deltadash: makes you tired doesn't it Mike, lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: my son made me tired from the moment he was born|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|deltadash: lol - I know THAT feeling :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|iceking: indeed |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzrz: but raggi did well to play small d'|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway might not finish up so happy|pg||
nt|lestergold: first endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spade switch might have done better|pg||
nt|lestergold: how man times have we sat there with a big trump holding against a 1 level contractg and watched declarer rack up 7 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: things a little easier with heart lead|pg||
nt|deltadash: Today is my eldest child's 50th birthday - THAT makes me tired, lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other scores after the second stanza: Rosen +53 vs Hackett --- Crouch +51 vs Senior --- de Botton +45 vs Hinden |pg||
nt|lestergold: he made me play endless card games with him when he was a toddler especially trumps!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, caps lock :(|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: ah keyboarditis is spreading|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|deltadash: does he prefer bridge or poker now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: bridge altho he plays poker quite well|pg||
nt|lestergold: its Cook here that is the poker pro|pg||
nt|deltadash: :) nice to know you passed that gene on|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey is an ale pro|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: rehi connection failed|pg||
nt|ady: rehi|pg||
nt|deltadash: re: hi all - small glitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: playing here but lost a couple of tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has a reputation  for immodesty on  a grand scale|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: gold got the @S right|pg||
nt|deltadash: lol, sounds interesting|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey is a major talking poiny in the UK bridge world|pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen says NO ONE END PLAYS ME|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: especially as the @S suit plays for no loser|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|roswolf: almost guaranteed on the overcall|pg||
nt|ady: as pointed out   also elininate clubs   and throw in with either spade or diamond works|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|1S|nt|jtr: Sunny???????  Not possible:)|pg||

nt|jtr: at red especially|pg||
nt|eggy: full strength surely :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jtr: I would be bidding 4@d with Justin's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|jtr: South was encouraged to save next door by partner's 1@h response|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|jtr: I am a little surprised he didnt bid 5@c though in case the opponents bid on|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: South you mean?|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|eggy: Even 3D looks a little tame - It looks like partner is terrible as he will be short in spades|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|dJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: True but would partner bid 5 if he chose 4@d ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Partner is not bidding until the next hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|eggy: I'm not sure you want him too - looks like 5D should havbe been -4 anyway :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: is there an upside to overcalling 1@S on that hand?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: None, imho|pg||
nt|georgia19: nasty contract to play, but unavoidable to be in it|pg||
nt|roswolf: another trappy hand for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: not all of the talk is complimentary bit he is certainly talented and colorful|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm nice|pg||
nt|lestergold: predictable|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tosh can play the cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: auld lang syne and all that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: There is one very happy spectator so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: agree  - weak suit, weak hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: yup, another -1 game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difference was that on board 1 declarer's Kx was worth a trick; on board 2 it wasn't|pg||
nt|roswolf: preempting to the limit|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing a weekend tourney with Garvey needs a visit to a rehab afterwards|pg||
nt|ady: part score again     likely in spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|iceking: 11 rule though indicated diamonds were 5-3 so he should gone for endplay maybe but he knows Páll is very tricky could lead from any card from any holdings|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzrz: should be rather easy to get to 7s after this start|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: in the closed room south opened a strong club|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: and when north responded 2n, south bid 3c intended as stayman/baron, but north took it as natural|pg||
mb|d!|an|3!H|nt|ady: possibly hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am pleased that west doesnt subscribe to the flimsy 1@S overcall theory|pg||
nt|lestergold: snaqvist responding with square root of nothing as usual|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzrz: as Raggi normally plays very honest carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: he probably got confused by d2 at trick 2|pg||
nt|ady: only possible game   4@S  for n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ady: 5@D   has 3 losers with bad trump split|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass imo|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to keep his partner now from propelling to the sky|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: a suppoet double on the south hand doesnt feel right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may encourage South to try 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C   can make as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: kept e/w quiet anyway|pg||
nt|ady: there is some play for this   but did not think e/w would get to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrt: waterloe "hope im not too good"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with four-card support, it's pushing the boundaries to raise to 3@H as West, particularly with three small spades |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i think south took the correct view on this hand|pg||
nt|ady: might make on a club lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: the club barrage has made it awkward for Fiorrester|pg||
nt|deltadash: that was helpful for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: couldnot bid only 3@h as danger of missing game|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump lead gives gold a chance now to make|pg||
nt|ady: could go wrong in trump suit if Garvey plays 9 quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: really with 3 top losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: well I hadn't expected Crouch to do that - and he's got away with it undoubled - not that it matters|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he did play quickly! but not the 9!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iceking: 2D- Multi dbl-13-16 hcp most shapes or any 17plus |pg||
nt|lestergold: so you push then into  a bad game then feel sick as it rolls in|pg||
nt|deltadash: he's home free now, @d shift too late|pg||
nt|ady: really needed diamond lead to beat this for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally io expected a @d to hit the table |pg||
nt|ady: could not shift any quicker    needed opening lead|pg||
nt|deltadash: me too Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like the natural lead to me|pg||
nt|ady: dont think trump from JXX is natural   with no holding in spades   |pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean a @d lead david not the silly trump|pg||
nt|ady: ok    sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s may well make but unlikkely to be bid however 5@d has been duly punished|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Won't be too hard for the defence to switch to trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: selway wields a firm axe|pg||
nt|ady: wont like the sight of dummy      north may have considered passing the opening again |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes caution would have worked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as this hand shows, responding on that type of hand can have its drawbacks|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sanfqvist in my opinion is wrong to employ these tactics playing against very tough opposition|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: looks like -500    ok if 4@S makes|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW will be happy with what they get - they will observe 4@H goes down|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are rabbit killing tactcis |pg||
nt|lestergold: selway and erichsen unfortunately are not rabbits|pg||
nt|roswolf: big rabbits|pg||
nt|roswolf: elk in espens case with huge sharp antlers:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzrz: he will check if spades 40 ... if not, then he will claim|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: yes he might well say that and perhaps vul he would have gone for it|pg||
nt|georgia19: he saved E/W from bidding a failing game:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|iceking: 2 down no disaster |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: Sandqvist and Tosh did win the TGR auction pairsd last year with a runaway top score but they have yet to make their mark at top international level sanqvist of course has a world ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: silver medal playing with Malinowski in 2006 bejing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: not unreasable to play partial   5@C  needs some luck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no ruffs in dummy for south :(|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: however the Law says you should, and it may very well be right |pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: the doubled undertricks are expensive|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|roswolf: yes a plus should be quite good for e/w|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: looks like possibly 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iceking: declerar could have escaped 1 down cashing trump T east is quard squeezed |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will have to hope that their teammates make 4@S |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I have been in worse grand slams|pg||
nt|jtr: @c lead makes it awkward|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|eggy: 6D was perhaps a bit lazy?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: It's the solid spots in diamonds that makes it so good ... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Undo please Martin|pg||
nt|jtr: True|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not really easy to diagnose in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jtr: @dJ vital for 7 to be good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I am sure some of those relay boys can find out|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jtr: they ask for queens at the 2 level|pg||
mb|4N|nt|eggy: South was presumably unlimited when he bid 4D, but perhaps Sandqvist thought that Q bids may be a bit murky|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, North should know he has the @dJ|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Not enough i think|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Here's the key point ... does South have anything extra?  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am pretty sure that this North hand is too good for 18-19. Let's ask KNR|pg||
nt|jtr: Has to bid it himself although South may value the @hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 19.5 on the Kaplan&Rubens Hand Evaluator|pg||
nt|jtr: Rethink|pg||
nt|jtr: Sometimes dangerous as partner may have paused|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Kx+AK10xx+KJx+Axx|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North knows he's off @CK|pg||
nt|eggy: It's not usually right for the hand that has limited itself to be in control of such auctions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So a 2NT opening would not have been unreasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: @sQ would do for 7|pg||
nt|eggy: South can't have too many clubs so 7 isn't a terrible shot however|pg||
nt|jtr: better than @hQ actually|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North sees AJxxx-x-AQxxx-xx opposite|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So he thinks, I've got to ruff out the spades ... are the diamonds good enough?|pg||
nt|jtr: North couldnt bid 4@s over 4@d as that would be to play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010january-July/Pleague/index.htm  for standings after 3 matches|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: It's a truly borderline decision for him ... if he knew partner had @D10, perhaps he bids the grand|pg||
nt|eggy: But that's the worst he can have, either major Q makes it pretty good I think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does, but why should partner have it?  That's why he tried with 5NT ... but partner said "no"|pg||
nt|jtr: Super safety? Or is it?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|jtr: But can partner value AQ(J)xx @s?|pg||

nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have to hope for 4@S bid and made OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: look destined for 3NT  e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: another difficult hand|pg||
nt|ady: not much here  |pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen is a slow and thoughtful player with a low error rate|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this has potential|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed a teanmate of mine and we reached the semi final of the english trials|pg||
mb|1C|an|polish|nt|vugraphzrz: a very good result for ew in closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: after west opened, east didnt stop below 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well an easy game to bid but may be trickier to play|pg||
nt|deltadash: another part score|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: possible grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 1nt and end there|pg||
nt|ady: could just get overboard   finding 9 card diamond fit     limit 11 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: now i agree with that overcall - good quality suit|pg||
nt|ady: likely end in 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS play Polish Club|pg||
mb|2H|nt|iceking: coffee board not much in this one |pg||
nt|lestergold: Tosh is of course a telveision bridge star!|pg||
nt|roswolf: a test of their methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ady: will do well to negotiate 7@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway one of two brothers legendary for their rubber bridge play|pg||
nt|ady: but if there  no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: balanced hands are opened 1@C or 1NR|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 6nt may be the practical end spot though|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: oh boy going for range asking with 9hcp |pg||
nt|lestergold: this needs good guesses to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i bet 2sp was misbid |pg||
nt|iceking: when you play range asking stayman 2sp here shows 10-11hcp 4sp|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: their version is a little different... 2s is 13-15 wth 4s|pg||
nt|iceking: yes 2d all min|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: or that is what north said|pg||
nt|iceking: correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: first guess not needed!|pg||
nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: assume 1NT forcing   so West may have to show a 3 card suit 2nd time with 5-5--3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: so was 1nt 11-17hc|pg||
nt|georgia19: 5@d a safer spot for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: will roll in if rthey bid it they should|pg||
nt|lestergold: it has many options an excellent con tract and most of the options work|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is never that easy the @HQ is a hardworking card|pg||
mb|6D|nt|lestergold: shopuld make losing @d, 2@h ,@c and @s|pg||
nt|ady: club lead  much better for defence   |pg||
nt|lestergold: don thinj a club ruff san be unravelled |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: im not sure...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl=three-card heart support|pg||
nt|roswolf: support doubles are very useful|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a punt like that wont get you there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a surprise - what's the hurry?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Tosh didnt look pleased |pg||
nt|ady: could make even without Q@H   as long as spades no worse than 4-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed -|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh there is a way osnt there|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: Sandqvist has a reputation for brilliance combined with unsound bidding decisions|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a typical example of poor english slam bidding - go slowly and use all the tools assuming you have them of course|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ady: but not neccessaryily fatal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after 4@d  - maybe 4@h-4@s-5@c and then a chance|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: lub lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|georgia19: chance now if N/S mess up the heart suit|pg||
nt|georgia19: but they won't|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes should be -1 but defence needs care|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/Pleague/A_div_1/ADivision1.htm  for standings after 2 matches|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sandqvist is a very dangerous opponent when the wind is blowing his way|pg||
nt|ady: potential swing for Rosen|pg||
nt|roswolf: we as a style do not like using science|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: 10 tricks with the diamonds kind|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|cQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: I think the usefulness of Support Doubles depends on your general system framework - good in a strong NT/5cM system, maybe not so good in weak/4cM |pg||
nt|roswolf: np for espen|pg||
nt|lestergold: I feel that his temperament is not that ideal for te top level- he takes failure very badly|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jtr: No, i said he couldnt|pg||

nt|vugraphzrz: so they go to lvl3 with 15-16...|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be competitive|pg||
nt|lestergold: after all Gold s 2@c bid was alerted as not natura;|pg||
nt|ady: not much on again|pg||
nt|lestergold: major part score for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get overboard with 6-5-11 shape|pg||
nt|roswolf: talking about the great mass of players of course - that is why the theoreticians like peter crouch should be encouraged|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that may be flat, but somehow you get a feeling that it will not be|pg||
nt|lestergold: the will to win is essentail at this level but u need to combine it with a good temperament that is not measy|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: you had a chance to  rebid them and you didnt"  M to S|pg||
nt|roswolf: it SHOULDNT be flat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a copy of the full Crouch-Patterson system - goodness me, it is complex|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: spades will win|pg||
mb|1H|nt|iceking: yes 2d would have been 11-12- 2h/2sp/2nt 13-14 3level is natural 15-16|pg||
nt|roswolf: bidding a slam in @S is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|georgia19: I know, Geoff, but it's such fun playing against players who know what's going on and save you thinking:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: oobviously some sort of major 2 suiter weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: south with  ll his values in minors will discourage|pg||
nt|deltadash: will they land in @s or @h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s have an easy spade game   but e/w  may sacrifice  with their good heart fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe unsuccessful but not unreasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west enter the fray|pg||
nt|ady: depends if west can get over the 2 suiter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: he's thinking hard|pg||
nt|lestergold: Crouch is one of our very top bidding theorists|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: 1nt = 14-16|pg||
nt|georgia19: in that case we should see a pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: THERFORE NORTY IS DECIDEDLY MINIMUM|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt matter as long as they dont get above 3 level|pg||
nt|deltadash: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: Runar and Valur copy each other and bid 3nt instead of raising to 4s|pg||
nt|roswolf: or even north|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: north gets the slam scent|pg||
nt|ady: n/s limit is 10 tricks on a diamond lead   so n/s have to be careful not to go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after 1M-2N (raise), can use double as a minor plus the other major - here 3@H pre-empts diamonds, if that is your fit|pg||
nt|georgia19: keyboarditis again|pg||
nt|ady: might make 9 tricks in hearts    seems only 8 in spades|pg||
nt|ady: 3 level might be too high|pg||
nt|ady: west might balance|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|iceking: this will make 11tricks 450 so SW evened this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: but n/s are uber aggressive|pg||
nt|georgia19: and me wrong to boot - nothing new there|pg||
nt|ewj: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult even for the garve to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the principles seem very sound. There may be a memory aspect though |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but at least they work at it and it is terringfyingly accurate in slam auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/Pleague/A_div_1/ADivision1.htm  for standings after 2 matches|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)on both counts|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are a pair to be reckoned with|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: and if 3@H is doubled, are you really going to 4@D? |pg||
nt|roswolf: this i think is not 100%clearcut for north|pg||
nt|georgia19: are they really, hard to imagine|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT on here    but would have to play diamonds from the top    likely play 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: another -1?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, agree. A lot of pairs are not prepared to put in the work|pg||
nt|ady: might try 4NT invite|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that would be my choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cannot succeed at top level internationally without a lot f work on sustem|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Erichsen studying hard here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Gold knows that balancing with his flat hand dangerous especially as he klnows n/s havent a great fit so where is his side's 3 level fit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: england players are bad at tyhat|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that lead guarantees -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: with a few exceptions|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes too many distractions|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: S "nothing extra"|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: think west worried about a stack of minor cards in south hand    left well alone  though diamonds does not play badly|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is why we do not have the strength in depth of many other european nations even tho we have the raw talent|pg||
nt|ady: well may be some of them have careers    and not enough time to devote to bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: excuses are fine david|pg||
nt|roswolf: even the real professionals dont practice that often with their"favorite"pard - too busy playing with punters to make a living|pg||
nt|ady: not an excuse    a fact|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: good duck by north|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell have a good agreement in these auctions - pass forces double, double indicates uncertainty and a bid says I think we can make this|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: but thios is not mps and with a healthy lead, Gold will not want to risk 300s and 500s against a paet score|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think it is a fact that our top internationals do not get sufficient support from our national organisation to play abaroad and ghet the experience they need|pg||

nt|pelu: flat board - no problem - 3@C easy win|pg||
nt|ady:  J@H doubleton  gives this a good chance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did you download the comprhensive version?|pg||
nt|georgia19: can't see Hallberg failing in this one - despite the trump break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at the moment, one would have to say so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a shorter version to the right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have both :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes more comphrensible|pg||
nt|pfbr: @h Happy Birthday Roland @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks A :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd1 in the other room n/s missed the game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't like birthdays - another year less to live :( |pg||
nt|lestergold: in Gold's interest to play second heart now to confirm pards possesion of the AK|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think Cooke will also play Gold for length in @ds when he shows up with a siingleton trump|pg||
nt|ady: he would be right    he has 3 diamonds   |pg||
nt|ewj: Yeh, it's not very interesting - there is just no chance at all he will make this :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so at the risk of commentator's curse i predict that this will be nisht machen|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|georgia19: I'm not surprised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What makes you think Gunnar will guess clubs?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: K@C now could make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: south will have a pretty good count, as East is marked with @CA|pg||
nt|roswolf: some specs are not enamoured of north's leap to game - but since this is a family programme i cant repeat them here:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: He did not|pg||
nt|roswolf: he hasnt|pg||
nt|pfbr: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And I can understand why|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: Erichsen has no reason to x this doesnt want to give away his heart hlding he doesnt know just how bereft n/s are in other departments not to mentuiomn the fact that his hearts are ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: sitting over the AKo|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
mc|7|nt|Walddk4: Sometimes Patterson would lead a club from the queen, but never from the ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup divine inspiration was needed|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Exit in clubs after one top heart|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You have 2 club losers no matter what|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jtr: Cards more friendly this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And if they play a second diamond Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they have a ruff it is usually from the hand with 3 trumps if they are 3-2|pg||
nt|jtr: I wonder what 1@s would mean by South|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Still, he's trying to make 2@H - the simplest way to do that is to hope hearts are 3-2 and the spade ace is on-side.  Anythiing else risks going down in a cold contract|pg||
mb|3H|an|*|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: You still make it if @SA is onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Not if the short heart gets a diamond ruff|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No, but that is against the odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Is it?  Aren't diamond just as likely to be 4-1 as hearts?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then you could suffer 3 diamond ruffs!|pg||
nt|jtr: I think his play was to exit after the two top @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but the one with 2 diamonds has 3 hearts rather than 2 most of the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge is all about probabilities|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: bell explaining bidding to jason|pg||
nt|jtr: He has 5 top losers remember so no chance if @hs are 4-1 but optimise your chances when they are 3-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think we might close this discussion with agreement - indeed it is all about the probabilities|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jtr: I disagree:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh well, Roland and I have decided not to invite you to our argument :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Humpf!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An Irishman should focus on his Irish slams :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, lets play 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I play it with the probabilities in mind|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Which means hoping like anything that West has @SJ or @HQ|pg||
nt|jtr: You could laso ruff a @h|pg||
nt|jtr: also|pg||
nt|jtr: Hope to just lose 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sort of a cross ruff?  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: That line looks pretty good now that you have been given a free club trick|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: But the lead smells a bit maybe |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Likely to have 4@cs on this bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: I think i would hope to escape with one round of @ss|pg||

nt|jtr: the 8 then solidifies the suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: studying|pg||
nt|jtr: Not sullying then?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not even sulking|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||

nt|pelu: _)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: i can tell you he is not very happy about his glasses now ....|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks   but some risk bu north for the 1 imp in this case|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this may be fascinating|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, South had a decent hand - five hearts was a bonus|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots if fits here|pg||
nt|ady: obvious  n/s are ddddestined for a minus    but getting into game might have caused the red card  and 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: Snadqvist is bidding l;ike as bat out of hell|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the grinding wheel is in action for later boards|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this will be feisty|pg||
nt|roswolf: where will the music stop|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d 0+cards; Denies 6+m unless 4M|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Ahh, Mike has it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then I can take a breather|pg||
nt|georgia19: he has it ALL:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D does not promise any @D |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I've got cut and paste too|pg||
nt|ady: seems 5 of a minor e/w should fail|pg||
mb|1S|nt|iceking: what should east bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: not clear maybe 3sp preemptive |pg||
nt|iceking: even he has only xxx in trumps he has some tricks and you like to give those strong club openers hard time|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|wk NT  not 4!S|nt|roswolf: south needs to take the low road|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have a big herts fit   but unless they get a club lead  then can only make a part sccore    8 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be some action  here|pg||
nt|deltadash: lively auction coming up|pg||
nt|ady: danger of n/s getting too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cooke will barrage this i expect to 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: late warning from director|pg||
nt|ady: or possibly e/w |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: north will leave this in good trump contral and good lead |pg||
nt|ady: 5 diamonds a decent contract for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: m/s will get too higgh but i will be surprised if this hand is not bought by e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is weak|pg||
nt|ady: well probably get to a dodgy 4@S    but will make|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|iceking: wrong again|pg||
mb|2S|nt|iceking: looks clear to pass 3sp dbl and lead diamonds though at least in my world |pg||
nt|deltadash: nice no bid by Cooke|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suppose the 2 tens give the hand a robust strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: looks like a double partscore for hf verdbref|pg||
nt|georgia19: well N/S know about their spade fit but not the double fit|pg||
nt|ady: auction quieter than we thought|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh Gold has found the perfect solution but i was not sure how natural the @d opner was|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus score for e/w fine here|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  also likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s is quite a good contract better than 3N|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|iceking: i dont see this makeable |pg||
nt|roswolf: now that is a fine bid imo(1nt)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: consideration for 5@C (lead and all that)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Interesting 5@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a drawback of the system in that north isny sure of the double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a lot of play in this contract the 8 +7 @D may come into it|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Erichsen asking about @D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: is it 4, could it be canape|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: there has to be the right lead and switch to beat 5@D |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: F asking about the 2@H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D = PROBABLY GF CHECKBACK|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: he will probably be told that it shows diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s may have to give tricks away|pg||
nt|ady: Jacj and importan 8 spades in west position useful|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: must actually promise 4 in which case with nothing in the majors Gold's bid looks about right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: hmm- you should win the ace there, k|pg||
nt|ady: on a heart lead Cooke may get it right|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 4@s loses 3 trump tricks the heart finesse is a fall back basically you need one of two finesses and no horrible ,breaks almost 755 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: diamond play interrtesting|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W may give them no option but to help with tricks 8 and 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: paul puts down his cards to think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon West was going to play @D9 from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just to let aprtner know immediately that you've got it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C a splinter - they do have methods then - just that they dont use them on the right hands|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: will declarer get the trumps right? i think he should|pg||
nt|lestergold: 75%|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: he can't - Q9x in East|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You are very good if you can play that suit for no loser when they are 3-1, Geoffrey :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: but this pause may give him pause... |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|iceking: stuck now EW will score some hearts on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|georgia19: as long as he doesn't play the 10 and e covers:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you could run the 10 and hope to pin the stiff 9 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 10 was a valiant try regardless|pg||
nt|ady: this time north does have more than enough for game opposite opening bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: the endplay on south is looming|pg||

pc|s2|nt|pelu: not so easy to dedeat 5@C :) - after @S to @C4 and @CJ to A - then @S to ruff-discarf will set up a @C-trick for defense :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey happy to play in 1@h rewound opposite an opening bid would expect to scramble 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: north not so confident|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Other scores after the second stanza: Rosen +53 vs Hackett --- Crouch +51 vs Senior --- de Botton +45 vs Hinden |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzrz: Q singleton is close to being a doubleton :-)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Liggins also misguessed clubs in 6@S on board 6|pg||

nt|mdgraham: there used to be a system where an opening 1@S showed 3-8 hcp, 2 or 6+@S I believe  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: called the Super Spade - was certainly used in one of the Olympiads. Swedish, I think  |pg||
nt|roswolf: this is it -must show a 2 suiter of some sort|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s 2@h the limit i fear 3@c e/w|pg||
nt|ady: double 3 card spade support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Dave Carlisle makes an interesting point regarding the 2@S overcall. How would a direct 2@S differ from a delayed 2@s?  |pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: probably 3@D=transfer to @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Lionel|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a delayed 2@s is unambiguous sapdes a direct coul be a strong takeout|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: i think 6@h can make but less than a 50% contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@D likely shows game-invitational values, as he could have bid 2@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: strange that East in CR didn't X|pg||
nt|georgia19: Steve and I play this as a major/minor usually with longer minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah my favorite although brian senior thinks it to be crazy!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: should be easy reach 7 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may regret that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so North accepts|pg||
nt|georgia19: Brian thinks a lot of what Steve says is crazy:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|georgia19: But they agree on football|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 1h some kind of relay bal hands or hearts 1sp forced 3club forcing with hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: has to be a matter of partership agreement|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it may be that they have agreed to play this way to alloow for the many psyches and relay 1 spade bids that are around|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: I get the impression that Brian thinks a lot of what most people say is crazy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW obviously play a direct 2@S as natural - maybe a delayed 2@s would just be protective|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: i would have made a cue and in a sense he is lucky they are missing 2 bullets|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@H    but  a dodgy contract and on spade finess|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: the trump break complicates things a bit|pg||

nt|lestergold: this has the square root of no play|pg||
pc|c6|nt|georgia19: he's a very confident man:)|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|pelu: but u have to X then u give tricks away :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: agains sandqvist has ignored the fact that his pard has made a clearl preemptive raise of his heart overcall and forced him uin to a silly 3N|pg||
nt|ady: how should such an established pair   get so high  ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: and whenyou have a healthy lead no need to risk these sort of slams|pg||

pc|d4|nt|iceking: W hand is the reason you invented RKCB|pg||
nt|iceking: hard to understand this|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Forrester of course worrying about losing the lead twice in the black suitd and being tapped with @ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally I will risk being shot down here but I feel that if Sandqvuist carries on bidding like this eiother his partner or team captain may issue a serious warning red card to ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: him|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s7|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: now low club for a nasty guess|pg||
nt|georgia19: I bet you don't want to say who the other two are:)|pg||

pc|d8|nt|lestergold: David they are not that establuished a sa pair they gave been playing together for only about two years|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, board 4 wasn't flat - 6@D= next door|pg||
nt|ady: think Tosh could also have not bid 3@H with his collection|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is very short term at this level many pairs are ten years or more established|pg||
nt|ady: I call 2 years established Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: jhowever Sandqvist has changed partners a few times halberg and malinowski recent partners both top class world lefvel pards but for whatever reason partnerships did not sustain|pg||

pc|d2|nt|roswolf: is my soul so cheap?|pg||
nt|georgia19: 20 quid wonm't tempt a rich guy like Geoff!!|pg||

nt|ady: weak 2 from south?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Senior made an error when he won @DK at trick 1, showing both top honours|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Yes he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember 1@D doesnt necessarily show the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mr Brian Senior|pg||
nt|roswolf: a rare day indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1N=11-13, possibly a singleton in partner's major|pg||
nt|georgia19: He'd better not be told that you said that, especially on your birthday|pg||
nt|ady: blanced light opening in 1st seat    this pair often do|pg||

mb|2N|an|GF|mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: But it's an error, end of story|pg||
mb|3S|nt|georgia19: maybe he played it so that Penfold would know he had the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Obviously he should try to transfer @DK to his partner who opened the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then perhaps declarer would have played for clubs to be 2-2|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes but like most of our experts they do not seem to work hard at perfecting a peartnership philosophy /bidding system|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Ew just dont wont to get IMPs - 2@S has a chance but not 3@S - best defense is a 3x@s|pg||

nt|ady: 13 cards|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: yes... he just appologised to Laki|pg||
nt|roswolf: north could be tempted!?|pg||
nt|ady: corrected high   nice pre-empt|pg||
nt|georgia19: 11, but 12??|pg||
nt|ady: seems dow not show anything much|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: not today|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting article from Victor Silverstone in last month's Bridge magazine on opening 3NT with strong Major - as opposed to traditional minor as here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 card suit for sure he must be told|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the slam hand (4) n/s in the other room bid only 6@D too but only made 12 tricks -so the rather undistinguished effort here actually gained 1 imp|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: both black suit key card right here for declarer so should make|pg||
nt|ady: couple of useful cards for Gold 10@H   and K@C     can make this|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|georgia19: 4@s+1. there, I'll risk looking stupid again|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: ok today!!!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Certainly generated action|pg||
nt|ady: needs diamond lead      Selaway can be squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: needs to duck an ear;y heart    then A@H   and trump finesse    and run the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: waterlow doesnt look happy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|vugraphzrz: west is unbal with either 5 clubs or 5+diamonds or 3suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold wont fancy the spade finesse but he needs the trick |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think you will make 12 tricks here with the favorable lay out but to get there is anti odds i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: gunnar may not show @DA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should do really - West is still unlimited|pg||
nt|roswolf: He has a pudding distribution|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht finesse being right doesnt help as there are only 3 @h tricks in any case|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|georgia19: never!!!|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which does run the risk of 5-1 hearts, but South may decide that there is nothing else to do |pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer a takeout double with North to this somewhat skethcy 1n overcall at unfave  vul|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: i am sure he will be happier at the end of the play -i expect this to be made|pg||

nt|vugraphzrz: we are a little bit faster than the closed room |pg||
nt|capercliff: i right i seem to remember this system N/S|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|georgia19: the Senior team are rather propping up this League, not carrying much in the luck department anyway|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@d means nothing is that right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 2 suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: here optimism wont be rewarded|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|georgia19: look at this kind @h break if N/S get frisky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@s Natural, 4+ suit, not 4 cards in a FG balanced hand or 5332 FG.|pg||
nt|georgia19: whadda they mean not discussed - does it not just show clubs??|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: 2@C natural, may be 2533|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: she has no idea|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: it should be takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a perfect fit here and 4@h is throw aginst the wall |pg||
nt|lestergold: Tosh of course with this escellent 2 suiter will try for game|pg||
nt|roswolf: for slam i meant!!:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Sandqvist knows his high cards are working now|pg||
nt|ady: if they are in a skam   6@C   much better    but will also fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will bid well to reach a game with 10 count opposite a weak no trumop!|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly an enormous ten count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C may indicate FG 5/5, in which case a high club contract is worth considering|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup maybe i have greater expectations|pg||
nt|ady: only game should be reached|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: hmm now 4@D>|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 4@D-4@H now|pg||
nt|ady: right Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrt: dble = 2 suits|pg||
nt|capercliff: doea the N hand qualify as an opener for everyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Katgh ur first mistake!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: PASS MISSED OUT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well forgive u|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 4@D may show the ace, not necessarily a shortage|pg||
mb|4H|an|5/5 invit|nt|deltadash: not at my house :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: may be effical trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: l find the passes dangerous|pg||
nt|capercliff: mine either:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|vbman: 6 dia might be making|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: 6d is a good contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of those things that is worth discussing - not this auction in particular, but as a generic system agreement |pg||
pc|d2|nt|georgia19: naa, they have screens|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: if EW in 3Nt - decl has to duck the first @D and then play @s10 - and N has to play !K!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: im not sure whey west bid 3s|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: yes, that would be nice defense!|pg||
nt|ady: on a bad day  4@H would go down     so really high enough|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|georgia19: LOOK what you've missed!!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like five trump tricks and that's it - 1100|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Dbl was meant to be clubs|pg||
nt|georgia19: that's OK, N/S can make 6@h - that's more|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Director being called due to Double and 2C bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is nice to see that amidst all the relays and transfers there is still room for a penalty double |pg||
nt|georgia19: but was it the right thing to do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: They're unsure about the double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, no, but that's only because both majors are 3-3  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: XX was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: DIRECTOR AGREEMENT: Hand to be played regardless|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: WELL IF ONLY AN INVITE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE ABRUPT END|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: only needs ht and spade finesse for slam so Roland would bid a slam of course as its better tahn 12.89%|pg||
nt|ady: more than heart finesse    need split as welll in hearts     netter in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: the abrupt end to the auction is becuase Tosh does not want to encourage his pard who doesnt need much to push him skywards|pg||
nt|ady: better|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vbman: needs 2/2 dias|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vbman: on a sp lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: then spade goes away on h if diamonds 31?|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk2: double now|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Dp|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Don't double the first time round ... it will bury the 5-card spade suit|pg||

mb|d|nt|vugraphzrz: a partscore battle that Skeljungur wins|pg||

nt|ady: stillawkward with K@C wrong    will be tapped twice|pg||

nt|roswolf: well it is not that bad a decision|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S certain to make   and 5 certain to go down    e/w have done the best they can   in the bidding   and even 3 down  a good save|pg||

mb|2H|nt|capercliff: can they land in 3@h?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: is that the adjusted score or the contract in the other room?|pg||

nt|ady: e/w|pg||
mb|1H|nt|capercliff: not by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not so much of a leap - more of a hop|pg||
nt|roswolf: a filthy opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: partial     for e/e    1NT  or maybe 2@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: yes the result was very satisfactory|pg||
nt|ady: may reach game in diamonds|pg||
nt|georgia19: getting cocky are they|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well they have a chance now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: these 20-board segments are a real test of stamina|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: selway said well played (the perfect English gentleman)|pg||
nt|capercliff: a @d lead from W beats 5@c in fact|pg||
nt|capercliff: assuming E unblocks a @h honor|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: yes and partnership discipline|pg||
nt|ady: pnly 1 loser on the surface  but any higher than game looks ambitious|pg||
nt|roswolf: not too many obvious tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n cant be bid now|pg||
nt|ady: n/s competing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: On 12 - the 6@S here, the bidding in the Open went 3NT P P! 4@S, P P 5@C P,  P5@S end|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you could play 4@S as a splinter here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may get too high here|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 9@d is a big card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: the CC doesn't give a hcp range for 1@D, 1@H or 1@s openers|pg||
nt|georgia19: why make an unassuming cue, then go on when pard says no - even with a 15 count?|pg||
nt|roswolf: less than 17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10-15|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So 1@D was systemic|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: that would test your agreements and memory!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 off in 3@s not much compensation aganst the top tricks in 3n |pg||
nt|deltadash: for sure Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has naff all defence why does he want to double for business|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzrt: 1D 10-16 with a range of bal and M/m combos|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: diamond lead seems best|pg||
nt|ady: spade lay is very good for Selway|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: trump leads often are|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricky on a trump switch|pg||
nt|ady: low trump lead best      Q@S   nice return|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: yes, looks good with @sAQ10|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|capercliff: i dont understand X|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is going to make even worse for n/s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: specs are saying that a trump lead was automatic - there is a lot of truth in that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East remembers that he is playing 5@d, not 6@d |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: actually, just tricky, period|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec suggestimg that the double was asking for 3N with spade stop not obvious to me i must admit|pg||
nt|ady: better if Selway olays A@C   abd trump|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but difficult to read|pg||
nt|lestergold: Rosen's team is currently leading the premiere leagie de Botton in 3rd place|pg||
nt|ady: leaves declarer with 3 trump tricks  2 clubs  1 heart and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: nobody wants to play trumps|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup but how does he evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is the nt ranfe?|pg||
nt|roswolf: range?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much room between 1NT and 3NT to describe the West hand - may simply treat it as a club single-suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: im surprised that 2@c by est in open room did not netch 2h from north which might have discouraged 3N however 5@c  has a chance off on a trump lead etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: staring hard at his cards, closes, thinks, opens again, stares, scratches head|pg||
nt|ady: no easy decision for west     game in clubs could be on with no play for no-trump     needs stoppers in both majors with some sort of club fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably off in any case time tio play 2 trimps|pg||

nt|eggy: Well he knows from the auction that North's takeout will include a diamond hoolding|pg||
nt|eggy: or N would have doubled the first time|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing would induce me to pass 2@h|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West was in " no double, no trouble mode"|pg||

nt|lestergold: here here geoffrey|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I sympathise - never easy to play your best bridge early on Sunday morning |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: uve hit nail on the head|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: great result for rosen in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: must have not cashed the 2 diamonds in OR  for 4@S to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: don't like xx with that @s suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a 20/20 hand how on earth they stumbled up to 3n in the open?|pg||
nt|capercliff: um 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i misread it only 1N|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: gone are the days when pass of the redouble meant=content to defend the redoubled contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: occurred i  the other room as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: in|pg||
nt|deltadash: 'stumbled' being the operative work Mike :)|pg||
nt|ady: according to the movie  north played A@D  on nothing 2nd round     but once he did not lead or switch to trumps there was no hope for defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: the twins reached another silly contract -hmm i would be very depressed if i was marvin the robot|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: of course not many triocks available|pg||
nt|deltadash: thank goodness :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i did the stumbling dashing delta!|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: lol - you're forgiven, kind sir :)|pg||
nt|ady: this should be passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen should persist once mroe with his minors here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzrt: 1NT  14-16|pg||
nt|roswolf: identical auctions|pg||
nt|georgia19: do they really expect to defend a @s contract? barking|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be the same result here |pg||
pc|d8|nt|ewj: redouble showed @S in the other room|pg||
nt|georgia19: i'll just have to get more up to date|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Best treatment in my opinion is to ignore the double and respond as you would have without a double. So 1@S, natural and forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: but io confess 2 hours sleep in last 36 hours may have something to do wsith it|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps scared of getting into trouble no double no trouble but 6/5 void seems an exception i bid again|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: E "enjoy yourself"|pg||
pc|d9|nt|deltadash: I should think!!!! nap time soon I hope!|pg||
nt|lestergold: anotherv swing a much better spot|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzrz: it seems hf verdbref will pick up 1 imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: F  "sorry"|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a very helpful lead |pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree mike - i'm glad i am out of the rat race now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: I feel pass is best     mis fit    get away before the red card appears|pg||
nt|lestergold: identical acution in open|pg||
nt|mdgraham: SJ Simon said years ago - when you think you have a misfit, stop bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes regrettably|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: partner does not know i am 65 David 3@c isnt game forcing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzrz: ah, i was too fast :-)|pg||
nt|ady: South opened 1C  and wrst overcalled 1@H   so was played by North on heart lead  and diamond went away|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: heart lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 12 imps to rosen|pg||
nt|ady: a little unfortunate for Hackett|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h2|pc|c9|nt|capercliff: would everyone open the E hand or just chuck it?|pg||
nt|deltadash: I welcome all help from the oppenents|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may go 1 off bu still  that would be 5 imps to Teltscher|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't matter if you are in a bad contract - if you bid on you will only reach a worse one  |pg||
pc|sK|nt|georgia19: thanks Ed, nice to know that, whew I'm not totally mad then|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: not here you wont ull reach 3@d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: I open |pg||
nt|capercliff: not much going for the hand really|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 points 6 card major and good mholding on other major ok dont like stiff k@d but cant have eberything|pg||
pc|sT|nt|deltadash: maybe I should have left it at 'opps' if I can't spell :)|pg||
nt|ady: east might even have a weakish hand with 7 hearts    best to leave well alone   west.s suits are not all that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|capercliff: 5 major Mike, Jxxxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is a lot b etter|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: usually partner has a weak hand with 6 @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: as here|pg||
