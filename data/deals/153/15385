nt|eggy: Actually of course I miscounted his tricks so he was always short of tricks - doh!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: I want to be in 6@D if North opens 3@C|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: But 3NT is understandable of course|pg||
nt|eggy: May be difficult now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Small needs to bid 4@D now if they are to get there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then 4@H from King|pg||
nt|eggy: I think he'll do that, but slam may still be hard to visualise|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 6@D is no play!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's cold|pg||
nt|eggy: not on a trump lead perhaps|pg||
nt|mrt2000: correct steve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which Tom will find from that hand?|pg||
nt|eggy: and the DT is perhaps good enough on this layout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He does not have the hand records|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will lead @SK|pg||
nt|mrt2000: anyway, I don't think they'll even get there|pg||
nt|eggy: guarded it prevents 2 ruffs in the West hand|pg||
nt|eggy: but Roland is right - you'd want to be in it|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: still waiting from the other side...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: Gosh - must be a self agreeing Q I think|pg||

mc|11|nt|eggy: He could have made 6 at that point if he ruffed a club and played a double squeeze|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi again Geoff|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  not making  |pg||
nt|deltadash: me 2 - can't say I blame him either|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no because coole's trumps ensure that the losing spadews cant all be ruiffed|pg||
nt|deltadash: what do we know??? lol|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharynr: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: surprisingly disciplined pass from Garvey |pg||
nt|ady: what can Garvey do about 3NT at level vulnerability   has to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Forrester "ridiculous this, sorry"|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c7|nt|vugraphzrz: north has shown 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a complex strong club system with a lot of relay responses|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: expect lots of transfers as well...|pg||
nt|lestergold: David you an i have to pass but Garvey does not al;ways pass when you have to pass!|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do you have the EW names please operator?|pg||
nt|georgia19: Hi, geoff, assume E/W are Nevena Senior and Hallburg|pg||

nt|eggy: and to honest it was pretty marked - but when you are only in 5 - so what|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You are bound to get too high too often if that East hand is an opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aceless balanced 11 count|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eggy: Well the Hacketts wouldn't get too high, because they adapt the responding hand actions better|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you pass 2@S, Steve, when you have a hand like King's?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|eggy: It depends what weak means in my system - If I were Jason - perhaps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|eggy: Normally in this method, East bids as if partner had bid 1S, with 1S a weak NT without 4 spades and 1NT - 18-19|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|h7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|eggy: so East is probably flat |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: That's one way of playing it. Another is to let 1NT still be a weak NT with 2 spades, and let 1@S show 3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|eggy: although of course the twins tend to open 4 card majors with weak hands even if 5-4|pg||

nt|roswolf: fair point david|pg||
nt|mdgraham: stronger men would have wilted..|pg||
nt|roswolf: but playing with brian senior needs perhaps more bravery!:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lyijng badly here for E/W|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|iceking: So first IMP to HF Verðbrféf and off we go:)|pg||
nt|ady: low partial for e/w  in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 1NT 14-16hcp |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|roswolf: straightforward 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   may be made  with a squeeze in diamonds and spades  on south|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 1@C nt nat or bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dont really want toget above two level|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S!|an|relay|nt|roswolf: i believe e/w are playing a natural 5 card major system|pg||
nt|georgia19: hmm, some work to get this one on the card|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: other Senior, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Nevena|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|11-13|nt|ady: 1@H resumably transfer rebid to spades?|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H  relay I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: sorry  already 10 tricks    can made an 11th|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 1@S overcall is yuck and vul too|pg||
nt|lestergold: the problemn with these light openers is when partner has an almost opening bid himself|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4!S|nt|iceking: Normal play here will lead to one down i predict 4 round of clubs-try AK of spades No Q drop and lose to heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south doesnt even have a ggod quality suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzrz: now declarer sees diamonds 5-3.. he migt go for endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: good|pg||
nt|ady: I would expect east to make 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nevena is a fine player and normally her declarer play is superb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 2@D @C @s TO LOSE|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: that is 4x clubs, KA spades, diamond|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like we're done|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: arrived in a good spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 unopposed bids to reach 2@s|pg||
nt|deltadash: makes you tired doesn't it Mike, lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: my son made me tired from the moment he was born|pg||
pc|h4|nt|deltadash: lol - I know THAT feeling :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|iceking: indeed |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzrz: but raggi did well to play small d'|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: things a little easier with heart lead|pg||
nt|deltadash: Today is my eldest child's 50th birthday - THAT makes me tired, lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other scores after the second stanza: Rosen +53 vs Hackett --- Crouch +51 vs Senior --- de Botton +45 vs Hinden |pg||
nt|lestergold: he made me play endless card games with him when he was a toddler especially trumps!|pg||

nt|lestergold: bridge altho he plays poker quite well|pg||
nt|lestergold: its Cook here that is the poker pro|pg||
nt|deltadash: :) nice to know you passed that gene on|pg||

nt|deltadash: re: hi all - small glitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: playing here but lost a couple of tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has a reputation  for immodesty on  a grand scale|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: gold got the @S right|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|eggy: True Roland, but the advantage of 1NT as strong is that you can respond off very marginal hands and also have 2NT available for some strong hands like 18-19 balance with 4 card ...|pg||
nt|eggy: support|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4D!|an|Slightly better than (4H) bid|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|mrt2000: NS might have a sacrifice in 5@C at this vulnerability|pg||

nt|mdgraham: is there an upside to overcalling 1@S on that hand?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: None, imho|pg||
nt|georgia19: nasty contract to play, but unavoidable to be in it|pg||
nt|roswolf: another trappy hand for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: not all of the talk is complimentary bit he is certainly talented and colorful|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: agree  - weak suit, weak hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: yup, another -1 game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difference was that on board 1 declarer's Kx was worth a trick; on board 2 it wasn't|pg||
nt|roswolf: preempting to the limit|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing a weekend tourney with Garvey needs a visit to a rehab afterwards|pg||
nt|ady: part score again     likely in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 11 rule though indicated diamonds were 5-3 so he should gone for endplay maybe but he knows Páll is very tricky could lead from any card from any holdings|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|vugraphzrz: should be rather easy to get to 7s after this start|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: in the closed room south opened a strong club|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: and when north responded 2n, south bid 3c intended as stayman/baron, but north took it as natural|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: possibly hearts|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzrz: as Raggi normally plays very honest carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: he probably got confused by d2 at trick 2|pg||
nt|ady: only possible game   4@S  for n/s|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|ady: 5@D   has 3 losers with bad trump split|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C   can make as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: kept e/w quiet anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrt: waterloe "hope im not too good"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with four-card support, it's pushing the boundaries to raise to 3@H as West, particularly with three small spades |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i think south took the correct view on this hand|pg||
nt|ady: might make on a club lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: the club barrage has made it awkward for Fiorrester|pg||
nt|deltadash: that was helpful for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: couldnot bid only 3@h as danger of missing game|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump lead gives gold a chance now to make|pg||
nt|ady: could go wrong in trump suit if Garvey plays 9 quickly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|georgia19: well I hadn't expected Crouch to do that - and he's got away with it undoubled - not that it matters|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: he did play quickly! but not the 9!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|iceking: 2D- Multi dbl-13-16 hcp most shapes or any 17plus |pg||
nt|lestergold: so you push then into  a bad game then feel sick as it rolls in|pg||
nt|deltadash: he's home free now, @d shift too late|pg||
nt|ady: really needed diamond lead to beat this for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally io expected a @d to hit the table |pg||
nt|ady: could not shift any quicker    needed opening lead|pg||
nt|deltadash: me too Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like the natural lead to me|pg||
nt|ady: dont think trump from JXX is natural   with no holding in spades   |pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean a @d lead david not the silly trump|pg||
nt|ady: ok    sorry|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW will be happy with what they get - they will observe 4@H goes down|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzrz: he will check if spades 40 ... if not, then he will claim|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: yes he might well say that and perhaps vul he would have gone for it|pg||
nt|georgia19: he saved E/W from bidding a failing game:)|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ady: not unreasable to play partial   5@C  needs some luck|pg||

nt|iceking: when you play range asking stayman 2sp here shows 10-11hcp 4sp|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: their version is a little different... 2s is 13-15 wth 4s|pg||
nt|iceking: yes 2d all min|pg||

nt|iceking: correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: first guess not needed!|pg||
nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: assume 1NT forcing   so West may have to show a 3 card suit 2nd time with 5-5--3-2|pg||

nt|georgia19: 5@d a safer spot for sure|pg||

nt|roswolf: or even north|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north gets the slam scent|pg||
nt|ady: n/s limit is 10 tricks on a diamond lead   so n/s have to be careful not to go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after 1M-2N (raise), can use double as a minor plus the other major - here 3@H pre-empts diamonds, if that is your fit|pg||
nt|georgia19: keyboarditis again|pg||
nt|ady: might make 9 tricks in hearts    seems only 8 in spades|pg||
nt|ady: 3 level might be too high|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: this will make 11tricks 450 so SW evened this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: but n/s are uber aggressive|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|georgia19: another -1?|pg||

pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell have a good agreement in these auctions - pass forces double, double indicates uncertainty and a bid says I think we can make this|pg||

nt|lestergold: he legendary for his ability to always win two way finessses|pg||
nt|lestergold: once they placed a missing q in both hands and after a wgile Belladonna announced this is impossibel both of you hold the missing Q!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iceking: north with AQ of spades might have XX to get a spade lead|pg||
nt|georgia19: why Rolamd? am I being thick here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Read above|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's like the song the West Ham fans sing - we're going down, we're going down, (etc)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He can easily have the ace, but sometimes he would lead a club if he had the queen, never from the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's an inference|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: Cooke may spend a while in the tank he knows that Gold is quite capable of bidding the socks off a ten count|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Other scores after the second stanza: Rosen +53 vs Hackett --- Crouch +51 vs Senior --- de Botton +45 vs Hinden |pg||
nt|mrt2000: at least 2 non-optimal decisions so far|pg||
nt|eggy: However - facing a passed hand Tom is not sure if he wants to stand it|pg||

nt|mrt2000: must pass with his @C viod, surely?|pg||

mb|2D|nt|pelu: not so easy to dedeat 5@C :) - after @S to @C4 and @CJ to A - then @S to ruff-discarf will set up a @C-trick for defense :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey happy to play in 1@h rewound opposite an opening bid would expect to scramble 7 tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: must have not cashed the 2 diamonds in OR  for 4@S to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: don't like xx with that @s suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a 20/20 hand how on earth they stumbled up to 3n in the open?|pg||
nt|capercliff: um 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i misread it only 1N|pg||
mb|1S!|an|0-4!S|nt|mdgraham: gone are the days when pass of the redouble meant=content to defend the redoubled contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: occurred i  the other room as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: in|pg||
nt|deltadash: 'stumbled' being the operative work Mike :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: of course not many triocks available|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzrt: 1NT  14-16|pg||
nt|roswolf: identical auctions|pg||
nt|georgia19: do they really expect to defend a @s contract? barking|pg||
mb|p|nt|ewj: redouble showed @S in the other room|pg||
nt|georgia19: i'll just have to get more up to date|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Best treatment in my opinion is to ignore the double and respond as you would have without a double. So 1@S, natural and forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: but io confess 2 hours sleep in last 36 hours may have something to do wsith it|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: I should think!!!! nap time soon I hope!|pg||
nt|lestergold: anotherv swing a much better spot|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: heart lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: looks like 12 imps to rosen|pg||
nt|ady: a little unfortunate for Hackett|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|capercliff: would everyone open the E hand or just chuck it?|pg||
nt|deltadash: I welcome all help from the oppenents|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may go 1 off bu still  that would be 5 imps to Teltscher|pg||
