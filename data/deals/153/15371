nt|ady: lead change   asit might regularly in such a close match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here we go|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Sabine :) i think, instead, will be a great match (also if after dinner) :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: quiet partial to start|pg||
nt|kit: South has strength for 1NT overcall, but with that flat hand there is danger of going for a number if West has the balance of strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 was a 7-IMP swing to Allegra as we see on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|ady: 20-20 again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but this time E really DOES have an opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final the score is  Angelini 144 - 83 Varese|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|kit: Still, if he passes he will just be guessing later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C apparently for majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@C no doubt promises both majors|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  some sort of stayman?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: east has a better opening than north had last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: all cards favourable for EW on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: soouth has found best lead giving bowt away|pg||
nt|ady: best lead     nothing given|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: happy 3NT for NS - will Fantoni-Nunes bid it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morning Jon|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is usually right against this auction|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Angelini has three Norwegians in the team, Helness, Helgemo and Brogeland .... but no longer Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|jcmax: There are two common treatments really when partner has opened 1 of a minor and the opponents overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: no half measures with north|pg||
nt|kit: 3NTjust plain an overbid -- I don't see any reason for it unless more expected from 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|jcmax: 1) always 2 of the same minor shows both majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K9x in @H and K1065 in majors are good cards after the INFORMATION - typical by Bocchi to understand the situation at the table|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks made in OR  playing in one|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2) always 2 of the other minor shows both majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: and 3) always 2 @C shows both majors .)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easier to remember|pg||
nt|kit: I wonger why West led 9 -- seems like might waste an important spot with little upside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you would have if RHO had opened 1NT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: shall we guess on -300?|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer does have some real chances here, and he knows pretty much where all the cards are from the bidding which is helpful|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: will try for J@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without the overcall at 2@C probably pass by North|pg||
nt|ady: double part score swing to Allegra hand 1  so if they make this  will be off to a great start|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Madala, knowing A in @S in West can play seeing all honors|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmmm, it seems to me that would be a big discrepancy. Pass or 3NT. surely there is also something in between.|pg||
nt|kit: Best for declarer now is probably to lead diamond to jack, then queen of clubs from hand -- if East takes it, declarer has dummy entry for black winners|pg||
nt|ady: was 1@D    1NT passed out in OR|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|deltadash: sounds right to me :)|pg||
nt|kit: There might not be something in between after the 2@C bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: didnt|pg||
nt|ady: tht would finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who say you should double a 2NT opener if it goes pass-pass|pg||
nt|ady: passive diamond looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all say that but no-one does|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa wants to retaion all his endplay options here hoping that defenders will be forced to give him his 8th trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: south best tho to continue as he started |pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, it's easy to be brave on paper|pg||
nt|ady: may well be   if he cashes all diamonds and then Q@S and 10@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: best for east to conceal his hand very difficult for defenders this way|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can see that anything bit a diamond now is fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or at least -200|pg||
nt|kit: so far so good -- now queen of clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcmax: I was referring to if W had passed 1NT. surely most top pairs have a method then to express a hand that cannot force to game, but may be interested.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|ady: 8@H ?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he would have been better "cashing" queen of clubs before squandering this exit|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like East has to pitch a club here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: well -2 i think is more likely|pg||
nt|kit: yes, 8@H does look like the right play -- surrounding the 7.  Veru unusual card combination|pg||
nt|jcmax: W is in a very awkward position now. Not an easy switch. Everything helps declarer except one card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If anyone can, Helgi can|pg||
nt|jcmax: But Helgemo has incredible imagination at the bridge table. he sees positions, nobody else has even heard of before!|pg||
nt|kit: He should have a pretty good idea about the distribution from East's discards and the line of play|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: needs to play king|pg||
nt|jcmax: With the @H J he has chosen to play on the psychological chance of declarer misguessing the @H-layout.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But does he know who has the 10?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He doesn't|pg||
nt|kit: he certainly will find that -- and from long thought about shift, he will deduce where 10 of hearts is|pg||
nt|ady: no    easier seeing all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great hand|pg||
nt|kit: it sure is|pg||
nt|jcmax: There is a good chance that declarer will guess W doesn't have the @H10.  with the @H10 the switch would have come faster.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree with Sabine|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with J10 in @H the return would be faster|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays king  east  return a low diamond?|pg||
nt|kit: the point about the speed of the shift is a good one.  Even at the highest levels, inferences can be drawn from more than just the cards played.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Also with the the JT w might have switched to the 10 instead. or alternatively after the long pause to a low one!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So when you have J10 you should tank before leading the jack when you see the 9 in dummy?|pg||
nt|kit: not for deceptive purposes -- that would be against the rules|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer draws his own inferences at his own risk -- but here he might well get it right|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|jbgood: not many tricks for the defense - missed game?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: Also, simply on restricted choice -- from J10 might have led either|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: Semneta hasa  legendary reputation for his card play|pg||
nt|kit: now the expected duck of queen of clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: not an auspicious start for the trailing team|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|blum1956: Normally they play Lebensohl in that position/ I wonder whether 3@c from Nunes was positive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we are about the last one in France NOT to open 1 nt with 5 cardsmajors:)|pg||
nt|ady: can end play south for 9th trick|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Sementa a happy man now although he can still endplay South for the overtrick|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it's without cost|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: had sementa taken the club and played another club north in would beat contract with heart thru|pg||
nt|Walddk2: jack!|pg||
nt|deltadash: maybe a little bit of nervousness to start |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did not do anything silly|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: I love this hand, it made my evening|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: hence the problem for a double of 2NT passed |pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: And it is the defense which comes out on top (low diamond now, of course).  Would it have made if declarer had played king of hearts?  I haven't worked it out.|pg||
nt|ady: think still would have been down 1  even playing K@H first time|pg||

nt|blum1956: 24|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Giusy?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the NT range, Giusy?|pg||
nt|jcmax: I think it would have made. e would have had no good return|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, how do you want Helness to defend from there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks likely for n/s to play 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D multi - possible weaker that 2@H or 2@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: I was referring to ady's comment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree with Sabine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this looks a routine 3nt|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: still very difficult after opps open 1 NT |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H how?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades, 5 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|kit: That was my conclusion also -- that would have made after king of hearts play|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe an upgraded 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Safe to win and take a @s finess|pg||
nt|ady: return low diamond   then duck Q@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @c for majors  NS make 3 @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile this looks like a coffee brek hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: all roads lead to at least 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: certainly not likkely to produce the excitement of the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: dbl by Failla can bid a very strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: Funny how often low from KQ9xx is right rather than a top one|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcmax: Could the light opening be a consequence of what happened on the previous board?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you will be endplayed a second later|pg||
nt|kit: right Roland|pg||
nt|ady: what does declarer do?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Kit|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: even with that favourable lead E may find it hard to come to nine|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S is in my view misguided. hoping to stay low is false economy, because bidding spades may be the MOST likely way to get N excited|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: overboard   2 off|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: with 3@H give a hand very strong|pg||
nt|kit: or does dummy get squeezed at a critical juncture?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|blum1956: looks like8 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may be a realy bid in this sequence|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S means a very weak hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent to land on feet after 2S|pg||
nt|kit: very complicated|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is correct, counting over 5@C|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d from W hand had a chance unlike 5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: relay :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: another good board for 4th highest of longest and strongest|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: agree Geoffrey - a small @h|pg||
nt|ady: I dont think it makes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: Best chance is to first play on @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: Why did Duboin not overcalled 1@d? It could be useful sometimes|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: make 3Nt also with Qxxx xxx Jxx xxx at the partner|pg||
nt|jcmax: thinking is not knowing :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: no reason to pick the heart push thus|pg||
nt|kit: Now whichever hand gets forced, declarer can arrange the entries to draw trumps from the other hand and then run the hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: cant cost to play a club to start with and tghen see what happens|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes, that is what I ment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If E had one more D and one less round card, 6C would be on after normal defense|pg||
nt|deltadash: wonder how many years that has been 'the lead'?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next time declarer has AJ opposite 10x and everyone asks: why did he not lead a top heart?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|blum1956: now the diamond discard looked safe|pg||
nt|kit: Might have been right to just bid 3NT after partner bids 2@S, with 8 top tricks, 4-4 spade fit might be worse anyway|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one down surely|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, will always be West hand forced|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: Yes - bad luck.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, though at that point N had hardly showed a great hand so 2S didnt need to be a dreadful hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h by Failla take the chance to find the slam in @C, so i agree with that bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse strikes who cares|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very little between finessing and going for the drop. 52-48 for the drop, a priori|pg||
nt|roswolf: now if a low heart is found against 3nt in the other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: just a part score  n/s|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: easy 4 @s ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did we make a simulation? What works best in the long run from KQxxx and KQxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normal result, the 4-1 trump break dooms 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Matter of style whether or not to overcall on North hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: 3 NT here looks more promising|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not seeing many likely continuations after 3H that would lead to 6C|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be balanced hand|pg||
nt|kit: South has difficult problem, with no suit to Q-bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C natural (normal in Italy against 1@C with only 2@c)|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps it is right to play that a bid of the other minor is a Q here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes and for 9 tricks you have to take the correct finess|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S doomed |pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: a much easier 3n here for E/W|pg||
nt|ady: might get too high|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: just playing it as forcing is likely to be good enough, no?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is a good bid - North could have 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: and here a shooting e/w might try a slam|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like that's the path we're on|pg||
nt|pfbr: .|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- bad fit in the clubs couples with 4-1 spade split|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: last board 2@c showed both majors - does really 2 @d show even more major cards?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: well, partner needs to know if it shows diamonds or not|pg||
nt|ady: unless defence slips  3NT has 5 tricks of the top|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 1Nt raise with a top honor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They proceed as if Helness had bid 1@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: 2@D is forcing one round|pg||
nt|lestergold: players normally play for the drop if there is no other indicator|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: giving the stop for 3Nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah i see, you mean doing it even with shorter diamonds. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but North nothing in @S ...|pg||
nt|kit: they have pinpointed the spade weakness, so will likely stop in time at 4@C|pg||
nt|tokay1975: antonio has very good cards  against 64 in majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: exactly Marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: like a support double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which in effect he did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: perfect defence against 2H could be quite bloody|pg||
nt|jcmax: !NT could also have been a transfer to @C|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Treatment even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The one you are comfortable with I suppose|pg||
nt|jcmax: Treatment for what, roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will probably win and play club at trick 2, setting up source of tricks first is usually best technique.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Good 3@S bid -- if partner has 3 small spades, that might be enough|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is a risk - ask half stop to bid Nt|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead against 4@s gives some chances to the defense|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d on 1@c opening  2@c was after one NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer must be careful|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: as kind kiubs tell me: 2 @c shows 5-4 and 2@d 5-5|pg||
nt|ady: a lucky lay and n/s can make 4@H    but not  in the bidding in both rooms|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think South will think Jx is enough|pg||
nt|ady: might lead a heart     but will have time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: *kibs|pg||
nt|ady: can get 1 heart discarded from dummy   but still too much to do|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: would need A in @D in South - with this layout E/W make 5 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for Qxx of spades upstairs...but even then likely to need 44 spades in EW hands|pg||
nt|kit: Heart lead wrong only if North has 7 clubs -- but that is quite possible|pg||
nt|blum1956: It proved easy enough to stop the opps from making a vulnerable game |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a push |pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: on the previous hand if a low heart is led Declarer playing the ACE does block the suit but declarers have been known to do the wrong thing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blum1956: In both rooms|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: If North had Qxx in spades, North would have bid 3NT -- that is why I don't like South's 3NT call|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|tokay1975: no room to ask for  queen of trumps|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|tokay1975: i am not sure if 4cl was somekind of turbo  asking aces |pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: West can afford to pitch 2 diamonds, 1 heart, 1 spade.  East must keep all of his spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might not have bid 3S with Qxx of spades and KQJxxx of clubs (and D ace instead)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you like 1NT to be? 1. Extra values - 2. Support for hearts - 3. Clubs    take your pick your favourite partner. As long as you have an agreement all is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double of 1NT that is|pg||
nt|kit: declarer simply playing for 3-2 spade split and 4-3 heart split (so no overruff on third round of hearts)|pg||
nt|ady: yes   home now if spades behave|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i meant, he might not have bid 3N, sorry|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|kit: This should be easy defense -- they know declarer starts with 8 top tricks, so the necessary assumptions are easy.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: but of course i agree about the 3N call being ill-judged|pg||
nt|kit: Also, declarer shouldn't have king of spades -- with that, would have bid 3NT, not 3@H.|pg||
nt|blum1956: Certainly it is dangerous to double the 1@s opening with Failla's hand, but to pass is also dangerous sometimes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think W never can make with 4-1 in @h|pg||

pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: 2S now by E ?|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is quite possible. I still believe many players would consider bidding more than 3@S. so just bidding 2@S seems good judgment to me.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Subtract some for KQ doubleton|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Hard to see West doing anything here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding Qx of hearts makes a 2-level preempt a bit more attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: very safe level!!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Gerben42: 2@C was gazilli so 3@D showed 18+ with @H and @D|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @c was aither natural or 17+|pg||
nt|blum1956: Besides the EW's 10-card fitthe double of 2@c worked better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As a spectator says, you can make 5, but it is unlikely to happen|pg||

nt|lestergold: this takes out K@c entry to the second spade trick amongst other things|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Where is the 15th?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not how I learned to count them|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You don't look at all 4 hands, do you Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i look out of the window like i did at school and got whacked all the time |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: last making spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3NT from S makes probably as East is squeezed for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probability about it 3 rounds of heart a spade swirch then east has to find 4 discards on the clubs and is mullered|pg||
nt|blum1956: But that was not clear for Nunes in the course of bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT might have made on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he can come to 9 tricks in time?|pg||
nt|jcmax: At this vulnerability some players might fancy a 3@H bid with the N hand over 2NT, just for the lead. But that would also depend on whether 2NT was GF or just inv+. it's more ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: dangerous to bid when it is invitaional+.|pg||
nt|kit: I am told that 3@D is natural, 3NT is not -- just shows no single suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: North needs a way to show a diamond suit, and South needs a way to find out how good they are  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Kit, i think 2Nt raise without singleton|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Very well thought out choice IMO|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||

nt|blum1956: 6@c looked better than 6@s|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|othered1: suggested 2N was a control-showing response, but that seems odd due to potential positioning on a flatish hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, 2@C-3@c (+ve in @d)-3@D (how good)- some step response to show all three top honours|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: so 11 out, and deservedly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course there are tose who would say that a grand which depends on a 3/2 break should not be bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the results merchants and in thiscase teammates wont be happy|pg||
nt|blum1956: It does not - only 4 diamonds with East |pg||

nt|bridge_one: in my system i use 2@H/@S by North to give 5cards with maximum 3 hcp|pg||
nt|blum1956: there is a choice - normally it is better to play 1NT then to defend it. But this vulnerability may be exclusive so Fantoni passed. EW prefere to defend 1@s|pg||

nt|kit: I like the third seat 4@H opening.  There doesn't figure to be a slam, 4@H is probably the right contract, and it puts pressure on opponents|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall with doubleton in @S|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, 4th seat -- but same principles|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have a good save in 5@D   but could hardly enter at that level|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with W. Dbl for me on 2@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: very interesting...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do know now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will attackclubs first I think|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT down on a club lead|pg||

nt|blum1956: Well, not 15 top tricks as on the previous board but 9 I can count|pg||
nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|ady: yes    sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: irony here is 3n is a lot better a contract than 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: but you cannot accuse anyone of mis bidding here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: 6@h looks easy with 2-2 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North could not afford to duck that diamond, Ralf. Then declarer can abandon the suit and turn his attention to clubs while he is keeping North off lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very interesting|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|blum1956: looks close|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is too good to give up on defending so double of 2@c seems right|pg||
nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: better spades and a weaker hand for the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|othered1: kOn long run expectations, yes, but 2@H needs to be very unlucky to go minus|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: I guess club finesse now, then spade to jack|pg||
nt|ady: now club to the 10 ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|deltadash: this one is a pretty cut and dried 6H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcmax: It may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it does have huge psychological advantages. The opponents never quite know what to expect. it could be anything.|pg||

pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: So winning the jack was correct, but ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5@C  1 or 4|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|blum1956: What system do Sementa-Duboin play? If the 1@h opening is restricted to 15-16 HCP then 2NT was a better rebid. Otherwise it looks not easy to reach 3NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And you have not missed a slam opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He does not have  A A K|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: playing spades first|pg||
nt|kit: this order doesn't feel right to me, but it works okay|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 9 hcp enough for game nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When do the invite, if ever?|pg||

nt|jcmax: I was just about to say the same thing, Kit :)|pg||
nt|kit: great minds think alike (sometimes)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and also some impossible ones as well|pg||
nt|jcmax: An awkward hand to open if one doesn't play a strong club system|pg||

nt|kit: there is a grand, but they will be doing well to get to a small|pg||
nt|ady: I think possibly 6@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: Standard practice is to just open 1@C anyway. Most times one gets another chance. sometimes partner has Qxxxx in spades and out and the bidding stops in 1@C|pg||
nt|kit: particularly since there will be plenty of enemy interference|pg||
mb|3C|an|5!c + 5!s|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: inevitably|pg||
nt|othered1: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|blum1956: Another test. this time for NS. Will they reach 4@h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its abit like criminal justice- if you are going to make sure you convict allk theguilty ones you will have to convict a few innocent iones|pg||
nt|othered1: south will move over any type of support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent hand for a Bergen raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 5cM|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess there has to be one that's decent|pg||
nt|lestergold: or the converse if you want to make sure you dont convict an innocent one you release many of the guilty ones|pg||
nt|kit: wonder what 3@C shows?|pg||
nt|kit: I am told it shows black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 5+@C / 5+other|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is hard to imagine S would really bypass the @S-suit with his hand. so 2-suiter makes a lot of sense.|pg||
nt|kit: If so, they will easily get to some slam|pg||
nt|jcmax: yes, it would indeed be a scoop for the system!|pg||
nt|kit: but finding the grand looks impossible to me -- but you never know -- maybe 5@D by North, 5@H by South?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if north bid 5@D i bet they find grand slam in @C|pg||
nt|ady: as long as if they bid a grand it is in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: they will certainly bid it in clubs if South has shown black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Definitely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bocchi knows that 7@S can only be right if they have 13 top tricks|pg||
mb|6C|nt|marlowepi: 2H or 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrr: the contract is 3nt by north ..bidding differnt as cards were picked in wrong axis|pg||
nt|ady: made 12 tricks in hearts OR     |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: the absolutely maximal hand with Fantoni|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT by Sementa  pinpointing distribution for South|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfave vul that is a brave one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bocchi count 12 tricks because can't imagine 6 @S in South|pg||
nt|kit: Leaping to slam without some kind of investigation is almost always wrong IMO, and this hand is no exception|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he was going to slam anyway, why not 5@D en route one could ask|pg||
nt|jcmax: I doubt Bocchi was seriously considering a grand slam. If his partner's distribution were 5521, then small slam would be on the @D finesse, which would rate to be offside on the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: bidding.|pg||
nt|kit: exactly Roland.  6@C won't run away from him.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the void in @H could exist but isn't sufficient - need also K in @D Q in @s without 6 cards in @S|pg||
nt|kit: but why couldn't partner have stiff diamond and Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|kit: the point is that it can't hurt to try|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that sounds all very well. But then when he gets 5@H over 5@D how does he know his partner has 6@S and 5@C and not vice versa? 6@C is a very practical bid.|pg||
nt|kit: If he bids 5@D and follows with 6@C over 5@H, his partner will know there was grand interest since 5@D forced to 6@C if clubs trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: 2@S might survive anyway -- not sure|pg||

nt|jcmax: True Kit. But how does s then Know tha his holding of QJTxxx,-, xx Qxxxx makes a grand. Whereas QJTxxx,-, xx Qxxxxx wouldn't make a slam?|pg||
nt|kit: He couldn't.  But if South held QJ10xx, A, Kx, Qxxxx I'll bet he would know.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ady: unlucky 4@H for e/w  if 2 spades are casshed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: the heart lead might not prove that safe. for example, dummy might have Q9x|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I cannot see any position to have a problem  to play Queen of @h  and South gave the count|pg||
nt|jcmax: I doubt that would be a 3@C bid in their methods.|pg||
nt|ady: its easy from here   but north cannot know of the 6th spade in south hand  with only 10 black cards  even with void heart  or even ace  what about possible diamond loser|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: looks like a strong NT to me|pg||
nt|othered1: EW in the other room have gone for some substantial, undoubled numbers.|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl showing a max?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think they would have gotten there on the actual hand -- all I'm saying is that there is nothing to lose by trying.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D xfert |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: with trumps 4-1 very sticky|pg||
nt|ady: seems went down 4 OR|pg||
nt|jcmax: You see I am going to play with Norberto in a few weeks. I have to defend his actions. :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: true Sabine :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: i think this will go off in practice|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10-13 and unbalanced, 5+ spades for Nunes opening|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teach him something, Sabine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Less expensive than 5@h (-990 instead of -1100)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they will get to 4@h here too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|blum1956: only a trump lead and a heart return guarantee the success of the defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: if Nunes disards dims on this which seems natural when east gets in with spade ace its heart heart ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think S will make now. Discard 2 @h and play 3 rounds oof @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: belay that....|pg||
nt|othered1: east might get fatally tapped on continued @S plays for extra undertricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West may be tempted by 5@d now - may think singleton spade with East |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like Villa are starting to fall behind a bit |pg||
nt|othered1: Is that pass forcing?  I don't think it should be.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Duboin cannot bid any more he may doubl;e of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like they did against Newcastle a few weeks ago?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: max and maj|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: difficult decision for west|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: better line|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: this results could be well duplicated in open room|pg||
nt|kit: Opening lead could be key here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: yes and this couold be 500 and a hefty 14 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: But, not surprisingly, west solves it correctly|pg||
nt|ady: nice result for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think south has a 2@H anyway|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes dbl  is to  with max |pg||
nt|kit: And that was the loser|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: not much for the crowd here...let's open the Cinzano or Primitivo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Impossible a swing with this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be these world class operators wont get this defence wrong|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: declarer can take quick spadepitch|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: actually even my dog would probabbly get it right |pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s may well be a make from Duboin's point of view - for example one trick in each side suit and that's all. Therefore to double that was  not an easy decision|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to show where his values lay|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt made in  board 9 againsta  bad defence|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzrr: bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now Nunes may just discard hearts and play diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: cash 4 in right oprder and ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: south might well have unblocked the @DK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: Failla hoping .... against hope|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: might only make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not impossible a priori -- 6N makes without heart lead|pg||
nt|kit: But still uppercut danger|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|othered1: But west has a pretty good record of making winning decisions|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with the ruff in @S he must play @C - obliged|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: A @s switch now will defeat!|pg||
nt|kit: however, then ace of diamond, diamond ruff, heart to king, low heart|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: may still be a trump promotion  |pg||
nt|kit: and this is not double-dummy -- he has full count of hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need try A in @H in west|pg||
nt|ady: should play 4th club after ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Another possibility is to play fourth round of clubs now|pg||
nt|kit: I guess simplest is to play heart now, then ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Duboin led a club in the other room after Fantoni opened 1NT (12-14) and Nunes responded 3@C (5-card Stayman ask)|pg||
nt|kit: Going back toopening lead, West had clue that his partner didn't double the artificial 2@D call, so maybe he should have avoided diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fairness, would anyone double with just @DQ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also small @H now - if A np, else A@D @D ruff and @H again - no way to beat with KQ@H in the dummy|pg||
nt|kit: no, but with QJxx(x) they would|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: not withn Duboing and nthen smell of blood in his nostrils|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW A SORT OF DEFENSIVE CROSSRUFF|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry to shout|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: well nunes has found the a trump switch by west at that point would have defeated surely|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and also the finesse in @s - so a dream ...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: since otherwise largely a guess between diamond and spade lead, perhaps the failure to double 2@D should tip the scales|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: that  is a dangerous opponent its fair to say |pg||
nt|roswolf: not a good card|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: too late now|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps   leaders pulling away|pg||
pc|d8|nt|deltadash: wrong club :(|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Nunes did well to discard hearats rather than dims|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|blum1956: The  trump switch did not defeat as Nunes could set uo a heart trick|pg||

nt|ady: would you double 2@D with just the queen?|pg||
nt|caruga: invece Agus ha fatto 4 cuori in quella di prima|pg||
nt|jcmax: should E have considered bidding 2@S to make sure he would get the lead?|pg||
nt|kit: no, but with stronger holdings I would double 2@D|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: also here a easy game for N/S |pg||
nt|marlowepi: either game will make here|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks seems odd|pg||

nt|blum1956: Bye|pg||
nt|lestergold: keep the jokes rolling Michael |pg||
nt|blum1956: sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Dbl of 5@H in OR kept them out of the good six.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW seem to have missed their cold slam next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H 11 tricks, next case|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S doesn't get a spade lead necessarily -- support and honor holdings are two different things.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: a game try of 41H seems appropriate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S to give the lead is possible in MP, in IMP can be dangerous - i think better to use a convention, like dbl to give the lead @S (and not for @D)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: But NS have a good save in 7m (esp @D)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: heart lead, spade knocked out, another low heart, then W squeezed late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D would show spades|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 6@H doubled with overtrick may gain points|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out that EW in OR had kept themselves out of slam, then were doubled|pg||
nt|blum1956: Will Sementa figure out that his partner has just one side card, not two&|pg||
nt|othered1: In an auction with both sides bidding up with double fits, just buying the contract may be enough to win the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting here that North has stayed out of this auction. |pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR the double NS fit was known.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Perhaps he has no descriptive action - not that anything seems particularly obvious |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Where is that button?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes   correct|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S running diamonds before spades so as to end in dummy|pg||
nt|blum1956: will Nunes remove this?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that's really an interesting point. When it looks like your opponents are going to outbid I don't think it makes much sense to support partner just for the sake of supporting ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: him. I prefer when it conveys a message. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: Fantoni warned off from further action with his decent hand|pg||
nt|ady: 1st round west overcalled 1@H in OR   north doubled   |pg||
nt|othered1: What was 2N?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2 keycards and a void - they should have a special bid for that case|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some kind of relay you would think|pg||
nt|othered1: I doubt 2N was natural. Other than that I've had suggestions of various hands, from cue-bid to, asks other suit, to shows @H fit.  Maybe 2@D means something other than simple ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Michaels?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2 key cards and a void could still have 2 minor losers of course|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|blum1956: Is the 1@h 3rd in hand also strong by their system?|pg||
nt|ady: cashes the diamonds before completing the spades |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: another  4@s made  |pg||
nt|othered1: It's suggested they play Ghestem and that 2@D is specific to majors.|pg||
nt|deltadash: who's got the button???? lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's state that the blind lead is difficult. Or as Jan Wohlin, Swedish top player and author wrote in one of his books: "Don't ever lead, it's too difficult!"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lebridgeur: good sacrifice in @h|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: I'm surprised that, holding KQx hearts and 4-3-3-3 that North bothered looking for 4-4 spade fit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbgood: no - but may be|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: both   ruff @d :):)|pg||
nt|blum1956: It was a difficult task for Nunes. His hand is worst possible from the defensive point of view but he knows few about partner's hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one spec  points that 4 @s  goes down on the " obvious" @s lead he is right on principle|pg||
nt|blum1956: But in this vulnerability he probably loses only 200 if 5@h proves to be wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 2@D is majors|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: yes one way or another should have been able to bid 3N with finality, |pg||
nt|kit: Seems to me much more likely that both contracts will take 9 tricks than that 10 in spades and only 8 in notrump.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: I think there is almost no such thing as a truly "blind" lead -- there are always some clues|pg||
nt|jcmax: Andy robson once told me that all his partner's were brilliant opening leaders. Now you maybe can work out why :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: isn´t there a small danger to have a 4-card major as side suit?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: South was fortunate to get heart lead if he was going to misguess clubs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: 5@H doubled  then losing points|pg||
nt|blum1956: If 4NT is RKCB then it was enough to show 2 keycards with @hQ (which Duboin surely has)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lebridgeur: nt so sure  South was right to pass  with  KQJ  in @h opposite a 6 or 7 cards suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: these high level desicions are impossible to get right all the time|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|blum1956: Could the small heart and the trump switch help ?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: no squeeze now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: if E holds his giant hearts|pg||
nt|ady: got heart lead in OR   also miss guessed the club|pg||
nt|kit: West afraid declarermight be sneaking a diamond through from KQJ, and tht his partner has natural trump trick|pg||
nt|kit: He is trying to see if ducking the diamond and letting partner lead a club can do any good|pg||
nt|jcmax: Guys, my son has 5 friends visiting who just decided they want to stay overnight. I need to get some order in the chaos. sorry about that. I hope you all enjoy the rest of the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: show. good night all!|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will conclude that it won't be of value -- if declarer has only 3 spades the contract won't be making anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good night Sabine and thanks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hope you've got a big garden|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is the last segment today. Four more tomorrow and the last set Sunday morning local time|pg||

nt|bridge_one: may operator is sleeping ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|kit: surprising to see him having this much difficulty -- the logic appear straightforward.  If declarer has 3 spades and not solid diamonds, the contract isn't making, so might as well ...|pg||
nt|kit: go up ace.  Unless I'm missing something.|pg||
nt|kit: Can anybody find a layout where ducking can gain (from West's point of view)?|pg||

nt|kit: yes, 3NT it surely will be regardless of methods, unless somebody has an accident|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: 3@S sign off opposite an invite|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s miss their fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C is a transfer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South can try a DBL here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: made :)|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S a totally unnecessary overbid IMO -- opponents have already exchanged information, so what is the point?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: then 5 @h is too optimistic|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: overstatement by west   probably tht 4@H making  so made advanced sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Did Garbosi forget their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am told 2 @h is two way  weak support in @s or stong with @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only 10imps difference with 36 boards to go   but this one could be bad for Garbosi|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the 4@s bid should of course imply the weak spade support hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead beats 5@s, other leads probably do not|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like that weak nt is back|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: transfer seems like it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: let us see |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1500 kibs watching this match here on BBO - quite a crowd!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @d attracting  on the bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: If North leads a heart the declarer wins and plays on diamonds. If the defense plays trumps twice the diamond suit works otherwise two hearts may be ruffed|pg||
nt|othered1: over 3@C, south's hand does look defensive and there's nothing certain about any offensive action|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means support in @H limit or + - i agree 4@S can be too much|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should just bid 3@S -- his partner will have better idea whether or not 4@H is making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: And opponents haven't bid to 4@H yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: !|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: if S has "Limit + " chances of 4S goading N into 5H are greatly reduced|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well done    no declarer task very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead triumph|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @s and @c  should easier now|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might have been a little more enterprising -he might have doubled 2nt to show values in the minors - but he no doubt is deflated by the poor run of boards|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer doesn't have 9 top tricks here.  |pg||
nt|kit: I think he goes up ace of hearts and attacks clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tempting to let it ride but they lead 3rd from any holding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@H and @C|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: asking for 5crd majors, or a possible 4441|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even the trump is OK |pg||
nt|ady: should make this for a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He was tempted|pg||
nt|kit: Why did he finesse?  Now if queen of diamonds is off, diamond shift defeats him.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: ouch wasnt the low heart a clear signal for a club?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: 3@S is then a transfer to 3NT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this may work as well but i like to show partnership solidarity|pg||
nt|bridge_one: have the chance to make the @H trick - else can make 9 tricks finding one trick in @D or @s|pg||
nt|kit: the heart finesse winning doesn't help him particularly, but it can hurt when it loses|pg||
nt|ady: agreed    top heart and club is safe|pg||
nt|kit: I can't think of any layout where taking heart finesse at trick 1 is superior|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however agree to play A in @H at first trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But can't you be short of entries for the clubs if you win @HA?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: no@c10?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lebridgeur: yes but  will take longer|pg||
nt|kit: He still wouldn't be cold -- West could win club and lead another heart, and dummy might be short an entry -- but  if that happens can take heart finesse then.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|blum1956: heart signal probably|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: It's systemic, so I can't really comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H = transfer?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Looks like you need to guess which heart to play from the West hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: Personally I would lead a heart -- safer, and if spades is right should be time to shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: well np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pinning the stiff 8 would certainly be great|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Can't you just take a couple of diamond ruffs, coming to 5 trumps, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 1 diamond -- unless trump lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|deltadash: easy game, isn't it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes:)|pg||

nt|ady: surprices east did not try the jack|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: and another 12 Imps swing|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe on club lead the entries are short for that|pg||
nt|ady: deceptive heartlead maybe  |pg||
nt|kit: But still, setting up fifth heart is enough -- 4 spades, 2 clubs, 1 diamond, 3 hearts.  Even 4-1 split doesn't matter.|pg||
nt|kit: So, on 3-2 spade split can just draw trumps and claim basically|pg||

nt|kit: On the same logic, shouldn't East be able to work out opponents are in 7-card fit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we trying for a grand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not|pg||
nt|deltadash: I think we're done now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer's hopes will be up when defense doesn't run clubs, but the 4-2 heart split defeats him|pg||
nt|kit: I would think that South would promise 4-card spade suit for this sequence, but maybe not.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: the best bid by S over partner's second double is RD, asking N to bid something:)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: oh, sorry -- didn't see who had bid 3@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: can you see any solution after this lead and N ducks @h?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: a conservative pass at 2@S by North could be made in this auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now discard a @D seam the best line|pg||
nt|kit: Not surprisingly, this hand plays a lot better in clubs than in spades|pg||
nt|kit: yes, diamond discards seem right -- but with spades 4-2 I don't think that will be good enough|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: not sure about the discard. i think ruff with queen of spades then lead jack maybe|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: not so dull commentators curse strikes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: with 10@S in South this line it is OK|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: however this line is winning with @S 3/3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@D apparantly was the first limited bid made by east|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c9|pc|s5|mc|8|nt|ady: why overtake 10@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he bid a lot so he wants to take the tricks on defense:)|pg||
nt|kit: If East has Qxx of diamonds, as indicated, then both black suits can't be splitting|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna|pg||
nt|jbgood: must be one of your slams Roland:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to Jon, Michael, Ralf and Jon for commentary|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty, bye all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all and bye!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, Michael too (not Jon twice)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he led D earlier, after ace, and E returns a minor suit, S cashes D queen & takes three clubs and crossruffs last 2 trix|pg||
nt|ady: another partial|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Giusy Di Dio. Great Job! Our appreciation to the organisers , The FIGB (Gianluca Frola)for ensuring ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Diane, Ralf, Mustapha and Roland for their company and wit and to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|deltadash: specs are pointing out that a @d lead would have made a big difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: that will be a flat board. It rarely pays to be so passive as NS in the open room. 4@s is not that bad after all|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C in OR   way overboard   fortunate to escape double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna. Great job!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our commentators, Kit Woolsey, David Edwin, Giorgio Mauri and Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: may end in 3NT |pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|kit: 3NT is quite possible, and looks like it will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N opened those other junky hands, i am surprised he passed this one, which actually has some positive features|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - 3nt is a normal contract here|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 9 trick level not  good for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 21 hcp  and no fit   an unlikely contract|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Dinner break now, back in 1 hour and 50 minutes, at 21.15 local time|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Roland - also for your nevertireing work for BBO!|pg||
nt|kit: "normal" on 22 high is a strong statement :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: bridge fans all over the world|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: thks all - collegues & spectators|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not as strong a statement as this auctrion|pg||
mb|3N|nt|blum1956: It id possible to make 10 in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unless bid from hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: AKQ109x can make 6 tricks in many layout ....|pg||
nt|ady: hopeless on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west can clear the diamonds now|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even 5@d is in danger but Fantoni probably does not exclude that 6@d are on the table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nothing more to do in this match, so I wish you all a nice weekend. Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|deltadash: Bye Ralf and thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: damp squib ending|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: yes, rather unlucky this time|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder if West should have taken a shot and doublet -- he knows clubs aren't running if that's declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am still a bit agog at the auction|pg||
nt|ady: even if west switches to a spade   should go down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S must think they are down by 50|pg||
nt|ady: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT looks doomed on diamond lead.  |pg||

nt|bridge_one: ty all for watching - bye !|pg||
nt|kit: It will go KA.  Then he runs clubs and plays another heart.  The count will make it clear that North started with 2 hearts, so cash for down 1.|pg||

nt|jbgood: a 3 Norsemen Italian team - I am sure we will see them in the final|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|kit: It might be right to lead low heart from dummy in case North has stiff king.  If North has K10x, he gets squeezed anywy|pg||
