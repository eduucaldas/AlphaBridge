nt|ady: first hand 20-20|pg||
nt|ady: looks as though n/s can make 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Giusy Di Dio|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Hi every one   3rd segment 16 boards of 5 with Angelini leading|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Roland |pg||
nt|ady: vedry close match|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so sunny in Reading either Ed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s might reach a tight 3NT    not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: David u cant be accused of ovestatement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Giusy Di Dio|pg||
nt|ady: hi Guisy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Giusy|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|lebridgeur: board  1 should be a major  fight  @h agains @s|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: hmm....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not board 1 then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they on 2 or 3 maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: re hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@h doubled is par|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder why Fantoni didnt open 2 @s - isnt that according to system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: is any bid here going to be natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|blum1956: surprisingly enough N's hand does not qualigy for the opening bid (1@s is forsing, 2@s being probably not for that kind of shape?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think there is any making game for N/S|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@s should be 10-13 unbalanced with 5+ spades - dosnt that fit?|pg||
nt|blum1956: clearly the biddin is not correctly sent|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 1@h opening and no support from W?|pg||
nt|jbgood: or they play something else than we see? (wrong download?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 commentators and no one knows what is going on|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is normal, Mike:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries, I am in touch with Gianluca Frola from the FIGB|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is looking into it|pg||
nt|ady: north opening a mute point|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: some  action required with South's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: presumeably 2@H   shows hearts and a minor|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mule?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Nunes adopts what we cal the staircase strategy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf  for the Fantunes convention card|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: can someone please explain the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: q2N seems odd why not redouble for rescue what if pard had 3 spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh sorry that explains|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 9-losers hands should not strain to open, especially when you don;t even get to name a suit you would like to see led|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is important to buy the contract on that kind of board whatever the level is|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Garbosi cannot be fouled and Nunes will have to bid  par contract as Michael pointed earlier|pg||
nt|blum1956: keypoint...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well so so far David ur prediction was correct N/S will not make 3N because they arent in it !!|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, hearts plus minor|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: D six growing up fast|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: my understanding of these proceedings is comparable to my understanding of Italian...|pg||
nt|jbgood: Cero|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We can all see that the cards on our screen do not match the hand they are playing|pg||
nt|jbgood: as Flash says: the board displayed is, indeed, Board 1 - it matches the auction which was displayed last time; as Roland indicated, this auction goes with another board...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they are playing board 2 or 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same problem in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: So Roland, we just wait and see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 has been redealt, that's why|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not inclined to go into detail|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: South kow s 1 he has only 2 defensive tricks 2  he cannot be expensive in 6 @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: even thing of redoubling !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Thinks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: club switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 down; even Fantoni can play this fast :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes! well done by both sides up to this moment. Still E needed to avoid the diamond lead which was easy enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either @DA is onside or it's not|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: end play in  @d Roland?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: One goes away on a spade, so not sure which endplay|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction - even if it gives away a trump trick, it usually comes back |pg||
nt|lestergold: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW 5cM. 4cD, 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa has those nice clubs in dummy he has no way of enjoying|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown's Law:  the lower the level of the doubled partial, the faster the trump lead...   :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East had really better take his heart ruff while he can |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Losing 2 diamonds when the ace is off|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: Hi|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @d  ace is obviously off side considering East final double|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio played always strong club - now they chenged the system, seeing the open of 1@C by Failla|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown was one of the early electees to Canada's Hall of Fame |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ace rather than small would win when S has stiff king, but risk is blocking the suit and having heart entry knocked out before clubs can get untangled|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|lebridgeur: sorry not well waked up forgot ace of @s discard:(|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|blum1956: @dA may be singleton offside (just exchange most of minor suit cards between EW)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500 which wouldnt have been tragic if n/s could make 3n |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: E trying to save a trick if W has KJxxx of spades, as a club here would endplay him|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||

nt|lestergold: didnt|pg||
nt|ady: tht would finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who say you should double a 2NT opener if it goes pass-pass|pg||
nt|ady: passive diamond looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all say that but no-one does|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa wants to retaion all his endplay options here hoping that defenders will be forced to give him his 8th trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: south best tho to continue as he started |pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, it's easy to be brave on paper|pg||
nt|ady: may well be   if he cashes all diamonds and then Q@S and 10@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: best for east to conceal his hand very difficult for defenders this way|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: we can see that anything bit a diamond now is fatal for the defence|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h2|nt|blum1956: Normally they play Lebensohl in that position/ I wonder whether 3@c from Nunes was positive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we are about the last one in France NOT to open 1 nt with 5 cardsmajors:)|pg||
nt|ady: can end play south for 9th trick|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa a happy man now although he can still endplay South for the overtrick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h5|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it's without cost|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|ady: hence the problem for a double of 2NT passed |pg||

mb|1C|nt|jbgood: 12-14, a max hand really'|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W also had a 3rd seat 1D opener there at the colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nice 2H opener here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: helps protect spade queen on defense too|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 23 HCP only difficult to be game   really on board 2|pg||
nt|jbgood: very difficult|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Giusy?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 10|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: looks likely for n/s to play 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D multi - possible weaker that 2@H or 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: still very difficult after opps open 1 NT |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H how?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades, 5 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @c for majors  NS make 3 @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile this looks like a coffee brek hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: certainly not likkely to produce the excitement of the last hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: dbl by Failla can bid a very strong hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Kit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: even with that favourable lead E may find it hard to come to nine|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S is in my view misguided. hoping to stay low is false economy, because bidding spades may be the MOST likely way to get N excited|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: overboard   2 off|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: with 3@H give a hand very strong|pg||
pc|dK|nt|blum1956: looks like8 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may be a realy bid in this sequence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: 3@S means a very weak hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent to land on feet after 2S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is correct, counting over 5@C|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d from W hand had a chance unlike 5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: relay :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h8|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Best chance is to first play on @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: Why did Duboin not overcalled 1@d? It could be useful sometimes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: make 3Nt also with Qxxx xxx Jxx xxx at the partner|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: no reason to pick the heart push thus|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: cant cost to play a club to start with and tghen see what happens|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes, that is what I ment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If E had one more D and one less round card, 6C would be on after normal defense|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|blum1956: now the diamond discard looked safe|pg||
nt|kit: Might have been right to just bid 3NT after partner bids 2@S, with 8 top tricks, 4-4 spade fit might be worse anyway|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, though at that point N had hardly showed a great hand so 2S didnt need to be a dreadful hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h by Failla take the chance to find the slam in @C, so i agree with that bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse strikes who cares|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very little between finessing and going for the drop. 52-48 for the drop, a priori|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: just a part score  n/s|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: easy 4 @s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 NT here looks more promising|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not seeing many likely continuations after 3H that would lead to 6C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be balanced hand|pg||
nt|kit: South has difficult problem, with no suit to Q-bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C natural (normal in Italy against 1@C with only 2@c)|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps it is right to play that a bid of the other minor is a Q here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a much easier 3n here for E/W|pg||
nt|ady: might get too high|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: just playing it as forcing is likely to be good enough, no?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is a good bid - North could have 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: last board 2@c showed both majors - does really 2 @d show even more major cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: well, partner needs to know if it shows diamonds or not|pg||
nt|ady: unless defence slips  3NT has 5 tricks of the top|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D is forcing one round|pg||
nt|lestergold: players normally play for the drop if there is no other indicator|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: giving the stop for 3Nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah i see, you mean doing it even with shorter diamonds. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but North nothing in @S ...|pg||
nt|kit: they have pinpointed the spade weakness, so will likely stop in time at 4@C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: exactly Marshall|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfect defence against 2H could be quite bloody|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Good 3@S bid -- if partner has 3 small spades, that might be enough|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is a risk - ask half stop to bid Nt|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead against 4@s gives some chances to the defense|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d on 1@c opening  2@c was after one NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer must be careful|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: as kind kiubs tell me: 2 @c shows 5-4 and 2@d 5-5|pg||
nt|ady: a lucky lay and n/s can make 4@H    but not  in the bidding in both rooms|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: I don't think South will think Jx is enough|pg||
nt|ady: might lead a heart     but will have time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: *kibs|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: would need A in @D in South - with this layout E/W make 5 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for Qxx of spades upstairs...but even then likely to need 44 spades in EW hands|pg||
nt|kit: Heart lead wrong only if North has 7 clubs -- but that is quite possible|pg||
nt|blum1956: It proved easy enough to stop the opps from making a vulnerable game |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a push |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|blum1956: In both rooms|pg||

nt|blum1956: In Russia we play 2NT opening for minors|pg||
pc|d7|nt|blum1956: The declarer needs to realise early that he must discard the 3rd club on the heart rather than ruffing one|pg||

nt|marlowepi: interesting choice of lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|blum1956: But the defenders may play clubs themselfe so the trump coup is needed|pg||

nt|blum1956: yes as South may discard two hearts|pg||

pc|h7|nt|kit: Declarer properly attacking his side suit first -- he needs to develop diamond tricks in all variations.|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: who|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway I cannot find a sensible alternative for North. But Fantoni is better...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West did well to hide his 10 of @h   both red tens are essential for the defense  @s could be right !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Not that easy to see that 10 of @s could do harm to the defense|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: difficult for the team that must win any IMP to play with this kinds of hands|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I think S will make now. Discard 2 @h and play 3 rounds oof @d|pg||

nt|mdgraham: interesting here that North has stayed out of this auction. |pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR the double NS fit was known.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Perhaps he has no descriptive action - not that anything seems particularly obvious |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ady: yes   correct|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S running diamonds before spades so as to end in dummy|pg||
nt|blum1956: will Nunes remove this?|pg||

nt|ady: 1st round west overcalled 1@H in OR   north doubled   |pg||
nt|othered1: What was 2N?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2 keycards and a void - they should have a special bid for that case|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some kind of relay you would think|pg||
nt|othered1: I doubt 2N was natural. Other than that I've had suggestions of various hands, from cue-bid to, asks other suit, to shows @H fit.  Maybe 2@D means something other than simple ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Michaels?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2 key cards and a void could still have 2 minor losers of course|pg||
mb|5C|nt|blum1956: Is the 1@h 3rd in hand also strong by their system?|pg||
nt|ady: cashes the diamonds before completing the spades |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: another  4@s made  |pg||
nt|othered1: It's suggested they play Ghestem and that 2@D is specific to majors.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: good sacrifice in @h|pg||

nt|blum1956: It was a difficult task for Nunes. His hand is worst possible from the defensive point of view but he knows few about partner's hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one spec  points that 4 @s  goes down on the " obvious" @s lead he is right on principle|pg||
nt|blum1956: But in this vulnerability he probably loses only 200 if 5@h proves to be wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 2@D is majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes one way or another should have been able to bid 3N with finality, |pg||

nt|ady: e/w did well to lose 50 in OR    3 hearts making n/s|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H fine contract here, but heart finesse is off.|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 12-14|pg||
nt|kit: I think N-S in other room did well to sell to 3@S|pg||
nt|jbgood: Varese gaining ground with the last two ..|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: transfer I presume|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes 8 imps. And 12 more on the board were Fantoni allowed 5@d to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3C?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a stretch in OR   held to 7 trricks on trump lead   though difficult from KX|pg||
nt|othered1: double seems normal, |pg||
nt|othered1: Double, in theory, is for takeout of @H on these auctions.  South has extras to justify it.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jbgood: 3 @c not on my cc - puppet?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes, I think a direct raise would show a good hand |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Fantunes play 12-14 in all positions, can be 6322, 5422 and even 4441 shape, not 5-4 in the majors, though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - but calling 4@H not easy for e/w don't call 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C is a transfer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South can try a DBL here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: made :)|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S a totally unnecessary overbid IMO -- opponents have already exchanged information, so what is the point?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: then 5 @h is too optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: overstatement by west   probably tht 4@H making  so made advanced sacrifice|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: Did Garbosi forget their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am told 2 @h is two way  weak support in @s or stong with @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only 10imps difference with 36 boards to go   but this one could be bad for Garbosi|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the 4@s bid should of course imply the weak spade support hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead beats 5@s, other leads probably do not|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like that weak nt is back|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jbgood: transfer seems like it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: let us see |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1500 kibs watching this match here on BBO - quite a crowd!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @d attracting  on the bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: If North leads a heart the declarer wins and plays on diamonds. If the defense plays trumps twice the diamond suit works otherwise two hearts may be ruffed|pg||
nt|othered1: over 3@C, south's hand does look defensive and there's nothing certain about any offensive action|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means support in @H limit or + - i agree 4@S can be too much|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should just bid 3@S -- his partner will have better idea whether or not 4@H is making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: And opponents haven't bid to 4@H yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: !|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: if S has "Limit + " chances of 4S goading N into 5H are greatly reduced|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well done    no declarer task very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead triumph|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @s and @c  should easier now|pg||

nt|kit: possible swing here if slam is reached|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 4 of a major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: people open and respond on such light hands these days that you need 1NT "sandwich" as strong balanced - but whether a flat 15-count is worth it is debatable|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 2@S if allowed to play    small loss|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: sry folks, have to leave you. Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: he has a good hand - 5-card suit, controls|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: 4@s is better than 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2H response would sometimes work out well by protecting club holding (or in other ways), but usually right to show 4-card support immediately|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not a  bad contract but   @s far behaving|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blum1956: try crossruff - trump coup may probably work in the ending. But Nunes is not aware of the trump position|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   may go down   but not 3 down    £@S   should be fown  so another pick up for Villa|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best lead....|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|blum1956: not a lot of defense in the East hand therefore not suitable for trupping|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Interesting board 13 in the other room. I'd like to know why Helgemo dropped the stiff @SK offside in 4@S|pg||

nt|ady: 4@C in OR   way overboard   fortunate to escape double|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3D|nt|kit: 3NT is quite possible, and looks like it will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N opened those other junky hands, i am surprised he passed this one, which actually has some positive features|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - 3nt is a normal contract here|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 9 trick level not  good for e/w|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: 21 hcp  and no fit   an unlikely contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Dinner break now, back in 1 hour and 50 minutes, at 21.15 local time|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Roland - also for your nevertireing work for BBO!|pg||
nt|kit: "normal" on 22 high is a strong statement :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: thks all - collegues & spectators|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not as strong a statement as this auctrion|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: It id possible to make 10 in diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: unless bid from hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: AKQ109x can make 6 tricks in many layout ....|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: west can clear the diamonds now|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even 5@d is in danger but Fantoni probably does not exclude that 6@d are on the table|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: damp squib ending|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: yes, rather unlucky this time|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder if West should have taken a shot and doublet -- he knows clubs aren't running if that's declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am still a bit agog at the auction|pg||
nt|ady: even if west switches to a spade   should go down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S must think they are down by 50|pg||
nt|ady: maybe down 2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|0  bamba: ma|pg||
nt|ady: is this last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, Michael, JP and Jon|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ady: opening 3@C  in OR   followed by 3@D  and then 4@C    hence same contract|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: trying to make    diamond to queen now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|lebridgeur: 0.3  ace =4 NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: thanks all, colleagues and spectators|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO. Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|ady: I believe this is last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: will be disappointed  when clubs fail|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: now around down 3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lunch break now. Restart in 2 hours and 15 minutes, at 14.30 local time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: double finesse in diamonds is the best chance|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer think West without control in @C for the switch in @S at second trick|pg||
nt|ady: well thx specs and all|pg||
