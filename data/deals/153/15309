nt|marlowepi: awkward rebid for W. 2H could easily miss a game|pg||
nt|jallerton: would 5@c show something like this?|pg||
nt|jallerton: West can be 5431 or perhaps 6430|pg||
nt|jallerton: spec suggests 5@C might be to play but East would bids clubs earlier with such a hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: even top partnerships have not always discussed how the following third bids by E would fiffer here: 4C, 5C, 5D|pg||

nt|dburn: all very odd|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dburn: at any rate, here is a decent slam for East-West, or possibly two decent slams and one indecent one|pg||
nt|chick: 6@D maybe?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|deltadash: Hi wlc :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|dburn: but six spades, six hearts and six diamonds (and one no trump) will all make|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@D is a pretty encouraging bid, considering E tried to sign off in 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: he might have bid five diamonds, to show an exceptionally good suit|pg||
nt|deltadash: agree - what's Green gonna do about it?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chick: if W has a quality-of-trump-suit bid available, now is the time for it|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer 5@D, too.|pg||
nt|dburn: but sometimes 4@d is a strong 5=4=3=1 shape, and Bennett may have wanted to retain 4@s as an option|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he ought to bid six diamonds now|pg||
nt|deltadash: that oughta do it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all:)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|dburn: well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|deltadash: easy game, lol|pg||
nt|othered1: back to 5@D in stead of 4 -- right out of the seminal Mark Time Bid article.  But west pushed one more time and things worked out.|pg||
nt|deltadash: very nice auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice bidded |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chick: I suspect both E and W were unenthusiastic about their bids, but together they did it quite well|pg||
nt|othered1: if west had been 5=4=3=1, it's likely would include the @DK and 6@D is quite a good spot, too.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: but 4C does not necessarily offer choice of strain...ostensibly it would, of course, but if he then bids 5D next time the message gets changed so there is more to 4C than just ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: choice of strain|pg||

pc|d6|nt|deltadash: we can't say this has been a dull match for sure!! lots of excitement so far|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was same bidding til 3@C but than E ruined it by bid 5@D over 3@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. same bid til 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: that didn't ruin anything - that should have enabled West to bid six comfortably, but she ruined it by passing|pg||

pc|h6|nt|chick: hmmmm Isn't that 5@D bid exactly what you were advocating here?  :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Did u agree at my last David?|pg||
nt|dburn: now, what else did West need apart from five good diamonds opposite?|pg||
nt|dburn: no, I didn't|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 4@d is not a slam try - the partnership can still be looking for the best game|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|dburn: and "fast arrival" is all eyewash anyway - if you jump when you don;t have to, you should have a reason for it, in this case excellent diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: so you think 4@D showed less than excellent diamonds?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: If E feel enough he/she will pass 3@D. When E bid 4@D it mean?|pg||
