nt|sybarra: this is a pair event, so the home and away is just for comparison |pg||
nt|sybarra: that transfer was just what pard wanted to hear |pg||
nt|dimi: would you X witj N hand Gabor?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: allways like it when they understand each other|pg||

nt|cicus: no|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems this is just going home playing on the red suits|pg||
nt|dimi: i think that S should reopen after 2@h - p- p - |pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: dead certain that he do not have a single diamond now|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the club shift obvious?  and is that what should be done next?|pg||
nt|haans: looks easy to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Skrzypczak's fingers are moving between 7 @c and 3 @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier from this vantage point for sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Pass around? Ain't P from N a semi force pass? Anyway they are lucky not ending in 3NT down|pg||

nt|dimi: yes|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|cicus: but I mistakenly told you it would make - no, W still has his @DK as an entry|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: playing equal level conversion, I might have doubled 1@H with 4@S+5@D|pg||
mc|9|nt|rnmalik: If he cannot make it then it is not makeable, a compliment.|pg||

nt|vugraphzsc: try to pronounce Skshipchak - that it's )))|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wonders I would never be able to say that name |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes, @H 2-2, easy on the line of play.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: see a 4@S for NS.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: try say HI you!|pg||
nt|dimi: NS will try 4@h i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|cicus: equal level conversion (ELC) is when you X then correct partner's bid on the same level, without promising extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: EW may make 5 of a minor here (especially 5@D) if NS don't find their ruff|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: it is sort of like trying to speak dutch for me,  my throat muscles were never trained for those noises|pg||
nt|haans: Lionel double?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22HP NS but with nice harmony|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but what is wrong with 5@S as the cards are placed.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: double = spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I adore the Neth.  been there many times, |pg||
nt|rodal f: NS play precission|pg||
nt|dimi: lucky for Versace that NS did not miss a @h fit after his 1@s bis|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a bunch of clubs can be made,  not  sure if they can handle 5 of not |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  so 2 @C,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: no way to claim @c as a trump |pg||
nt|sybarra: so 2 @D rather,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: after 2@d rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: N asked about DBL and got answer "for take out". does it helps declarer?|pg||
nt|dimi: ...bid|pg||
nt|cicus: e.g. 1@H-X-p-2@C-p-2@D|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: true, cant get there from here |pg||
nt|cicus: this has to be played in good tempo|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: having 4 cards in both majors, E led a trump|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive N's X was negative. So why did they loose the @H color?|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 @Ds must be ruffed so trumps cannot be drawn|pg||
nt|cicus: also, @Hs must be established|pg||
nt|dimi: useful convention|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|haans: yes good help|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: but being doubled is no good|pg||
nt|cicus: best continuation|pg||
nt|cicus: declarer must also take care of not conceding a @H ruff|pg||
nt|cicus: not at all easy|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Egorov a bit to active here. WHAT have W promissed? 0HP+      and he bid freely? HUM|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like 2 down from here - we'll see|pg||
nt|cicus: now if he ruffs a @D, he must play a low @H from dummy I think|pg||
nt|dimi: but you should remeber it, otherwise it can end in a disaster|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|sybarra: E will "fall off chair" with Q from W |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should make now by playing@C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: making +1.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: only slightly amazed is my guess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cant avoid ruffing 2 @D |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cicus: now again, only @D ruff then low @H is successful|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say Q@H now, would it make a difference, difficult hand.|pg||
nt|cicus: it is easy to see now that @H ace concedes a @H ruff for the defence|pg||
nt|cicus: not the best idea here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: better cash the q of @D  but easy from here to say that |pg||
nt|cicus: but it's only the overtrick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dimi: true|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question has to be (on this hand) after 1 nt do you bid 4 card suits up the line, or bid the @D thinking you might bid again if pard bids spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades again |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: NS did well after 1st session, but the second one wasn't so lucky and they are 39th now|pg||
nt|cicus: I am sure Versace will make this but it was very difficult with closed hands|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dimi: well done|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow|pg||

nt|cicus: 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: easy so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Diane,  look at South's name,  8 consinants in a row,  want to pronounce it?|pg||

pc|h8|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: so even easier  at end of day |pg||
nt|cicus: here, W will inevitably take a @H trick and lead a trump through|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Hi Patricia:)|pg||
nt|cicus: so declarer is going to lose 3 @Hs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: may shoot a @D back and he does|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But not that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: although that was not best |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|fifee: 2@H is probably a transfer showing a decent 2@S raise|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzsc: EW are beginners|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzsc: I have it easy - my granny was Polish|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|deltadash: Sveta has an 'inside' source :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we should call him "shipwreck"   (no offense) |pg||
nt|cicus: the suit has holes, 3@Hs is a flaw and he has too much defence|pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: or nice word is "novice" |pg||

nt|bg: That was Eric Murray's success story let Kehela play all the tough hands|pg||
nt|ady: this one not tough    impossible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a Murray-Kehela story that still makes me chuckle ... do we have time?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brede has a lot of playing strength but he did say that when he jumped to 4@D vulnerable. The rest must be up to partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think we all agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Murray had a balanced 1 point hand, and it went Pass-Pass-Pass to him in 4th seat|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: He looked up, and noticed Kehela going very red in the face|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So he said: "hmm, this is nearly an opening bid, but I think I will pass it in"|pg||

nt|cicus: this is 1 off but 3@D would have made so a possible gain|pg||
pc|hA|nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
nt|dimi: in the end best contract for EW, 1NT is one down ... the same fate of a 2@S contract|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, if he'd opened, NS might now be in a higher contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|deltadash: we could ALL number off, Larry, but that may take awhile :(|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|rodal f: So fare all boards from 22 til 24HP have been for bonus biddings while 26HP ain't enough for the same. Funny:)|pg||

nt|deltadash: that wouldn't have been my choice of bids, but what do I know??? :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand and depends playing 3NT or 4@H. |pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: east's 2 suits may have been majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H are not very friendly and @S 10 lead would create problems for the declarer.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: out of 5 hands that we have seen, except one all hands have been played in 4@H.|pg||
nt|cicus: Vytas in commanding position|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cicus: this may be anther gain for them|pg||

nt|bg: chance for ERA to get back in the match|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Declarer tapped himself to pieces and could not handle the 4-1 trump break later|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cicus: I don't think Zaleski will gain 20 IMPs here so Vytas advances to the final|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: and W in my opinion too strong for 4@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: If S use @SA by @S lead E can make 12 by @S@C squice at N|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|haans: urkk|pg||
nt|deltadash: oops|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: stil, they will have to go down 2 doubled, otherwise at most 14 IMPs can be given away|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: otherthan A@H, have no losers.|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, they could have afforded going 1 down in a grand slam|pg||
