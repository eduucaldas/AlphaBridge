nt|gluckenval: nell'apertura di 1NT (forte) la possibilità di 5 carte nobili.|pg||
nt|0  bamba: non tutti passano la mano di TOSI|pg||
nt|caruga: è vero ma silvio non vuole aprire in barrage e vedere paolo svenire con 100 d'onori quinti d'appoggio|pg||
nt|cuan: penso che se il mio partner apre di 3@H, ritengo non sia ancora sveglio ed abbia confuso le quadri con le cuori|pg||
nt|gluckenval: penso che 6@H sia comunque il par della mano, solo che probabilmente lo chiameranno non pensando di essere in difesa su 5@S fattibili in E/W|pg||
nt|katar: un bel 4@s da nord non sarebbe bruttissimo|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Are they on 2 or 3 maybe?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome all|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@h doubled is par|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder why Fantoni didnt open 2 @s - isnt that according to system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: is any bid here going to be natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|blum1956: surprisingly enough N's hand does not qualigy for the opening bid (1@s is forsing, 2@s being probably not for that kind of shape?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think there is any making game for N/S|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@s should be 10-13 unbalanced with 5+ spades - dosnt that fit?|pg||
nt|blum1956: clearly the biddin is not correctly sent|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 1@h opening and no support from W?|pg||
nt|jbgood: or they play something else than we see? (wrong download?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 commentators and no one knows what is going on|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is normal, Mike:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries, I am in touch with Gianluca Frola from the FIGB|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is looking into it|pg||
nt|ady: north opening a mute point|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: some  action required with South's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mule?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Nunes adopts what we cal the staircase strategy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf  for the Fantunes convention card|pg||
mb|5H|mb|5S|nt|lestergold: can someone please explain the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 9-losers hands should not strain to open, especially when you don;t even get to name a suit you would like to see led|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is important to buy the contract on that kind of board whatever the level is|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Garbosi cannot be fouled and Nunes will have to bid  par contract as Michael pointed earlier|pg||
nt|blum1956: keypoint...|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: D six growing up fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: my understanding of these proceedings is comparable to my understanding of Italian...|pg||
nt|jbgood: Cero|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: We can all see that the cards on our screen do not match the hand they are playing|pg||
nt|jbgood: as Flash says: the board displayed is, indeed, Board 1 - it matches the auction which was displayed last time; as Roland indicated, this auction goes with another board...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they are playing board 2 or 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same problem in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: So Roland, we just wait and see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 has been redealt, that's why|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not inclined to go into detail|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: South kow s 1 he has only 2 defensive tricks 2  he cannot be expensive in 6 @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: even thing of redoubling !|pg||

nt|blum1956: yes! well done by both sides up to this moment. Still E needed to avoid the diamond lead which was easy enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either @DA is onside or it's not|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: end play in  @d Roland?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: One goes away on a spade, so not sure which endplay|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Losing 2 diamonds when the ace is off|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio played always strong club - now they chenged the system, seeing the open of 1@C by Failla|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: ace rather than small would win when S has stiff king, but risk is blocking the suit and having heart entry knocked out before clubs can get untangled|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: even with that favourable lead E may find it hard to come to nine|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S is in my view misguided. hoping to stay low is false economy, because bidding spades may be the MOST likely way to get N excited|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: overboard   2 off|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Yes, that is what I ment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If E had one more D and one less round card, 6C would be on after normal defense|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|blum1956: now the diamond discard looked safe|pg||
nt|kit: Might have been right to just bid 3NT after partner bids 2@S, with 8 top tricks, 4-4 spade fit might be worse anyway|pg||

mb|2D|nt|jbgood: 3 NT here looks more promising|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be balanced hand|pg||
nt|kit: South has difficult problem, with no suit to Q-bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C natural (normal in Italy against 1@C with only 2@c)|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps it is right to play that a bid of the other minor is a Q here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: a much easier 3n here for E/W|pg||
nt|ady: might get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: just playing it as forcing is likely to be good enough, no?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is a good bid - North could have 4@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jbgood: last board 2@c showed both majors - does really 2 @d show even more major cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: well, partner needs to know if it shows diamonds or not|pg||
nt|ady: unless defence slips  3NT has 5 tricks of the top|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bridge_one: 2@D is forcing one round|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: giving the stop for 3Nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah i see, you mean doing it even with shorter diamonds. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but North nothing in @S ...|pg||
nt|kit: they have pinpointed the spade weakness, so will likely stop in time at 4@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: exactly Marshall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: perfect defence against 2H could be quite bloody|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Good 3@S bid -- if partner has 3 small spades, that might be enough|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is a risk - ask half stop to bid Nt|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead against 4@s gives some chances to the defense|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d on 1@c opening  2@c was after one NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer must be careful|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: as kind kiubs tell me: 2 @c shows 5-4 and 2@d 5-5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: I don't think South will think Jx is enough|pg||
nt|ady: might lead a heart     but will have time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: *kibs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bridge_one: would need A in @D in South - with this layout E/W make 5 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for Qxx of spades upstairs...but even then likely to need 44 spades in EW hands|pg||
nt|kit: Heart lead wrong only if North has 7 clubs -- but that is quite possible|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|kit: If North had Qxx in spades, North would have bid 3NT -- that is why I don't like South's 3NT call|pg||

pc|d8|pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: i meant, he might not have bid 3N, sorry|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: This should be easy defense -- they know declarer starts with 8 top tricks, so the necessary assumptions are easy.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: but of course i agree about the 3N call being ill-judged|pg||
nt|kit: Also, declarer shouldn't have king of spades -- with that, would have bid 3NT, not 3@H.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: he will settle for 9 now I guess|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|kit: accurate discarding by both defenders|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if East would have 3@S (with Jxx in South), the lead @H help the declarer to make 3Nt (squeeze against West) - he must keep at 6 cards 3@S 2@h so declarer can play @d|pg||

nt|bridge_one: South can try a DBL here|pg||

nt|kit: 4@S a totally unnecessary overbid IMO -- opponents have already exchanged information, so what is the point?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: then 5 @h is too optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: overstatement by west   probably tht 4@H making  so made advanced sacrifice|pg||
mb|5S|nt|blum1956: Did Garbosi forget their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am told 2 @h is two way  weak support in @s or stong with @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only 10imps difference with 36 boards to go   but this one could be bad for Garbosi|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the 4@s bid should of course imply the weak spade support hand|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: ace of @d attracting  on the bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: If North leads a heart the declarer wins and plays on diamonds. If the defense plays trumps twice the diamond suit works otherwise two hearts may be ruffed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means support in @H limit or + - i agree 4@S can be too much|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should just bid 3@S -- his partner will have better idea whether or not 4@H is making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: And opponents haven't bid to 4@H yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: !|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|toniemme: altro swing per Angelini dato che l'apertura di est a 2@H e le successive licite a fiori portano il livello dichiarativo oltre l'azzardato 3SA di aperta|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|nt|toniemme: ha pagaTO 2@c 2@s E UNA @d..|pg||

mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: and if pd has doubled without the king, very likely he has little elsewhere so it will not cost the contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: 10-13, 5+ spades, unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: looks like a dull 3N here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: By unbalanced I mean not 5332|pg||
nt|blum1956: interesting board|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: Interesting that West doesn't raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in front at a passed hand east could bid also 2@h|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: RD ?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like this 2@S call one bit -- partner might not even have 4 spades, and wrong hand gets tapped.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s 3 cards after pass at 1@H rdbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he did the exact smae thing before you got here Kit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can pass now|pg||
nt|kit: ah, good point Giorgio|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  19|pg||
pc|c3|nt|blum1956: not that dull|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @s lead can create problems for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Nort must duck a heart |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes and then?|pg||
nt|blum1956: any lead may create ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i see he may have difficulties in establishing and enjoying 2 @hs|pg||

pc|c7|nt|jbgood: ... but the spade king:)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: Even if he ruffs high should go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: not possible to ruff two clubs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: On the same logic, shouldn't East be able to work out opponents are in 7-card fit?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the best bid by S over partner's second double is RD, asking N to bid something:)|pg||

mb|3N|an|4441!c|mb|p|nt|toniemme: 3SA deve essere covenzionale tipo bilanciata forte con 4@H..|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|toniemme: o anche sottocolore della splinter a @C ..questa più improbabile..|pg||
nt|cuan: si fanno anche 5@D. Ma Nord sa che il fit non è cuori ?|pg||
nt|toniemme: nord forse pensa che sud non abbia interpretato in modo corretto il 3SA..sempre che fosse da interpretare ..:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|julia11: paolo vista la dichiarazione dell'altro 3 senza stavolta non  rischia|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: ty, bye all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all and bye!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, Michael too (not Jon twice)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he led D earlier, after ace, and E returns a minor suit, S cashes D queen & takes three clubs and crossruffs last 2 trix|pg||
nt|ady: another partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: that will be a flat board. It rarely pays to be so passive as NS in the open room. 4@s is not that bad after all|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kit: 3NT is quite possible, and looks like it will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N opened those other junky hands, i am surprised he passed this one, which actually has some positive features|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - 3nt is a normal contract here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: 21 hcp  and no fit   an unlikely contract|pg||

nt|kit: "normal" on 22 high is a strong statement :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|blum1956: thks all - collegues & spectators|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not as strong a statement as this auctrion|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ady: unless bid from hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: AKQ109x can make 6 tricks in many layout ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west can clear the diamonds now|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even 5@d is in danger but Fantoni probably does not exclude that 6@d are on the table|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: damp squib ending|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: yes, rather unlucky this time|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder if West should have taken a shot and doublet -- he knows clubs aren't running if that's declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am still a bit agog at the auction|pg||
nt|ady: even if west switches to a spade   should go down|pg||
