nt|Walddk2: http://www.ycbc.co.uk/ycko2010.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|athene: Passing 4@C and making on the nose only gains 3, in fact, against 5@C in the other room.|pg||
nt|athene: So the odds just aren't that good.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: passing 4C looks very wrong to me. you have play for game facing hands that might not even bid 3C|pg||

nt|dburn: they can't, and 3@c was going to make, but I don't blame Hinden for taking her best shot - 28 IMPs in eight boards is a lot to make up|pg||

nt|vugraphzry: limit or 16+ @C s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: it must have some other possible meanings too, given the 3D bid. if it were a pure invite S would just bid a game, with slam not in the picturew|pg||
nt|marlowepi: omk thx|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: if it turns out you have two trump losers here, you might want to try to ruff the fourth diamond in dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could reverse dummy maybe|pg||
nt|athene: if west had @SA109x for example|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: there are two tactical problems - firstly, if you play two rounds of trumps and east shows out, west can play a third trump to stop that plan|pg||
nt|athene: secondly you might want to play a heart early, in some lines, i think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when i mentioned reverse dummy, i meant early heart to be implicit|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the ten and you might catch west in a red-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: yes, leading a heart is sort of part and parcel of reversing dummy :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart and harcel|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: well, with the scores as they stand, the match isn't going to hinge on 620/650 here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4@H was a bit high on a combined 20 count without shortage|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1NT (11)12-14|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: some people play that a double of 2@D is takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: that can have some tactical advantages|pg||
nt|athene: for example|pg||
nt|athene: suppose it goes 1nt 2@D (X) 2@H (2@S)|pg||
nt|athene: now if north bids 3@H, it's not clear whether he is just competing, or actually inviting|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: but as it went here, with the delayed double, north has already denied any game interest|pg||
nt|athene: so he can happily bid 3@H without his partner doing anything foolish, like bidding four|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trump is not exactly good for the defence, but at least Bennett avoided the diamond lead|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it isnt very hard for NS to have agreements that distinguish between a merely competitive 3H and a game try though|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: N kind of denied game interest by passing 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry meant private answering question|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it is a bit unfortunate for Scoltock that partner does not have four spades, but in his position he will do all he can to keep the auction alive|pg||
nt|athene: yes, especially at love-all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Time to give up after 3@H I think|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: specs questioning the 3H bid. yes, that contract rates to fail. N hoped to push them up one more, and succeeeded. perhaps not that likely to work often enough, but the sixth heart ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Was making|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Until declarer threw a club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E might have doubled 3H to show a bit extra with only 3 spades and convertible values|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Best to pitch the diamond if he can read it|pg||
nt|athene: Doubling 3@H sounds like a matchpoint knife-edge to me :)|pg||
nt|athene: or BAM|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The way declarer has Ã¦played this hand indicated that he does not have five spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has already doubled hearts for takeout, and NS are NV|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|athene: Some expert said that if you double 3@H for one off at imps, you have to decide if three imps is worth ten years of partner's life :)|pg||

pc|d5|pc|sJ|pc|dA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sQ|pc|h9|nt|athene: Of course with some partners, that would be a fair rate of exchange|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: however as Roland and Jeff pointed out we are in a context of a 30+ IMP margin and so EW wish to be active. my point was that if activity is desired, maybe more upside in defense|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: better from S hand:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trump lead for example|pg||
nt|jallerton: well then you need to score 1 ruff in dummy, @hK and 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: North has the sort of hand where you bid game with no hesitation if you have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|athene: but a 5-3 fit just isn't enough trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: expect heart knave to be led, and W must duck. play may then favor declarer|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Some case for bouncing to 4@s on the South hand over the double|pg||
nt|athene: Hoping to get an injudicious sac?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: especially since EW are playing this set hungrily|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if Ds 43 that forces them to cash a heart|pg||
nt|athene: normally you want to set up your side suit tricks early, admittedly|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i dont get it....if W wanted to play 4H he should have bid it over 2C|pg||

nt|athene: heart bids by west over 2@C, sorry|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|dburn: his actual sequence sounds strong with hearts and four spades|pg||
nt|athene: even 4@H over 3@D if you want to keep it simple|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W rejected NT and didnt raise diamonds and wanted to play game. E most unl;ikely to have 5 spades. so why not 4H over 2C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, E was not exactly obl;igated to start with X either...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: seems worse than an immediate 4H over 2C|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting - Google Translate renders that as "if on the same day is whole shebang"|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he had to pass 3nt, the way he bid it|pg||
nt|jallerton: sounds as though Google Translate is about as useful as Google Maps|pg||

nt|deltadash: asap, David :)|pg||
nt|dburn: though not obvious to do so - North's clubs are not robust, and 2@c might be the fire rather than the frying pan|pg||

nt|jallerton: and prize money rarely goes up in Engligh bridge events - as entries gradually dwindle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jeffrey was right. Â£1,000 to the winners, 200 to the runners-up|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C would be unlucky on these cards.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: It will be hard now for West to visualize that his partner has all his strength outside spades.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: That will be a good thing if it stops him bidding 6@C :) But not so good if it stops him bidding 6@D :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: East should not stand this with @s8xxx opposit apparent shortness|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and now the shock|pg||
nt|athene: Of course, it might not be that easy for North to find the spade lead against 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Scoltock passed|pg||
nt|athene: Hmmm - OK, that's a bit unfortunate!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't take 3NT out to play in 4 of a minor, do you?|pg||
nt|athene: I really don't think you can pass 4@C.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Never seen that before|pg||
nt|jallerton: assumed partner had a weak distributional raise to 3, presumably|pg||
nt|athene: But clearly west felt that as east was limited (3@C not forcing) 4@C had to be non-forcing also|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzry: that was the explantion|pg||
nt|vugraphzry: explanation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But hey, pulling a non-doubled game to a partscore. I can't believe that 4@C is passable|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: Well, as Ishamel Del'Monte explained to me once, "no bid is forcing - you can always pass it!"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: undoubled even|pg||
nt|jallerton: might get lucky if opps in 6@c |pg||
nt|Walddk2: That will be the last board at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzry: exactly|pg||
nt|athene: Even if North doesn't find the spade lead against 6@C, you can't get the spade away in time, as south has only a doubleton diamond.|pg||
nt|athene: A heart lead would let 6@C make :)  @HAKJ9 throwing all *east's* spades away|pg||
nt|athene: But i don't think many norths are "finding" that one|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|jallerton: not unless South has doubled - possible I suppose|pg||

nt|athene: perhaps east should have bid 4@D over 3NT|pg||
