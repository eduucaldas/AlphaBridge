nt|deltadash: Hi everyone and good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland, Diane and Geoffrey|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Ralf|pg||
nt|deltadash: Looks like we're going to ease into it with this hand - not much action|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi all|pg||

nt|Walddk3: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf  for Fantunes|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Our operator is Giusy Di Dio|pg||
nt|april7: S might open in 3d|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Peter Lund and Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting that the same players seem to be facing off set after set.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: board  1 should be a major  fight  @h agains @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The layout isn't friendly for N-S in a heart contract. On a good day you make game|pg||
nt|stewball: 3nt better than 4 @s here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jbgood: hmm....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not board 1 then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they on 2 or 3 maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: re hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@h doubled is par|pg||
nt|april7: partscore of 3@C by NS|pg||
nt|pelu: the players are soonback after only 5 minbreak - I exp 15-10 min - well done by players (and TDs)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder why Fantoni didnt open 2 @s - isnt that according to system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: is any bid here going to be natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|blum1956: surprisingly enough N's hand does not qualigy for the opening bid (1@s is forsing, 2@s being probably not for that kind of shape?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think there is any making game for N/S|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@s should be 10-13 unbalanced with 5+ spades - dosnt that fit?|pg||
nt|blum1956: clearly the biddin is not correctly sent|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 1@h opening and no support from W?|pg||
nt|jbgood: or they play something else than we see? (wrong download?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 commentators and no one knows what is going on|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is normal, Mike:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries, I am in touch with Gianluca Frola from the FIGB|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is looking into it|pg||
nt|ady: north opening a mute point|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: some  action required with South's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not an unreasonable game when you are 25 IMPs behind with 16 boards to go|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but n/s dont have to be in game|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the basic system of n/s?|pg||
nt|deltadash: they may not get past 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Quiet start to the day, a straightforward 4@H. Cards well placed|pg||
nt|april7: now NS might reach an unmakable game|pg||
nt|flash: hello, all - a most impressive display be Angelini|pg||
nt|stoffers: Good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: presumeably 2@H   shows hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mule?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Nunes adopts what we cal the staircase strategy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf  for the Fantunes convention card|pg||
nt|flash: by...   and some hands worth writing up   :)|pg||
nt|stewball: going to be hard to manage|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: can someone please explain the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: q2N seems odd why not redouble for rescue what if pard had 3 spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh sorry that explains|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has a chance without a @s lead. Declarer can knock out @hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: now an invite or the classic punt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rinaldi will obviously accept an invite|pg||
mb|2S|nt|flash: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf   for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 9-losers hands should not strain to open, especially when you don;t even get to name a suit you would like to see led|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is important to buy the contract on that kind of board whatever the level is|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Garbosi cannot be fouled and Nunes will have to bid  par contract as Michael pointed earlier|pg||
nt|blum1956: keypoint...|pg||
nt|april7: now 3@C by N and pass by S|pg||
nt|tomi2: i cant imagine anybody passing a partscore here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|flash: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|flash: for N-S|pg||
nt|stewball: this may be forcing in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: good morning all|pg||
nt|psridhar: Madala wil invite|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: well so so far David ur prediction was correct N/S will not make 3N because they arent in it !!|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, hearts plus minor|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: D six growing up fast|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 4 cl  is advance cuebid  shows  heart supp |pg||
nt|othered1: I think 2@C was game forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is GF and they wil game, thas why they play bridge|pg||
nt|april7: should they play "weak" openings then 3@C by S is passableor also 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: are we in a Gazilli auction?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Jim|pg||
nt|poohbear: Close as to whether South should make a game try|pg||
nt|stoffers: Only 3 loosers in 4@s NS here, but some work to be done. Cant be beat tough|pg||
nt|psridhar: a strong invitn |pg||
nt|poohbear: It is quite possible North has only 3 @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: my understanding of these proceedings is comparable to my understanding of Italian...|pg||
nt|jbgood: Cero|pg||
nt|flash: hi, Ralf|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We can all see that the cards on our screen do not match the hand they are playing|pg||
nt|jbgood: as Flash says: the board displayed is, indeed, Board 1 - it matches the auction which was displayed last time; as Roland indicated, this auction goes with another board...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they are playing board 2 or 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same problem in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: So Roland, we just wait and see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 has been redealt, that's why|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not inclined to go into detail|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: South kow s 1 he has only 2 defensive tricks 2  he cannot be expensive in 6 @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: even thing of redoubling !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Thinks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
nt|deltadash: obviously it's PUSH time|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - good morning from Copenhagen|pg||
nt|tokay1975: they may land in 5h  making  still|pg||
nt|tomi2: this auction can not be non forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: Helness-Helgemo in 3Nt - @s3 lead|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not sure I understand why you must get to game with 12-11 both balanced|pg||
nt|tomi2: opener+opener = game, once north has opened 1@C he has to live with the consequences|pg||
nt|othered1: Convention card says 2@C is GF, balanced or @C  support|pg||
nt|tomi2: either +400 or -nx50|pg||
nt|Walddk3: At least they have right-sided notrump |pg||
nt|Walddk3: But it may not be enough|pg||
nt|april7: S must steal a @D trick if @S are led|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The trouble is that these guys have played before|pg||
nt|othered1: How many partnerships that open junk have adjusted their response structure accordingly?  I haven't seen many, they just pay off to occasional overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not fair, really|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@s the weakest bid, and pass shows somthing i guess|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends on agreement|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an easy lead for Duboin|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but in the other room i expect the same to happen|pg||
nt|tomi2: bidding by bocchi somehow suggests 3145, so south might think of 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: It looks like Allegra has somthing to work with|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told that breaking news about this match is on  www.bridgetopcis.com |pg||
nt|flash: i haven't had a chance to look, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 down; even Fantoni can play this fast :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes! well done by both sides up to this moment. Still E needed to avoid the diamond lead which was easy enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either @DA is onside or it's not|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: end play in  @d Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 5@C is just dead|pg||
nt|pelu: some play : pass the weak option|pg||
nt|stoffers: looks like im right :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: well bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: now upto Bocchi to make it|pg||
nt|poohbear: best defense is to force dummy with @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense is to play @H every time |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|poohbear: If they do that declarer should play to set up @ds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: This really isn't a good display of their system|pg||
nt|poohbear: before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|stoffers: helgemo's double of 3@h gave them a chanse to investigate more, but he really had to do it didnt he?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW play 5443 with a 15-17 NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: One goes away on a spade, so not sure which endplay|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
nt|april7: why must N open?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Give Bocchi @SA instead of KJ and slam would have made. Goes to show how the 4321 scale is flawed. A = 4, KJ = 4|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction - even if it gives away a trump trick, it usually comes back |pg||
nt|lestergold: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW 5cM. 4cD, 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa has those nice clubs in dummy he has no way of enjoying|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown's Law:  the lower the level of the doubled partial, the faster the trump lead...   :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East had really better take his heart ruff while he can |pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may well diagnose the bad breaks now|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Barry - why do u have a croatian flag?|pg||
nt|poohbear: why not?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S 5, 1@H 4, 1@D 4, 1@C 3 (only with 4333), otherwise also 4+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is Norwegian Standard I believe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right stoffers?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bocchi also has the option of double finesse in dia|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR @H lead - and @CQ sj make life easy for decl|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Losing 2 diamonds when the ace is off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi, sorry I'm late|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: Hi|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @d  ace is obviously off side considering East final double|pg||
nt|poohbear: lacks entries for the dbl finesse|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|tomi2: because he has an opener|pg||
nt|april7: to many losers|pg||
nt|pelu: by system they open 11+, so..|pg||
nt|april7: then N must open!:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 11 with a 5 card suit headed by an honoer and intermediates, no point in the doubleton|pg||
nt|pelu: sometimes u end up in bad games - and just get a flat board - u opp are also in game :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: Yes, Roland, but now many is playing BOA's transfers after 1@c opening and 5c majors|pg||
nt|stoffers: BOA= Baard Olav Aasan, great system|pg||
nt|psridhar: one trump entry and one club ruff entry if he is keen on dia dbl fin|pg||
nt|stoffers: best defence so far|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR easy ride: @cQ to K, @SK to A and @S back?|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can make by giving up a dia too|pg||
nt|pelu: @S6 can be high! :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: Geir needs to duck the spade now if played, then another @h when he takes the next|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer will play @ds first I suspect|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 tricks for Nunes!|pg||
nt|poohbear: He is thinking about what to do if @ds 4-1|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|flash: www.bridgetopics.com   looked like a typo|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio played always strong club - now they chenged the system, seeing the open of 1@C by Failla|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown was one of the early electees to Canada's Hall of Fame |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ace rather than small would win when S has stiff king, but risk is blocking the suit and having heart entry knocked out before clubs can get untangled|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni found 2 voluntary bids on that N hand ! well reasoned|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|pelu: the slam still need only 1 @c-loser|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lebridgeur: sorry not well waked up forgot ace of @s discard:(|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: but dont forget that 1@D = 14+|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, cant be beat now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|Walddk3: Helgemo just took his 8 top tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blum1956: @dA may be singleton offside (just exchange most of minor suit cards between EW)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sure|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500 which wouldnt have been tragic if n/s could make 3n |pg||
nt|Walddk3: He did not even try to lead a diamond up|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: E trying to save a trick if W has KJxxx of spades, as a club here would endplay him|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tomi2: i would expect 75% of the top 50 pairs in the world to be in 3nt on that one|pg||

nt|ady: lead change   asit might regularly in such a close match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here we go|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Sabine :) i think, instead, will be a great match (also if after dinner) :)|pg||
nt|april7: but perhaps if S should open in 3d|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry, you can't divide 50 by 4 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: quiet partial to start|pg||
nt|kit: South has strength for 1NT overcall, but with that flat hand there is danger of going for a number if West has the balance of strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 was a 7-IMP swing to Allegra as we see on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Straightforward 3NT to bid - anything but straightforward to play|pg||
nt|stoffers: if the hand went like that it was one off in the ending..but guess it didnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: E-W don't have a weak 2-bid in the Majors available|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 20-20 again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but this time E really DOES have an opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final the score is  Angelini 144 - 83 Varese|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|kit: Still, if he passes he will just be guessing later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C apparently for majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@C no doubt promises both majors|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  some sort of stayman?|pg||
nt|flash: so we'll have a different auction than in the Closed Room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: east has a better opening than north had last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: all cards favourable for EW on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: soouth has found best lead giving bowt away|pg||
nt|ady: best lead     nothing given|pg||
nt|flash: sorry - Duboin-Sementa E-W in the Open Room|pg||
nt|stewball: best to avoid stayman when the trumps are 5/0|pg||
nt|psridhar: on winning dia queen if Helness played a h, Bocchi wd hv a ruffed a dia winner to draw trumps|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, right|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1NT is the proper call in my opinion. 2@d is asking for trouble|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|blum1956: happy 3NT for NS - will Fantoni-Nunes bid it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morning Jon|pg||

nt|april7: another weak hand which must be opened,but this time there is a slam in @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: OR in 6@S by north|pg||
nt|stoffers: totally agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Angelini has three Norwegians in the team, Helness, Helgemo and Brogeland .... but no longer Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|jcmax: There are two common treatments really when partner has opened 1 of a minor and the opponents overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: no half measures with north|pg||
nt|kit: 3NTjust plain an overbid -- I don't see any reason for it unless more expected from 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|jcmax: 1) always 2 of the same minor shows both majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K9x in @H and K1065 in majors are good cards after the INFORMATION - typical by Bocchi to understand the situation at the table|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks made in OR  playing in one|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2) always 2 of the other minor shows both majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: and 3) always 2 @C shows both majors .)|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told that a protest has been filed concerning the make-up of the Angelini team|pg||
nt|flash: there are 3 Norwegians playing and the rules may limit the number of foreign players to 2|pg||
nt|pelu: o tx - I am commentator|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D can be 22-24 balanced|pg||
nt|stoffers: would you open 1NT also?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unusual, no transfer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am surprised they dont play transfers in that spor|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: EW, with very high requirements for an opening 1-suit, open 1N, 12-14 on some off-shape hands.  5-4 OK, if not both majors, as are at least some 4-4-4-1s.|pg||
nt|poohbear: spot|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps they like the opener to be on lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Easier to remember|pg||
nt|kit: I wonger why West led 9 -- seems like might waste an important spot with little upside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you would have if RHO had opened 1NT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tomi2: 1100?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This is not cheap|pg||
nt|pelu: 1100 is ok against 1430|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1100 yes, so still a gain for Angelini|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shall we guess on -300?|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer does have some real chances here, and he knows pretty much where all the cards are from the bidding which is helpful|pg||
nt|stewball: dont you hate it when your singleton is the 2|pg||
nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|stewball: and the udca crowd chips in...|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N was a transfer to @D, used on many kinds of hands.|pg||
nt|stewball: this is far from obvious|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|othered1: East doesn't have a real handle on where are the high cards, since west has only shown @D length.|pg||
nt|stoffers: 2@d is to play?|pg||
nt|poohbear: usually the opener knows what to lead|pg||
nt|pelu: Fantoni bid 2@D over 1@S - I prefer the 1NT by Bocchi|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: will try for J@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without the overcall at 2@C probably pass by North|pg||
nt|ady: double part score swing to Allegra hand 1  so if they make this  will be off to a great start|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Madala, knowing A in @S in West can play seeing all honors|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmmm, it seems to me that would be a big discrepancy. Pass or 3NT. surely there is also something in between.|pg||
nt|kit: Best for declarer now is probably to lead diamond to jack, then queen of clubs from hand -- if East takes it, declarer has dummy entry for black winners|pg||
nt|ady: was 1@D    1NT passed out in OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Peter! Nice to see you:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|deltadash: sounds right to me :)|pg||
nt|kit: There might not be something in between after the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Staymanish auction may steer helgemo away from the heart lead|pg||
nt|othered1: With the @HK coming down, you can't beat this, anyway.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: didnt|pg||
nt|ady: tht would finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who say you should double a 2NT opener if it goes pass-pass|pg||
nt|ady: passive diamond looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all say that but no-one does|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa wants to retaion all his endplay options here hoping that defenders will be forced to give him his 8th trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: south best tho to continue as he started |pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, it's easy to be brave on paper|pg||
nt|ady: may well be   if he cashes all diamonds and then Q@S and 10@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: best for east to conceal his hand very difficult for defenders this way|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: often after !x - 1NT pd is weak, så they prefer 2@C and 2@D as natural weak bids|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: then @SJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yep, with dummy showing 4@H (I assume puppet), the heart lead is unappetizing|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: we can see that anything bit a diamond now is fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or at least -200|pg||
nt|kit: so far so good -- now queen of clubs|pg||
nt|flash: same contract in the Open Room, but having opened 2@S, Sementa led the @DQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcmax: I was referring to if W had passed 1NT. surely most top pairs have a method then to express a hand that cannot force to game, but may be interested.|pg||
nt|stoffers: i reallyt would like to use stayman...|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Funnily enough E-W never found their heart fit in the other room, because Helgemo had a systemic 1@H opening|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: 8@H ?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he would have been better "cashing" queen of clubs before squandering this exit|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like East has to pitch a club here|pg||
nt|pelu: they use opp suit as stayman|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: well -2 i think is more likely|pg||
nt|kit: yes, 8@H does look like the right play -- surrounding the 7.  Veru unusual card combination|pg||
nt|jcmax: W is in a very awkward position now. Not an easy switch. Everything helps declarer except one card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If anyone can, Helgi can|pg||
nt|jcmax: But Helgemo has incredible imagination at the bridge table. he sees positions, nobody else has even heard of before!|pg||
nt|kit: He should have a pretty good idea about the distribution from East's discards and the line of play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: needs to play king|pg||
nt|jcmax: With the @H J he has chosen to play on the psychological chance of declarer misguessing the @H-layout.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But does he know who has the 10?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He doesn't|pg||
nt|kit: he certainly will find that -- and from long thought about shift, he will deduce where 10 of hearts is|pg||
nt|ady: no    easier seeing all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great hand|pg||
nt|kit: it sure is|pg||
nt|jcmax: There is a good chance that declarer will guess W doesn't have the @H10.  with the @H10 the switch would have come faster.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree with Sabine|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with J10 in @H the return would be faster|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays king  east  return a low diamond?|pg||
nt|kit: the point about the speed of the shift is a good one.  Even at the highest levels, inferences can be drawn from more than just the cards played.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Also with the the JT w might have switched to the 10 instead. or alternatively after the long pause to a low one!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So when you have J10 you should tank before leading the jack when you see the 9 in dummy?|pg||
nt|kit: not for deceptive purposes -- that would be against the rules|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer draws his own inferences at his own risk -- but here he might well get it right|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR: lead @H to 9, and @HK to A|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: not many tricks for the defense - missed game?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Also, simply on restricted choice -- from J10 might have led either|pg||
nt|pelu: hi Ralf - it was a "privat" comment - invitation for a team match :)|pg||
nt|flash: Boye Brogeland is partnering Angelini|pg||
nt|flash: we've mostly seen the 'heavyweights' slugging it out|pg||
nt|pelu: decl can endplay East to give him the 8. trick on @sQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: and then a @D from Comella from the K = easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That @HK is a nice try ... and with @H8 falling, it might just be enough to bring the contract home|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: Semneta hasa  legendary reputation for his card play|pg||
nt|kit: now the expected duck of queen of clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm being told that small @C at trick 2 would have beaten this after @D return.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: not an auspicious start for the trailing team|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu: still only 8 tricks : 2@s+2@h+3@c+1@d|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blum1956: Normally they play Lebensohl in that position/ I wonder whether 3@c from Nunes was positive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we are about the last one in France NOT to open 1 nt with 5 cardsmajors:)|pg||
nt|ady: can end play south for 9th trick|pg||
nt|mr murray: didnt like spades?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: well played East can be squeezed in @c+@h if East take too many tri8cks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Sementa a happy man now although he can still endplay South for the overtrick|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it's without cost|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very tricky position here ... perhaps West can be endplayed|pg||
nt|mr murray: cant understand heart play by w|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: had sementa taken the club and played another club north in would beat contract with heart thru|pg||
nt|Walddk2: jack!|pg||
nt|deltadash: maybe a little bit of nervousness to start |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did not do anything silly|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: I love this hand, it made my evening|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: hence the problem for a double of 2NT passed |pg||

nt|stoffers: These are the kind of boards Angelini wants|pg||
nt|stoffers: 1 impers|pg||

nt|psridhar: 6D can be beaten on stiff cl lead, but a gud slam|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: looks likely for n/s to play 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D multi - possible weaker that 2@H or 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I was referring to ady's comment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree with Sabine|pg||
nt|othered1: Correct analysis:  then you pitch last @C and ruff @D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East was on lead in the CR|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: well this looks a routine 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: still very difficult after opps open 1 NT |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H how?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades, 5 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|kit: That was my conclusion also -- that would have made after king of hearts play|pg||
nt|april7: the 12th  trick is missing |pg||
nt|flash: Duboin-Sementa are on their way to slam|pg||
nt|pfbr: @H@H@H! Happy Birthday Roland @H@H@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and led a heart|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Maybe an upgraded 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Safe to win and take a @s finess|pg||
nt|ady: return low diamond   then duck Q@C|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR N could bid 2@D forcing, I exp that 2@D is not forcing for Bocchi - but 2@C ? transfer to @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @c for majors  NS make 3 @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile this looks like a coffee brek hand|pg||
nt|pelu: Helgemo in 6@s|pg||
nt|stoffers: guess it showes @d's yes :)|pg||
nt|pelu: then 2@D would be @Hs - and so on :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: im surprised helness didnt bid 2@s, not enough hcp?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni still thinking (5 mins now) on that heart lead|pg||
nt|pelu: still in trick 1 in OR - @H lead and decl try to find a plan if its a singleton|pg||
nt|psridhar: on a spade lead here Bocchi will land the slam easily |pg||
mb|3H|nt|deltadash: all roads lead to at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: i could use some help with this sequence - both Easts followed the Xfer with a 3@S call...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like a relay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a trial instead of 3nt |pg||
nt|flash: from the explanation of the 4@C call which followed in the Open Room, it appears to ask about @H length and show at least a slam try|pg||
nt|flash: this would allow West to rebid 3NT with a doubleton @H|pg||
nt|othered1: A somewhat light opening by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: certainly not likkely to produce the excitement of the last hand|pg||
nt|pelu: a Roland-slam - make on @C-finess + @HA in East|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like if you can get a couple of @C ruffs it's there and that may depend on opening lead.|pg||
nt|april7: I dout that he will make if defence doesn't slip|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The difference is that 3nt is an alternative to 4@h (2- or 3-card suppport) and 3@s will ask for more information|pg||
nt|flash: for those not playing these methods, East might have to rebid 4@D to show the pattern and go past 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and this is the negative answer in my opinion|pg||
nt|pelu: why not a cue in 4@C?|pg||
nt|vincenzo1: 3@S is like a transfer for 3NT (I think that 3NT from Fulvio shows 4 Spades)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Peter. do you see the bidding like me?|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|pelu: yes Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Ed|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Vincenzo...    there's only so much we can get from the convention cards and notes   :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: dbl by Failla can bid a very strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: Funny how often low from KQ9xx is right rather than a top one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: Could the light opening be a consequence of what happened on the previous board?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you will be endplayed a second later|pg||
nt|kit: right Roland|pg||
nt|ady: what does declarer do?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or @HQ in East ... but in true Roland style, East has both, so no misguess is possible|pg||
nt|pelu: the Roland-rule : if makes = a god slam :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: lucky slam 2-2 cards right|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure lucky - but still easy make :)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS also in 3NT in OR - as expected|pg||
nt|othered1: What was the lead?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pelu: wow - missing the @C cue??|pg||
nt|flash: so 4@H shows at least 3-card support, but, as our commentators have suggested seems not to do justice to the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy to play on a heart lead too when you see all cards, but it's not easy at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Kit|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead vand ducck first @H from table|pg||

nt|othered1: @DJ, I'm told |pg||
nt|tomi2: btw, connected to this match there is a lot of politiscs going on... Lauria-Versace who had been on the Angelini Team for decades left the team for several reasons. They build up a ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: new team with a French sponsor (Zaleski). So Angelini has hired Hlness-Helgemo and additionaly Brogeland from Norway to play in his team. Now their opps from the semifinal ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: complain, that the contitions of contest allow only 2 foreign players to play in a team. Does anybody have more information...?|pg||

nt|othered1: How good is 6@H?|pg||
nt|stewball: @d @d @s|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, Barry said that|pg||
nt|pelu: It look like|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: even with that favourable lead E may find it hard to come to nine|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S is in my view misguided. hoping to stay low is false economy, because bidding spades may be the MOST likely way to get N excited|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: overboard   2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with 3@H give a hand very strong|pg||
nt|kit: or does dummy get squeezed at a critical juncture?|pg||
nt|flash: for those puzzled by the delays before the bids appear, our operator enters the North and East bids only after East has called|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and it´s also only a @d lead, which can create problems|pg||
mb|4S|nt|blum1956: looks like8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may be a realy bid in this sequence|pg||
nt|othered1: Fact is, on NS cards, t his is a slam that should be bid.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bridge_one: 3@S means a very weak hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent to land on feet after 2S|pg||
nt|kit: very complicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is correct, counting over 5@C|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d from W hand had a chance unlike 5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: relay :)|pg||
nt|april7: ofcourse you mustbe in 6,but unfortunate distribution|pg||
mb|6D|nt|tomi2: reminds me of some football matches back in the 90's that were ruled in favor to the losing team because of 4 non- european players playing... Norway is not an EU member, that ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: might affect the whole thing, since the "Bosman" rules should also applay for Bridge and they are (as far as I know) only for members of the EU|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: with @S break and @H break, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: another good board for 4th highest of longest and strongest|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: agree Geoffrey - a small @h|pg||
nt|ady: I dont think it makes|pg||
nt|flash: so North would have Passed in tempo and East taken time to consider the auction; nothing nefarious afoot|pg||
nt|pelu: exelent for Roland (making) - but I am not so good in calculations - @H3-2 + @S 4-3 and even worse om a @D-lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on a @d lead less than 40% but otherwise more than 50% roughly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: Best chance is to first play on @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: Why did Duboin not overcalled 1@d? It could be useful sometimes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: make 3Nt also with Qxxx xxx Jxx xxx at the partner|pg||
nt|jcmax: thinking is not knowing :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason to pick the heart push thus|pg||
nt|kit: Now whichever hand gets forced, declarer can arrange the entries to draw trumps from the other hand and then run the hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: The play : What can East discard when decl play 3x@S? squeezed in 3 suits!|pg||
nt|pelu: @c9 in S!|pg||
nt|othered1: East gets squeezed without the count on 3 trumps and can't find comfortable discards with south's @C9 being a threat, too|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Exactly what happened at the other table|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: cant cost to play a club to start with and tghen see what happens|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes, that is what I ment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If E had one more D and one less round card, 6C would be on after normal defense|pg||
nt|deltadash: wonder how many years that has been 'the lead'?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next time declarer has AJ opposite 10x and everyone asks: why did he not lead a top heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: pl - can u tell me: what is 2@s?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bocchi might finish playing b4 Fantoni ? :)|pg||
nt|pelu: still in trick 1 in OR|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: controls?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|blum1956: now the diamond discard looked safe|pg||
nt|kit: Might have been right to just bid 3NT after partner bids 2@S, with 8 top tricks, 4-4 spade fit might be worse anyway|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one down surely|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, will always be West hand forced|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, though at that point N had hardly showed a great hand so 2S didnt need to be a dreadful hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h by Failla take the chance to find the slam in @C, so i agree with that bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse strikes who cares|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very little between finessing and going for the drop. 52-48 for the drop, a priori|pg||
nt|roswolf: now if a low heart is found against 3nt in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C can be 18-19 balanced|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: just a part score  n/s|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: easy 4 @s ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did we make a simulation? What works best in the long run from KQxxx and KQxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normal result, the 4-1 trump break dooms 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Matter of style whether or not to overcall on North hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I don't think it will be much of an issue no matter what|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 NT here looks more promising|pg||

nt|ady: this looks like a push hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the lead has been extended by another 4 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is a dangerous board for NS with 4-1 in @s and one ace missing|pg||
nt|pelu: 300+130 = a gameswing|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2hx -4 was possible 1100|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all players are very experienced|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Pass by N a bit surprising|pg||
nt|blum1956: EW just need to discover their spades miscontrol|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this level one expects that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had better not get beyond 4@S here with this trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but they are missing the trump Q so shouldnt bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but 5 is too many|pg||
nt|roswolf: may get to 5@S though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lebridgeur: une bonne défense  à 5 @h ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 4-0 I´m not awake yet (at 17.45!!!)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Come to London my friend, you'll gain an hour|pg||
mb|1N|nt|blum1956: Here the Fantoni-Nunes system works - 2@h instead of 1@h preempts the opponents' spades|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: in 4 @s Imeant against 4 @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South African Texas|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I´ll do Roland!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry, ignore that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this double can help NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the double should sound a warning note|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 4dia is trnsf splinter?  but this  is tooweak |pg||
nt|kit: Normal 2@S contract, rather unlucky to go down|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is really well done by NS in the other room to stop in 2@S. what a disappointment to have to go down!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is takeout of spades. Notmal treatment I would think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 minutes, still no move from Fantoni|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kit: North isn't worth more than a 2@S call I don't think, which KQ of diamonds doubleton|pg||
nt|othered1: Here north eschewed the weak 2, though it's roughly in range|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a low partscore in @H or @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: right   Michael  easier after 1 :h opening  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that Fantoni already showed 14+ when he opened 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: cautios in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2S now by E ?|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is quite possible. I still believe many players would consider bidding more than 3@S. so just bidding 2@S seems good judgment to me.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is sufficient - 6 losers are too much |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: is 2@D forcing here?  Not clear|pg||
nt|ady: hand 19 11 imps to Villa   6NT failing in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like East thinks it is.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by North depending on italian style - |pg||
nt|tokay1975: if that is 10 12 splinter  i thk not easy to stop in 4sp by notrh|pg||
nt|roswolf: that should be finis|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Does N know that this is from 1097!|pg||
nt|othered1: He should, south raised|pg||
nt|pelu: hi sh :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Barnet Shenkin holds the world record. 22 minutes and 35 seconds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To play to a trick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzrr: Welcome All Live From Mumbai (India)|pg||
nt|blum1956: clsim in the first trick - rare occasion|pg||
nt|tokay1975: dbl helped them|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think west made a wrong choice by doubling|pg||
nt|stewball: Nunes must have thot that either S was falsecarding or that they play the same from 982 as 98|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: club lead reasonable -- spade lead would also have been reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Subtract some for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|mr murray: sometimes 2/1 has to be violated when misfit|pg||
nt|pelu: 800 in 3@sX|pg||
nt|april7: in 4@H by N, n must duck first trick if @S is lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: Hard to see West doing anything here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding Qx of hearts makes a 2-level preempt a bit more attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: very safe level!!|pg||
nt|flash: i'll leave you in the good hands/voices of Ed, Peter and Ralf|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: 2@C was gazilli so 3@D showed 18+ with @H and @D|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @c was aither natural or 17+|pg||
nt|blum1956: Besides the EW's 10-card fitthe double of 2@c worked better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As a spectator says, you can make 5, but it is unlikely to happen|pg||
nt|kit: There is danger if East continues clubs -- West may wrongly play a third round, not knowing that East's trumpt tricks are natural|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: *either|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a leadc!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this takes out K@c entry to the second spade trick amongst other things|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D i think isn't forcing (probably they use a kind of roudy (2@C forcing generic)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W clearly though 2D NF|pg||
nt|april7: very expensive 3@S contract|pg||
nt|pelu: 1. D = 3 card @H, 2. X = GF|pg||
nt|othered1: A bit high on two basically flat hands|pg||
pc|d4|nt|blum1956: The unbid suit!|pg||
nt|kit: This seems optimistic -- isn't East expected to have a weak notrump, considering the pass over 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Another example of the flawed 4-3-2-1 scale. A = 4 hcp (contract makes), KJ = also 4 hcp (contract goes down). The ace is seriously underrated in that scale|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now N can |pg||
nt|pelu: his options are - as I see: @H singleton contra @Cs 5-1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: excactly|pg||
nt|jbgood: (sry abaout my spelling)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: scusami, mano 1 3sa per EO |pg||
nt|lestergold: hope east is noth thinking of switching|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It's easy to remember but it does not reflect the true value of the honours|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: West made no such mistake, however|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is worth 16.5 on the KNR|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: if he thought 2D was NF, and EW play support doubles, he may be reading E for a better hand|pg||
nt|ady: poor judgement by west to raise to 3NT after east showed minimum passing the intervention of spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, if that is what P showed|pg||
nt|kit: They have enough stoppers -- just not enough winners.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard 3 @d aon @h and crossruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Duboin would not have ducked that diamond against 5, we will never know|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW did not bid the slam on board 4 in the open room|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe he will escape for 500 only? if i could play like fantoni, I would like to be declarer every board :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: if I would gain IMPS on all boards where i play such ugly 3MX xontracts... ;)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AKQJxx+xxx+KQ+xx|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcmax: Some players might consider bidding 2NT with the N hand. and really. the only realistic game is 3NT. I could make on a good day.|pg||
nt|othered1: As in the previous set, Allegra has jumped out to a lead on the set, closing up the match.|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, but Duboin might have shown both majors if the lead was a singleton|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1D-play Fantoni need to play @C to K - then N can be a sort of endplayed on @CQ - but normal play would be to finess after @cQ|pg||
nt|othered1: How many of the top players are point counters on other than flat NT-type hands?|pg||
nt|othered1: My guess, almost none.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|blum1956: If declarer had won the first trick he could endplay West. But now he is 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kit: North ducked first spade so he had better control of things|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing support doubles and E was not sure about 2D, he could have waffled with a heart preference, having denied them of them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: denied three of them|pg||
nt|kit: If he hadn't declarer might have come home with 2 clubs, 4 diamonds, 2 spades, 1 heart if defense not careful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i need to proofread before i hit send:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: perhaps a misunderstand about 2Nt|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: well but any understanding about 2N would be produced by misunderstandings about Pass and/or 2D i think|pg||
nt|kit: 9 of spades suit-preference, showing club strength rather than heart strength|pg||
nt|pelu: if u have a very good @S-suit and 5 small @Hs u overcall 1@S and not "Michael"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eventually, Fantoni played a spade at trick 2 and landed his slam after ruffing a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So a flat board 6@D was|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: is there a position here where west eventually has to provide Nunes with a helicopter back to his 9th trick?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: but when N did'nt discard a @C East can have some indication of the layout|pg||
nt|pelu: I count before opening a hand - a normal hand in 1. and 2. seat I like 11 and 5 card suot or 12+|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only chance to make from Fantonis position is that N has @dQJ10 and is squeezed |pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: Declarer has to trust this card and play a heartup to get out for down 1.|pg||
nt|pelu: now ruff and play a @h|pg||
nt|pelu: he played @S in trick 2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: 8 tricks even with A@H right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: not like this!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|blum1956: The position ended after Nunes ducked the 1st trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: happens in the best families...|pg||
nt|othered1: now ruff @C and play trumps, but nothing good happens|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and is playing on that chance|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: now he may go down 2|pg||
nt|april7: good play taking the K and now small @C|pg||
nt|tomi2: after the bidding and the @D show out the full layout is clear to Fantoni|pg||
nt|tomi2: south has 5 dias and showed 3 hearts so he had 5 clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Madala has to play a smal @C end then Fantoni in the hot seat|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this was not NS's best defense|pg||
nt|tomi2: then Madala opened the bidding and doubled later, so honors should be kind of located too|pg||
nt|april7: but S could have AQ of @C and feels endplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: Ed where in the defense would u play diff?|pg||
nt|tomi2: then N has not enough points for his double of 2@S, he would simply bid 3@H non invitational|pg||
nt|othered1: I think @H then low @C would have worked, as at that point east didn't have hand double dummy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: here we go|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: North needs to pitch a heart here -- I think he can work that out.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N also clearly convinced E has a better hand|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: strange after the bidding N is favorit to @SK (only 5 HCP in @C and bidding 2-0-1|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: North can assume his partner has either ace of hearts or king of clubs, else declarer has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how a heart pitch could cost whatever the layout.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes and also E would have had a 2N opener|pg||
nt|ady: hand 20  3NT was made in OR for 10 imp swing to Allegra|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is marked with doubleton heart so heart pitch could not cost|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see only a small @c in trick 1 can defense 2 @C-tricks|pg||

nt|pelu: the first 5 boards just what Angeline like - no swings |pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: not absolutely killig but killing in practice|pg||
nt|othered1: You basically need the @D suit or a squeeze if they can't be picked up|pg||
nt|lestergold: sprry 15 top tricks|pg||
nt|blum1956: and the vulnerability  stopped East from preempting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where is the 15th?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he must have hated having to paASS WITH An 8 card suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North show a positive in diamonds and then the @DAKQ|pg||
nt|othered1: @HQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: interresting 3NT from Helness, he figured if partner has @h support there would likely be a spade ruff in that game. |pg||
nt|psridhar: bd6 may well add to that list|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: when i lead tings like that it always gives the contract|pg||
nt|kit: This hand is very dull 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S comes in with trumps behaving|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C is the 15+ balanced type.|pg||
nt|psridhar: good lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stewball: Nunes has a close decision imo|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lebridgeur: Activity from South!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK; so you count @HQ as a top trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not how I learned to count them|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a number of specs have done so|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will of course lead first spade from dummy, in case North has stiff ace or AJx.|pg||
nt|jcmax: hmmmm. is 3N natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: CC does not go that far|pg||
nt|kit: might depend on what 3@D is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seam natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without cue in @H|pg||
nt|kit: if 3@D is natural, 3NT certainly isn't|pg||
nt|othered1: this time|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: That makes 8 tricks easy|pg||
nt|psridhar: Helness may scramble a 6th trick here but i cant see how he can make 1nt|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer will attack @cs by playing the ace and eventually sey up an extra winner there|pg||
nt|stoffers: i guess he can get 5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: i feel a 3n coming ion here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C can be a balanced hand about 20 hcp with others type of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is charmed to hear 2C on his right|pg||
nt|jbgood: you like the spade bid?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 5 can be made on any lead  and defense but not percentage   i thk|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Better to have 3nt on E because a @h lead is rather celar from N|pg||
nt|deltadash: friendly hand here, every suit breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT was limit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: clear...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lebridgeur: I am not keen but greeen against red |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: red cards flying across the table|pg||
nt|deltadash: or well placed :)|pg||
nt|pelu: a!§D-lead could defeat 3@H - in OR @c-lead and a @D loser on @cs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks after this lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did not learn to look at the opponents cards either|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks 500ish.|pg||
nt|stewball: i would not bet against Nunes making 3nt had he bid it|pg||
nt|stewball: the pace reflects the score.....|pg||
nt|othered1: Things, lie relatively well.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: 2NT bal 20:-|pg||
nt|ady: this booked for down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard for N to pass 2C.... :):)|pg||
nt|kit: difficult lead for West|pg||
nt|lestergold: top tricks are what actually cash had @ds not broken there would have been less|pg||
nt|othered1: What was the 2N response?  Looks weird, since it could misposition NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 15 is logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't look at all 4 hands, do you Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i look out of the window like i did at school and got whacked all the time |pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H making in OR in Board 21|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H makable on guessing the @H position and no @D lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: last making spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3NT from S makes probably as East is squeezed for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probability about it 3 rounds of heart a spade swirch then east has to find 4 discards on the clubs and is mullered|pg||
nt|blum1956: But that was not clear for Nunes in the course of bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT might have made on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he can come to 9 tricks in time?|pg||
nt|jcmax: At this vulnerability some players might fancy a 3@H bid with the N hand over 2NT, just for the lead. But that would also depend on whether 2NT was GF or just inv+. it's more ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: dangerous to bid when it is invitaional+.|pg||
nt|kit: I am told that 3@D is natural, 3NT is not -- just shows no single suit|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H looks really aggressive nonvul, to my eyes|pg||
nt|pelu: the winning lead - for declayer|pg||
nt|othered1: Since 1@C isn't very meaningful, it's difficult to charge east's lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: North needs a way to show a diamond suit, and South needs a way to find out how good they are  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Kit, i think 2Nt raise without singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: same bidding to 3@h in OR|pg||
nt|pelu: 5½ :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Very well thought out choice IMO|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 18 was more interesting than many of us thought. In the mid-game with 5 tricks in the bag and a spade came back from Helgemo, Madala could have made it when he won @SA ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (correctly) if he had exited with a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo must get out with a heart to dummy's jack (Helness pitches a low diamond), Now declarer takes a losing diamond finesse and a forced suicide squeeze materialises. Perforce, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo must exit in diamonds and the squuezes Helness in the black suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cute|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Try to go through the play in MOVIE|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after Madala wins @SA|pg||
nt|othered1: This will be 5 to Angelini.|pg||
nt|othered1: not meaningful as to @C holding|pg||
nt|othered1: It was painfully slow when Angelini was ahead by dozens.|pg||
nt|stewball: do they have time clocks in Europe?|pg||
nt|stewball: Madaal is hating the whole thing|pg||
nt|stewball: Madala|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they kick in when it runs slower than 15 minutes a board :)|pg||
nt|stewball: maybe Madala is attemping the sominex coup|pg||
nt|poohbear: might have been better to win the first heart to save an exit card|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@c looked better than 6@s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: suggested 2N was a control-showing response, but that seems odd due to potential positioning on a flatish hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, 2@C-3@c (+ve in @d)-3@D (how good)- some step response to show all three top honours|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: so 11 out, and deservedly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course there are tose who would say that a grand which depends on a 3/2 break should not be bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the results merchants and in thiscase teammates wont be happy|pg||
nt|blum1956: It does not - only 4 diamonds with East |pg||
nt|april7: I don't think that anybody could guess the @H here|pg||
nt|othered1: Try @C now, since east likely can't get in?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|blum1956: too much|pg||
nt|deltadash: Right Roland - won't be easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT denied shortage|pg||
nt|tokay1975: exactly  right  last 2 cards sp and a cl  dummy  rx in clubs. torr cannot protect both|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was really a devastating opening lead from Madala|pg||
nt|jtr: I can only manage that when i am drunk|pg||
nt|jtr: sry|pg||
nt|stewball: pass the Guiness|pg||
nt|stewball: eventually he is going to play @c|pg||
nt|stewball: he just doesnt know it yet|pg||
nt|othered1: Good point from Flash:  Fantoni's 2@S opener showed 9+ - 13; so Madala can't confidently place the @CK  (@DAK could be split either way)|pg||
nt|stewball: so what alternative does he have|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in my system i use 2@H/@S by North to give 5cards with maximum 3 hcp|pg||
nt|blum1956: there is a choice - normally it is better to play 1NT then to defend it. But this vulnerability may be exclusive so Fantoni passed. EW prefere to defend 1@s|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lebridgeur: previous board open room  one @h opening  one @s overcall but 4 @h was the final contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: Good point Sabine -- I think 3@H is the percentage action, and I hope I would have been awake enough at the table to find it.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzrq: our cclub leading  (wcg   1,  Matunga  2,  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club switch now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: But not so easy|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Next time you are S with AK9 of hearts and they lead a low heart, remember to win with the ace and lead back the nine. W ducked here...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: facing this dummy i meant|pg||
nt|kit: But you would never do that, as don't expect West to have led from J10xx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but what do you have to lose? if they are 32 you are still fine|pg||
nt|ady: must take winners now|pg||
nt|ady: at least must take A@S if cashing trump winner|pg||
nt|roswolf: club switch needed i think|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: Nunes getting lots of tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Pulga had switch to a club, the defence would have been a tempo ahead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: W has time to play a @s from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now declarer has time to set up a spade trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 5, Bocchi-Madala also stopped in 4@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lebridgeur: urgent to ruff @s Jack|pg||
nt|othered1: not much if they're going to attack @C . . .|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jbgood: well done|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and play trump if not overruffed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was a very difficult defence, mind you|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|nt|blum1956: not needed this time - 10 tricks always|pg||
nt|kit: But if playing the suit yourself, with AK9 in closed hand opposite 87xxx, lead Ace, and if honor fall on right, continue with 9 and watch LHO sweat.|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - still needs an alert defense to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not all that clear that it wasn't right to set up partner's heart|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lebridgeur: Jack of @h is alright for time being|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: Really time for south to claim.|pg||
nt|stewball: i am told hand records available at http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/|pg||
nt|stewball: testing....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: i don;t like winning the D ace. surely S has the queen, so why give him an entry to dummy in diamonds?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E is discarding after N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lebridgeur: made !!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But Helness has the answer ... a coup en passant|pg||
nt|pelu: @S-lead in OR = close to 6 tricks|pg||
mc|5|nt|marlowepi: right, but it isnt really different when they lead a heart to the queen, you do the same|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: too late|pg||
nt|jbgood: so THAT is why he bid 1 @s:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: neither E nor W saw the danger|pg||

nt|roswolf: another slam hand|pg||

nt|othered1: Missing slam here should be a charge to EW|pg||
nt|april7: I mean to make not to bbe bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming they have the auction to themselves.|pg||
nt|vincenzo: 1@D is 14+ .....for fantunes|pg||
nt|othered1: The rally  continues|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Ed, but still a lot to do|pg||
nt|othered1: Will west overcall?|pg||
nt|poohbear: BTW notice that Bocchi didnt routinely play a @h when in with the @c . he knows he needs to make tricks in other suits to defeat 1NT|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Much better than odds on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as 3-2 in itself is 68%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult for South, in a way. 2NT did not exactly sound like an almost-solid five-card suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes what i meant is against the yardstick for b idding a grand which is higer than 505 requirement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To se how defence should be, N could have playes low on @d10 and watched discard from S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Close to game in notrumps, hearts or diamonds, but I'm not sure if any of them quite fetch|pg||
nt|othered1: 40+ boards gives them enough time, if they can keep this form (and fortune)|pg||
nt|pelu: Helness in "N after @hQ and a small @H to king and A could have meded 2NT - but did'nt read the end-position|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: on   5 that is|pg||
nt|kit: If North passes, should East balance assuming he has a way to show majors?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: How many @s from N? 3?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lebridgeur: teh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@D perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice lie for declarer|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should, but many would disagree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would if my majoprs were reversed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 505|pg||
nt|othered1: POInted out,correctly I think, that best spot is 6N by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i feel a frying pan into the fire possibility here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50%|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt shows heart support?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like a very long pause before bidding here in N - s know thta pd has a difficult bidding problem|pg||
nt|april7: I am willing to bet that EW will bid the slam!If W shows 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N has play even if the @S don't come in|pg||
nt|othered1: I laike the simple auction in the OR|pg||
nt|stewball: prefer 2@h to 2@c|pg||
nt|othered1: But not everyone allows a raise on 3, even HHx.|pg||
nt|stewball: with this hand i insist on it:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I try to, but eventually have to play partner's way, since those that demand 4-cars support are lost without the agreement.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: well someone is headed for it but i dont know whom,|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have splintered|pg||
nt|kit: Another dull hand coming up -- makes up for the exciting 3NT we saw earlier|pg||
nt|ady: nice practical bid in 4th seat|pg||
nt|jcmax: Helness no doubt is a big believer in "bid what you think you can make" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: what difference if majors reversed?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pd will bid my long suit with equal lengths|pg||
nt|kit: if 2@C shows majors, 2@D by partner asks which is longer|pg||
nt|blum1956: now EW may stop short of game|pg||
nt|kit: I like the third seat 4@H opening.  There doesn't figure to be a slam, 4@H is probably the right contract, and it puts pressure on opponents|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall with doubleton in @S|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, 4th seat -- but same principles|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have a good save in 5@D   but could hardly enter at that level|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to find 6@d now|pg||
nt|othered1: How good can the 2@C rebid be?|pg||
nt|stewball: with a bad suit it can be pretty good|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with W. Dbl for me on 2@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: very interesting...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do know now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will attackclubs first I think|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT down on a club lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: they will find the slam after the 14+ opener and the strong jump, I think these hands fits well in their methods|pg||
nt|stewball: but here,thinking is an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile with NS vul your chances of decent score defending 1N are not dismal|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: lost 5 IMP in bidding regained 4 in play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: do you want to be there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|pelu: here that 2@H is not as strong as normal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so?|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe more difficult to find 6@D after a weak NT without interference letting east upgrade @S void|pg||
nt|poohbear: Helgemo didnt overcall with a 6 card major?? He is developing standards!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: not down on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: count again|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N from west actually looks pretty good|pg||
nt|blum1956: Well, not 15 top tricks as on the previous board but 9 I can count|pg||
nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|ady: yes    sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: irony here is 3n is a lot better a contract than 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: but you cannot accuse anyone of mis bidding here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no problem with that is there?  As long as South does not "take advantage"|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right - but extra pressure on S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgebase.com/tools/handviewer.html?s=s76daq7ct&w=sthtdkj86&n=hjd53ck87&e=sq5d94cj9   is the ending I was talking about on 18. South exits with a spade to West who gets ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: out with a heart (East and South both pitching diamonds)|pg||
nt|pelu: and he know that next time - when he get a @C-trick he has to find another suit so this way he had a double-chance (@S or @D)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: 6@h looks easy with 2-2 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North could not afford to duck that diamond, Ralf. Then declarer can abandon the suit and turn his attention to clubs while he is keeping North off lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very interesting|pg||
nt|pelu: and 6@D almost need @H 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: thoroghly disgusting contract yhat will make|pg||
nt|othered1: Other sound opening styles, even if not always 14+, would make east comfortable to make slam tries.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand 5@c|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW weren't quite in tune here.  Wonder where the problem was|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a 5-card @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: looks close|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is too good to give up on defending so double of 2@c seems right|pg||
nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: better spades and a weaker hand for the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|othered1: kOn long run expectations, yes, but 2@H needs to be very unlucky to go minus|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unless E/W take the first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mr murray: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I guess club finesse now, then spade to jack|pg||
nt|ady: now club to the 10 ?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|deltadash: this one is a pretty cut and dried 6H|pg||
nt|othered1: That card by south doesn't figure to be deceiving|pg||
nt|poohbear: Helness will play the 9 of @ss to retain communication|pg||
nt|poohbear: unless he decides to win and shift to @ds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcmax: It may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it does have huge psychological advantages. The opponents never quite know what to expect. it could be anything.|pg||
nt|april7: in 6NT either @D or @S must break|pg||
nt|othered1: This could be very close to a standard auction, so far, though the bids would not have the same meaning (through 4@H)|pg||
nt|april7: without heart lead 13 tricks in NT by force|pg||
nt|psridhar: we can see h fin provides 9th trick, but Madala will try another line?|pg||
nt|pelu: The problem for Helness - @S9 dont defeat 3NT - can PD have Axxx in @D?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: well 4@h went 3 light it appears|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So winning the jack was correct, but ...|pg||
nt|othered1: It looks like not having a strong JS available complicates the auction significantly. |pg||
nt|pelu: as u see on the bidding from OR East was in 3@S before GF here 2@S = GF|pg||
nt|tomi2: is this a "Turbo" sequence? a spec asks and I ask myself too...|pg||
nt|vincenzo: turbo|pg||
nt|tomi2: so 4NT indicates 2 keycards by Fantoni, yes?|pg||
nt|pelu: Fantoni just need @DK OR @cQ by pd for the slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: he doesnt hv the tempo to set up 2 dia tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: First hurdle|pg||
nt|vincenzo: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: he played him for @DAxxx - possible is S has @HK|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats one advantage playing vs top opposition...they r also looking ahead and in trying for their genuine chance may simplify matters |pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: all scores are in now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C  1 or 4|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  they have to cash  first 5 tricks  . but  i thk  they will  after the bidding|pg||
nt|mr murray: yes they will|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, East plays a club back, West cashes @SA to see what ha[[ems|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When North discards, West "sees"|pg||
nt|april7: thats the worst contract if E should pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would expect better clubs with west for this bid, but I use 5NT as pick a slam on such auction, that would have been my bid|pg||
nt|pelu: but 4@S from Sementa over pd 3NT look a little pessimistic|pg||
nt|othered1: I would add the OR's auctions to my samples of 4th suit forcing auctions gone awry.|pg||
nt|april7: e will bid 6@S or 6NT|pg||
nt|pelu: if u play WJS u could bid 3@S over 2@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would have taken Sementas 3@S followed by 4@S as a mild slamtry with good spades, so imo Duboin could bid on with AKAK, I dont know if he had shown that|pg||
nt|othered1: You can *always* find the way around the 4th suit forcing morass, but you wind up doing it in the post-mortem too often.  If these guys can't handle it, it's not playable by us ...|pg||
nt|othered1: lesser mortals.|pg||
nt|pelu: here Fantoni feat that pd is woid in @S and has a very good @C-suit|pg||
nt|vincenzo: credo di no ... 3 picche è solo 6° ... ho giuseppe alle spalle ...|pg||
nt|april7: then he should bid 6NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 6nt he cant ruff neither a spade nor a dia to get his tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: I must admit I would pass 6 clubs If that is strongly encouraging to play and not just an offer (as i mentioned this depends on the other methods you have available)|pg||
nt|vincenzo: network problems ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Fantoni has 3 options: Pass, 6@S and 6NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2 things: first of all I see that 6nt is on on this actual layout because jxx is comming down and Nunes has a spade card, but I try to imagine what I would do in Fantoni's seat ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: without seeing the full layout|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: What system do Sementa-Duboin play? If the 1@h opening is restricted to 15-16 HCP then 2NT was a better rebid. Otherwise it looks not easy to reach 3NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And you have not missed a slam opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He does not have  A A K|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: playing spades first|pg||
nt|kit: this order doesn't feel right to me, but it works okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H sign-off opposite 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 4 you are supposed to raise|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mr murray: uutomatic to play spade ace before club|pg||
pc|d8|nt|deltadash: this would be a BIG 'oops'!!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: e/w here will be very pleased to get a plus   when they might have lost a game swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h a gross contract apparently gross overbidding|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: now decl has to make the right play in @c - almost 50-50|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2) they play with screens, so Bocchi and Fantoni are on the same side of the screen. They will put they bidding cards on the tray and they will be visible at the same time for west ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and south, probably our operator is in the corner and waits until both have bid, so it was not Bocchi thinking so long...|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 IMP on @cQ|pg||
nt|vincenzo: fulvio was thinking|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: The @cQ in the second trick was better|pg||
nt|othered1: Book play will get it right (youi can pick up Q9xx onside) absent other considerations|pg||
pc|s4|nt|blum1956: That's why I prefer Precision or old-fashioned Polish club to the natural system|pg||
nt|lestergold: as I often say to David a bit liem certain club member we both know|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny that a disciplined weak 2D may get you to 3N, since east wouild have strong reason to upgrade KJ|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: defenders will have to conced a heart |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: west opened 1@D in OR   as many would     they still could not find 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Dont agree Roland! I play @cK and if declarer ducks play @cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It makes sense that responder must raise if he has 4. How can partner not be interested in slam opposite 4?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|stewball: 8 imps|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|poohbear: His play is correct. If partner has 4 points the only ones that help is the ace of @ds|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like a good chance to set up the 9. trick in @D - worked fine - and he can take Plan B (@H-finess if @D dont work)|pg||

nt|roswolf: and now some distribution|pg||
nt|deltadash: that was probably the last nail in the coffin|pg||
nt|deltadash: An ACTION hand|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR NS stopped in 3@D after 3@S from S = 5@s+4m or 6@s - 10-13 HCP|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S opening, sorry|pg||
nt|tomi2: on @HQ lead NS might have forced Nunes to ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: could be passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa will be surprised to discover he gauined 5 imps here|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D-2N-3@C (feature) - 3N.  Not tricky at all.|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 1cl 4h?|pg||
nt|roswolf: where do you want to play this -4@H?|pg||
nt|tomi2: then he is down to KJ sec, I think its best then to lead towards dummy because you pik up singleton queen onside|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone understand the NS auction inthe OR?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: only 10 imps exchanged in the first 6 boards - not much really|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jbgood: Nunes considering|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N opened a much worse hand than this already, and vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u play such simple common sense bridge Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Normal weak NT here, though their system allows some funny shapes (like 4-4-41)|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry saw this one wrong, west was playing|pg||
nt|pelu: Thomas - played by West u cant force dummy's @Cs|pg||
nt|tomi2: but Bocchi tried :)|pg||
nt|othered1: and any 5422 but not 54 in M :)|pg||
nt|pelu: so now 39-0 for Allegra - we have a match om|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is for me more like a slam trial in any suit and D is more limited|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nunes went for the endplay in OR, and went one off int that 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: just before you came Kit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can make 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impressed?|pg||

nt|roswolf: you might revoke roland:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: syggest players leave waiting room and re-enter it|pg||

nt|ady: another flat 11 opening by North   may lead to 2NT   probably going down|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not enough   ...for our and your fun|pg||
nt|blum1956: this board also not exciting|pg||
nt|ady: need not to get overboard in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a nightmare hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the old days i might have bid 2@S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zalicytowa³em 4 kier i by³em przygotowany ¿e jak partner zapyta o dame atu to powiem ¿e mam na tego 7 kiera|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A good setup for the Fantunes methods|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3 diamonds great spot|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2nt shows dias?|pg||
nt|tomi2: or any signoff in a minor?|pg||
nt|othered1: Card says "transfer with many kinds of hands|pg||
nt|tomi2: 50% say dias 50% one minor :)|pg||
nt|vincenzo: 2SA maybe week in @c or week in @D or other type of hands|pg||
nt|april7: a save by 5@D over 4 in a M  could be to expensive|pg||
nt|othered1: South is making a call that he thinks will get partner to bid a major (or other specific agreement).   Since they're a good partnership, it shoudn't be an on0the-spot invention.|pg||
nt|vincenzo: if 2 suites he has clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: South knows that the auction at the other table won't be like this.  And I think he must act.|pg||
nt|pelu: and for sure @DK is topplay from Helness - most players would just play @S9 - and sometime see decl take 4@C + 4@H + 1@S|pg||

nt|pelu: so new leader :) by 1imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C is the 15+ balanced variety,  here.  1@H transfer to @S 0-11 pts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Sementa is right to underestimate his hand now by not bidding 4@s immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: his stiff K@c does not look like pulling its weight|pg||
nt|blum1956: But Duboin shows extras|pg||
nt|tomi2: they are a relatively new partnership compared to others on their level|pg||
nt|tomi2: Meckwell have this on page 463 in their system book :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And north takes out the takeout double|pg||
nt|stewball: 2@c must have been 2 suited|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: West might have shoved in a 1@S overcall -- relatively safe, and might do some good.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Free lesson in Polish|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3sp shows 65 but not super just enough  to play a game|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|othered1: But aren't these auctions you should discuss before unleashing one on partner at the table?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why? because E don´t know anything about xxx in @s by W|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: this one is only one loser away from the normal threshold, and N has the suit he is opening, so much better than his first exhibit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 hcp enough for game nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When do the invite, if ever?|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting question is whether North should speculate a double.  I know almost nobody does, but it wouldn't surprise me if it were percentage action.|pg||
nt|jcmax: I was just about to say the same thing, Kit :)|pg||
nt|kit: great minds think alike (sometimes)|pg||
nt|jcmax: It's the kind of action one might choose when one is very much into it or very hungry. Not so likely after dinner.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Helg can make this terrible 3Nt|pg||
nt|pelu: diff system that u need to X with 6-5 in red|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What a treat. Four of Europe's, and the world's, finest players at this table on a Sunday morning|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: lack of decebt spade stop may have prompted south to be conservative|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I  would bid 1@h with East cards   partner is bound to have majors|pg||
nt|tokay1975: he had no better bid probably  when 3dia is limit  with 55 or 65|pg||
nt|othered1: What safe play will Bocchi seek?|pg||
nt|stoffers: 450 here, next|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|deltadash: I could use a few of those Roland, thx :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Which contract do you prefer 4@h or 4@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond force may make declarer feel ubcomfortable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it need start with @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: i@d doubled might have been exciting:)|pg||
nt|othered1: What are the extras?|pg||
nt|blum1956: Ask Duboin|pg||
nt|roswolf: might well just cash the major suit ak's and claim|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcmax: No doubt his best chance would be magic :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: i have a feeling that there isa defence to beat 3@h but probably needs an intitial club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Saturday, sorry, I was ahead of myself|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Getting older :(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But the good news is, Roland, a day less older than you thought!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like the lead is about to double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so far 39-0 in this set........|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: Board 17 might have help prompt his conservatism too|pg||
nt|ady: same contract OR|pg||
nt|tokay1975: to shift  trumps second   trick is better i thk .now declarer just needs 7trump tricks to make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can play A in @S (otherwise KQ good)|pg||
nt|kit: still only 8 tricks I think -- North goes up|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: ducking a spade maybe, but this is real bridge|pg||
nt|tomi2: madala must bid something, every bid could cause confusing, he cant pass because he does not know what bid is agreed as majors, so he picks the one, that wouldbe majors in similar ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: auctions|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: Nuneshipiong to achieve that rarity a ruff with a stiff trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: at end of day its hard in an imp game to stay our of game when you have 23/24/25 ish high card points between you and an 8 card fir|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

nt|bridge_one: @H @h for A and @h - now @d @d @d @D @S|pg||
nt|kit: best declarer can get is 4 diamonds, 2 clubs, and 2 in one of the majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: make Q in @C in the end game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't see it|pg||

nt|othered1: You may stay out of that with a weak NT opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: or as mu dog says: sniff it ... bid it...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The philosophy these days is to leave no possible game unbid..|pg||
nt|kit: yes, they have that nasty habit of counting tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Really, if 2N was forcing, south can pass then cue-bid whatever natural suit was bid, no?|pg||
nt|othered1: In the absence of an agreement|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then partner will not expect such a great hand in case slam will be good, say he has some good fit and aces...|pg||

nt|psridhar: down to 18 now  tight match ahead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jacksond: there are hands where only makeable grand slam is in the 3/3 fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: I also think it is unfair to Moyse that his name is connected to all weird trump fits - the 4-3 fit is actually a fit:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and also some impossible ones as well|pg||
nt|jcmax: An awkward hand to open if one doesn't play a strong club system|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How to bid 7@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|kit: there is a grand, but they will be doing well to get to a small|pg||
nt|ady: I think possibly 6@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: Standard practice is to just open 1@C anyway. Most times one gets another chance. sometimes partner has Qxxxx in spades and out and the bidding stops in 1@C|pg||
nt|kit: particularly since there will be plenty of enemy interference|pg||
nt|othered1: 49-0 is quite a run|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: inevitably|pg||
nt|othered1: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|blum1956: Another test. this time for NS. Will they reach 4@h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its abit like criminal justice- if you are going to make sure you convict allk theguilty ones you will have to convict a few innocent iones|pg||
nt|othered1: south will move over any type of support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent hand for a Bergen raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 5cM|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess there has to be one that's decent|pg||
nt|lestergold: or the converse if you want to make sure you dont convict an innocent one you release many of the guilty ones|pg||
nt|kit: wonder what 3@C shows?|pg||
nt|kit: I am told it shows black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 5+@C / 5+other|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is hard to imagine S would really bypass the @S-suit with his hand. so 2-suiter makes a lot of sense.|pg||
nt|kit: If so, they will easily get to some slam|pg||
nt|jcmax: yes, it would indeed be a scoop for the system!|pg||
nt|kit: but finding the grand looks impossible to me -- but you never know -- maybe 5@D by North, 5@H by South?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if north bid 5@D i bet they find grand slam in @C|pg||
nt|ady: as long as if they bid a grand it is in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: they will certainly bid it in clubs if South has shown black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Definitely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bocchi knows that 7@S can only be right if they have 13 top tricks|pg||

nt|stoffers: might be fireworks here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: 2H or 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrr: the contract is 3nt by north ..bidding differnt as cards were picked in wrong axis|pg||
nt|ady: made 12 tricks in hearts OR     |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|blum1956: the absolutely maximal hand with Fantoni|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT by Sementa  pinpointing distribution for South|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfave vul that is a brave one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bocchi count 12 tricks because can't imagine 6 @S in South|pg||
nt|kit: Leaping to slam without some kind of investigation is almost always wrong IMO, and this hand is no exception|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he was going to slam anyway, why not 5@D en route one could ask|pg||
nt|jcmax: I doubt Bocchi was seriously considering a grand slam. If his partner's distribution were 5521, then small slam would be on the @D finesse, which would rate to be offside on the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: bidding.|pg||
nt|kit: exactly Roland.  6@C won't run away from him.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the void in @H could exist but isn't sufficient - need also K in @D Q in @s without 6 cards in @S|pg||
nt|kit: but why couldn't partner have stiff diamond and Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|kit: the point is that it can't hurt to try|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that sounds all very well. But then when he gets 5@H over 5@D how does he know his partner has 6@S and 5@C and not vice versa? 6@C is a very practical bid.|pg||
nt|kit: If he bids 5@D and follows with 6@C over 5@H, his partner will know there was grand interest since 5@D forced to 6@C if clubs trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A fair slam here, and it looks to be on (just)|pg||
nt|othered1: There are 10 lucky tricks for NS here.|pg||
nt|stoffers: xx?|pg||
nt|stoffers: must be thinking of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 2@S might survive anyway -- not sure|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if 1diamond is hearts  2cl is  obvious bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: op|pg||
nt|blum1956: IThere are some problems in the play thanks to the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|jbgood: a reasonable contract though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: optimism by both EW   should be one down|pg||
nt|lestergold: or foolhardy?|pg||
nt|kit: I'll grant that it is unlikely partner will bid the grand -- but if partner does you will have gained, otherwise you break even|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But very very thin|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C cn be top carded down, on 3-3@D split|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: easy play for decl in OR @D from N to king - and now 8 toptricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Numes down 2 in 3NT: @S to 9 and !Q - and now he played @D to King -@S back to K - 4x@C and then he "endplayed East to led from @HK - but no..:(|pg||
nt|psridhar: on spd lead Bocchi can get short trumped here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: In OR east was able to bid a mere 2N|pg||
nt|mr murray: club ace on always makes even off makes on most layouts|pg||
nt|stoffers: this is close to making, but 1@s and 3 @h loosers yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: well shape is everythimng points count for little by comparison|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: 10-13 unbalanced - yes, 3 NT makes. Spades behave!|pg||
nt|blum1956: In Russia we play 2NT opening for minors|pg||
nt|tokay1975: south  knows  the distrubution of north |pg||
nt|april7: at some point the @H must be opened, might do it now|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer needs to realise early that he must discard the 3rd club on the heart rather than ruffing one|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: interesting choice of lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it seems to me that a trump lead sinks 6@D if the club ace is off |pg||
nt|ralfwil: so many rounds of bidding to reach 4@h.....|pg||
nt|othered1: a few more imps headed to Allegra|pg||
nt|othered1: Rather, an imp or two.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|blum1956: But the defenders may play clubs themselfe so the trump coup is needed|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the trump coup just does not work against best defense|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes as South may discard two hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is likely to get the trumps right here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: clming 4 in 5 seconds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: Declarer properly attacking his side suit first -- he needs to develop diamond tricks in all variations.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nd 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: spec say: why dont N bid 3@C - he know his pd with 3 card @C|pg||
nt|pelu: or 4 card c!|pg||
nt|othered1: so you never bid 1N with 3=3=5=2?|pg||
nt|stoffers: still time for Geir to play @s's|pg||
nt|stoffers: but as soon ahs declearer playes @h's from hand, he has 3 natural trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The winner is 3NT. How on earth do you get there; you don't|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1:  a common consequence of 2-suited bids when you don't buy the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hi|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even a spade lead is dangerous ... declarer could easily lose control as he tries to ruff the clubs good|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lebridgeur: Queen of @c now  and South must discard @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it is all a question of would holds the 10 of @d from North point of wiew   not that clear|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway I cannot find a sensible alternative for North. But Fantoni is better...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West did well to hide his 10 of @h   both red tens are essential for the defense  @s could be right !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Not that easy to see that 10 of @s could do harm to the defense|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: difficult for the team that must win any IMP to play with this kinds of hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, in 2S he can afford to suffer a ruff|pg||
nt|mr murray: still pretty good. Would always want to be there although probably only makes 601/2% of time:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess this is the "game force, balanced" version of 2@C.|pg||
nt|othered1: Then they need the rest of the auction to sort things out|pg||
nt|othered1: No theoretical reason not to take this approach if you have room to bid out your hands.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pelu: call it 40%|pg||
nt|pelu: yes I do but N can exp that pd after 2@D by West max has 4 card @D|pg||
nt|pelu: EW are in Red so 99% sure they have 8-fit|pg||
nt|pelu: DD 3NT is the contract to play! - u can set up the 9. trick in @H:) - no communication to East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your 9th is @SK, Peter|pg||
nt|stoffers: 1@h-1@s-1NT must be the start, but tough to get there even from there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't need a single heart tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: trick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: keep your hands off that @DA, South |pg||
nt|othered1: declarer doesn't know (as we do) that he's safe|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|kit: Lead seems normal -- surely safer than diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see we have almost 1500 specs which is a lot for a weekday early afternoon|pg||
nt|pelu: and down 1 now|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - u are right :(:(:(:(:(|pg||
nt|stoffers: diciplined passes from Helness with his 11 black cards, if Geir had like AKxx@c they might have been cold for 4@s|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: Yes, I think you might struggle to get this slam to even money, but it's a complicated calculation - too hard for me|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes but in closed cards south knows  55 in minors and opener . north may have  rdxxx cl or something more|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to stay out of slam i thk|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I agree ... it's normal for South to bid it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: also 6@D in OR|pg||
nt|mr murray: sure|pg||
nt|mr murray: this calibre players will always get there|pg||
nt|tokay1975: agree|pg||
nt|mr murray: should |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ady: looks to be heading for same result as OR|pg||
nt|pelu: even in the club most players would be in 6@D after 1@D - 1@H - 2@C - 2@S (4.suit) 3@C - Now S know 3-3 and he will just ask for key-cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... the light opening propels South.  Now imagine South is the dealer and opens 1@D ... it's all a lot harder for North, who doesn't know that South has A-AK in the majors to ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cover his losers there|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: Even here, with all the good things that have happened, South needs clubs to divide 4-3, which is only about a 65% cvhance|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: made now I told you that it was a very tricky defensive|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: OK, 6, finessing for @S 10|pg||

nt|jcmax: True Kit. But how does s then Know tha his holding of QJTxxx,-, xx Qxxxx makes a grand. Whereas QJTxxx,-, xx Qxxxxx wouldn't make a slam?|pg||
nt|kit: He couldn't.  But if South held QJ10xx, A, Kx, Qxxxx I'll bet he would know.|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes he has extra chance  against 52 clubs and diamonds in good side|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Correct ... he will still make on some 5-2 club breaks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ady: unlucky 4@H for e/w  if 2 spades are casshed|pg||
nt|othered1: Allegra seems to have slowed down the Angeline onslaught.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this room is 5 boards behind, but as far as I saw this in Italy directors don't rule so ard on time issues. In Germany its more a problem for slow players|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the heart lead might not prove that safe. for example, dummy might have Q9x|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I cannot see any position to have a problem  to play Queen of @h  and South gave the count|pg||
nt|jcmax: I doubt that would be a 3@C bid in their methods.|pg||
nt|ady: its easy from here   but north cannot know of the 6th spade in south hand  with only 10 black cards  even with void heart  or even ace  what about possible diamond loser|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but here u can give -10 IMPs to both teams :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think Nunes-Fantoni are the much slower pair here|pg||
nt|othered1: East preempted in OR, changing the auction considerably|pg||
nt|othered1: And that could affect the play if east stays out here.|pg||
nt|pelu: no problem with 10 tricks for N i 4@S - easy play om all leads|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@C won't be fun to play if it's bid and north sits a double.|pg||
nt|pelu: can Bocchi bid 4@c as splinter?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If he had a count, N misplayed @s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: Who is thinking, north or east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: looks like a strong NT to me|pg||
nt|othered1: EW in the other room have gone for some substantial, undoubled numbers.|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl showing a max?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think they would have gotten there on the actual hand -- all I'm saying is that there is nothing to lose by trying.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D xfert |pg||
nt|othered1: Or both?|pg||
nt|pelu: prob most N|pg||
nt|april7: y, thats a handicap which might come up, pass or bid 5 @S|pg||
nt|stewball: a breather..time for tea|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: spec ask: if w duck the @C? then No need to play @CK to make on cross-ruff - if he play @c10 then down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: with trumps 4-1 very sticky|pg||
nt|ady: seems went down 4 OR|pg||
nt|jcmax: You see I am going to play with Norberto in a few weeks. I have to defend his actions. :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: true Sabine :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: i think this will go off in practice|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10-13 and unbalanced, 5+ spades for Nunes opening|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teach him something, Sabine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Less expensive than 5@h (-990 instead of -1100)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they will get to 4@h here too|pg||
mb|3D|nt|blum1956: only a trump lead and a heart return guarantee the success of the defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: if Nunes disards dims on this which seems natural when east gets in with spade ace its heart heart ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think S will make now. Discard 2 @h and play 3 rounds oof @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: belay that....|pg||
nt|othered1: east might get fatally tapped on continued @S plays for extra undertricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West may be tempted by 5@d now - may think singleton spade with East |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like Villa are starting to fall behind a bit |pg||
nt|othered1: Is that pass forcing?  I don't think it should be.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Duboin cannot bid any more he may doubl;e of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like they did against Newcastle a few weeks ago?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: max and maj|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: difficult decision for west|pg||
nt|othered1: West's double like permits him to correct @C to @D (at a low level) without showing extras.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: better line|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: this results could be well duplicated in open room|pg||
nt|kit: Opening lead could be key here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes and this couold be 500 and a hefty 14 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: But, not surprisingly, west solves it correctly|pg||
nt|ady: nice result for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think south has a 2@H anyway|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes dbl  is to  with max |pg||
nt|kit: And that was the loser|pg||
nt|pelu: a heavy 2@S bid|pg||
nt|othered1: On last h and, note that contract was played by south in the OR and got low @S lead, so declarer didn't face Bocchi's problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not much for the crowd here...let's open the Cinzano or Primitivo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Impossible a swing with this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be these world class operators wont get this defence wrong|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Super result for E/W here ... successfully staying low on a very tempting vulnerable setup|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 toptricks in 3Nt - but @D lead will give the 9, or decl can set up the 9. in @S|pg||
nt|stoffers: wow, 6@h doubled on the previous board in OR..|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Close to a tie after that board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, maybe only 9 IMPs|pg||
nt|pelu: so down to 6 IMP now|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6H has a fundamental flaw, leave alone the bad breaks :)|pg||
nt|pelu: "only" missing 3 keycards :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: gr8 lead |pg||
nt|stoffers: great lead this, might be don now|pg||
nt|stoffers: down even|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry nonvuln only 9IMP|pg||
nt|pelu: killing all communication - even with @S 3-3|pg||
nt|stoffers: so, declearers best line is to take this, then AK@h, then K@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: take in which hand>?|pg||
nt|stoffers: need to take the K|pg||
nt|poohbear: so?|pg||
nt|poohbear: then what|pg||
nt|psridhar: cannot make on this lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: one hand or the other will be entrylless|pg||
nt|stoffers: another spade if ducked, but can only get to 8 i think|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best preformance by Fantoni-Nunes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: declarer can take quick spadepitch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last set of 16 boards tomorrow at 10.00 Central European Time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: actually even my dog would probabbly get it right |pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s may well be a make from Duboin's point of view - for example one trick in each side suit and that's all. Therefore to double that was  not an easy decision|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to show where his values lay|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt made in  board 9 againsta  bad defence|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzrr: bye all|pg||

nt|lestergold: cash 4 in right oprder and ruff|pg||
nt|stewball: Happy Bday to Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks John|pg||
nt|stoffers: @h lead in OR|pg||
nt|psridhar: might well be the lead that decides the match|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: south might well have unblocked the @DK|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: Failla hoping .... against hope|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: might only make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not impossible a priori -- 6N makes without heart lead|pg||
nt|kit: But still uppercut danger|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have no other opening for a 4441 hand within the 12-14 range|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: But west has a pretty good record of making winning decisions|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with the ruff in @S he must play @C - obliged|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mr murray: very heavy but is perfect on layout|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @s switch now will defeat!|pg||
nt|kit: however, then ace of diamond, diamond ruff, heart to king, low heart|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|ady: may still be a trump promotion  |pg||
nt|kit: and this is not double-dummy -- he has full count of hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need try A in @H in west|pg||
nt|ady: should play 4th club after ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Another possibility is to play fourth round of clubs now|pg||
nt|kit: I guess simplest is to play heart now, then ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Duboin led a club in the other room after Fantoni opened 1NT (12-14) and Nunes responded 3@C (5-card Stayman ask)|pg||
nt|kit: Going back toopening lead, West had clue that his partner didn't double the artificial 2@D call, so maybe he should have avoided diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fairness, would anyone double with just @DQ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also small @H now - if A np, else A@D @D ruff and @H again - no way to beat with KQ@H in the dummy|pg||
nt|kit: no, but with QJxx(x) they would|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: not withn Duboing and nthen smell of blood in his nostrils|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW A SORT OF DEFENSIVE CROSSRUFF|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry to shout|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nunes has found the a trump switch by west at that point would have defeated surely|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and also the finesse in @s - so a dream ...|pg||
nt|pelu: if u dont play 2-0-1 GF then 2@D from W and rase 2@S to 3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|kit: since otherwise largely a guess between diamond and spade lead, perhaps the failure to double 2@D should tip the scales|pg||
nt|stewball: they dont seem to be shy with offshape nt openers regardless|pg||

nt|othered1: Bye, Mike!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bye ed leave it in all ur very capable hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least VILLA F are on the scoreboard this set|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer took the straightforward and probably best line|pg||
nt|ady: would you double 2@D with just the queen?|pg||
nt|caruga: invece Agus ha fatto 4 cuori in quella di prima|pg||
nt|jcmax: should E have considered bidding 2@S to make sure he would get the lead?|pg||
nt|kit: no, but with stronger holdings I would double 2@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not a friendly position   of the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: also here a easy game for N/S |pg||
nt|marlowepi: either game will make here|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks seems odd|pg||
nt|stewball: the hands have tamed considerably|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 5 trumps 4 AKs and a heart|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bye|pg||
nt|lestergold: keep the jokes rolling Michael |pg||
nt|blum1956: sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Dbl of 5@H in OR kept them out of the good six.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW seem to have missed their cold slam next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H 11 tricks, next case|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S doesn't get a spade lead necessarily -- support and honor holdings are two different things.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As pointed out, 4@S would be two too high, saving me!|pg||
nt|othered1: Auction in open room looks quite standard.  If long @D promised, maybe a 2@D preference could be considered.|pg||
nt|psridhar: interesting hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: a game try of 41H seems appropriate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S to give the lead is possible in MP, in IMP can be dangerous - i think better to use a convention, like dbl to give the lead @S (and not for @D)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: But NS have a good save in 7m (esp @D)|pg||
nt|othered1: This type of shape is why Bocchi didn't have a clear read on the hand where he double-dummied the @S late.|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 26 i mean|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: same bidding to 2@s in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: heart lead, spade knocked out, another low heart, then W squeezed late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D would show spades|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 6@H doubled with overtrick may gain points|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out that EW in OR had kept themselves out of slam, then were doubled|pg||
nt|blum1956: Will Sementa figure out that his partner has just one side card, not two&|pg||
nt|othered1: In an auction with both sides bidding up with double fits, just buying the contract may be enough to win the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting here that North has stayed out of this auction. |pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR the double NS fit was known.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Perhaps he has no descriptive action - not that anything seems particularly obvious |pg||
nt|othered1: 1@c presumably with the intent of rebidding 1N to show a generic balanced 15+ hand?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: I assume|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl would show 4 or 5 @ss|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Where is that button?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D was transfer to @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: yes   correct|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S running diamonds before spades so as to end in dummy|pg||
nt|blum1956: will Nunes remove this?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that's really an interesting point. When it looks like your opponents are going to outbid I don't think it makes much sense to support partner just for the sake of supporting ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: him. I prefer when it conveys a message. |pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S in OR = 8-10 HCP and 3 card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The most unusual aspect of the Fantunes system is that they have no weak 2's available, unless you think 10-13 is weak. I think the rest of us have some kind of weak 2 on our card, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: either a natural 2x or a Multi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi is not a naughty word in Europe|pg||
mb|r|nt|jbgood: Fantoni warned off from further action with his decent hand|pg||
nt|ady: 1st round west overcalled 1@H in OR   north doubled   |pg||
nt|othered1: What was 2N?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2 keycards and a void - they should have a special bid for that case|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some kind of relay you would think|pg||
nt|othered1: I doubt 2N was natural. Other than that I've had suggestions of various hands, from cue-bid to, asks other suit, to shows @H fit.  Maybe 2@D means something other than simple ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Michaels?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2 key cards and a void could still have 2 minor losers of course|pg||
nt|othered1: Does 3@H look aggressive given his @H bad position?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|blum1956: Is the 1@h 3rd in hand also strong by their system?|pg||
nt|ady: cashes the diamonds before completing the spades |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: another  4@s made  |pg||
nt|othered1: It's suggested they play Ghestem and that 2@D is specific to majors.|pg||
nt|deltadash: who's got the button???? lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's state that the blind lead is difficult. Or as Jan Wohlin, Swedish top player and author wrote in one of his books: "Don't ever lead, it's too difficult!"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm struggling to find a defence to beat 4@H ... is there one?|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: please tell|pg||
nt|bjacobs: lots of suggestions coming my way!|pg||
nt|pelu: try @H A and @H = only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I think there is a winner in them ... the low spade lead from North|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: good sacrifice in @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me- yes! this 5-card @h are bad honours|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Helgemo forced to bid 2@H. Pass would suggest defending|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: I'm surprised that, holding KQx hearts and 4-3-3-3 that North bothered looking for 4-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: will north duck the first @H?|pg||
nt|stewball: wrong guess but it wont cost|pg||
nt|stoffers: Fantoni had a great declearers play in 3NT in OR, and the nice club lead earned Angelini a nice swing on board 26|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: no - but may be|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: both   ruff @d :):)|pg||
nt|blum1956: It was a difficult task for Nunes. His hand is worst possible from the defensive point of view but he knows few about partner's hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one spec  points that 4 @s  goes down on the " obvious" @s lead he is right on principle|pg||
nt|blum1956: But in this vulnerability he probably loses only 200 if 5@h proves to be wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 2@D is majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then he can get in, cross to partner's @CQ and take two more spades|pg||
nt|pelu: i count - but pl corect me : now 5@Hs + 3@D + 1@S|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry S has to follow 4 times in @D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: yes one way or another should have been able to bid 3N with finality, |pg||
nt|kit: Seems to me much more likely that both contracts will take 9 tricks than that 10 in spades and only 8 in notrump.|pg||
nt|pelu: after a @C-lead to A @H to A and @D 9 to J in N|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think there is almost no such thing as a truly "blind" lead -- there are always some clues|pg||
nt|jcmax: Andy robson once told me that all his partner's were brilliant opening leaders. Now you maybe can work out why :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@s still denies 4|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would think it would be more unbalanced though|pg||
nt|poohbear: Unless 2NT would be takeout. |pg||
nt|psridhar: with cl 4-4 and dia and spd fin in, 3nt can roll|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: isn´t there a small danger to have a 4-card major as side suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Tricky isn't it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but will make|pg||
nt|othered1: another @Cneeded now or east may get endplayed in trumps later|pg||
nt|pelu: down 5 but no X :)|pg||
nt|othered1: rather,w with trumps for @C lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am surprised Bocchi chose 2NT and not 3@d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: I surrender :(:(:(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, we won't see the play in that tantalizing 4@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: South was fortunate to get heart lead if he was going to misguess clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: 5@H doubled  then losing points|pg||
nt|blum1956: If 4NT is RKCB then it was enough to show 2 keycards with @hQ (which Duboin surely has)|pg||
nt|othered1: Must south overtake to beat this?|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess n ot|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while.  Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: nt so sure  South was right to pass  with  KQJ  in @h opposite a 6 or 7 cards suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: these high level desicions are impossible to get right all the time|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|stewball: @s coming|pg||
nt|othered1: north may wind up with quite a few tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: Could the small heart and the trump switch help ?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|stewball: or4 not|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|ady: no squeeze now|pg||
nt|stewball: playing Nunes for trump KQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: if E holds his giant hearts|pg||
nt|ady: got heart lead in OR   also miss guessed the club|pg||
nt|kit: West afraid declarermight be sneaking a diamond through from KQJ, and tht his partner has natural trump trick|pg||
nt|kit: He is trying to see if ducking the diamond and letting partner lead a club can do any good|pg||
nt|jcmax: Guys, my son has 5 friends visiting who just decided they want to stay overnight. I need to get some order in the chaos. sorry about that. I hope you all enjoy the rest of the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: show. good night all!|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will conclude that it won't be of value -- if declarer has only 3 spades the contract won't be making anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good night Sabine and thanks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hope you've got a big garden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, priv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last segment today. Four more tomorrow and the last set Sunday morning local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Four other nations offer broadcasts over the wekend: England, France, Japan and India, so plenty to choose from|pg||
nt|kit: is he still thinking operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For vugraph schedule, please go to  http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may operator is sleeping ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|kit: surprising to see him having this much difficulty -- the logic appear straightforward.  If declarer has 3 spades and not solid diamonds, the contract isn't making, so might as well ...|pg||
nt|kit: go up ace.  Unless I'm missing something.|pg||
nt|kit: Can anybody find a layout where ducking can gain (from West's point of view)?|pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like 8 easy tricks. I doubt Bocchi takes a @s finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: in 3NT - making in OR - in the endposition Duboin had @cQ (Helgemo unblocked here) and was endplayed to open @Ds) if unblocked also down in OR|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|bjacobs: It looks hopeless, but note, he has only 2 losers ... perhaps he can afford to lose 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|mr murray: doesn't matter what he does he will make it|pg||
nt|mr murray: cards very friendly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm pretty sure that's an inaccurate statement!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He can't simply play clubs from dummy, because East can get a club ruff|pg||
nt|stoffers: Helness not supporting @hs? Maybe he misread his hand..|pg||
pc|c8|nt|blum1956: Did Garbosi forget their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am told 2 @h is two way  weak support in @s or stong with @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only 10imps difference with 36 boards to go   but this one could be bad for Garbosi|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the 4@s bid should of course imply the weak spade support hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead beats 5@s, other leads probably do not|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like that weak nt is back|pg||
nt|mr murray: heart to hand and club up|pg||
nt|othered1: We;re only guessing at development at this point (convention cards go only so far) but it looks like west may have shown shape and more than a minimum (0)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: transfer seems like it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: let us see |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1500 kibs watching this match here on BBO - quite a crowd!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @d attracting  on the bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: If North leads a heart the declarer wins and plays on diamonds. If the defense plays trumps twice the diamond suit works otherwise two hearts may be ruffed|pg||
nt|othered1: over 3@C, south's hand does look defensive and there's nothing certain about any offensive action|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the key will be to discard the blocking club on a trump at some stage|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means support in @H limit or + - i agree 4@S can be too much|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should just bid 3@S -- his partner will have better idea whether or not 4@H is making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: And opponents haven't bid to 4@H yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: !|pg||
nt|psridhar: an opportunity for Allegra here -tough to find the dia ruff in 4H|pg||
nt|poohbear: couldnt he be 4-5 in the reds?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S has "Limit + " chances of 4S goading N into 5H are greatly reduced|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well done    no declarer task very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead triumph|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @s and @c  should easier now|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might have been a little more enterprising -he might have doubled 2nt to show values in the minors - but he no doubt is deflated by the poor run of boards|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer doesn't have 9 top tricks here.  |pg||
nt|kit: I think he goes up ace of hearts and attacks clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tempting to let it ride but they lead 3rd from any holding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@H and @C|pg||
nt|stoffers: Geir is always 5+-4+ here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: asking for 5crd majors, or a possible 4441|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|blum1956: Even the trump is OK |pg||
nt|ady: should make this for a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He was tempted|pg||
nt|kit: Why did he finesse?  Now if queen of diamonds is off, diamond shift defeats him.|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure we will have a swing here - IN OR EW in 4@sX|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch wasnt the low heart a clear signal for a club?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: 3@S is then a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now he is in BIG trouble, because he can't play clubs twice from his hand|pg||
nt|mr murray: timing bad|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: NS convention card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: hmm this may work as well but i like to show partnership solidarity|pg||
nt|bridge_one: have the chance to make the @H trick - else can make 9 tricks finding one trick in @D or @s|pg||
nt|kit: the heart finesse winning doesn't help him particularly, but it can hurt when it loses|pg||
nt|ady: agreed    top heart and club is safe|pg||
nt|kit: I can't think of any layout where taking heart finesse at trick 1 is superior|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however agree to play A in @H at first trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But can't you be short of entries for the clubs if you win @HA?|pg||
nt|april7: now discarding the @C on @D and gussing the J of M and +1 or -1 imp|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no@c10?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|pelu: they open on 4 card @H - but I dont exp 4-5 - here Helness wont to stop fast - so pass :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stoffers: Helness pass is based on his weak holdings i guess, he doesnt want to get to high (some invitational bid form Geir)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes but  will take longer|pg||
nt|kit: He still wouldn't be cold -- West could win club and lead another heart, and dummy might be short an entry -- but  if that happens can take heart finesse then.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mr murray: he should have had another heart in dummy to lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To be honest, I still don't see how the hand could be made, even though GIB says it could have been|pg||
nt|pelu: but even af @h to J, @C to J @H to hand - 2XH and now a @C rgen A@D will kill him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what I figured as well Peter, so we are going to have to excuse Madala for going down ... if we cannot make it seeing all four hands, it must be a difficult one|pg||
nt|mr murray: if he had had a nother heart in dummy he couuld oplay it and a club towards dumy and claim|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blum1956: heart signal probably|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only @h will do|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: this is a rather lucky game but it should be a pushed board.now maybe more @C|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR played from W - @C-lead to K and @s from s - now decl "only" need to find @Hq|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a great game NV  . Needs a @h finesse and no @d ruff|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Not really, West wins @CA and punches him with a diamond|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mr murray: needed not to play second heart so soon|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: yes, but J10 in @h are sufficient to wait one time|pg||

nt|bjacobs: He worked it out for us on Board 18 ...|pg||
nt|april7: so it was still a guess at the end|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 24 hcp 3NT that wont work this time|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: at those colors 1S covers a wide range, and you want pd to keep doing it. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3nT ALSO HERE|pg||

mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Here you have the 5422 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have no other opening for that hand when 12-14|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Los club led by Helness against 3NT but there was time to recover|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *Low|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West prevented them :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: me too|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure he in London a the british tournament :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm, no excuse|pg||
nt|pelu: a very good slam - act on the  doublefiness in @s - but if @Cs 2-2 close to a safeplay on a non-@s-lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of tricks in NT if @H block|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni has a little of both|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you like 1nt on this hand Roland? I don´t|pg||
nt|deltadash: me 3|pg||
mb|4D|nt|blum1956: anyway EW must finish in 4@s (maybe doubled) and will need the trump guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: ongoing debate whether to ocall or dbl with that S hand|pg||
nt|stewball: in the old days dbl was auto|pg||
nt|stoffers: strong and positive here, guess Tor will support @d's|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: It's systemic, so I can't really comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H = transfer?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but they must find their 3nt with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like possible swing, as 4@S certainly has a lot of play.|pg||
nt|stewball: but now with resp/comp dbls many overcall|pg||
nt|stewball: with a J high suit i'm a dbler|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know what west's double implies here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: easy 6D now|pg||
nt|pelu: only problem sh be to stop in 6@D |pg||
nt|stoffers: 4nt and 5nt from Tor now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Helness needs to diagnose whether partner has the @h king or a 4th @c for the grand|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4NT-5@d-5NT-6@c-6@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|pelu: if playede from N - in OR played in S - so @c 2-2 u can eliminate the red suits before playing @SJ|pg||
nt|stoffers: but, 4@h should be the king, so Tor might bid 7...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like you need to guess which heart to play from the West hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cards, wish to compete|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: west regretting response on poor hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D would not have been natural|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h might be RKCB. and 4NT 1 or 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Personally I would lead a heart -- safer, and if spades is right should be time to shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: well np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pinning the stiff 8 would certainly be great|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, I can't answer everyone ... anyway, no point talking to me - I don't know how to make that last hand|pg||
mb|5N|nt|kit: Can't you just take a couple of diamond ruffs, coming to 5 trumps, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 1 diamond -- unless trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: easy game, isn't it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes:)|pg||
nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4@h is cuebid..|pg||

mb|6C|nt|marlowepi: yes spade is big commitment|pg||
nt|ady: surprices east did not try the jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: and another 12 Imps swing|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe on club lead the entries are short for that|pg||
nt|ady: deceptive heartlead maybe  |pg||
nt|kit: But still, setting up fifth heart is enough -- 4 spades, 2 clubs, 1 diamond, 3 hearts.  Even 4-1 split doesn't matter.|pg||
nt|kit: So, on 3-2 spade split can just draw trumps and claim basically|pg||
nt|stoffers: last train prhaps?|pg||
mb|7D|nt|blum1956: well 100 is close to what EW deserve|pg||

nt|pelu: Hi Ed what is 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: even if it holds   still 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kit: yes, jack of spades seems like normal play unless he is convinced South would always lead high from KQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Even on 4-1 spade split, 3-2 hearts is good enough|pg||
nt|othered1: Can anyone translate this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|0  bamba: @s now|pg||
nt|kit: will then have 4 hearts, 3 spades, 2 clubs, 1 diamond|pg||

nt|pelu: no need for desperation - only ½way in match|pg||
nt|april7: instead of Q of @H K of @D and all is well:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is transfer to @C.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my system I can show a solid @c by bidding 3@c after - probably - a 2@c opening. So 6@c is rather easy after that|pg||
nt|psridhar: this can tighten the match again|pg||

nt|stoffers: or not :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: should not make this|pg||

nt|othered1: 22-24 2@D|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H shortness|pg||

nt|mdgraham: people open and respond on such light hands these days that you need 1NT "sandwich" as strong balanced - but whether a flat 15-count is worth it is debatable|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 2@S if allowed to play    small loss|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@c minors, x takeout|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: sry folks, have to leave you. Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: he has a good hand - 5-card suit, controls|pg||
nt|psridhar: Helness has got his H suit in now|pg||
nt|stoffers: might get to 4@s now?|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob not|pg||
nt|stoffers: I would rather bid 3@h than double on Tor's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S will call slam|pg||
nt|ady: only nade 11 tricks OR     must has miss guessed hearts|pg||
nt|mr murray: heart 10 a mirage|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@Dis a nice spot|pg||
nt|psridhar: Helgemo may try 3H|pg||
nt|poohbear: Now come 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: grom Helness|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: If that happens, can swith to ruffing 2 diamonds, with ace of clubs still entry|pg||
nt|stoffers: or 3@d even|pg||
nt|poohbear: from|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: 3 @c and 3! aces for defence look avaialble here|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 nt will not make ¨- neither would 2 @c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then West has no more diamonds, and you can win @SA, draw trumps and claim|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: 1@H shows @S|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@H retransfer?|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4@d= you pick game|pg||
nt|stoffers: with 1HCP :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is going towards 5D X for 300 to EW my guess|pg||
mb|4N|mb|d|nt|blum1956: 4@s is better than 3@c|pg||
nt|stewball: 2@c must be artificial|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, either natural or 16+|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: 2H response would sometimes work out well by protecting club holding (or in other ways), but usually right to show 4-card support immediately|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not a  bad contract but   @s far behaving|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|blum1956: try crossruff - trump coup may probably work in the ending. But Nunes is not aware of the trump position|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   may go down   but not 3 down    £@S   should be fown  so another pick up for Villa|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best lead....|pg||
nt|roswolf: this bidding looks odd as many transfer responses are|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would expect north to play nt a vast majority of the time|pg||
nt|stoffers: 5@dx and -300 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: entrys to hand may be awkward|pg||
nt|roswolf: will be awkward|pg||
nt|deltadash: the entire hand looks awkward to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: setting up the spade suit seems to appeal to many specs - i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: not a lot of defense in the East hand therefore not suitable for trupping|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well done to "Private" who provided the winning solution|pg||
nt|othered1: What has north done that gives south something to think about?|pg||
nt|stewball: Madala in his prepass huddle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NT is wrong-sided, Helgemo wisely went for diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 defensive tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|stewball: I dont think 3nt is an obvious bid on either auction|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: A heart lead is safer on this hand but i understand west's reluctance to lead it|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer seems to agree too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that Helgemo did not think 3NT was in jeopardy, he was looking for a diamond slam. Samme applies here I suspect|pg||
nt|stewball: agreed|pg||
nt|poohbear: You PICK no YOU pick NO you pick !|pg||
nt|pelu: against 4@h with no play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: The play is rather clear, play on @d and @h. Otherwise you will lose 2@s 1 @h, 1@c and 1@c|pg||
nt|othered1: Specs -- they're not playing control-showing responses to 1@C.|pg||
nt|poohbear: why does 4@h have no play?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Interesting board 13 in the other room. I'd like to know why Helgemo dropped the stiff @SK offside in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Dubion in OR   finessed 2nd round of hearts  |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: operator ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: he hears you|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bocchi has shown the same as Helness did with his 2@H reverse|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4@h had no play? |pg||
nt|stoffers: im so slow...|pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like 1o from here |pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H wd hv made|pg||
nt|psridhar: getting there was the challenege|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Table feel I suppose|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South was afraid about to play slam knowing North without singleton and limited strength|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was just a detour so to speak|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Against the odds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|blum1956: 3@d makes with a diamond guess only|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: now 3@S sjould amke|pg||
nt|ady: should make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: speculative lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: ok - would make :( prob - @C-ruff as entry to play @S|pg||
nt|pelu: and set up the 5.@s|pg||
nt|stoffers: 6@d in OR on 29, 16 imps to Allegra and an exiting finnish coming up!|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bocchi judged well to reach 5D here , instead of Doubling 4H|pg||
nt|psridhar: not so gud if this ends 500 to EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: quite a treat this exciting match|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont see how this is going for 500 if declarer sets up @cs|pg||
nt|stoffers: Yes, quite a treat. These guys have all played better bridge, and it is good to see they are made of flesh and blood and can do a mistake! The ting is they make fewer than most...:)...|pg||
nt|poohbear: What suit is the defense using to tap declarer? If they use @ss twice the J sets up in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: oh I see. Declarer gets uppercut|pg||
nt|pelu: Fantoni also in 5@D - but no X????????????|pg||
nt|stoffers: For me it looks like -3 if Tor playes @s every time he is on lead yes|pg||
nt|stoffers: Guess Sementa in OR ment his pass as forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: so 5-8 IMP for Angenlini|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: Well if Helgemo doesn't dbl with his massive defensive hand perhaps it would go all pass here as well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|blum1956: but the trupping pass further passed around would have turned minus to plus|pg||
nt|othered1: specs see more of a problem than I do here.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: when they dont cover they dont have it (Zia)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kit: hard to see how diamond underlead can gain -- maybe if partner then underleads ace of hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: Where would it have cost to play a round of trumps first? |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: But no-one would cover when declarer has shown 7 cards|pg||
nt|blum1956: so one more push|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and @d now|pg||
nt|roswolf: might chuck the @DK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes @dK|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|psridhar: Angelini will be +10 Imps with 2 bds to go at end of this bd|pg||

mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: and if pd has doubled without the king, very likely he has little elsewhere so it will not cost the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a straightforward 4@S -i doubt whether they will go for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C same as before|pg||
nt|stoffers: When Geir bid 4@h, if these guys bid and supprot to a game, a forcing pass is set up|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: very well done in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: may get to the wrong spot|pg||
nt|ady: yes 5@D the only game with a chance|pg||
nt|othered1: Is 1@S normal in their system?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = 0-11, 4+ spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: By unbalanced I mean not 5332|pg||
nt|blum1956: interesting board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Interesting that West doesn't raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in front at a passed hand east could bid also 2@h|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@h also works|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  also |pg||
nt|othered1: Getting to 4@S isn't very impressive.  Getting to 3, unluckily down on @C ruff, is less of a charge|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: is 1H what we would all bid? and would we pass 1H as W ?|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can makr 9 tricks in clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S doomed|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 7h if they bid it|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H is not F! so I dont see why Bocchi bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H = transfer|pg||
nt|psridhar: If Angelini win , they owe Helness for his defense this session on a couple of Bds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|ady: specs asking what 3@C is    anyone know?|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now this shold be easy for Duboin provided that Sement shows diamond suit ans short spades|pg||
nt|ady: paaarently transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: CC says Stayman, transfers, shortness at 3-level - not much on second-round actions|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@C is 5+@D + 4@H or 6@D+1@C, 3@D is relay, 3@S in short in spades with 5+@D + 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: That describes 12 of east's cards very well.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt i think showed clubs|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kit: Continued debate whether South should bid Stayman with 4-3-3-3.  Takes a lot for 4 of a major to take 10 tricks while 3NT 8.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: hovewer i think 1@S by East obliged (if 1@H stnd)|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why North didn't bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C, if natural, shouldn't excite west too much.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's GF :)|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, then west's excitement level is irrelevant.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: RD ?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like this 2@S call one bit -- partner might not even have 4 spades, and wrong hand gets tapped.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s 3 cards after pass at 1@H rdbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he did the exact smae thing before you got here Kit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can pass now|pg||
nt|kit: ah, good point Giorgio|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  19|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  now making game either in hearts or diamonds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to set pressure on declarer Peter?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s natural to play @c10 to @cj and take some finess in @h|pg||
nt|othered1: But do you really have to bid game on this?|pg||
nt|stoffers: tough to find that clublead, to say at least|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: not that dull|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @s lead can create problems for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Nort must duck a heart |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes and then?|pg||
nt|blum1956: any lead may create ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i see he may have difficulties in establishing and enjoying 2 @hs|pg||
nt|kit: But I'm still not so sure I like it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: ... but the spade king:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess you don't.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: a spec opines that 2nt might be 2way either sygnoff in clubs or setting in spades |pg||
nt|deltadash: I think we're on the fast track now|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is certain now = wrong again:(|pg||
nt|deltadash: Oh, well, Geoff, we've all been there many times and will be again :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never in the picture in the other room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably let @h9 run|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not GF apparently|pg||
nt|poohbear: this might have been a swing if Helness dbled 2@c stayman|pg||
nt|stoffers: Tor didnt have a clear-cut double on the stayman either with just AT high|pg||
nt|pelu: East could X 2@C - with no X no @C-lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: Has east limited his hand yet?|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@H a fine slam - 7@H need @CK in S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, East might give it a whirl ... there are some other chances as well|pg||
nt|tokay1975: picks  up diamonds even they are 42  with 32 trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that it is normal for NS to bid 1@S in N|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fantoni Nunes play weak NT so they will open 1@c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|blum1956: Even if he ruffs high should go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: not possible to ruff two clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: I like east's approach to this hand.  West has a dead, flat minimum and could be much better for 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush, club ruff can wait|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, the 4th @S will keep it from making, I think.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: On the same logic, shouldn't East be able to work out opponents are in 7-card fit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we trying for a grand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not|pg||
nt|deltadash: I think we're done now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer's hopes will be up when defense doesn't run clubs, but the 4-2 heart split defeats him|pg||
nt|kit: I would think that South would promise 4-card spade suit for this sequence, but maybe not.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Still a trick short, no? Spades 4-1|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the best bid by S over partner's second double is RD, asking N to bid something:)|pg||
nt|pelu: the scedule: next match 17.15 - but will be delayed - and then 21.15 - 6. segment - if played - to morrow 10.00|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tokay1975: wd|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he whirled away|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After all, West is quite a good declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: oh, sorry -- didn't see who had bid 3@H|pg||
nt|pelu: 1) @H lead for sure = only 1 @C-ruff - @CK onside 50% @D 3-3 <%|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps you can set up the diamonds even if they are 4-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So  I think this contract is about 80+%|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes  easy  against 42  diamonds  enough entrys|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You don't need to take even a single club ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: can you see any solution after this lead and N ducks @h?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: a conservative pass at 2@S by North could be made in this auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now discard a @D seam the best line|pg||
nt|kit: Not surprisingly, this hand plays a lot better in clubs than in spades|pg||
nt|kit: yes, diamond discards seem right -- but with spades 4-2 I don't think that will be good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it won't help him to pitch two hearts|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: not sure about the discard. i think ruff with queen of spades then lead jack maybe|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so dull commentators curse strikes|pg||
nt|othered1: this speeds things up|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: with 10@S in South this line it is OK|pg||
nt|tokay1975: after a trump lead  geir thks  trumps  are 32|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: however this line is winning with @S 3/3|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: obviously, Madala and I are not on the same wawelength|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: 5@D apparantly was the first limited bid made by east|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|ady: why overtake 10@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he bid a lot so he wants to take the tricks on defense:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna|pg||
nt|jbgood: must be one of your slams Roland:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to Jon, Michael, Ralf and Jon for commentary|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty, bye all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all and bye!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, Michael too (not Jon twice)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he led D earlier, after ace, and E returns a minor suit, S cashes D queen & takes three clubs and crossruffs last 2 trix|pg||
nt|ady: another partial|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Giusy Di Dio. Great Job! Our appreciation to the organisers , The FIGB (Gianluca Frola)for ensuring ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Diane, Ralf, Mustapha and Roland for their company and wit and to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|deltadash: specs are pointing out that a @d lead would have made a big difference|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Last board of the set.  Many thanks to our excellent operator Giusy Di Dio ... no Undos!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And thanks to my fellow commentators, Peter and Mustafa|pg||
nt|othered1: AThis set certainly quieted down.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|blum1956: that will be a flat board. It rarely pays to be so passive as NS in the open room. 4@s is not that bad after all|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C in OR   way overboard   fortunate to escape double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna. Great job!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our commentators, Kit Woolsey, David Edwin, Giorgio Mauri and Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: may end in 3NT |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally our appreciation to the FIGB and Gianluca Frola for organizing this broadcast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set and our broadcast from Italy today. Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna. Great job!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our commentators, Ed Shapiro and John Stewart|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer had a pretty good count on the hand so the @h finesse was a huge favorite|pg||
mb|1D|nt|poohbear: those 1 impers are important when the matxh is tight|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: 3NT is quite possible, and looks like it will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N opened those other junky hands, i am surprised he passed this one, which actually has some positive features|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - 3nt is a normal contract here|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 9 trick level not  good for e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of spects have "no name" in profil - most commentators will not answer "John Do's" - pl be polite a update your profil :(:(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the FIGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO. Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show, greatly appreciated by ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx all, good night|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: 21 hcp  and no fit   an unlikely contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Dinner break now, back in 1 hour and 50 minutes, at 21.15 local time|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Roland - also for your nevertireing work for BBO!|pg||
nt|kit: "normal" on 22 high is a strong statement :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the FIGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO. Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show, greatly appreciated by ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very good set for  angelini now  duboin sementha will be back next session|pg||
nt|bjacobs: there's a break now - next set due to start in 2 hours, 20 minutes|pg||
nt|othered1: Will north raise?|pg||
nt|othered1: Rather, would north have raised if west had stayed out?|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of italians dont agree - 1@S sh be 5+|pg||
nt|othered1: non-vul, many modern players tend to respond on south's hand without anywhere near classical requirements|pg||
nt|stoffers: But need a lot of overtricks the last board then :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3c must be unbal 4 trump raise|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Last board of the match now. Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna. Great job!|pg||
nt|stoffers: will helness compete over 3@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and to our commentators, PS, Christer, Barry and Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: acc 5@C is a winner (doublefiness @HK10)|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW are close to making 5C- double dummy 11 on dbl hook in h|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl of 3@c by Helgemo must show a good hand. Not @cs|pg||
nt|stoffers: Yes, double is typhical 3415 or a strong hand with no bid|pg||
nt|pelu: and in red he dont like to bid 4@c|pg||
mb|3D|nt|blum1956: thks all - collegues & spectators|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not as strong a statement as this auctrion|pg||
mb|d|nt|blum1956: It id possible to make 10 in diamonds|pg||
nt|stoffers: now he will bid 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unless bid from hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: AKQ109x can make 6 tricks in many layout ....|pg||
nt|ady: hopeless on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: west can clear the diamonds now|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even 5@d is in danger but Fantoni probably does not exclude that 6@d are on the table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nothing more to do in this match, so I wish you all a nice weekend. Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|deltadash: Bye Ralf and thx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play will resume at 10.00 local time tomorrow, in about 10½ hours from now. Last set of 16 boards. Welcome back then|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: damp squib ending|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: yes, rather unlucky this time|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder if West should have taken a shot and doublet -- he knows clubs aren't running if that's declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am still a bit agog at the auction|pg||
nt|ady: even if west switches to a spade   should go down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S must think they are down by 50|pg||
nt|ady: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT looks doomed on diamond lead.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|0  bamba: ma|pg||
nt|ady: is this last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx to all:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: i guess he had bid 3NT in a lokal pairs event tough :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lebridgeur: natural ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Giusy Di Dio, our excellent operator in Bologna|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, Michael, JP and Jon|pg||
nt|othered1: This, perhaps, being the counterpart of the last hand where north bid without a fit.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Play will resume at 10.00 local time tomorrow, in about 10½ hours from now. Welcome back then|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: opening 3@C  in OR   followed by 3@D  and then 4@C    hence same contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This contract is no Gimme|pg||
nt|pelu: 5+ HCP - not 5 card suit - sorry for confusion - so many would pass on the Bocchi hand - OK?:):)|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes Duboin-Sementa need to bid 5@C to win the match|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: trying to make    diamond to queen now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes well done to allegra|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|lebridgeur: 0.3  ace =4 NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: thanks all, colleagues and spectators|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO. Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|ady: I believe this is last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: will be disappointed  when clubs fail|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he will probably need to finesse the diamonds to make it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: now around down 3|pg||
nt|tokay1975: maybe both  cl and dia  finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lebridgeur:  the match still in contention 27 imps   32 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lunch break now. Restart in 2 hours and 15 minutes, at 14.30 local time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: double finesse in diamonds is the best chance|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For full schedule, please go to  http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|Walddk2: May I suggest that you bookmark that site where all times are local to *you*. That will save me from lots of questions about where, when and what. Thank you|pg||
nt|kit: He will cross to dummy and lead queen of hearts, hoping that North has K10.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ty all for watching - bye !|pg||
nt|kit: It will go KA.  Then he runs clubs and plays another heart.  The count will make it clear that North started with 2 hearts, so cash for down 1.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: Madala has had some incredibly difficult play problems in this set|pg||
nt|stoffers: if they bid it, they will make it..|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: declarer think West without control in @C for the switch in @S at second trick|pg||
nt|ady: well thx specs and all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what happens when you sit South|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|blum1956: done|pg||
nt|blum1956: by all|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: a 3 Norsemen Italian team - I am sure we will see them in the final|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|kit: It might be right to lead low heart from dummy in case North has stiff king.  If North has K10x, he gets squeezed anywy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stoffers: Geir will settle on 10 here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching. We hope you enjoyed your stay in the vugraph room and look forward to welcoming you on another BBO presentation|pg||
nt|kit: and Helness worked that out!  Very well done.|pg||
nt|kit: At least I think he worked it out.|pg||
nt|kit: But the fact that he is thinking here isn't a good sign|pg||

nt|stoffers: no, 470=10|pg||
nt|stoffers: 600-130|pg||
nt|pelu: I need to open calculator :) and then agree with u - coffee-time - black and a lot of suggar :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: jeeez, they bid it..|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 5@C - ½-time Angelini was up with 71 IMP - and looks like to lose by 1IMP - but we cant be sure this is only BBO-score 1 IMP can be misscored|pg||
nt|pelu: will u keep the table open to off. result?|pg||
