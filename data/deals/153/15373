nt|lestergold: Hi Roland |pg||
nt|ady: vedry close match|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so sunny in Reading either Ed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s might reach a tight 3NT    not likely to make|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|deltadash: Hi everyone and good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland, Diane and Geoffrey|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Ralf|pg||
nt|deltadash: Looks like we're going to ease into it with this hand - not much action|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: board  1 should be a major  fight  @h agains @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The layout isn't friendly for N-S in a heart contract. On a good day you make game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: hmm....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not board 1 then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they on 2 or 3 maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: re hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@h doubled is par|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder why Fantoni didnt open 2 @s - isnt that according to system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: is any bid here going to be natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|blum1956: surprisingly enough N's hand does not qualigy for the opening bid (1@s is forsing, 2@s being probably not for that kind of shape?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think there is any making game for N/S|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@s should be 10-13 unbalanced with 5+ spades - dosnt that fit?|pg||
nt|blum1956: clearly the biddin is not correctly sent|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 1@h opening and no support from W?|pg||
nt|jbgood: or they play something else than we see? (wrong download?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 commentators and no one knows what is going on|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is normal, Mike:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries, I am in touch with Gianluca Frola from the FIGB|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is looking into it|pg||
nt|ady: north opening a mute point|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: some  action required with South's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not an unreasonable game when you are 25 IMPs behind with 16 boards to go|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but n/s dont have to be in game|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the basic system of n/s?|pg||
nt|deltadash: they may not get past 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Quiet start to the day, a straightforward 4@H. Cards well placed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: presumeably 2@H   shows hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mule?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Nunes adopts what we cal the staircase strategy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf  for the Fantunes convention card|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: can someone please explain the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: q2N seems odd why not redouble for rescue what if pard had 3 spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh sorry that explains|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has a chance without a @s lead. Declarer can knock out @hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: now an invite or the classic punt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rinaldi will obviously accept an invite|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 9-losers hands should not strain to open, especially when you don;t even get to name a suit you would like to see led|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is important to buy the contract on that kind of board whatever the level is|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Garbosi cannot be fouled and Nunes will have to bid  par contract as Michael pointed earlier|pg||
nt|blum1956: keypoint...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: well so so far David ur prediction was correct N/S will not make 3N because they arent in it !!|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, hearts plus minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: D six growing up fast|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 4 cl  is advance cuebid  shows  heart supp |pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: my understanding of these proceedings is comparable to my understanding of Italian...|pg||
nt|jbgood: Cero|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We can all see that the cards on our screen do not match the hand they are playing|pg||
nt|jbgood: as Flash says: the board displayed is, indeed, Board 1 - it matches the auction which was displayed last time; as Roland indicated, this auction goes with another board...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they are playing board 2 or 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same problem in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: So Roland, we just wait and see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 has been redealt, that's why|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not inclined to go into detail|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: South kow s 1 he has only 2 defensive tricks 2  he cannot be expensive in 6 @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: even thing of redoubling !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Thinks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
nt|deltadash: obviously it's PUSH time|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - good morning from Copenhagen|pg||
nt|tokay1975: they may land in 5h  making  still|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an easy lead for Duboin|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but in the other room i expect the same to happen|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|ady: club switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 down; even Fantoni can play this fast :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes! well done by both sides up to this moment. Still E needed to avoid the diamond lead which was easy enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either @DA is onside or it's not|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: end play in  @d Roland?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One goes away on a spade, so not sure which endplay|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Give Bocchi @SA instead of KJ and slam would have made. Goes to show how the 4321 scale is flawed. A = 4, KJ = 4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction - even if it gives away a trump trick, it usually comes back |pg||
nt|lestergold: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW 5cM. 4cD, 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa has those nice clubs in dummy he has no way of enjoying|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown's Law:  the lower the level of the doubled partial, the faster the trump lead...   :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East had really better take his heart ruff while he can |pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may well diagnose the bad breaks now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Losing 2 diamonds when the ace is off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi, sorry I'm late|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: Hi|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @d  ace is obviously off side considering East final double|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio played always strong club - now they chenged the system, seeing the open of 1@C by Failla|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sheardown was one of the early electees to Canada's Hall of Fame |pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: ace rather than small would win when S has stiff king, but risk is blocking the suit and having heart entry knocked out before clubs can get untangled|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam still need only 1 @c-loser|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lebridgeur: sorry not well waked up forgot ace of @s discard:(|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
mc|11|nt|blum1956: @dA may be singleton offside (just exchange most of minor suit cards between EW)|pg||

nt|ady: lead change   asit might regularly in such a close match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here we go|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Sabine :) i think, instead, will be a great match (also if after dinner) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: quiet partial to start|pg||
nt|kit: South has strength for 1NT overcall, but with that flat hand there is danger of going for a number if West has the balance of strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 was a 7-IMP swing to Allegra as we see on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Straightforward 3NT to bid - anything but straightforward to play|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20 again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but this time E really DOES have an opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final the score is  Angelini 144 - 83 Varese|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|kit: Still, if he passes he will just be guessing later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C apparently for majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@C no doubt promises both majors|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  some sort of stayman?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: east has a better opening than north had last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: all cards favourable for EW on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: soouth has found best lead giving bowt away|pg||
nt|ady: best lead     nothing given|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|blum1956: happy 3NT for NS - will Fantoni-Nunes bid it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morning Jon|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is usually right against this auction|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Angelini has three Norwegians in the team, Helness, Helgemo and Brogeland .... but no longer Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|jcmax: There are two common treatments really when partner has opened 1 of a minor and the opponents overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: no half measures with north|pg||
nt|kit: 3NTjust plain an overbid -- I don't see any reason for it unless more expected from 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|jcmax: 1) always 2 of the same minor shows both majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K9x in @H and K1065 in majors are good cards after the INFORMATION - typical by Bocchi to understand the situation at the table|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks made in OR  playing in one|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2) always 2 of the other minor shows both majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: and 3) always 2 @C shows both majors .)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D can be 22-24 balanced|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Easier to remember|pg||
nt|kit: I wonger why West led 9 -- seems like might waste an important spot with little upside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you would have if RHO had opened 1NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: shall we guess on -300?|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer does have some real chances here, and he knows pretty much where all the cards are from the bidding which is helpful|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: will try for J@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without the overcall at 2@C probably pass by North|pg||
nt|ady: double part score swing to Allegra hand 1  so if they make this  will be off to a great start|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Madala, knowing A in @S in West can play seeing all honors|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmmm, it seems to me that would be a big discrepancy. Pass or 3NT. surely there is also something in between.|pg||
nt|kit: Best for declarer now is probably to lead diamond to jack, then queen of clubs from hand -- if East takes it, declarer has dummy entry for black winners|pg||
nt|ady: was 1@D    1NT passed out in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: sounds right to me :)|pg||
nt|kit: There might not be something in between after the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Staymanish auction may steer helgemo away from the heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: didnt|pg||
nt|ady: tht would finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who say you should double a 2NT opener if it goes pass-pass|pg||
nt|ady: passive diamond looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all say that but no-one does|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sementa wants to retaion all his endplay options here hoping that defenders will be forced to give him his 8th trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: south best tho to continue as he started |pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, it's easy to be brave on paper|pg||
nt|ady: may well be   if he cashes all diamonds and then Q@S and 10@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: best for east to conceal his hand very difficult for defenders this way|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|pelu: then @SJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yep, with dummy showing 4@H (I assume puppet), the heart lead is unappetizing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: we can see that anything bit a diamond now is fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or at least -200|pg||
nt|kit: so far so good -- now queen of clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcmax: I was referring to if W had passed 1NT. surely most top pairs have a method then to express a hand that cannot force to game, but may be interested.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: 8@H ?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he would have been better "cashing" queen of clubs before squandering this exit|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like East has to pitch a club here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: well -2 i think is more likely|pg||
nt|kit: yes, 8@H does look like the right play -- surrounding the 7.  Veru unusual card combination|pg||
nt|jcmax: W is in a very awkward position now. Not an easy switch. Everything helps declarer except one card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If anyone can, Helgi can|pg||
nt|jcmax: But Helgemo has incredible imagination at the bridge table. he sees positions, nobody else has even heard of before!|pg||
nt|kit: He should have a pretty good idea about the distribution from East's discards and the line of play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: needs to play king|pg||
nt|jcmax: With the @H J he has chosen to play on the psychological chance of declarer misguessing the @H-layout.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But does he know who has the 10?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He doesn't|pg||
nt|kit: he certainly will find that -- and from long thought about shift, he will deduce where 10 of hearts is|pg||
nt|ady: no    easier seeing all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great hand|pg||
nt|kit: it sure is|pg||
nt|jcmax: There is a good chance that declarer will guess W doesn't have the @H10.  with the @H10 the switch would have come faster.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree with Sabine|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with J10 in @H the return would be faster|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays king  east  return a low diamond?|pg||
nt|kit: the point about the speed of the shift is a good one.  Even at the highest levels, inferences can be drawn from more than just the cards played.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Also with the the JT w might have switched to the 10 instead. or alternatively after the long pause to a low one!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So when you have J10 you should tank before leading the jack when you see the 9 in dummy?|pg||
nt|kit: not for deceptive purposes -- that would be against the rules|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer draws his own inferences at his own risk -- but here he might well get it right|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR: lead @H to 9, and @HK to A|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: not many tricks for the defense - missed game?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Also, simply on restricted choice -- from J10 might have led either|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: and then a @D from Comella from the K = easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That @HK is a nice try ... and with @H8 falling, it might just be enough to bring the contract home|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: Semneta hasa  legendary reputation for his card play|pg||
nt|kit: now the expected duck of queen of clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: not an auspicious start for the trailing team|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: still only 8 tricks : 2@s+2@h+3@c+1@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|blum1956: Normally they play Lebensohl in that position/ I wonder whether 3@c from Nunes was positive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we are about the last one in France NOT to open 1 nt with 5 cardsmajors:)|pg||
nt|ady: can end play south for 9th trick|pg||
nt|mr murray: didnt like spades?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Sementa a happy man now although he can still endplay South for the overtrick|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it's without cost|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very tricky position here ... perhaps West can be endplayed|pg||
nt|mr murray: cant understand heart play by w|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: had sementa taken the club and played another club north in would beat contract with heart thru|pg||
nt|Walddk2: jack!|pg||
nt|deltadash: maybe a little bit of nervousness to start |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did not do anything silly|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: I love this hand, it made my evening|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: hence the problem for a double of 2NT passed |pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: And it is the defense which comes out on top (low diamond now, of course).  Would it have made if declarer had played king of hearts?  I haven't worked it out.|pg||
nt|ady: think still would have been down 1  even playing K@H first time|pg||
nt|pelu: to kill the entry on @hJ - if S try to set up the 5. @c|pg||
nt|mr murray: he will make it now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: No-one wants to get endplay, then rather throw the jack away|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Semneta made 2 more tricks than those who would have finessed the pesky spade|pg||
nt|ady: nice play|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Looks like he is going to do the simple thing, and take the diamond finesse for his contract|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: overboard   2 off|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: with 3@H give a hand very strong|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Best chance is to first play on @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: Why did Duboin not overcalled 1@d? It could be useful sometimes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: make 3Nt also with Qxxx xxx Jxx xxx at the partner|pg||
nt|jcmax: thinking is not knowing :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: no reason to pick the heart push thus|pg||
nt|kit: Now whichever hand gets forced, declarer can arrange the entries to draw trumps from the other hand and then run the hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: cant cost to play a club to start with and tghen see what happens|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes, that is what I ment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If E had one more D and one less round card, 6C would be on after normal defense|pg||
nt|deltadash: wonder how many years that has been 'the lead'?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No|pg||

mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be balanced hand|pg||
nt|kit: South has difficult problem, with no suit to Q-bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C natural (normal in Italy against 1@C with only 2@c)|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps it is right to play that a bid of the other minor is a Q here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes and for 9 tricks you have to take the correct finess|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S doomed |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a much easier 3n here for E/W|pg||
nt|ady: might get too high|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: just playing it as forcing is likely to be good enough, no?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is a good bid - North could have 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: and here a shooting e/w might try a slam|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like that's the path we're on|pg||
nt|pfbr: .|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- bad fit in the clubs couples with 4-1 spade split|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 3 hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: last board 2@c showed both majors - does really 2 @d show even more major cards?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: well, partner needs to know if it shows diamonds or not|pg||
nt|ady: unless defence slips  3NT has 5 tricks of the top|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 1Nt raise with a top honor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They proceed as if Helness had bid 1@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is the spot here ...and I guess they will probably get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D is forcing one round|pg||
nt|lestergold: players normally play for the drop if there is no other indicator|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: giving the stop for 3Nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah i see, you mean doing it even with shorter diamonds. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but North nothing in @S ...|pg||
nt|kit: they have pinpointed the spade weakness, so will likely stop in time at 4@C|pg||
nt|tokay1975: antonio has very good cards  against 64 in majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Despite both of them having very un-notrumpy shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: exactly Marshall|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kit: like a support double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which in effect he did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, a spade lead might be problematic|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: perfect defence against 2H could be quite bloody|pg||
nt|jcmax: !NT could also have been a transfer to @C|pg||
nt|kit: probably was transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know what the best tratment is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Treatment even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The one you are comfortable with I suppose|pg||
nt|jcmax: Treatment for what, roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will probably win and play club at trick 2, setting up source of tricks first is usually best technique.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: Good 3@S bid -- if partner has 3 small spades, that might be enough|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is a risk - ask half stop to bid Nt|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead against 4@s gives some chances to the defense|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d on 1@c opening  2@c was after one NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer must be careful|pg||
nt|mr murray: someone better take green card out soon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's not going to happen for a while|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on the fall of @cJ is not so bad|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is certainly the right contract ... |pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it is by no means easy to get to, as East, looking at his hand|pg||
nt|pelu: Buratti-Comella in 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spec is suggesting 4@H ... a Moysian fit only Mrs Moyse could love|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: as kind kiubs tell me: 2 @c shows 5-4 and 2@d 5-5|pg||
nt|ady: a lucky lay and n/s can make 4@H    but not  in the bidding in both rooms|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: I don't think South will think Jx is enough|pg||
nt|ady: might lead a heart     but will have time to switch to spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: *kibs|pg||
nt|ady: can get 1 heart discarded from dummy   but still too much to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: would need A in @D in South - with this layout E/W make 5 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for Qxx of spades upstairs...but even then likely to need 44 spades in EW hands|pg||
nt|kit: Heart lead wrong only if North has 7 clubs -- but that is quite possible|pg||
nt|blum1956: It proved easy enough to stop the opps from making a vulnerable game |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a push |pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: on the previous hand if a low heart is led Declarer playing the ACE does block the suit but declarers have been known to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|pelu: let see the defense: for sure @HK - if N now will kill dummy with a @d . then 3NT make!|pg||
nt|mr murray: looks like spade beats it. shouldn't make a passive lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: In both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If North had Qxx in spades, North would have bid 3NT -- that is why I don't like South's 3NT call|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well bid, I would sy ... they bid suits 8 times, then 3NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tokay1975: no room to ask for  queen of trumps|pg||
nt|kit: West has obvious heart shift, and that will be that|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR a @S lead from S|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3 spades was last train|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: well e/w here did shoot the slam but now can he make it?|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tokay1975: i am not sure if 4cl was somekind of turbo  asking aces |pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: West can afford to pitch 2 diamonds, 1 heart, 1 spade.  East must keep all of his spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might not have bid 3S with Qxx of spades and KQJxxx of clubs (and D ace instead)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: What do you like 1NT to be? 1. Extra values - 2. Support for hearts - 3. Clubs    take your pick your favourite partner. As long as you have an agreement all is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double of 1NT that is|pg||
nt|kit: declarer simply playing for 3-2 spade split and 4-3 heart split (so no overruff on third round of hearts)|pg||
nt|ady: yes   home now if spades behave|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: i meant, he might not have bid 3N, sorry|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: This should be easy defense -- they know declarer starts with 8 top tricks, so the necessary assumptions are easy.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: but of course i agree about the 3N call being ill-judged|pg||
nt|kit: Also, declarer shouldn't have king of spades -- with that, would have bid 3NT, not 3@H.|pg||
nt|blum1956: Certainly it is dangerous to double the 1@s opening with Failla's hand, but to pass is also dangerous sometimes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think W never can make with 4-1 in @h|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: with diamonds 3-3 declarer is home|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: he will settle for 9 now I guess|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: wd by Bocchi|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|nt|kit: accurate discarding by both defenders|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if East would have 3@S (with Jxx in South), the lead @H help the declarer to make 3Nt (squeeze against West) - he must keep at 6 cards 3@S 2@h so declarer can play @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which certainly strengthens argument for spade lead|pg||

nt|blum1956: EW just need to discover their spades miscontrol|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this level one expects that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had better not get beyond 4@S here with this trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but they are missing the trump Q so shouldnt bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but 5 is too many|pg||

mb|1D|nt|lebridgeur: une bonne défense  à 5 @h ?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Come to London my friend, you'll gain an hour|pg||
mb|1H|nt|blum1956: Here the Fantoni-Nunes system works - 2@h instead of 1@h preempts the opponents' spades|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: in 4 @s Imeant against 4 @h|pg||

nt|tokay1975: 4dia is trnsf splinter?  but this  is tooweak |pg||
nt|kit: Normal 2@S contract, rather unlucky to go down|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is really well done by NS in the other room to stop in 2@S. what a disappointment to have to go down!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is takeout of spades. Notmal treatment I would think|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|kit: North isn't worth more than a 2@S call I don't think, which KQ of diamonds doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a low partscore in @H or @c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lebridgeur: right   Michael  easier after 1 :h opening  |pg||

nt|ady: cautios in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2S now by E ?|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is quite possible. I still believe many players would consider bidding more than 3@S. so just bidding 2@S seems good judgment to me.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is sufficient - 6 losers are too much |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: is 2@D forcing here?  Not clear|pg||

pc|d8|nt|kit: club lead reasonable -- spade lead would also have been reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Subtract some for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|mr murray: sometimes 2/1 has to be violated when misfit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Hard to see West doing anything here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding Qx of hearts makes a 2-level preempt a bit more attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: very safe level!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Gerben42: 2@C was gazilli so 3@D showed 18+ with @H and @D|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @c was aither natural or 17+|pg||
nt|blum1956: Besides the EW's 10-card fitthe double of 2@c worked better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As a spectator says, you can make 5, but it is unlikely to happen|pg||
nt|kit: There is danger if East continues clubs -- West may wrongly play a third round, not knowing that East's trumpt tricks are natural|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jbgood: *either|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a leadc!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this takes out K@c entry to the second spade trick amongst other things|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D i think isn't forcing (probably they use a kind of roudy (2@C forcing generic)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W clearly though 2D NF|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blum1956: The unbid suit!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The hand is worth 16.5 on the KNR|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: if he thought 2D was NF, and EW play support doubles, he may be reading E for a better hand|pg||
nt|ady: poor judgement by west to raise to 3NT after east showed minimum passing the intervention of spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, if that is what P showed|pg||
nt|kit: They have enough stoppers -- just not enough winners.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard 3 @d aon @h and crossruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Duboin would not have ducked that diamond against 5, we will never know|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|blum1956: If declarer had won the first trick he could endplay West. But now he is 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kit: North ducked first spade so he had better control of things|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing support doubles and E was not sure about 2D, he could have waffled with a heart preference, having denied them of them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: denied three of them|pg||
nt|kit: If he hadn't declarer might have come home with 2 clubs, 4 diamonds, 2 spades, 1 heart if defense not careful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i need to proofread before i hit send:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: perhaps a misunderstand about 2Nt|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: well but any understanding about 2N would be produced by misunderstandings about Pass and/or 2D i think|pg||
nt|kit: 9 of spades suit-preference, showing club strength rather than heart strength|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: is there a position here where west eventually has to provide Nunes with a helicopter back to his 9th trick?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|s5|nt|kit: Declarer has to trust this card and play a heartup to get out for down 1.|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|pelu: strange after the bidding N is favorit to @SK (only 5 HCP in @C and bidding 2-0-1|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: North can assume his partner has either ace of hearts or king of clubs, else declarer has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how a heart pitch could cost whatever the layout.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes and also E would have had a 2N opener|pg||
nt|ady: hand 20  3NT was made in OR for 10 imp swing to Allegra|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lebridgeur: Activity from South!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not how I learned to count them|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a number of specs have done so|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will of course lead first spade from dummy, in case North has stiff ace or AJx.|pg||
nt|jcmax: hmmmm. is 3N natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: CC does not go that far|pg||
nt|kit: might depend on what 3@D is|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: i feel a 3n coming ion here|pg||

nt|lestergold: top tricks are what actually cash had @ds not broken there would have been less|pg||
nt|othered1: What was the 2N response?  Looks weird, since it could misposition NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 15 is logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't look at all 4 hands, do you Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i look out of the window like i did at school and got whacked all the time |pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H making in OR in Board 21|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: last making spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3NT from S makes probably as East is squeezed for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probability about it 3 rounds of heart a spade swirch then east has to find 4 discards on the clubs and is mullered|pg||
nt|blum1956: But that was not clear for Nunes in the course of bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT might have made on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he can come to 9 tricks in time?|pg||
nt|jcmax: At this vulnerability some players might fancy a 3@H bid with the N hand over 2NT, just for the lead. But that would also depend on whether 2NT was GF or just inv+. it's more ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: dangerous to bid when it is invitaional+.|pg||
nt|kit: I am told that 3@D is natural, 3NT is not -- just shows no single suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: North needs a way to show a diamond suit, and South needs a way to find out how good they are  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Kit, i think 2Nt raise without singleton|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: Very well thought out choice IMO|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 18 was more interesting than many of us thought. In the mid-game with 5 tricks in the bag and a spade came back from Helgemo, Madala could have made it when he won @SA ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (correctly) if he had exited with a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo must get out with a heart to dummy's jack (Helness pitches a low diamond), Now declarer takes a losing diamond finesse and a forced suicide squeeze materialises. Perforce, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo must exit in diamonds and the squuezes Helness in the black suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cute|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Try to go through the play in MOVIE|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after Madala wins @SA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@c looked better than 6@s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: suggested 2N was a control-showing response, but that seems odd due to potential positioning on a flatish hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, 2@C-3@c (+ve in @d)-3@D (how good)- some step response to show all three top honours|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: so 11 out, and deservedly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course there are tose who would say that a grand which depends on a 3/2 break should not be bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the results merchants and in thiscase teammates wont be happy|pg||
nt|blum1956: It does not - only 4 diamonds with East |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|blum1956: too much|pg||
nt|deltadash: Right Roland - won't be easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT denied shortage|pg||
nt|tokay1975: exactly  right  last 2 cards sp and a cl  dummy  rx in clubs. torr cannot protect both|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was really a devastating opening lead from Madala|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in my system i use 2@H/@S by North to give 5cards with maximum 3 hcp|pg||
nt|blum1956: there is a choice - normally it is better to play 1NT then to defend it. But this vulnerability may be exclusive so Fantoni passed. EW prefere to defend 1@s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lebridgeur: previous board open room  one @h opening  one @s overcall but 4 @h was the final contract|pg||

nt|kit: But you would never do that, as don't expect West to have led from J10xx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but what do you have to lose? if they are 32 you are still fine|pg||
nt|ady: must take winners now|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|blum1956: not needed this time - 10 tricks always|pg||

nt|jbgood: y - still needs an alert defense to beat it|pg||

nt|pelu: I dont like a very long pause before bidding here in N - s know thta pd has a difficult bidding problem|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: well someone is headed for it but i dont know whom,|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have splintered|pg||
nt|kit: Another dull hand coming up -- makes up for the exciting 3NT we saw earlier|pg||
nt|ady: nice practical bid in 4th seat|pg||
nt|jcmax: Helness no doubt is a big believer in "bid what you think you can make" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: what difference if majors reversed?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pd will bid my long suit with equal lengths|pg||
nt|kit: if 2@C shows majors, 2@D by partner asks which is longer|pg||
nt|blum1956: now EW may stop short of game|pg||
nt|kit: I like the third seat 4@H opening.  There doesn't figure to be a slam, 4@H is probably the right contract, and it puts pressure on opponents|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall with doubleton in @S|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, 4th seat -- but same principles|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have a good save in 5@D   but could hardly enter at that level|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with W. Dbl for me on 2@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: very interesting...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do know now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will attackclubs first I think|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT down on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile with NS vul your chances of decent score defending 1N are not dismal|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: lost 5 IMP in bidding regained 4 in play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: do you want to be there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|pelu: here that 2@H is not as strong as normal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: not down on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: count again|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N from west actually looks pretty good|pg||
nt|blum1956: Well, not 15 top tricks as on the previous board but 9 I can count|pg||
nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|ady: yes    sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: irony here is 3n is a lot better a contract than 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: but you cannot accuse anyone of mis bidding here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no problem with that is there?  As long as South does not "take advantage"|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right - but extra pressure on S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgebase.com/tools/handviewer.html?s=s76daq7ct&w=sthtdkj86&n=hjd53ck87&e=sq5d94cj9   is the ending I was talking about on 18. South exits with a spade to West who gets ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: out with a heart (East and South both pitching diamonds)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 6@h looks easy with 2-2 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North could not afford to duck that diamond, Ralf. Then declarer can abandon the suit and turn his attention to clubs while he is keeping North off lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: thoroghly disgusting contract yhat will make|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blum1956: looks close|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is too good to give up on defending so double of 2@c seems right|pg||
nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: better spades and a weaker hand for the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|othered1: kOn long run expectations, yes, but 2@H needs to be very unlucky to go minus|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unless E/W take the first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mr murray: true|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: I guess club finesse now, then spade to jack|pg||
nt|ady: now club to the 10 ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|deltadash: this one is a pretty cut and dried 6H|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcmax: It may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it does have huge psychological advantages. The opponents never quite know what to expect. it could be anything.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: well 4@h went 3 light it appears|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: So winning the jack was correct, but ...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: First hurdle|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: all scores are in now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C  1 or 4|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  they have to cash  first 5 tricks  . but  i thk  they will  after the bidding|pg||
nt|mr murray: yes they will|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, East plays a club back, West cashes @SA to see what ha[[ems|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When North discards, West "sees"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|blum1956: What system do Sementa-Duboin play? If the 1@h opening is restricted to 15-16 HCP then 2NT was a better rebid. Otherwise it looks not easy to reach 3NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And you have not missed a slam opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He does not have  A A K|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: playing spades first|pg||
nt|kit: this order doesn't feel right to me, but it works okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H sign-off opposite 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 4 you are supposed to raise|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mr murray: uutomatic to play spade ace before club|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|deltadash: this would be a BIG 'oops'!!!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: e/w here will be very pleased to get a plus   when they might have lost a game swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h a gross contract apparently gross overbidding|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|blum1956: The @cQ in the second trick was better|pg||
pc|s7|nt|blum1956: That's why I prefer Precision or old-fashioned Polish club to the natural system|pg||
nt|lestergold: as I often say to David a bit liem certain club member we both know|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
mb|3C|nt|blum1956: Sementa is right to underestimate his hand now by not bidding 4@s immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: his stiff K@c does not look like pulling its weight|pg||
nt|blum1956: But Duboin shows extras|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: West might have shoved in a 1@S overcall -- relatively safe, and might do some good.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Free lesson in Polish|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3sp shows 65 but not super just enough  to play a game|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this one is only one loser away from the normal threshold, and N has the suit he is opening, so much better than his first exhibit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 hcp enough for game nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When do the invite, if ever?|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting question is whether North should speculate a double.  I know almost nobody does, but it wouldn't surprise me if it were percentage action.|pg||
nt|jcmax: I was just about to say the same thing, Kit :)|pg||
nt|kit: great minds think alike (sometimes)|pg||
nt|jcmax: It's the kind of action one might choose when one is very much into it or very hungry. Not so likely after dinner.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Helg can make this terrible 3Nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|deltadash: I could use a few of those Roland, thx :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Which contract do you prefer 4@h or 4@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond force may make declarer feel ubcomfortable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it need start with @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: i@d doubled might have been exciting:)|pg||
nt|othered1: What are the extras?|pg||
nt|blum1956: Ask Duboin|pg||
nt|roswolf: might well just cash the major suit ak's and claim|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcmax: No doubt his best chance would be magic :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: i have a feeling that there isa defence to beat 3@h but probably needs an intitial club lead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Getting older :(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But the good news is, Roland, a day less older than you thought!|pg||

nt|ady: same contract OR|pg||
nt|tokay1975: to shift  trumps second   trick is better i thk .now declarer just needs 7trump tricks to make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can play A in @S (otherwise KQ good)|pg||
nt|kit: still only 8 tricks I think -- North goes up|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ducking a spade maybe, but this is real bridge|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: Nuneshipiong to achieve that rarity a ruff with a stiff trump!|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: 6@H easily bid in the other room on board 7; it seems all over and we get the dream final: Allegra vs Angelini, starting at 21.15 local time tonight, in about 3 hours from now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @H @h for A and @h - now @d @d @d @D @S|pg||
nt|kit: best declarer can get is 4 diamonds, 2 clubs, and 2 in one of the majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: make Q in @C in the end game|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: he will if west now tries to ruff a spade|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks looks easy now|pg||

nt|lestergold: pardon raif its off|pg||
nt|lestergold: ruff A@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: you know thecards may be spitting in ur face but u know it will be  bid in the other room and unlikely to be a disaster|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is not the end of the day at the moment, just half-past-three|pg||
nt|tokay1975: agree roland  that match will be  very exited between very strong teams|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: should make just 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: the duck make declarer's life quite difficult|pg||
nt|kit: declarer can set up 3 hearts, 2 spades, 1 club, 1 diamond, but he is afraid opponents may have enough tricks first|pg||
nt|ady: may plau wedt for doubleton honor in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: er Michael I have the frfanchise on all the appaling jokes here|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|othered1: On merit, too. :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks easier on this board as the cards lie|pg||

mc|11|nt|lestergold: oh well all academic on that line|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Doesnt help. W can finess for @hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: was there a risk in returning to hand with a club and advancing say the t@h?|pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like 9 tricks now. Probably NS should have played trumps three times after winning the @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that these guys have played before|pg||

nt|othered1: You may stay out of that with a weak NT opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: or as mu dog says: sniff it ... bid it...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The philosophy these days is to leave no possible game unbid..|pg||
nt|kit: yes, they have that nasty habit of counting tricks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jacksond: there are hands where only makeable grand slam is in the 3/3 fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: I also think it is unfair to Moyse that his name is connected to all weird trump fits - the 4-3 fit is actually a fit:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and also some impossible ones as well|pg||
nt|jcmax: An awkward hand to open if one doesn't play a strong club system|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How to bid 7@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2+cards|pg||
nt|kit: there is a grand, but they will be doing well to get to a small|pg||
nt|ady: I think possibly 6@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: Standard practice is to just open 1@C anyway. Most times one gets another chance. sometimes partner has Qxxxx in spades and out and the bidding stops in 1@C|pg||
nt|kit: particularly since there will be plenty of enemy interference|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: inevitably|pg||
nt|othered1: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|blum1956: Another test. this time for NS. Will they reach 4@h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its abit like criminal justice- if you are going to make sure you convict allk theguilty ones you will have to convict a few innocent iones|pg||
nt|othered1: south will move over any type of support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent hand for a Bergen raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 5cM|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess there has to be one that's decent|pg||
nt|lestergold: or the converse if you want to make sure you dont convict an innocent one you release many of the guilty ones|pg||
nt|kit: wonder what 3@C shows?|pg||
nt|kit: I am told it shows black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 5+@C / 5+other|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is hard to imagine S would really bypass the @S-suit with his hand. so 2-suiter makes a lot of sense.|pg||
nt|kit: If so, they will easily get to some slam|pg||
nt|jcmax: yes, it would indeed be a scoop for the system!|pg||
nt|kit: but finding the grand looks impossible to me -- but you never know -- maybe 5@D by North, 5@H by South?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if north bid 5@D i bet they find grand slam in @C|pg||
nt|ady: as long as if they bid a grand it is in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: they will certainly bid it in clubs if South has shown black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Definitely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bocchi knows that 7@S can only be right if they have 13 top tricks|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: 2H or 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrr: the contract is 3nt by north ..bidding differnt as cards were picked in wrong axis|pg||
nt|ady: made 12 tricks in hearts OR     |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|blum1956: the absolutely maximal hand with Fantoni|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT by Sementa  pinpointing distribution for South|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfave vul that is a brave one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bocchi count 12 tricks because can't imagine 6 @S in South|pg||
nt|kit: Leaping to slam without some kind of investigation is almost always wrong IMO, and this hand is no exception|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he was going to slam anyway, why not 5@D en route one could ask|pg||
nt|jcmax: I doubt Bocchi was seriously considering a grand slam. If his partner's distribution were 5521, then small slam would be on the @D finesse, which would rate to be offside on the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: bidding.|pg||
nt|kit: exactly Roland.  6@C won't run away from him.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the void in @H could exist but isn't sufficient - need also K in @D Q in @s without 6 cards in @S|pg||
nt|kit: but why couldn't partner have stiff diamond and Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|kit: the point is that it can't hurt to try|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that sounds all very well. But then when he gets 5@H over 5@D how does he know his partner has 6@S and 5@C and not vice versa? 6@C is a very practical bid.|pg||
nt|kit: If he bids 5@D and follows with 6@C over 5@H, his partner will know there was grand interest since 5@D forced to 6@C if clubs trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A fair slam here, and it looks to be on (just)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: 2@S might survive anyway -- not sure|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if 1diamond is hearts  2cl is  obvious bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: op|pg||
nt|blum1956: IThere are some problems in the play thanks to the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|jbgood: a reasonable contract though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: optimism by both EW   should be one down|pg||
nt|lestergold: or foolhardy?|pg||
nt|kit: I'll grant that it is unlikely partner will bid the grand -- but if partner does you will have gained, otherwise you break even|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But very very thin|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|othered1: In OR east was able to bid a mere 2N|pg||
nt|mr murray: club ace on always makes even off makes on most layouts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: well shape is everythimng points count for little by comparison|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 10-13 unbalanced - yes, 3 NT makes. Spades behave!|pg||
nt|blum1956: In Russia we play 2NT opening for minors|pg||
nt|tokay1975: south  knows  the distrubution of north |pg||
mb|4C|nt|blum1956: The declarer needs to realise early that he must discard the 3rd club on the heart rather than ruffing one|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting choice of lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it seems to me that a trump lead sinks 6@D if the club ace is off |pg||
mb|4D|nt|blum1956: But the defenders may play clubs themselfe so the trump coup is needed|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the trump coup just does not work against best defense|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes as South may discard two hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is likely to get the trumps right here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: clming 4 in 5 seconds|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer properly attacking his side suit first -- he needs to develop diamond tricks in all variations.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nd 10 tricks|pg||
mb|6D|nt|pelu: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1:  a common consequence of 2-suited bids when you don't buy the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hi|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even a spade lead is dangerous ... declarer could easily lose control as he tries to ruff the clubs good|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: Queen of @c now  and South must discard @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it is all a question of would holds the 10 of @d from North point of wiew   not that clear|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway I cannot find a sensible alternative for North. But Fantoni is better...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West did well to hide his 10 of @h   both red tens are essential for the defense  @s could be right !|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Not that easy to see that 10 of @s could do harm to the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: difficult for the team that must win any IMP to play with this kinds of hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, in 2S he can afford to suffer a ruff|pg||
nt|mr murray: still pretty good. Would always want to be there although probably only makes 601/2% of time:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: call it 40%|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: keep your hands off that @DA, South |pg||
nt|othered1: declarer doesn't know (as we do) that he's safe|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Lead seems normal -- surely safer than diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see we have almost 1500 specs which is a lot for a weekday early afternoon|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I think you might struggle to get this slam to even money, but it's a complicated calculation - too hard for me|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tokay1975: yes but in closed cards south knows  55 in minors and opener . north may have  rdxxx cl or something more|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to stay out of slam i thk|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I agree ... it's normal for South to bid it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: also 6@D in OR|pg||
nt|mr murray: sure|pg||
nt|mr murray: this calibre players will always get there|pg||
nt|tokay1975: agree|pg||
nt|mr murray: should |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: looks to be heading for same result as OR|pg||
nt|pelu: even in the club most players would be in 6@D after 1@D - 1@H - 2@C - 2@S (4.suit) 3@C - Now S know 3-3 and he will just ask for key-cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... the light opening propels South.  Now imagine South is the dealer and opens 1@D ... it's all a lot harder for North, who doesn't know that South has A-AK in the majors to ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cover his losers there|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even here, with all the good things that have happened, South needs clubs to divide 4-3, which is only about a 65% cvhance|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lebridgeur: made now I told you that it was a very tricky defensive|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: OK, 6, finessing for @S 10|pg||
pc|s7|nt|blum1956: It takes time to make all the calculations (mostly conditional) at the table. And you are noy always right(|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|jbgood: it looked as if W hesitated before playing the @h Queen, maybe that put Fantoni off?|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't even need that (though it would have been clear) anymore|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: If defense had persisted in clubs, declarer would have been in danger of going down 2.|pg||

nt|jcmax: True Kit. But how does s then Know tha his holding of QJTxxx,-, xx Qxxxx makes a grand. Whereas QJTxxx,-, xx Qxxxxx wouldn't make a slam?|pg||
nt|kit: He couldn't.  But if South held QJ10xx, A, Kx, Qxxxx I'll bet he would know.|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes he has extra chance  against 52 clubs and diamonds in good side|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Correct ... he will still make on some 5-2 club breaks|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: unlucky 4@H for e/w  if 2 spades are casshed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: the heart lead might not prove that safe. for example, dummy might have Q9x|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I cannot see any position to have a problem  to play Queen of @h  and South gave the count|pg||
nt|jcmax: I doubt that would be a 3@C bid in their methods.|pg||
nt|ady: its easy from here   but north cannot know of the 6th spade in south hand  with only 10 black cards  even with void heart  or even ace  what about possible diamond loser|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: looks like a strong NT to me|pg||
nt|othered1: EW in the other room have gone for some substantial, undoubled numbers.|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl showing a max?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think they would have gotten there on the actual hand -- all I'm saying is that there is nothing to lose by trying.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D xfert |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: spec ask: if w duck the @C? then No need to play @CK to make on cross-ruff - if he play @c10 then down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: with trumps 4-1 very sticky|pg||
nt|ady: seems went down 4 OR|pg||
nt|jcmax: You see I am going to play with Norberto in a few weeks. I have to defend his actions. :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: true Sabine :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: i think this will go off in practice|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10-13 and unbalanced, 5+ spades for Nunes opening|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teach him something, Sabine :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|blum1956: Less expensive than 5@h (-990 instead of -1100)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they will get to 4@h here too|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|blum1956: only a trump lead and a heart return guarantee the success of the defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: if Nunes disards dims on this which seems natural when east gets in with spade ace its heart heart ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think S will make now. Discard 2 @h and play 3 rounds oof @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: belay that....|pg||
nt|othered1: east might get fatally tapped on continued @S plays for extra undertricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West may be tempted by 5@d now - may think singleton spade with East |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like Villa are starting to fall behind a bit |pg||
nt|othered1: Is that pass forcing?  I don't think it should be.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Duboin cannot bid any more he may doubl;e of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like they did against Newcastle a few weeks ago?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: max and maj|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: difficult decision for west|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: better line|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lebridgeur: this results could be well duplicated in open room|pg||
nt|kit: Opening lead could be key here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and this couold be 500 and a hefty 14 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: But, not surprisingly, west solves it correctly|pg||
nt|ady: nice result for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think south has a 2@H anyway|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes dbl  is to  with max |pg||
nt|kit: And that was the loser|pg||
nt|pelu: a heavy 2@S bid|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: not much for the crowd here...let's open the Cinzano or Primitivo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Impossible a swing with this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be these world class operators wont get this defence wrong|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Super result for E/W here ... successfully staying low on a very tempting vulnerable setup|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s9|nt|kit: declarer can take quick spadepitch|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually even my dog would probabbly get it right |pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s may well be a make from Duboin's point of view - for example one trick in each side suit and that's all. Therefore to double that was  not an easy decision|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to show where his values lay|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt made in  board 9 againsta  bad defence|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzrr: bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now Nunes may just discard hearts and play diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: cash 4 in right oprder and ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might well have unblocked the @DK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: Failla hoping .... against hope|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: might only make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not impossible a priori -- 6N makes without heart lead|pg||
nt|kit: But still uppercut danger|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: But west has a pretty good record of making winning decisions|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with the ruff in @S he must play @C - obliged|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mr murray: very heavy but is perfect on layout|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: A @s switch now will defeat!|pg||
nt|kit: however, then ace of diamond, diamond ruff, heart to king, low heart|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ady: may still be a trump promotion  |pg||
nt|kit: and this is not double-dummy -- he has full count of hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need try A in @H in west|pg||
nt|ady: should play 4th club after ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Another possibility is to play fourth round of clubs now|pg||
nt|kit: I guess simplest is to play heart now, then ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Duboin led a club in the other room after Fantoni opened 1NT (12-14) and Nunes responded 3@C (5-card Stayman ask)|pg||
nt|kit: Going back toopening lead, West had clue that his partner didn't double the artificial 2@D call, so maybe he should have avoided diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fairness, would anyone double with just @DQ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also small @H now - if A np, else A@D @D ruff and @H again - no way to beat with KQ@H in the dummy|pg||
nt|kit: no, but with QJxx(x) they would|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: not withn Duboing and nthen smell of blood in his nostrils|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW A SORT OF DEFENSIVE CROSSRUFF|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry to shout|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well nunes has found the a trump switch by west at that point would have defeated surely|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and also the finesse in @s - so a dream ...|pg||
nt|pelu: if u dont play 2-0-1 GF then 2@D from W and rase 2@S to 3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|kit: since otherwise largely a guess between diamond and spade lead, perhaps the failure to double 2@D should tip the scales|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: that  is a dangerous opponent its fair to say |pg||
nt|roswolf: not a good card|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: too late now|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps   leaders pulling away|pg||
pc|h9|nt|deltadash: wrong club :(|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: Nunes did well to discard hearats rather than dims|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: The  trump switch did not defeat as Nunes could set uo a heart trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: I mean that Nunes misplayed the contract by playing a @h from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes good point|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|othered1: Dbl of 5@H in OR kept them out of the good six.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW seem to have missed their cold slam next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H 11 tricks, next case|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S doesn't get a spade lead necessarily -- support and honor holdings are two different things.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As pointed out, 4@S would be two too high, saving me!|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: a game try of 41H seems appropriate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S to give the lead is possible in MP, in IMP can be dangerous - i think better to use a convention, like dbl to give the lead @S (and not for @D)|pg||
mb|r|nt|othered1: But NS have a good save in 7m (esp @D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: same bidding to 2@s in OR|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: heart lead, spade knocked out, another low heart, then W squeezed late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D would show spades|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 6@H doubled with overtrick may gain points|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out that EW in OR had kept themselves out of slam, then were doubled|pg||
nt|blum1956: Will Sementa figure out that his partner has just one side card, not two&|pg||
nt|othered1: In an auction with both sides bidding up with double fits, just buying the contract may be enough to win the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting here that North has stayed out of this auction. |pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR the double NS fit was known.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Perhaps he has no descriptive action - not that anything seems particularly obvious |pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Where is that button?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: yes   correct|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S running diamonds before spades so as to end in dummy|pg||
nt|blum1956: will Nunes remove this?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, that's really an interesting point. When it looks like your opponents are going to outbid I don't think it makes much sense to support partner just for the sake of supporting ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: him. I prefer when it conveys a message. |pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S in OR = 8-10 HCP and 3 card|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Fantoni warned off from further action with his decent hand|pg||
nt|ady: 1st round west overcalled 1@H in OR   north doubled   |pg||
nt|othered1: What was 2N?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2 keycards and a void - they should have a special bid for that case|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some kind of relay you would think|pg||
nt|othered1: I doubt 2N was natural. Other than that I've had suggestions of various hands, from cue-bid to, asks other suit, to shows @H fit.  Maybe 2@D means something other than simple ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Michaels?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2 key cards and a void could still have 2 minor losers of course|pg||
mb|2H|nt|blum1956: Is the 1@h 3rd in hand also strong by their system?|pg||
nt|ady: cashes the diamonds before completing the spades |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: another  4@s made  |pg||
nt|othered1: It's suggested they play Ghestem and that 2@D is specific to majors.|pg||
nt|deltadash: who's got the button???? lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's state that the blind lead is difficult. Or as Jan Wohlin, Swedish top player and author wrote in one of his books: "Don't ever lead, it's too difficult!"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm struggling to find a defence to beat 4@H ... is there one?|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: please tell|pg||
nt|bjacobs: lots of suggestions coming my way!|pg||
nt|pelu: try @H A and @H = only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I think there is a winner in them ... the low spade lead from North|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lebridgeur: good sacrifice in @h|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4C|nt|kit: I'm surprised that, holding KQx hearts and 4-3-3-3 that North bothered looking for 4-4 spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: no - but may be|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: both   ruff @d :):)|pg||
nt|blum1956: It was a difficult task for Nunes. His hand is worst possible from the defensive point of view but he knows few about partner's hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one spec  points that 4 @s  goes down on the " obvious" @s lead he is right on principle|pg||
nt|blum1956: But in this vulnerability he probably loses only 200 if 5@h proves to be wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 2@D is majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then he can get in, cross to partner's @CQ and take two more spades|pg||
nt|pelu: i count - but pl corect me : now 5@Hs + 3@D + 1@S|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry S has to follow 4 times in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes one way or another should have been able to bid 3N with finality, |pg||
nt|kit: Seems to me much more likely that both contracts will take 9 tricks than that 10 in spades and only 8 in notrump.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: I think there is almost no such thing as a truly "blind" lead -- there are always some clues|pg||
nt|jcmax: Andy robson once told me that all his partner's were brilliant opening leaders. Now you maybe can work out why :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: isn´t there a small danger to have a 4-card major as side suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Tricky isn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I surrender :(:(:(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, we won't see the play in that tantalizing 4@H|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ady: 5@H doubled  then losing points|pg||
nt|blum1956: If 4NT is RKCB then it was enough to show 2 keycards with @hQ (which Duboin surely has)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lebridgeur: nt so sure  South was right to pass  with  KQJ  in @h opposite a 6 or 7 cards suit|pg||

pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: if E holds his giant hearts|pg||

nt|kit: West afraid declarermight be sneaking a diamond through from KQJ, and tht his partner has natural trump trick|pg||
nt|kit: He is trying to see if ducking the diamond and letting partner lead a club can do any good|pg||
nt|jcmax: Guys, my son has 5 friends visiting who just decided they want to stay overnight. I need to get some order in the chaos. sorry about that. I hope you all enjoy the rest of the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: show. good night all!|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will conclude that it won't be of value -- if declarer has only 3 spades the contract won't be making anyway|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Hope you've got a big garden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, priv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last segment today. Four more tomorrow and the last set Sunday morning local time|pg||

nt|kit: is he still thinking operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For vugraph schedule, please go to  http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may operator is sleeping ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|kit: surprising to see him having this much difficulty -- the logic appear straightforward.  If declarer has 3 spades and not solid diamonds, the contract isn't making, so might as well ...|pg||
nt|kit: go up ace.  Unless I'm missing something.|pg||
nt|kit: Can anybody find a layout where ducking can gain (from West's point of view)?|pg||

nt|jbgood: Varese gaining ground with the last two ..|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: transfer I presume|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes 8 imps. And 12 more on the board were Fantoni allowed 5@d to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: mayhem may eventuate here|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3C?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a stretch in OR   held to 7 trricks on trump lead   though difficult from KX|pg||
nt|othered1: double seems normal, |pg||
nt|othered1: Double, in theory, is for takeout of @H on these auctions.  South has extras to justify it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stronger than 3@S|pg||
nt|kit: does anybody know what 2@Cis?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||

mb|4H|nt|jbgood: 3 @c not on my cc - puppet?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes, I think a direct raise would show a good hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Fantunes play 12-14 in all positions, can be 6322, 5422 and even 4441 shape, not 5-4 in the majors, though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - but calling 4@H not easy for e/w don't call 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C generic forcing without 5 cards out|pg||
nt|kit: North also bidding his small doubleton -- interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@S sign off opposite an invite|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s miss their fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C is a transfer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South can try a DBL here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: made :)|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S a totally unnecessary overbid IMO -- opponents have already exchanged information, so what is the point?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: then 5 @h is too optimistic|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: overstatement by west   probably tht 4@H making  so made advanced sacrifice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is hairy as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The question is: how can declarer set up his clubs without losing control?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks hopeless, but note, he has only 2 losers ... perhaps he can afford to lose 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|mr murray: doesn't matter what he does he will make it|pg||
nt|mr murray: cards very friendly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm pretty sure that's an inaccurate statement!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He can't simply play clubs from dummy, because East can get a club ruff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: Did Garbosi forget their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am told 2 @h is two way  weak support in @s or stong with @h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only 10imps difference with 36 boards to go   but this one could be bad for Garbosi|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the 4@s bid should of course imply the weak spade support hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump lead beats 5@s, other leads probably do not|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like that weak nt is back|pg||
nt|mr murray: heart to hand and club up|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: transfer seems like it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: let us see |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1500 kibs watching this match here on BBO - quite a crowd!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @d attracting  on the bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: If North leads a heart the declarer wins and plays on diamonds. If the defense plays trumps twice the diamond suit works otherwise two hearts may be ruffed|pg||
nt|othered1: over 3@C, south's hand does look defensive and there's nothing certain about any offensive action|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the key will be to discard the blocking club on a trump at some stage|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means support in @H limit or + - i agree 4@S can be too much|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should just bid 3@S -- his partner will have better idea whether or not 4@H is making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: And opponents haven't bid to 4@H yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: !|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: if S has "Limit + " chances of 4S goading N into 5H are greatly reduced|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well done    no declarer task very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead triumph|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ace of @s and @c  should easier now|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might have been a little more enterprising -he might have doubled 2nt to show values in the minors - but he no doubt is deflated by the poor run of boards|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer doesn't have 9 top tricks here.  |pg||
nt|kit: I think he goes up ace of hearts and attacks clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tempting to let it ride but they lead 3rd from any holding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@H and @C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: asking for 5crd majors, or a possible 4441|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|blum1956: Even the trump is OK |pg||
nt|ady: should make this for a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He was tempted|pg||
nt|kit: Why did he finesse?  Now if queen of diamonds is off, diamond shift defeats him.|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure we will have a swing here - IN OR EW in 4@sX|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: ouch wasnt the low heart a clear signal for a club?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is then a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now he is in BIG trouble, because he can't play clubs twice from his hand|pg||
nt|mr murray: timing bad|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|roswolf: hmm this may work as well but i like to show partnership solidarity|pg||
nt|bridge_one: have the chance to make the @H trick - else can make 9 tricks finding one trick in @D or @s|pg||
nt|kit: the heart finesse winning doesn't help him particularly, but it can hurt when it loses|pg||
nt|ady: agreed    top heart and club is safe|pg||
nt|kit: I can't think of any layout where taking heart finesse at trick 1 is superior|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however agree to play A in @H at first trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But can't you be short of entries for the clubs if you win @HA?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: no@c10?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|lebridgeur: yes but  will take longer|pg||
nt|kit: He still wouldn't be cold -- West could win club and lead another heart, and dummy might be short an entry -- but  if that happens can take heart finesse then.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mr murray: he should have had another heart in dummy to lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To be honest, I still don't see how the hand could be made, even though GIB says it could have been|pg||
nt|pelu: but even af @h to J, @C to J @H to hand - 2XH and now a @C rgen A@D will kill him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what I figured as well Peter, so we are going to have to excuse Madala for going down ... if we cannot make it seeing all four hands, it must be a difficult one|pg||
nt|mr murray: if he had had a nother heart in dummy he couuld oplay it and a club towards dumy and claim|pg||
pc|d2|nt|blum1956: heart signal probably|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: only @h will do|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: Not really, West wins @CA and punches him with a diamond|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mr murray: needed not to play second heart so soon|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: yes, but J10 in @h are sufficient to wait one time|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D denies a 5422 hand, 5 spades still possible, so 3@S shows 3 cards|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: do you like 1nt on this hand Roland? I don´t|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's systemic, so I can't really comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H = transfer?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but they must find their 3nt with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like possible swing, as 4@S certainly has a lot of play.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like you need to guess which heart to play from the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west regretting response on poor hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: Personally I would lead a heart -- safer, and if spades is right should be time to shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: well np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pinning the stiff 8 would certainly be great|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, I can't answer everyone ... anyway, no point talking to me - I don't know how to make that last hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Can't you just take a couple of diamond ruffs, coming to 5 trumps, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 1 diamond -- unless trump lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|deltadash: easy game, isn't it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes:)|pg||

nt|ady: surprices east did not try the jack|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lebridgeur: and another 12 Imps swing|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe on club lead the entries are short for that|pg||
nt|ady: deceptive heartlead maybe  |pg||
nt|kit: But still, setting up fifth heart is enough -- 4 spades, 2 clubs, 1 diamond, 3 hearts.  Even 4-1 split doesn't matter.|pg||
nt|kit: So, on 3-2 spade split can just draw trumps and claim basically|pg||
pc|h8|nt|blum1956: well 100 is close to what EW deserve|pg||
nt|0  bamba: 4@c is -2 whit a perfect DEF|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: even if it holds   still 1 trick short|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: Even on 4-1 spade split, 3-2 hearts is good enough|pg||
pc|h5|nt|0  bamba: @s now|pg||

nt|bjacobs: All right, board 29:  heart at trick 2, club to the jack (or king), then another club,  ruff the diamond, play a third club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: possible slam|pg||
nt|kit: possible swing here if slam is reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4 of a major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: people open and respond on such light hands these days that you need 1NT "sandwich" as strong balanced - but whether a flat 15-count is worth it is debatable|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 2@S if allowed to play    small loss|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: sry folks, have to leave you. Bye all|pg||
nt|blum1956: he has a good hand - 5-card suit, controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S will call slam|pg||
nt|ady: only nade 11 tricks OR     must has miss guessed hearts|pg||
nt|mr murray: heart 10 a mirage|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: If that happens, can swith to ruffing 2 diamonds, with ace of clubs still entry|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: 3 @c and 3! aces for defence look avaialble here|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 nt will not make ¨- neither would 2 @c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then West has no more diamonds, and you can win @SA, draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s is better than 3@c|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: 2H response would sometimes work out well by protecting club holding (or in other ways), but usually right to show 4-card support immediately|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not a  bad contract but   @s far behaving|pg||
pc|cA|nt|blum1956: try crossruff - trump coup may probably work in the ending. But Nunes is not aware of the trump position|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   may go down   but not 3 down    £@S   should be fown  so another pick up for Villa|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best lead....|pg||
nt|roswolf: this bidding looks odd as many transfer responses are|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would expect north to play nt a vast majority of the time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: entrys to hand may be awkward|pg||
nt|roswolf: will be awkward|pg||
nt|deltadash: the entire hand looks awkward to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: setting up the spade suit seems to appeal to many specs - i agree|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a lot of defense in the East hand therefore not suitable for trupping|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well done to "Private" who provided the winning solution|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: A heart lead is safer on this hand but i understand west's reluctance to lead it|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer seems to agree too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: The play is rather clear, play on @d and @h. Otherwise you will lose 2@s 1 @h, 1@c and 1@c|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting board 13 in the other room. I'd like to know why Helgemo dropped the stiff @SK offside in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Dubion in OR   finessed 2nd round of hearts  |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: operator ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: he hears you|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Table feel I suppose|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South was afraid about to play slam knowing North without singleton and limited strength|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed ralf|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Against the odds|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@d makes with a diamond guess only|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: and if pd has doubled without the king, very likely he has little elsewhere so it will not cost the contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: a straightforward 4@S -i doubt whether they will go for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 10-13, 5+ spades, unbalanced|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: looks like a dull 3N here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|blum1956: very well done in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: may get to the wrong spot|pg||
nt|ady: yes 5@D the only game with a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: By unbalanced I mean not 5332|pg||
nt|blum1956: interesting board|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: Interesting that West doesn't raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in front at a passed hand east could bid also 2@h|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@h also works|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  also |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: is 1H what we would all bid? and would we pass 1H as W ?|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can makr 9 tricks in clubs |pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: 4@S doomed|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 7h if they bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ady: specs asking what 3@C is    anyone know?|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now this shold be easy for Duboin provided that Sement shows diamond suit ans short spades|pg||
nt|ady: paaarently transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: CC says Stayman, transfers, shortness at 3-level - not much on second-round actions|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@C is 5+@D + 4@H or 6@D+1@C, 3@D is relay, 3@S in short in spades with 5+@D + 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: That describes 12 of east's cards very well.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt i think showed clubs|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kit: Continued debate whether South should bid Stayman with 4-3-3-3.  Takes a lot for 4 of a major to take 10 tricks while 3NT 8.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: hovewer i think 1@S by East obliged (if 1@H stnd)|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why North didn't bid 4@S?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: RD ?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like this 2@S call one bit -- partner might not even have 4 spades, and wrong hand gets tapped.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s 3 cards after pass at 1@H rdbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he did the exact smae thing before you got here Kit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can pass now|pg||
nt|kit: ah, good point Giorgio|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  19|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  now making game either in hearts or diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: not that dull|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @s lead can create problems for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Nort must duck a heart |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes and then?|pg||
nt|blum1956: any lead may create ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i see he may have difficulties in establishing and enjoying 2 @hs|pg||
nt|kit: But I'm still not so sure I like it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jbgood: ... but the spade king:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a spec opines that 2nt might be 2way either sygnoff in clubs or setting in spades |pg||
nt|deltadash: I think we're on the fast track now|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is certain now = wrong again:(|pg||
nt|deltadash: Oh, well, Geoff, we've all been there many times and will be again :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never in the picture in the other room|pg||
mb|5H|nt|othered1: Has east limited his hand yet?|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@H a fine slam - 7@H need @CK in S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, East might give it a whirl ... there are some other chances as well|pg||
nt|tokay1975: picks  up diamonds even they are 42  with 32 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Even if he ruffs high should go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: not possible to ruff two clubs|pg||
mb|7H|nt|kit: On the same logic, shouldn't East be able to work out opponents are in 7-card fit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we trying for a grand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not|pg||
nt|deltadash: I think we're done now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer's hopes will be up when defense doesn't run clubs, but the 4-2 heart split defeats him|pg||
nt|kit: I would think that South would promise 4-card spade suit for this sequence, but maybe not.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the best bid by S over partner's second double is RD, asking N to bid something:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tokay1975: wd|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he whirled away|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After all, West is quite a good declarer|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: oh, sorry -- didn't see who had bid 3@H|pg||
nt|pelu: 1) @H lead for sure = only 1 @C-ruff - @CK onside 50% @D 3-3 <%|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps you can set up the diamonds even if they are 4-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So  I think this contract is about 80+%|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes  easy  against 42  diamonds  enough entrys|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You don't need to take even a single club ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: can you see any solution after this lead and N ducks @h?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a conservative pass at 2@S by North could be made in this auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now discard a @D seam the best line|pg||
nt|kit: Not surprisingly, this hand plays a lot better in clubs than in spades|pg||
nt|kit: yes, diamond discards seem right -- but with spades 4-2 I don't think that will be good enough|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: not sure about the discard. i think ruff with queen of spades then lead jack maybe|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: not so dull commentators curse strikes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 10@S in South this line it is OK|pg||
nt|tokay1975: after a trump lead  geir thks  trumps  are 32|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: however this line is winning with @S 3/3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: 5@D apparantly was the first limited bid made by east|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: why overtake 10@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he bid a lot so he wants to take the tricks on defense:)|pg||
nt|kit: If East has Qxx of diamonds, as indicated, then both black suits can't be splitting|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: so it might not be right to go all out to make|pg||
