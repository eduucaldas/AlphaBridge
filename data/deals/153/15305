nt|lestergold: 3n by Rosen in closed looks a bit damp|pg||
nt|jallerton: Neil Rosen chose 3NT over 2@c.  Frances hinden is giving her side a chance with the slow route|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think it was wringing wet|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d 4th suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: east now comes alive having underbid somnewhat on second round|pg||
nt|lestergold: chance then here for Bowles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's worth 2.5 @C I suppose but he does not have that card in his bidding box|pg||
nt|jallerton: not likely to get to 3NT now, although I think 3@s from West is best played as a NT probe rather than definitely 5/6|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C looks on the spot now|pg||
nt|lestergold: west'shand is very slammish and i think Rosen's bid in closed was lazy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frances in the tank still|pg||
nt|jallerton: in standard bidding there is no good way to bid hands like West's|pg||
nt|lestergold: a iminimum opener is allowed to have 6 good clubs and a @d control which makes west's hand a slam try even on a min rebid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: and 4@C it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: an agreement in vogue 20 years ago, the Baron 2NT response showing 16-18 BAL works on hands like this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That should do the trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: well frances is certainly on my wavelength|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4NT encouraging|pg||
nt|jallerton: (not Blackwood)|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has the nuts|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: A new table would also be for take-out|pg||
nt|jallerton: which John Howard might have worked out before choosing to save over it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double rather|pg||
nt|lestergold: green and bennet did they not used to be junior england?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jallerton: no need to lead from AK when you have all the suits locked up.  Trump lead to cut down on ruffs looks right|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i always think that you should use a double of a conventional 2nt as a message that you have some desire to compete which would have worked very well here|pg||

pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hinden had no desire to compete|pg||
nt|roswolf: you can as west make a positive call if you have a decent -ish hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: double of 2NT would indeed be responsive, but partner might expect more than a Queen and two Jacks|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think unfave vulhe would|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i am a great believer in trying to take advantage of opps systemic bids abd here a decent game has been missed through not being active enough although i agree that east ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: should double again|pg||

pc|d4|nt|roswolf: on board 7 the other room as expected stayed in a partscore|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 6 segments of 8 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Geoffrey Wolfarth, Jeffrey Allerton and Mike Gold|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Brian McGuire|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Players still not seated|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Geoff Jeff Roland Brian and specs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am at the venue, the Young Chelsea Bridge Club|pg||
nt|lestergold: Are u there to deal the cards Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|jallerton: Perhaps Roland will take over the operating later if an operator needs a rest|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect this board to be a quiet partscore but the yc style of bidding is always colourful and unpredictable|pg||
nt|lestergold: For the benefit of the non UK specs the Young Chelsea was appropriately named.... when it was founded.... some forty odd years ago....|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the average player there is not quite as young these days|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i was a member once .....long ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: i still am it is a mo0st remarkable club|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed a tribute to its founder - it was hard work for Warwick in the early days|pg||
nt|lestergold: more of an institution than a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup a young institution|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS play 5-card majors with a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Warwick ran it is a service to the game rather than for personal profit and deserves an award|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW  2/1  with a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ready to go|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a pity pushy by north|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frances Hinden (Finch) is one of our regular vugraph commentators|pg||
nt|lestergold: to be fear his playing stremngth is consioderable|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@h seems reasonable to me: @hAx and @cJ opposite, for example|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed mike but south needs to be restrained|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: unfortunately his partner does not have a pip in his suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will be starting with boards 7 and 8 in this room, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a typical yc colourful bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 segments of 8 boards in this final|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|lestergold: vul games need to be bid |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: and 3NT might roll home here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: it migyht wll|pg||
nt|jallerton: with @hAx onside|pg||
nt|lestergold: very lucky lie of cards|pg||
nt|jallerton: and @dA onside|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm but pushing too hard is a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but today the disaster looks like for e/w|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: It's a terrible contract, really, but nothing the defence can do|pg||
nt|lestergold: Green has no option here but to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: well declarer may finesse in spades in due coursefor a minus score|pg||

mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|sybarra: We should be back in about 10 min or so |pg||

nt|vugraphzrx: 2@D weak 2 in a major 5-9 points|pg||
nt|dburn: this needs two finesses, so it was not quite as awful as 3NT earlier, but it will still not make - 3NT, on the other hand, would have done|pg||
nt|henryb:  I can see how declarer takes 9 tricks, but not 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: David are they all "deliberate" (slow) at the other table?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or do we just have the speed demons?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: and 3NT was in theory a worse contract but in practice a better one, since it needs the diamond finesse and either 4-4 clubs or South not to have been dealt a club lead|pg||
