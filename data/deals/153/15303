nt|sybarra: Running score: http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a pair event, so the home and away is just for comparison |pg||
nt|sybarra: that transfer was just what pard wanted to hear |pg||
nt|dimi: would you X witj N hand Gabor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: allways like it when they understand each other|pg||
nt|sybarra: they do also :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: no|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: an optimistic contract but cars klay very favourably for n/s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: it seems this is just going home playing on the red suits|pg||
nt|dimi: i think that S should reopen after 2@h - p- p - |pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: dead certain that he do not have a single diamond now|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the club shift obvious?  and is that what should be done next?|pg||
nt|haans: looks easy to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Skrzypczak's fingers are moving between 7 @c and 3 @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier from this vantage point for sure|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass around? Ain't P from N a semi force pass? Anyway they are lucky not ending in 3NT down|pg||
nt|cicus: but I may reopen 2@H with the S hand|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: its about a 10% contract if that|pg||
nt|lestergold: now has to pick the @ds|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: in fact I am sure I'd reopen|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: this should be easy  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: right play - can't afford to dislodge spade entry for an uncertain finesse|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||

nt|sybarra: 7 consinants in a row!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: but I mistakenly told you it would make - no, W still has his @DK as an entry|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: playing equal level conversion, I might have doubled 1@H with 4@S+5@D|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: If he cannot make it then it is not makeable, a compliment.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|vugraphzsc: try to pronounce Skshipchak - that it's )))|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wonders I would never be able to say that name |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes, @H 2-2, easy on the line of play.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: see a 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|lestergold: needed 3 finesses and a bit more too|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|haans: try say HI you!|pg||
nt|dimi: NS will try 4@h i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|cicus: equal level conversion (ELC) is when you X then correct partner's bid on the same level, without promising extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: EW may make 5 of a minor here (especially 5@D) if NS don't find their ruff|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: it is sort of like trying to speak dutch for me,  my throat muscles were never trained for those noises|pg||
nt|haans: Lionel double?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22HP NS but with nice harmony|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but what is wrong with 5@S as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|lestergold: here isa somewhat more robust game|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|haans: double = spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I adore the Neth.  been there many times, |pg||
nt|rodal f: NS play precission|pg||
nt|dimi: lucky for Versace that NS did not miss a @h fit after his 1@s bis|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a bunch of clubs can be made,  not  sure if they can handle 5 of not |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  so 2 @C,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: no way to claim @c as a trump |pg||
nt|sybarra: so 2 @D rather,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: after 2@d rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: N asked about DBL and got answer "for take out". does it helps declarer?|pg||
nt|dimi: ...bid|pg||
nt|cicus: e.g. 1@H-X-p-2@C-p-2@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so they probably will bid slam|pg||
nt|rodal f: So B19 more interesting then this coffeboard?:)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: true, cant get there from here |pg||
nt|cicus: this has to be played in good tempo|pg||
nt|lestergold: nopt really interestimng just brutal over bidding rewarded with a favourable layout|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@H must show a weak hand so maybe they won't get past the 5 level|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsc: having 4 cards in both majors, E led a trump|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive N's X was negative. So why did they loose the @H color?|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 @Ds must be ruffed so trumps cannot be drawn|pg||
nt|cicus: also, @Hs must be established|pg||
nt|dimi: useful convention|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might but by que's it's easy to stop|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|haans: yes good help|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: but being doubled is no good|pg||
nt|cicus: best continuation|pg||
nt|cicus: declarer must also take care of not conceding a @H ruff|pg||
nt|cicus: not at all easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well should stop of course maybe at 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or 4 after S denied Q in @C|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: Egorov a bit to active here. WHAT have W promissed? 0HP+      and he bid freely? HUM|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like 2 down from here - we'll see|pg||
nt|cicus: now if he ruffs a @D, he must play a low @H from dummy I think|pg||
nt|dimi: but you should remeber it, otherwise it can end in a disaster|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: kwik klaim|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: E will "fall off chair" with Q from W |pg||
pc|cT|nt|rnmalik: should make now by playing@C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: making +1.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: only slightly amazed is my guess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cant avoid ruffing 2 @D |pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: now again, only @D ruff then low @H is successful|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say Q@H now, would it make a difference, difficult hand.|pg||
nt|cicus: it is easy to see now that @H ace concedes a @H ruff for the defence|pg||
nt|cicus: not the best idea here|pg||

nt|fifee: ty :) hi Rodal :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have a nice day Gabor|pg||
mb|r|nt|fifee: hello diane @H|pg||
nt|cicus: this must be some oe-suiter|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@H and 2@S.|pg||
nt|cicus: I doubt N will complete the transfer|pg||
nt|cicus: he's considering 2@H and 2!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 6@S, may bid 2@S.|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: easy so far|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has potential to get a little too high e/w can only make 8 legitimate tricks in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Diane,  look at South's name,  8 consinants in a row,  want to pronounce it?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, with a very lucky lie in @Hs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: no reason to bid on|pg||
nt|dimi: exactly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and more easy now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs will be sound to be 3/3,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *found|pg||
nt|cicus: when you have 4 losers with a 2-suiter, partner often contributes a 5th loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: lol - I surrender!!!|pg||
nt|haans: well done Skrypzak|pg||
nt|haans: c|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: rz ))|pg||
nt|cicus: I have to say 4@S by E is over-aggressive in my view|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unfortunately is an overbid which will NOT be rewarded |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: so even easier  at end of day |pg||
nt|cicus: here, W will inevitably take a @H trick and lead a trump through|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u bid freely 2@S, Mike?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Hi Patricia:)|pg||
nt|cicus: so declarer is going to lose 3 @Hs|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|sybarra: may shoot a @D back and he does|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But not that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: although that was not best |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|fifee: 2@H is probably a transfer showing a decent 2@S raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot see what west's  shapeless 11 count minus worthless @h J justifies this raise|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: no i dont like it minimumum with horrible spade suit |pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzsc: EW are beginners|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzsc: I have it easy - my granny was Polish|pg||
nt|sybarra: our operator Sveta gave us a hint:  try to pronounce Skshipchak - that it's )))|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|deltadash: Sveta has an 'inside' source :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we should call him "shipwreck"   (no offense) |pg||
nt|cicus: the suit has holes, 3@Hs is a flaw and he has too much defence|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass from me at E's hand and bid 2@S if W Xed. Showing the weak hand E have|pg||
nt|lestergold: agree Frank however i dont think west has a jump raise even given east's overbid worth 3@s at best|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: or nice word is "novice" |pg||
nt|dimi: would not be my choice, was intended as a defense vs 4@h or 3nt|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|deltadash: right again, Patti :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H 3/3, would make 2@S.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|fifee: 1@s 2@s being a bit weaker|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Or a invtational bid wourth 3@S? As exsplained. Never seen that before.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: tomorrow, we have semifinal and final in teams, yes|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|deltadash: works for me :)|pg||
nt|cicus: now even an overtrick|pg||
nt|cicus: could be vital in such a short match|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: at end of daty west has almost no values except for good spades|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: too late|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: Sveta,   at some point you may tell him the silly USA types have new nickname for him |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: well, if we got Pepsi from Pszczola - why not?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with @H guess, NS can make 4@D, or without the @H even can pitch on @C, but the cards are not very friendly for this contract.|pg||
nt|lestergold: @d holding worth a maybe trick thats all|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: nice indeed|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||

mb|1H|nt|deltadash: thx Haans|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: not sure I like the 1 @H bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: yuk|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: so am I, but funny to see all 4 having bids|pg||
nt|rodal f: For new specs. Running scores: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/wilpairs.html|pg||
nt|cicus: many would have opened that E hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fifee: how many like the reverse with this hand?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dimi: E has a normal w2 opening |pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Moisant in @H or NT or @C contract?|pg||
nt|fifee: I don't particularly because the suits are not great|pg||
nt|deltadash: got a few holes, but what can you do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we saw it last session Sveta,  every 10 bid like they had a mountain |pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 pt hand bid like a mountain |pg||
nt|ralfwil: But somtimes I have to regret not to bid a 4-card major when opps have 5-4:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: actually, I can understand it well - if someone paid entry fee, (s)he isn't here to pass|pg||
nt|cicus: but I like the pass with that mediocre suit and no distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: how do you feel about 2 suited balancing,  is there another bid?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 3, 4@H made on a @C lead.|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems to me the father is a more aggressive bidder than the son|pg||
nt|rodal f: X=3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: east support double|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: At the endge for mePatricia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But wisely passed by E, many partnerships dont like to preempt an unpassed P.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: 3@s might be to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that is another way to look at it Sveta|pg||
nt|haans: que = any good 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|haans: balacing hand|pg||
nt|deltadash: works for me - this plan obviously wasn't the best|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Here the declarer has 3 losers, so should make 4@H.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S loser can be pitched on K@C, if @S not attacked now.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: many use it and also use jump to 2nt 19-21 natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be hard to find the 8th trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|deltadash: it's a friendly hand for declarer - that always helps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fifee: utter nonsense ? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not laydownn hiowever its not easy to defend either|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: Danilo, suggests second X |pg||
nt|rodal f: edge*|pg||
nt|lestergold: best defence should beat it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|deltadash: me 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: me 4|pg||
nt|haans: me 4 ever :)|pg||
nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) :)|pg||
nt|haans: have we not fun :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) :) :)  seems appropriate |pg||
nt|deltadash: for sure :)|pg||
nt|haans: kib: lalislol: can I add to this?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Larry :)|pg||
nt|haans: Yep Hi Larry|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: he goes plus now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: not "our"  (n/s) best landing  |pg||
nt|cicus: this is 1 off but 3@D would have made so a possible gain|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
nt|dimi: in the end best contract for EW, 1NT is one down ... the same fate of a 2@S contract|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, if he'd opened, NS might now be in a higher contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|deltadash: we could ALL number off, Larry, but that may take awhile :(|pg||
nt|dimi: maybe 3@c|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|dimi: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Morning Roland specs and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Dimitri|pg||
nt|cicus: oh it seems west will get enndplayed |pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: I am sure "shipwreck" would rather be in clubs|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: no wreck in club harbour|pg||
nt|sybarra: Sveta has to not laugh at name until later  |pg||
nt|haans: see it from the good side clubs 2-2 so 2 clubs tricks|pg||
nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: at work, I'm unable even to smile )))|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cicus: not now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: a @d switch had been better after @cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi szots|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|cicus: if @CJ, then later (after hearts have gone) a small club endplays west with singleton @C9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit unlucky . Turn the A in @C and @H:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: So fare all boards from 22 til 24HP have been for bonus biddings while 26HP ain't enough for the same. Funny:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: even table for these pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: 4 boards remain|pg||
nt|fifee: Just 2 more rounds to go :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: less order remains at the end of the event, sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence should come to 3@s @h and 2@c|pg||

nt|deltadash: not your fault Sveta, you're doing a SUPER job and we appreciate you :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 5@D a make it they do not lead @D|pg||

nt|vugraphzsc: no single word...|pg||
nt|deltadash: that wouldn't have been my choice of bids, but what do I know??? :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand and depends playing 3NT or 4@H. |pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: east's 2 suits may have been majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H are not very friendly and @S 10 lead would create problems for the declarer.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: out of 5 hands that we have seen, except one all hands have been played in 4@H.|pg||
nt|cicus: Vytas in commanding position|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cicus: this may be anther gain for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south can ruff two clubs in dummy  as leading a trump loses a trump trick for the defence|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: not sure what tricks W expects to take |pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: must have been|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as 2@D is gameforce after the precission opening|pg||

nt|rodal f: If 2@D was gameforce, as I belive it was, S can't pass 3@S. Or...?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: overtrick on lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzsc: two-suiter with @h - explained|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can 2@C mean 2 suiter major? Seems so by W's bid|pg||

nt|rodal f: Specs told me 2@D as GF and 3@S as slamtry. Tks specs:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 20/20 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ralfwil: Easts hand looked more like a 4@h opening for me than 1@h|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes just found an email about it |pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Frank|pg||
nt|cicus: hi Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we hope "shipwreck" is not offended |pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: 3@H by W, promises 5@S + 4@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same here:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: U said a Roland, Mike?:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: I don't think Zaleski will gain 20 IMPs here so Vytas advances to the final|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and W in my opinion too strong for 4@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: If S use @SA by @S lead E can make 12 by @S@C squice at N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now a bit easyer:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not however a fascintaing hand on this occassion|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: 2nt on 15 hcp not my choice |pg||

pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: very difficult.|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, 15 will be enough|pg||

nt|rodal f: A spec told me that Brede won mixed pair in Pula with Joanna Brede with a bit over 57% Globetrotters?:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: he is bringing "tricks" in the spade suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: do not think the 4/1 trump break can do any damage here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: urkk|pg||
nt|deltadash: oops|pg||
nt|lestergold: this probabbluy makes 8 tricks as east can enjoy a club ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: stil, they will have to go down 2 doubled, otherwise at most 14 IMPs can be given away|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rnmalik: otherthan A@H, have no losers.|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, they could have afforded going 1 down in a grand slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Not cashed may make 7.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this 12 Board match. Thanks all.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@S is an inferior slam, but who cares|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

nt|rnmalik: As long as it is making.:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If I bid 6@S I find Jxxx with one defender|pg||

nt|lestergold: er maybe not doesnt appear to want one|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: If W had to play the @C then @CJ was needed from table and N alone holding @S and @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: fairly standard I think |pg||
nt|rodal f: The rusult or squice=;)|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|deltadash: true|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: Can finesse @C and ruff a @H in hand can make 7.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||

nt|rodal f: hehe|pg||
nt|lestergold: a little comical yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: declarer needed to do the hearts first|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer's play esnures 8 tricks one way or the other|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: but that was a bit doubole dummy|pg||
nt|cicus: he needed those tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: This was the last deal of this table. Still half of the segment left. See you all soon to see the last 6 boards|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
