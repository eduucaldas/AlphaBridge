nt|lestergold: problem for bennet is that his partnwer may take out the double not expecting him to hold most of the pack|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||

nt|djneill:  South 3@s = "anything you can have I don't care"|pg||
nt|jallerton: the 2NT response seems to have used up a lot of room.  If North starts with 2C, that gives South room to show interest|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Is 3@C the best call on the North hand?  What would 2! s mean?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are 2 boards ahead of the closed room now|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes what's best for North, 2@s (general GF) or 3@c|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Not a beautiful hand to lead from.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|djneill:  @sA lead normally bad, but when South shows a stopper, it's reasonable from AQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: I would prefer to save 3@c for a 5/5 when 2@S is available|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: good practical contract this -diamond lead protected|pg||
nt|djneill:  looks like North can pitch 2@d on long @c and @sK|pg||
nt|djneill:  so the @h hook appears to be a safety play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he needs not guess hearts|pg||
nt|jallerton: really?  Danger West gets in and leads a @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I should have put it differently|pg||
nt|djneill:  good word jeff, West is the "danger hand" meaning East cannot profitably attack @d as long as East is on lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can afford the safety play in hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well hes gone for that option but 300 does not comkpenwsate for vul game|pg||

nt|deltadash: you've got me :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't mind it - 3NT is quite a big position, and 3@s doubled will often go two down against a part score or three down against a game|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree.  If north's @H were A and fewer lower honors, 3@Sx could be bloody.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sometimes 1 down when game is making too matter of opinion i know at the table id bid 3N|pg||

nt|deltadash: very true, but I'm an optimist at heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: bridge always has many what ifs i think there is more equitu in making the vul game here than a big pena;ty need a computer analysis to settle this one|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not facing @sx @hAKQxx @diAKx @cQxxx it doesn't - then, 3NT is hopeless, 5@c is cold and 3@s doubled is -500|pg||

nt|lestergold: phantom of the opera strikes|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear, that 5@c bid - sometimes when it makes partner will raise it to six|pg||
nt|deltadash: for sure - that was a surprise to me!!|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at the vulnerability he was hoping either for a make or (more likely) for a save|pg||
nt|lestergold: its funny how we are programmed to believe that vul oppos are making the games that they bid |pg||

pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|c4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h8|nt|dburn: if he judges matters well he will get the "save" part in that he will lose only 300, but that was against a non-making game|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|deltadash: maybe it's because when we make vul game bids we THINK we're gonna make it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrx: I wonder if we'll have any flat boards this session :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east'sbid was justified 8 card suit and a bit outside |pg||
nt|lestergold: the sympathisers are speaking up|pg||
nt|dburn: fortunately, he can't play spades towards the queen because he needs to play clubs from the table, so he may escape for 300 anyway|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: although curiously enough, West does best to play a club at this point, leaving declarer the entries to get the spades wrong|pg||

nt|vugraphzrx: Aha. This could be a flat board.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: 3N or 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe, but declarer has more than nine tricks available in 3NT|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|dburn: indeed there was = South won the spade lead in dummy and carefully played a club to the nine, to guarantee four club tricks and nine in all|pg||

nt|vugraphzrx: 2@S range enquiry, 3@c maximum|pg||

pc|sT|nt|dburn: meanwhile, I suppose that on the lie of cards South could make six of either minor|pg||

mb|3S|nt|roswolf: now will west pass!?:)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jallerton: no. over a jump, pass is NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  West sees slam opposite random 10-counts, even grand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Acol Road is located in West Hampstead in NW London, where you also find the Acol Bridge Club|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jcwla: The X should be in a good overall hand, if you don't have that and just have a good holding in one of their suits just pass and hope they play that one.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty jeff|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: hiya|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's hand unfortunately is getting worse and worse, the more minors West shows - East's "random 10 HCP" is unfortunately concentrated in the majors, where West is likely not to want them|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will wondering what is going on|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo he is worth 5@D MINIMUM|pg||
nt|djneill:  bidding system concentrate on beginning of auction holdings - this bid shows this, this shows that - but you have to be able to reevaluate on the fly|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jallerton: I think he has to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is looking a little unhappy, confused, whatever, and eventually raises to 5@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: QT9 a nice @D holding even still.|pg||
nt|djneill:  yep|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 6@C or 6@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  just hope West has 5@d!|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: now the spotlight is on West.  Will she finesse or play for drop in @c?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|djneill:  West uses the old rule:  never play partner for the perfect hand - in this case, West could try for grand with a 5M cue-bid but it's just not possible to figure everything out cooperatively - East might not know exactly waht West wants|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2 x entry in @d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It looks tempting to finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|jallerton: she'll have found out about 4-1 @d, so is North 5512 or 5611?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: low diamond to dummy first|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point jeff, the 2@c michaels cue-bid gives West valuable distributional clues in th eplay|pg||
nt|djneill:  either way, both suits are not breaking evenly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only she wasn't this good she would make it easily (if that makes sense)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d6|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has the expected length in minors, and is expected to have the @dK since honors tend to be where the most cards are located|pg||
nt|jallerton: North might have bid 4@S with 5611 as Phil Clayton points out|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think finessing @C is not good you can cope with 3-1 break on some layouts (like here)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok, based on phil's suggestion of the (65)11 North would bid with, it makes sense to go for the 2-2 break now|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: Feels better to me|pg||
nt|dburn: if North had a singleton club, West would need to cash one trump, then force an entry to dummy in diamonds to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: 0 card fit shouldin general be better tha 8 card fit but bot so simple here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|dburn: and if he does that, he won't make his slam|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: in dims you soemtimes make when K@d is wrong and clubs are 3/1|pg||
nt|dburn: and the odds favour going wrong - clubs are more likely to be 3-1 than diamonds to be 4-1|pg||
nt|lestergold: if the short club is with the doubleton @d|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|dburn: here he goes|pg||
nt|othered1: and south should work this out|pg||
nt|dburn: if he had worked it out, he would have ducked the diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its anesxciting kill point|pg||
nt|dburn: but whatever he does, declarer will probably go down anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, ducking the diamond would be a candidate for Grosvenor Gambit of the Century|pg||
nt|deltadash: will someone tell me the best line of play percentage wise?|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer is following it, although technically he should have cashed the ace of diamonds first|pg||
nt|othered1: And this is happening mainly because of north's 2-suited bid.  without that, this line of play would be quite odd.|pg||
