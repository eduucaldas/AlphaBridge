nt|mrdct: in fact it looks too strange to be true - perhaps the auction doesn't coincide the the board we are seeing|pg||
nt|mrdct: and the fact that no lead had emerged yet suggests something funny is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: very strange - the movie is showing this board as completed with one table in 4@s and one in 3@s - but no auctions|pg||
