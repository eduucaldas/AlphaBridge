nt|pelu: = 3@s+ 2@D + 2@h + 1@c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West would probably need to go up @DK, and keep plugging at the spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace played @HK from hand at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H9 ducked, and another heart. West cleared spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, a diamond towards the queen will make the hand, double dummy, because @C9 drops singleton|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Don't know which line is better, but it looks like @HK is a popular choice|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The same double dummy play, running @CJ will make the hand on the heart play|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sga1: yes both the tables played that way|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So this is in effect the same line Versace took|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Now Giubilo can set up spades as he has another two entries|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and declarer lacks the entries to dummy to get lucky in clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sga1: now @cJ|pg||
nt|sga1: after @h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no good ... East rises @CA and plays a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, too late now|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: dont help: @cA and a @D - West has played @s 10 and @s9 = @D entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The winning line is double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From the outset I mean|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: double dummy = with all cards exposed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zaleski needs a major swing soon if they are to advance to the final|pg||
nt|pelu: playing @D in trick is a litle DD - but not a far of line of play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't gain on 11 one would think, and 12 will be flat'ish|pg||

nt|sybarra: Running score: http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a pair event, so the home and away is just for comparison |pg||
nt|sybarra: that transfer was just what pard wanted to hear |pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: allways like it when they understand each other|pg||
nt|sybarra: they do also :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems this is just going home playing on the red suits|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: dead certain that he do not have a single diamond now|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the club shift obvious?  and is that what should be done next?|pg||
nt|haans: looks easy to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Skrzypczak's fingers are moving between 7 @c and 3 @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier from this vantage point for sure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Pass around? Ain't P from N a semi force pass? Anyway they are lucky not ending in 3NT down|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: this should be easy  |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|cicus: right play - can't afford to dislodge spade entry for an uncertain finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: no lavinthal for @D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: I must say for those of us in USA  (probably Eng. also) the South name is a combination of letters that  never go together for us |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: and we do not have commentator or operator claims.......|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 consinants in a row!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cicus: but I mistakenly told you it would make - no, W still has his @DK as an entry|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: If he cannot make it then it is not makeable, a compliment.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cicus: if N plays a club now and E ducks, it still makes|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks to Eric Arvidsson for the hint|pg||

mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|sga1: good sacrifice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Skrz will bid again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In theory it could go 3 down|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That South name is fascinating. No-one outside Poland can pronounce or spell it|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry defense can start with @c-ruffs = down 3 - tx specs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: At least it's got ONE vowel|pg||
nt|vugraphzsb: i can spell :D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be disappointing for Giubilo that he can't beat this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has pretty good defence it's fair to say|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's quite tricky to play|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has to play it completely open, ruffing 2 diamonds, drawing trumps (bringing him down to just one trump), and then get lucky in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, can't set up hearts too early because he then risks a ruff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: exactly|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pelu: or he can just play 3x@S and put his money on the @h-suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And now he is in some strife|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now they can tap his hand with a club, can't they?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: C best now |pg||
nt|pelu: could kill Ss hand |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may be good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And exactly the swing Zaleski was looking for|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Drawing trumps and playing on hearts is not good enough ... only 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace played the hand as if he knew the layout|pg||
nt|pelu: no winning : take and play @Hq - whenhold take tha @ss|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CK ruffed, diamond. Trump switch. Then he ruffed 2 diamonds in the dummy and finessed @H10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|pelu: or is he a trick shot? I go for coffee :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: He is a trick short: 5 spades, 1 diamond ruff, 4 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not any more|pg||
nt|sga1: cant make now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You simply have to ruff the two losing diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The error was to cover @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He makes it now|pg||

nt|vugraphzsc: try to pronounce Skshipchak - that it's )))|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wonders I would never be able to say that name |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes, @H 2-2, easy on the line of play.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: see a 4@S for NS.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|haans: try say HI you!|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|cicus: EW may make 5 of a minor here (especially 5@D) if NS don't find their ruff|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|sybarra: it is sort of like trying to speak dutch for me,  my throat muscles were never trained for those noises|pg||
nt|haans: Lionel double?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22HP NS but with nice harmony|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but what is wrong with 5@S as the cards are placed.|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: double = spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I adore the Neth.  been there many times, |pg||
nt|rodal f: NS play precission|pg||
nt|dimi: lucky for Versace that NS did not miss a @h fit after his 1@s bis|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a bunch of clubs can be made,  not  sure if they can handle 5 of not |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  so 2 @C,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: no way to claim @c as a trump |pg||
nt|sybarra: so 2 @D rather,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: after 2@d rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: N asked about DBL and got answer "for take out". does it helps declarer?|pg||
nt|dimi: ...bid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: true, cant get there from here |pg||
nt|cicus: this has to be played in good tempo|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: having 4 cards in both majors, E led a trump|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive N's X was negative. So why did they loose the @H color?|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 @Ds must be ruffed so trumps cannot be drawn|pg||
nt|cicus: also, @Hs must be established|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|haans: yes good help|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: but being doubled is no good|pg||
nt|cicus: best continuation|pg||
nt|cicus: declarer must also take care of not conceding a @H ruff|pg||
nt|cicus: not at all easy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Egorov a bit to active here. WHAT have W promissed? 0HP+      and he bid freely? HUM|pg||
nt|deltadash: looks like 2 down from here - we'll see|pg||
nt|cicus: now if he ruffs a @D, he must play a low @H from dummy I think|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: E will "fall off chair" with Q from W |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should make now by playing@C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: making +1.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: only slightly amazed is my guess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cant avoid ruffing 2 @D |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|cicus: now again, only @D ruff then low @H is successful|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say Q@H now, would it make a difference, difficult hand.|pg||
nt|cicus: it is easy to see now that @H ace concedes a @H ruff for the defence|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|sK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: better cash the q of @D  but easy from here to say that |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question has to be (on this hand) after 1 nt do you bid 4 card suits up the line, or bid the @D thinking you might bid again if pard bids spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades again |pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: NS did well after 1st session, but the second one wasn't so lucky and they are 39th now|pg||
nt|cicus: I am sure Versace will make this but it was very difficult with closed hands|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dimi: well done|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: If Giubilo ducks when @HQ was played, declarer can't make it|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No communication to the good hearts because he can't cash @HA|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pelu: N has agood hand - but I dont like the jump to 3@h after 1NT from East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, it ended up as a dummy reversal |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: I think Giubilo should have figured it out. He knows declarer has the 10 as well|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's problem was interersting ... he passed 3@H on the basis of "no double, no trouble"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: As it turned out that was a losing decision|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: BUT, in the final of the recent American Nationals, Sonntag, in a similar position, preferred back to 3@S and ended up -800, losing the match|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Indeed, but Sonty was brilliant in the Buffett Cup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Europe was outplayed to be honest|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In Sontags case, it had gone 1@S - Pass - Pass - 1NT - 3@H ... nearly the identical auction|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S also go down on best defense|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Quite so|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: 5 more IMPs to VYTAS on 11 when 3@S failed at the other table|pg||

nt|cicus: 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: hello diane @H|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 2@H and 2@S.|pg||

nt|cicus: he's considering 2@H and 2!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 6@S, may bid 2@S.|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: easy so far|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: Diane,  look at South's name,  8 consinants in a row,  want to pronounce it?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: But not that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: although that was not best |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fifee: 2@H is probably a transfer showing a decent 2@S raise|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: I have it easy - my granny was Polish|pg||
nt|sybarra: our operator Sveta gave us a hint:  try to pronounce Skshipchak - that it's )))|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|deltadash: Sveta has an 'inside' source :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we should call him "shipwreck"   (no offense) |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: or nice word is "novice" |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|deltadash: right again, Patti :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H 3/3, would make 2@S.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fifee: 1@s 2@s being a bit weaker|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Or a invtational bid wourth 3@S? As exsplained. Never seen that before.|pg||

nt|vugraphzsc: well, if we got Pepsi from Pszczola - why not?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with @H guess, NS can make 4@D, or without the @H even can pitch on @C, but the cards are not very friendly for this contract.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: That's my point - he cucked 16 imps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: chucked|pg||
nt|bjacobs: lost 5 when he would have gained 11|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|pelu: and they loose by 17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then they would lose by 1, no?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Funny game ... 12 board match is a bit of a crap shoot|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right, UNLESS they had bid 6@S|pg||

nt|sybarra: yuk|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: so am I, but funny to see all 4 having bids|pg||
nt|rodal f: For new specs. Running scores: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/wilpairs.html|pg||
nt|cicus: many would have opened that E hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fifee: how many like the reverse with this hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: E has a normal w2 opening |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Moisant in @H or NT or @C contract?|pg||
nt|fifee: I don't particularly because the suits are not great|pg||
nt|deltadash: got a few holes, but what can you do?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: we saw it last session Sveta,  every 10 bid like they had a mountain |pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 pt hand bid like a mountain |pg||
nt|ralfwil: But somtimes I have to regret not to bid a 4-card major when opps have 5-4:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: actually, I can understand it well - if someone paid entry fee, (s)he isn't here to pass|pg||
nt|cicus: but I like the pass with that mediocre suit and no distribution|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: how do you feel about 2 suited balancing,  is there another bid?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 3, 4@H made on a @C lead.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the endge for mePatricia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But wisely passed by E, many partnerships dont like to preempt an unpassed P.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: that is another way to look at it Sveta|pg||
nt|haans: que = any good 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|haans: balacing hand|pg||
nt|deltadash: works for me - this plan obviously wasn't the best|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: Here the declarer has 3 losers, so should make 4@H.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S loser can be pitched on K@C, if @S not attacked now.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: many use it and also use jump to 2nt 19-21 natural|pg||
pc|sA|nt|deltadash: it's a friendly hand for declarer - that always helps|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sybarra: not "our"  (n/s) best landing  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
nt|dimi: in the end best contract for EW, 1NT is one down ... the same fate of a 2@S contract|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, if he'd opened, NS might now be in a higher contract|pg||
mc|6|nt|deltadash: we could ALL number off, Larry, but that may take awhile :(|pg||

mb|p|nt|fifee: east's 2 suits may have been majors|pg||
