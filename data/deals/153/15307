nt|roswolf: which maybe why declarer chose this line:(:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|djneill:  West has a weak raise, so utilizes 1NT forcing|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1NT @semi-forcing|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|djneill:  2@d appears to be a relay to 2@h, containing a v. weak hand, or various nice hands|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c !@c or 13-17 bal or 4@s|pg||
nt|djneill:  a direct 2@h would have been a constructive 2fit probably|pg||
nt|djneill:  giving up a natural 2@d there (can't remember last time I had a natural 2@d to want to bid)|pg||
nt|jallerton: correct, 2@d is either a very bad hand or one with 4+ clubs|pg||
nt|djneill:  that way, East with 16-17 can evaluate correctly whether to push on, or realize 2@h is high enough|pg||
mb|3C|nt|djneill:  North sees no reason to let them play at the 2-level when they want to|pg||

pc|dK|nt|roswolf: south got intimidated by the vul in not competing further|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|djneill:  need to hold to just 1 loser (losing 3@h, 1@d already, can afford 1 more to make 2@s)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: yes frances may need her intuition to get this right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes a kibitzer mentions that entries to the board would help - the @cT provides 2nd entry, but now tapped|pg||
nt|roswolf: or indeed just dont play any trumps|pg||
nt|djneill:  idea might be to hook South for the @sKTx or @sQTx, using the @sJ98 as a finessing agent|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is too confusing for everyone|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: In Denmar, for example, no double must be alerted. The opponents must ask if they want to know|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: I think the same applies for Germany|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|djneill:  8 sure tricks off the top on that break, and North has extra knowledge about how to play the @c from the 3@c opening - if can strip East of @h's, can play low @c towards and endplay him|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jallerton: and Scotland, Roland|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|dburn: yes, but they must also ask if they don't want to know, in order not to create unauthorized information  for partner|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree the l+e committee must review the present alerting rules - i personally would make all doubles self alerting coupled with active ethics as played in australia |pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes i would be suprised if they missed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  South goes with the invite with 10 HCP, the @cT and red honors look helpful|pg||
nt|jallerton: they will after that 2NT bid, but many would have preferred 2@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  North has a supermax so accepts|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes still being aggressive|pg||
pc|c3|nt|djneill:  not sure if North wanted to chance 3@d since it might be construed as NF, but if forcing it would allow getting to some good red suit games with a weak @c holding opposite|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|djneill:  West has ears, leads the unbid suit|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's @c8 should not be from a residue like J8 or T8 (would lead back the higher), so West could cash a @c if desired, but South could have 5@c here|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok West can see the stiff King so does not lead the Queen from Q3, but if she couldn't see it, she would I think|pg||
nt|djneill:  that would have produced a quick set had East the @sA (3@c, 2@s)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|djneill:  but it's hard to believe East has anything else after that @c honor, there aren't that many cards in the deck, the @s exit might have been a punt|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h finesse no risk here, but 2nd finesse has risk, but they are 3-3 as R said|pg||
nt|djneill:  was South's @d cash premature?|pg||
nt|djneill:  would be good to know they split 4-2 early|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|h5|pc|c6|pg||
