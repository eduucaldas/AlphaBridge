nt|patricck: the danger of going slow was if the opponent could effectively pre-empt the auction. If you were playing 4NT specific ask as an opening it would have been better to use it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is exclusion I am asked. When a suit is set (usually at the 3-level) a jump to 5 of a side suit tells partner that he/she is void in that suit and wants to know how many ...|pg||
