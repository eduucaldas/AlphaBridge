nt|mdgraham: is there an upside to overcalling 1@S on that hand?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: None, imho|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: agree  - weak suit, weak hand|pg||
mb|1N|an|up to 12|nt|iceking: 11 rule though indicated diamonds were 5-3 so he should gone for endplay maybe but he knows Páll is very tricky could lead from any card from any holdings|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzrz: should be rather easy to get to 7s after this start|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: in the closed room south opened a strong club|pg||
nt|vugraphzrz: and when north responded 2n, south bid 3c intended as stayman/baron, but north took it as natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzrz: as Raggi normally plays very honest carding|pg||

pc|d2|nt|vugraphzrt: waterloe "hope im not too good"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with four-card support, it's pushing the boundaries to raise to 3@H as West, particularly with three small spades |pg||
