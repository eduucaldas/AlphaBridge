mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Easts hand looked more like a 4@h opening for me than 1@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: we hope "shipwreck" is not offended |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3@H by W, promises 5@S + 4@H|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ralfwil: and W in my opinion too strong for 4@h|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|fifee: hurts more with a @H continuation. @Cs lying favorably|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: If W had to play the @C then @CJ was needed from table and N alone holding @S and @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: fairly standard I think |pg||
nt|rodal f: The rusult or squice=;)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after the @c return, I think W should have playes like the other tables and finessed in @h|pg||
