nt|lestergold: but should be suspicious that is exactly what to expect from a player opf King's ability|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anopther way was to play the remaining |pg||
nt|yo_yo: has he forsaken tom townsend?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i haD NOTICED EVEN THO AT THIS HOUR IM NORMALLY HAL;F ASLEEP|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry capslock|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D    3NT   likely staert|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg of course a legend and Ms.Senior one of the world's leading lady players|pg||
nt|lestergold: against the long standing partnerhsip of cooke and garvey|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from rainy central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: My second session - will try harder|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
nt|daman: I have never heard of the legend and I subscribed to IPBM for years|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey a great bit slightly wild talent|pg||
nt|daman: I have heard of Nevena|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg is a world class player|pg||
nt|daman: you said legend    he is not a legend|pg||
nt|daman: and I have a plethora of specs who agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a matter of opinion |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
nt|daman: he might be a legend in GB|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 : After 40 boards Small +39IMPs v Senior, Rosen +33IMPs v Teltscher, Crouch +5IMPs v Hinden, DeBotton +3IMPs v Hackett P|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: fantastic pass from West    winning action|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: why not open weak 2@s? Or Multi? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  12-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: er my son has a louder voice and is a lot bigger!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: ok then very well known player :)|pg||
nt|daman: cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is originally from swedn and plays a great deal internationally especially the S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the US|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You have never heard of Nevena Senior, George?|pg||
nt|pelu: but long way from US to Canada :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2 : After 40 boards Cope +18IMPs v Pryor, Dhondy +16IMPs v Cooper, Shillitoe +11IMPs v Fagarty, Bird +6IMPs v Roberts|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone make sense of this auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Sure I have|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
nt|daman: sctoll up|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bonjour à tous  and hello all |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead would let it thru|pg||
nt|daman: r*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you said you had not|pg||
mb|4N|nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, heard, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||
mb|5D|nt|daman: can't remember her maiden name|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|daman: Demtinev or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Delova|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrrmmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: but it works well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call me naive, but I would have led a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: no way to go down in 4@s (almost)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C lead in other room|pg||
nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6-card or player ))))|pg||
nt|garnetts: They do--and in my view their card play rarely live up to their expectations--a triumph of hope over experience |pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: Might there have been a pass by east to start this?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: lost it N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no alert from S on 1@d?|pg||

nt|lestergold: well dop u agree with Townsend'spass david?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: Best play from E is to discard @s6 on next @c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: maybe Townsend tht 3@D likley if east had anything   that +300 would not be a great loss  and if partner had nothing would gain |pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: a very odd view imo|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N is of course a normal and goo contract very unlucky that apart form spades all other 3  Qs badly placed for dclarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3nt will go down now. N has not enough of entries to finess in all suits|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East will be in trouble soon|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: and that´s why E should discard @s6 on @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes discarding on clubs but Small has to read the position not easy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good start for N-S|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: ok the finesse was into the safer hand but ....|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes sets them on the right path (Hopefully) |pg||

nt|sharkey: N shud bid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good  potential save in 7 @c   par contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure N should bid at all, 7@c is a good save but who is to say they will bid slam?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: he choosed  the lowest cue bid I think  Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes makes sense, |pg||
nt|sybarra: (lowest cue first) |pg||
mb|5C|mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: 1@D   3@D   5@D  he bid. Partner was silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: i guess you have to open that dog (4333)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Ed & Mike|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: will Gui give them 4@S?|pg||

nt|daman: good stuff to reach game|pg||

mb|6S|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any reason to make 4@S  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denies 6 in a minor unless a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D can have 6 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Scores from first stanza|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup not a good 13 count but an opening within the meaning of the Act|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Teltscher 86 Hackett 29, Senior 13 Rosen 49, Hinden 35 Small 41, Crouch 40 de Botton 52|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the multi does seem to work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 combined but work to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: but E didnt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@D presumably asks for the better major|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time 3NT looks slightly better|pg||
nt|garnetts: East sees no reason to do anything other than bid 3NT--things are well placed for 4@H--best lead from North though |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 4@H not 3NT sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: with W do you lead low ht or q? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small should have good 6 to bad 8|pg||
nt|daman: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 top losers and 2 out  of 3 black losers in Hallberg's hand which need to be disposed of one way or the other|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike and Marshall|pg||

nt|capercliff: some would play a X bu N now says "I would like to bid 7@c"|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not this pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: hello everybody we are here for the fench national championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well a good club view would help the cause of n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: might on a club lead even then not certain |pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: Q in pards bid suit i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours there is a lot of equity in messing up the u]auction as n/s have done|pg||
nt|capercliff: that way he includes partner in deciding whether to bid or not|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: this pickles you pard |pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: we can talk about that :)|pg||

nt|daman: can make 5 really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he is lucky here can ruff 2 losers in dummy and just about negotiate |pg||
nt|daman: yes   maybe only makes 4    not enough soldiers for an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful when returning to hand ruffing the third@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: however has no choice as @da drops|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DK he can discard the last @S-loser - so give up 2 @Hs - but has to take @HA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting metaphor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you guess hearts (you don't), it's 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: I lead the Q but who am I ?|pg||

nt|daman: maybe 620|pg||
nt|lestergold: 650 my guess|pg||

nt|lestergold: Small is having a field day at the wheel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you a weak 2 would have worked equally well |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its no0t a victory for the multi as such merely a victory for the barrage that took place|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe a lowly trump promoted in south |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW? |pg||
nt|daman: being aggressive?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Michelle Brunner a frequent member of English distaff international team|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow usually plays with hackett senior very experienced senior player i dont know much about Levy|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: SZ thinking about digging graves|pg||
nt|ady: part score here    likley 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: now the hand is scored as -1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: -1 is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: which hand? the last?|pg||
nt|pelu: how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is this david levy?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it was clear that North had nothing except @c support for passing 3 @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont know if EW can bid 5@C here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an| |nt|Walddk2: 5@H!? What a strange choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This mountain that SZ had to climb is suddenly taking on the appearance of Everest|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot think how West declared 5@H next door |pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that with the TOD west thought east had four |pg||
nt|daman: I think you might look at their card Nicky|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an| |nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Yang psyched a pass over the Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1,  e/w lost an imp here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|daman: ask them the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: agressive non bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: No auction given in the movie|pg||
mb|2N|nt|blum1956: again the 3NT-4 Major choice|pg||
nt|othered1: Why alert the double,  Standard to double 1N for takout of @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to get to I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: diamond lead beats this|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s. time enough to find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the rosen team fresh from having given the senior team a serious pasting|pg||
nt|ady: wrong red suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i predict|pg||
nt|daman: would we all have bid 3NT with 3334 9 count?|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told that -1 was claimed at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg still has his workl cut out for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: from someone who is at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are two tens i think normal to bid vul game at ips with west's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North can't really sit this,  since his double wasn't based on defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was wondering about the alert on Michelle's pass over 1C last time. maybe she alerts all her bids|pg||
nt|othered1: his redouble, rather|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure he cant sit this. he has good defence, knows he is facing spade shortness and five hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N makes on the cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Goes down if NS get their @S trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 Nt is alright too|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 3 nt  with  j987 |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe she was swayed by her two 10's|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes a spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: E's @h spots are just good enough to deny the defence 4 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT down on @H lead & @S switch?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - misread|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: from the frying pan.... into ,,,, the fire....|pg||
nt|othered1: The double, in practice, tends to deny a fit at all, but north's @S suit doesn't need a lot of support.  |pg||
nt|sharkey: placed @SK behind @SQ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a bit nerve wracking  however |pg||
nt|capercliff: no Carl, declarer gets his @d trick before defence sets up a @s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: bakhshi has to alert  as he could have a longer @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H    needs club lead  to definately beat it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: 4@H also made in the other room on board 1, with an overtrick even|pg||
nt|othered1: Not at all -- isn't 2@H makable?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|garnetts: this might beat it too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: SZ scores :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the bidding in CR is so strange, that the operator dont wont to give it :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has two trumps and above all, EW are vul & 2D X is not game so even if they make it there is a limit to how bad it can be. N has shown a good hand so if S doesnt want to move ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: towards game I think it is reasonable for N to pass the double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 2@h is not so far away|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hm as i expected Sandqvist is worried about the defensive potential of his con tribution|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @h now and small return|pg||
nt|capercliff: but E knows who has the K now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: @d switch good enuf?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the teltscher team seemed to be way in front  yesterday|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this will be a quick match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Halberg will make it with the help from the lead now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: high @h would be  encouraging for this pair the 6  is not clear the 10 would be best hoping for AK9  in South|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: has time to try the club as well|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: would not affect the result here|pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all, sorry, I hadn't seen the broadcast already started :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bas :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Bas|pg||
nt|neobas: Heya Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT CR as well|pg||
nt|neobas: Hej Carl|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good afternoon Bas|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: spade lead also enough    only one discard of a club  so down 1|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: A spade was led to the ace and one returned. Curtains|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: he almost has to fall into it now    no?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: was so much easier to beat the hand from this vantage point |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: I am told that the contract was 6@C and not 5@H|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: but after the great lead the follow-up was disappointing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room, Whittaker reasonably played partner for a singleton spade rather than @CA after West bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't fault him|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Anyway, something went 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: I think 2@S was a good decision, likely going plus instead of minus if east had taken the right view|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sharkey: a push|pg||
mc|9|nt|garnetts: I am suprised to hear that :)  |pg||

nt|lestergold: at this rate|pg||
nt|daman: this has the potential to be passed out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also the clubs rate to be well placed for declarer on this auction, and a better source of tricks for offense than defence|pg||
nt|capercliff: hard to stay out of game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT going down here|pg||
nt|sharkey: East may lead a @S though...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: Well they got off to a very good lead and then made a fatal switch |pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: that makes 8 tricks....|pg||
nt|sybarra: every card is wrong for decarer actually |pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like an endplay possibility|pg||
mb|r|nt|othered1: is that a transfer or multi-type defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Holland likes to bid diamonds, then hearts:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: no, not clear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if that's a weak 2 ...|pg||
nt|daman: nope  The Garve saved us from that|pg||
nt|lestergold: with garvey around you cant be sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: now the @H lead from E |pg||
nt|neobas: Who here believes North should pass 1@H to allow partner to X?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: No--but the Q@C seemed a very rapid play |pg||
nt|blum1956: not an easy decision for North spade lead probably made from J10|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: apparently david gold still contemplating the @SA|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view too fast to work out options |pg||
nt|lestergold: must show one of the majors or tyransfer?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT here. Impressed?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card drury?|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think makeable with @H lead|pg||
nt|neobas: It is something every regular partnership should've discussed in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a third in hand opening but 1nt looks bold at these colours and with a sketchy stop|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is the wildness of garvey at unfavouravle vul he makes a bid that many of us wouldnt even do at favourable|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|haans: no :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: once you have a reputation...it is difficult to deviate|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will get a plus score on this occasion for his efforts|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very tamely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h will go down after 4 rounds óf @c, otherwise makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You can't sit still with a 17 count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a quick one down?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push i expect|pg||
nt|ady: this should go ddown on the lay    3NT  may have mad with Q@D right though a an unlikely club lead would beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the weak No trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tosh backing in with a Q and a QJ i think very dangerous|pg||
nt|capercliff: hold up the @h twice and play 3 rounds of @c's, what does E pitch?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   no distribution for an action but 1 NT is possible  1 @s  would weak with dsitribution|pg||
nt|neobas: W on lead won't make a difference, I think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: no a quick 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: a passive lead mind you would let it thru but unlikely|pg||
nt|neobas: Same lead CR|pg||
nt|capercliff: double dummy can get out for -1 i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: pitch @D - limited communications after 4 times @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has to get the unblock in also |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: work to do but the lead has created a trick and the spades are playabel for one loser|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: yes Roland - and I can make 6 on a non-@c-lead :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have been more impressed if you could have made 6@C on the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dangerous weak 2 with 6 solid tricks in ones hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer knows E is 4-3 in the majors now|pg||
nt|neobas: South in the CR ducked the lead twice, played a @C to hand and a @D to the K, after which defence could cash 3@Hs and 3@Ds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose it is not clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT asked East to choose a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Crouch knows that diamonds 5-0 now after the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will play the hand accordingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry what amn i talking about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Qx a particularly doubtful value|pg||
nt|capercliff: and after 4 rounds of @c's will have full outlay|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: hard for partner to read this|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can only make on a spade lead which is likely|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: yes and the side suit is @h!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a @d trick may be created  as they lie|pg||
nt|sharkey: actually East pitches after dummy so wont make|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: two yes for one no :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch knows that Tosh has nothing. Otherwise North has no double|pg||
nt|sybarra: except with no @D lead, maybe shows S has none?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north cant be faulted but south will be ashamed|pg||
nt|othered1: Good pint, Shirley|pg||
nt|othered1: point|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is on the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pint sounds OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe the pint is better at this hour for us|pg||
nt|sybarra: 940 am here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may need a heart switch now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed someone eill need a blood transfusion after this|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: @S lead would have beaten this |pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooops  Gold did return a low @S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what their methods were over 1NT  ---tempting to bid if you get both suits in |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: most   declarer can get is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: that cant be right|pg||
nt|capercliff: E did not switch to a @c?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and declarer did not play a @h voluntarily?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: that is a textbook error of course|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe a double psychology play :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: another 13 imps to Teltscher|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think 3N is a likely spot here|pg||
nt|daman: Mike    I have noticed a marked imrpovement with your spelling    are you dating a Grammar teacher?    or are you just typing slower?    lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: at unfave vul i cant see the point of the bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, and especially with a double. what if W redoubles? now you may get hurt in a variety of ways|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has to NOT play trumps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts and 3 clubs, or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is certain re diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: 12 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you are very kind Mike!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i never heard of a weak 2  8-12|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: assuming the 5-0 trump split playing clubs which is the natural thing to do will make the positiom clear|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: not at all like the old days|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well practice|pg||
nt|daman: hehehe|pg||
nt|sybarra: stranger and stanger |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe getting ready to put E in somehow |pg||
nt|capercliff: if declarer had the @s instead of the 8 he would make this|pg||
nt|capercliff: 9@s|pg||
nt|capercliff: a @c now and what will E pitch?|pg||
nt|neobas: A small @S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: He would have a chance but that would be the case  on any defense|pg||
nt|capercliff: then he would make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: this may not be good enough|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|garnetts: On the last hand I really like the pass of 2@D --an intelligent psych |pg||
nt|lestergold: this doesnt make sense|pg||
nt|daman: tell us a bit about the 4some at the other table Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely that club wasnt ducked by the defence|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it is again|pg||
nt|roswolf: but that was a clear error by north|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace and a @H now?|pg||
nt|othered1: south did echo in @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: does that help?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or a diamond to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will be endplayed twice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it is also easy|pg||
nt|othered1: And east's double of 2@S had to be on more than just the @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: in either red suit - declarer's choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is to try to go plus instead of minus, but i agree that with that collection of rubbish he is aiming at an extremely narrow target|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer didnt want to squeeze dummy on the last @c|pg||
nt|neobas: Has to play @Ss now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well spotted|pg||
nt|sybarra: and has to be low spade doesnt it? |pg||
nt|neobas: Yes|pg||
nt|neobas: He might take the @DA for -1 in Teams but I think he has the lay of the hand at this point|pg||
nt|capercliff: he should get this right|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I think any @s  do|pg||
nt|capercliff: he knows S has 3 more @d's without the Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually you might be right on JP |pg||
nt|neobas: Correct, because, as Cliff said, Declarer does not have the @ST|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: I hope everyone noted how long North spent working out the options in the OR--it is a real lesson of using your brain in crucial situations |pg||
nt|sharkey: Playing @C squeezed E; but also destroyed communications for declarer |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think E has the count on declarers hand |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but it was fine play by declarer to create the illusion that South had @CK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to he queen, then the ace and a small one|pg||
nt|roswolf: good practical bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looking like someone who had  xx|pg||
nt|othered1: Sure, fine play by east, but north could have worked it out anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: so now what does N do?|pg||
nt|sybarra: el stucko |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Starts crying?|pg||
nt|othered1: So north was playing east for 2=5=4=2?|pg||

nt|sybarra: and great thinking as declarer,  didnt panic |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed was my teammate in my Camrose match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive always foujhnd Small to be an undisciplined player at this level which ismperhaps why altho he is up there competing ion the premier league every year rarely m,akes it into the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: top 4 if ever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well  it was a weak @H suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h e/w looks normal|pg||
nt|neobas: Let's hope for NS North doesn't get pushy|pg||
nt|neobas: Might just open 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 small hts by N not exactly appetizing for going beyond 4 @S |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: tough to get to 6@C but maybe not after that opening |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16 opp  7   difficult|pg||
nt|blum1956: using the negative free style North should bid 2@h and then the life becomes easy|pg||
nt|ady: only 23 hcp   but great fit  and source of tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: splinter  or fit jump  or voidwood  which?|pg||
nt|blum1956: but NS probably do not use it|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is hoping to buy a contract for his side))|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does the X show @S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if they do go to 3H you cant rate your chances of beating iot very highly. and if they do go down 50, what have you won? risk-reward ratio very dicey|pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: yes --almost certainly spades with @D toleranace |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: It is a n 11 match round robin on 3 week end so victory points are at stake|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: surely the dbl means more than "not penalty"!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they must have some more meaning than "not penalty"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will show off the strong club system|pg||
nt|neobas: 2@D a Game Forcing opening, it seems|pg||
nt|neobas: As for the subsequent bids, I am at a loss :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: or multi not sure|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, I am not sure what is going on here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: might just bid 6@C and hope for the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or jump to 4@C GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did North double over 2@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not double I mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another tough call for Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|garnetts: When people used to play monet doubles --there were many times a psychic penaltry double was used--good time for it here for example :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tradegy too as its frigid|pg||
nt|daman: it is gin|pg||
nt|capercliff: does anyone know their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: game   forcing ace  of @d  shown by 3 @d bid|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Does that not show both red suits?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe better cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: like everyone else I have no idea what to do with hands like west--so might as well gamble|pg||
nt|othered1: There are 7's and there are 7's.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT 17-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this is not plain sailing|pg||
nt|lestergold: here we see Towsned can bid aggressively when he wants to|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im trying to work out can this be made double dummy even?|pg||
nt|lestergold: answer is i dont think that makes ten tricks as cardsw lie here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult when the @S dont break|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i think tiownsend overbid herec partner didnt even have tio have 4 reasonable,hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bakhshi knows the @S dont break from the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 3@c expresses his values after the double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most would bid 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: why?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19 points? |pg||
nt|lestergold: west'shand is full of holes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 points opposie a pssoble yarborough maybe with a 3 card suit is not mandatory game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in either major|pg||
nt|neobas: According to kibs 2@D is GF, 3@D shows @DA and 3@Ss|pg||
nt|neobas: In which case I wonder what 4@D is|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 4-2 spade split gives this an excellent play    would Bakhshi except an invitation ?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure NS play Michael 5+/4+ - S has absolut minimum, but very friendly steup for N|pg||
nt|othered1: dicey is a very kind way to put it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: now they know nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Especially with the state of the match - harking back to the debate earlier about tactics|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not hard since North choose to bid 3@H--5NT will do it now |pg||
nt|blum1956: either exclusion Blackwood  (if NS use one) or just RKCB and hope for  the @dA with EW|pg||
nt|ady: disappointing|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reached the par contract now, 6@DX|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not yet Roland |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very polite David |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: He surely is not contemplating 6NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is considering what to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: length is the paramountg consideration|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@D?  Puppet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so yes, Ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: Last year Cooke and Garvey were in the winning Camrose team which was I expect a culmination of their drwam for years|pg||
nt|daman: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh comes from the "Scots wha' hae wi' Wallace bled" school|pg||
nt|othered1: Your line here?  Cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: im askwed if 2@h is forcing here i would say it was forcing in most partnerships ithese days|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously must be in theirs|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they play 2@c multi and 2@d  Gf ace showing answers|pg||
nt|capercliff: flat board-next|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: North can likely infer that @S are 3-3 at most in EW  hands|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: 5 small @H and a bust and it has a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a moot point borderline my point is that Towsend sholuld have consulted|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Lucky that hearts are 3-3. He can test if @CJ10 doubleton first by cashing one of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has always believed that he was the world's number one not noted for his modesty but to be fair i have always felt that he had a great talent for then game but in sufficent ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: discipline to sustain a position at the top table|pg||
nt|neobas: To a junior like me that seems like a rather old-fashioned system. Obviously I don't know it in-depth but Ace-showing answers are something of the past in my book :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: but would he get the right result with a 4-2 spade split  if just consulting|pg||
nt|neobas: It got them to the right spot though|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: trump next I imagine |pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CJ to indicate values in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: @cJ for @S|pg||
nt|garnetts: trump is best--the spade can wait |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter and I must have been partners|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: a double followed by a 3 level cue bid tells pard that he doesnt need much to bid game posession ofa 5 CARD SUIT WOULD THEN BE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT|pg||
nt|ady: I agree if east had just 3 small hearts and a bust then 4 hearts could cost a big number|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ssorry butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|daman: we have our share of those on this side of the pond as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry slight exaggeration but we are allowed to tease garvey|pg||
nt|neobas: Be right back|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: a club away on that spade wouldnt hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think selway should have played a club here a spade should have helped declarer|pg||
nt|daman: The Garve is not timid   he criticizes easily    lol|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the winner of the 3 weekends gets to represent England in the Camrose |pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: if clubs 3/3,  this rolls |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: but oh well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is very good play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: extremely strange bid for the player of Brunner's level|pg||
nt|lestergold: better not continue these!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: top diamond or even a trump by south would do|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think bakhshi can set up a long dim and enjoy without losing trump comntrol|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it matters  if Townsend pulls 1 trumpt    can discard a club on K@S   and has time to ruff a spade and a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: hovering over a @h|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor South might be feeling a bit shell shocked after the start to this match---pressure gets to all of us |pg||
nt|lestergold: There are T shirts in circulation listing the world's top ten players Garvey at the top of course|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Then he just needs either hearts or clubs to behave|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: yes this is not the same situation as 1D-1S-1N-2H|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: not designed by Gravey tho|pg||
nt|daman: they can't be selling at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive sat opposite garvey for a weekend tourney- it is not the world's easiest task|pg||
nt|othered1: Only some very old-fashioned partnerships play 2@H  nonforcing.  I have only one of them remaining.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: crpssruff at MPs. seems better to work on spades and trumps at IMPs. not sure|pg||
nt|othered1: are we frozen?|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is there to think about? |pg||

nt|lestergold: but hes okay for a beer away from then table!!!|pg||
nt|pelu: if lose to @SQ then a @H-ruff - but he is lucky|pg||
nt|lestergold: well some of the bridge world'smore colourful characters Halberg is getting on form seventy buty i hear no one can beat him in an arm wrestle|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small not known for his sweetness and lightness either|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: hts behave |pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: and spades 4-3 of course|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome Henry|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Henry!  Why  the distinction?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a bidding test here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 6@h is the top spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer has certainly been friendly to slams |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on  previous deal four @d  showed   @s acceptance with no other thing to cue|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: first weekend of 3|pg||
nt|othered1: here south passedthe ugly 12-ount|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after clubs can use 2D as art 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@d makes as well of course|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contracts rely on @h being 3-2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope pard knows you use rock crusing 3 level bids|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha Shirley|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: part score hand    n/s  in spades best|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lebridgeur: he is vulnberable  and only 6 cards  sensible in first position|pg||
nt|neobas: 6@D it is, it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 15 opp 15 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean slam for these boys?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|haans: SZ coming|pg||
nt|garnetts: Tough hand for North --|pg||
nt|yo_yo: redouble is for blood i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double now look fine |pg||
nt|blum1956: EW probably catched up|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes xx was punitive|pg||
nt|sybarra: singleton honors worth ?  (zip)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike Bell also passed 3@D in the OR on 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  because after 1@c ... you have 2@d available as an artificial force|pg||
nt|othered1: Sounds reasonable, but I don't think I've seen that in action.  Don't get around much any more, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had probably played on establish the @d suit by winning the first @c by @cQ and played a @d to @dA and ruffed a @d another @c to K ruffed another @d and discarded @sJ on @cA and ...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that played @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  which you don't after 1@d and 3@c as an artificial force uses up a lot of room|pg||
nt|neobas: Second as well, in my opinion Meyer|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is vul,  so make can expect a "good" hand |pg||
nt|sharkey: W opened 1@D CR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Yes bas of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like Gan's choice of 1NT in the closed room, rather than double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Anyone for 1NT on the West cards raher then dbl? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jxx often a nice holding|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to see the @H-stop in 3Nt - in CR West reopen 1NT - so......|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that the absence of a 7th club does not deter the Garve from a vul 3 level pre=empt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not sure of their sys here but i assume 1C is some sort of artificial bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like 3N doesn'thave much play at all on @H lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S raising @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i understood this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam looks well below 59%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2¬@h doesnt mke|pg||
nt|ady: North decided to keep out of bidding     not unreasonable|pg||
nt|daman: I have an appointment in 10 minutes    so I will have to flee this match at that point|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 or 7? - as long as the suit is QJ109xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: however his cheeky opening has pushed e/w into  a pretty hpel;ess 3n|pg||
nt|pelu: woprked foine here - no chance in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west considering 3@C   not an immediate success|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect lead!|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: only 2@D on 14 HCP???????????????|pg||
nt|sybarra: Simon Cope says:  no - relay shape ask I am pretty sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 60%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50% i mean|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S?|pg||
nt|neobas: I think I'd open 1@D and 3@D equally as frequent|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and stopped in 5    not satisfactory test :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: It may be difficult to get to slam unless W opens 3@D|pg||
nt|capercliff: the only downside to opening 3@d is that you are 3-3 in the majors|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|neobas: I feel W has used the brakes too much in CR|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree, especially when you see where double leads to|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers unavoidable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I said it before and I will say it again. The EBU must require that all convention cards are submitted and then put on display on the website. It is unreasonable that commentators ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: must guess what certain bids mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll have a word with Max Bavin|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I agree with both of you  !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: I would rather have passed the double than bid 2@D |pg||
nt|haans: original bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: I have found that the cc's typically posted are only part of the story,  but would be nice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead for King|pg||
nt|henryb:  you only think that because he rebid 1N and not 2, Mike|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit i would not have preotected with halberg's hand altho h ewas influnced by holding 9 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: close his eyes and play the top tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: hope for the best |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so I prefer to open 3 @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: (also in little tiny print) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that I have the EW card. I have because Crouch sent it to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Most don't get terribly deep into relay development|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took me 5 minutes to download the comprehensive version of the EW CC|pg||
nt|sybarra: the cc's hardly give the details for relays,  agree ED |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a shorter version I have on hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect Precision, with 2S inviting game in NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the1N rebid must show 18-1i9 points to explain the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2N looks safe enuf|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Couldn't see a card there|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it is reasonable to assume that  Henry |pg||
nt|lestergold: playing natural club south would rebid 2N|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes me too|pg||
nt|sharkey: W felt "guilty" due to his light opener in CR I think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: i would have tried 3@D :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or even open 1@d maybe?|pg||
nt|capercliff: in 2nd seat|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: ruff out, play trumps and then a spade|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes of course Haans :) rofl |pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have tried 2@H with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland explained to me that out operators are new to this and it is very tought job--in my view Darren is doing brilliantly so far --may not be able to note all alerts this first ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: time |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Cheers, I am new but Roger is an old hand, you'll have David and Ant later who are both experts!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: making 5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: Roland and I would have been in 3NT because we would have bid 1NT as west --so there |pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of going for a number would have detered me|pg||
nt|pelu: but some would pass the X - if pd strong then 500-800 |pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 imps about to appear for the Teltscher team|pg||

nt|neobas: He brought six tricks and three card support to the table, I'd say I have nothing to be guilty about|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@d doesn't tell pard anything about his hand really|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: looks like 800|pg||
nt|athene: of course there are textbooks which would frown on that 3@C opener, but having the texture in the suit is worth a lot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: well i guess mid late forties but always looked about 25 to me|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: taken the max --well done |pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: claim?|pg||
nt|athene: @CQJ109xx is going to be a 2-loser suit mostly even if partner hasn't got a fit|pg||
nt|athene: better than e.g. @CK97432 which might indeed get really killed|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes the average junior look like an old age pensioner|pg||
nt|neobas: @H pitch looks scary|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|blum1956: a swing for Hackett this time probably|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: I think 1NT is the most descriptive bid,as it does not promise a @H stop|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: best way to find 3nt  is not caring about stoppers|pg||
nt|ady: looks like the defence wont be able to get 2 club tricks    the 4th diamond will be a discard|pg||

nt|lestergold: and second club away on that diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N should fail if bid as S hand is squeezed before W hand is....E never gets a chance to make a mistake by discarding a D|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I like    3 @d in first or 2nd seat      |pg||
nt|sharkey: looking closer at CR bidding I think East was to blame for not getting to slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting question Carl, if I was green VS red I'm not sure what I would open|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: well to be fair the weak NT didnt help earlier|pg||
nt|ady: e/w need to keep out of game|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s frigidaire?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C or 1@D opening on last hand in anatural system is strictly a matter of style|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: The Complete Book of Balasncing Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: SZ rapidly approaching a target of 10 imps per board to win.|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|lestergold: and not actually a bad contract|pg||
nt|pelu: ok slam - but I dont exp that NS will come even close to bid slam|pg||
nt|athene: south might just respond 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cooke is the perfect partner for garvey he is a thoughtful disciplined highly intelligent player around whom Garvey can dance his dance of death|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe 4@d in that case|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps 3 NT may be an option...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  5+ hearts  9+ hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|neobas: 3@H by South?|pg||
nt|neobas: Four, even!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: unassuming cue bid not game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this may lead to game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surprised Bakhshi didnt double to show those @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may likem his diamond fit|pg||
nt|reisig: no alert for 2@h?|pg||
nt|pelu: I would hate to open 1@D on the N-hand :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Garvey deals out quite a lot of death against anyone but the toughest opposition|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: minor  openings at 3 level  should  be some how constructive if partner has not passed|pg||
nt|sybarra: pusilanimous bid of 3,  |pg||
nt|capercliff: i like the 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @H also |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: systematic requirements i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H - let them guess|pg||
nt|neobas: Well, I would too, so that's why I expected South to bid 3 :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: @h lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: and may be it makes too|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: It's like 20/20 cricket, run rate required per over almost 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the category of "oh good"........|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: too strong  is South for 3@h|pg||
nt|capercliff: no problem now I think, only a @h lead would give declarer problems|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it makes on a cross-ruff?|pg||
nt|sybarra: its close to making,  sometimes pard has some clubs to add to mine |pg||
nt|capercliff: i think 4@h is pretty standard|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - just use @HA first trick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: at last a penalty double bid as penalty taken as penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: transfer weak twos --interesting |pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
nt|pelu: I know it the system - but still :)|pg||
nt|athene: they play strong club, 5-card majors, multi 2@D, so 1@D is very loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s wants to be played by south asltho here as A@h is right doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I'm sorry, we have to restart this room|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||
nt|lestergold: why show hearts when they have alre4ady located spade fit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont worry Nicky anyoje takes on vugraph is very brave|pg||
nt|neobas: Hmm, on second thought maybe not|pg||
nt|capercliff: that might not be good enough, because declarer will eventually have to go out to a @d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: he has a simple bid to show a good raise in spade4s|pg||
nt|henryb:  West is close to too strong for a 2N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this decision to open 2N here is going to lead to game and i dont think can make|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is a pro-am bid, in my eyes.  Partner has no idea of trick potential in @D contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I think 2N would be fine if the hand were different:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: Holland 3@C  for major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see the point of a transfer weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Francis Hinden made 4@H  well done to her|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Frances|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s deny a @h cue?|pg||
nt|pelu: Sorry - I was weong they are "close" now|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluckly west's hand is better than some 20 counts but has hit an unfortunate misfit minimum opposite|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: doesnt it just give opps an extra bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gained 12 imps for her team on 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt venture into this auction with that pile of festering horse manure with a gun to my head|pg||
nt|capercliff: and a second trump comes|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: specs want to undertsand teh system|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone explain it|pg||
nt|lestergold: heavily artificial of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 21H must show spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n support 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d cue i assum|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key is the nebulous 1D opening and the 2@h response|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Roland, but in 20/20 10 per over is eminently achievable - especially if an inform Gilchrist is batting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah by South  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n good support im toldthe rest is fairly starightforward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually 2N is OK if pd is a passed hand. but facing an unlimited partner you are just begging to miss a slam|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|capercliff: now he can afford to go out to a @d and retain trump control|pg||
nt|neobas: Only a @H will set it now|pg||
nt|sybarra: testing  E now|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think it can be beat now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: 5@S asking for @H-control?|pg||
nt|henryb:  mainly unlucky that the diamond suit doesn't run|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the point I was dancing around|pg||
nt|lestergold: Holland too good in the majors to pass 2N|pg||
nt|neobas: Well done|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: old fashioned forcing nt might have solved this problem ending in 2 @D's or so |pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately i think with Towsned's minimum 12 count and awful spade suit his 3@d bid which is effectivbely a game try was an overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case 3NT is the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@H|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe im wrong|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the  @d   duck was fatal should have  cross ruffed|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: i would think it must be by impication|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|neobas: I think that would've led to only nine tricks Meyer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: 1NT would have been 5-11  NF|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: also you do not really need to ask for ther Q@H as you know North is not queen high for his actions |pg||
nt|garnetts: He is almost certain to have the ace |pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed very unlucky not an unreasonable bidding sequence|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe I am wrong as well :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: it was agood auction |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This can go 2 down of Shi finds the diamond shift|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lestergold: coujld easily be duplicated |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: N had to lose a diamond at some point, so put the defense to test fast |pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: I am not sure they can do that with 5 hearts as they have 2@D available for 9+ with hearts|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: their system is different|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  notice that even 2N is down since West gets squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry wrong descard there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, Artur might open 2N, but i predict 1D|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sybarra: looks like a "big club"  2 @C,   6clubs and can have 4 card major |pg||
nt|lestergold: this 1@c opener is obviousoly not strong club so what is it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps something Polish or romanesque|pg||

nt|henryb:  apparently N-S are playing some sort of two or hree-way 11c|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think maybe Polish so im advised by someone who should know!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multiple hand types covered under 1C umbrella, sometimes strong sometimes ordinary|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think you're correct|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: no the ace?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That goes away on a diamond after you have cashed 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: double is the winning action|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/wwill get a plus score in any case|pg||
nt|neobas: Kib suggesting a trump promotion is trick 10 (4@S 3@C 1@D 1@H + the promotion)|pg||

nt|capercliff: not unreasonable as W opened 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: some care is needed to make 4@H here--there are potential problems |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H can be made with open cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: penalty doubles seem to be like buses, none for hours, and then 2 together :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N making 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee break hand|pg||
nt|neobas: This looks to be -1, barring defensive errors|pg||
nt|sharkey: cross ruff denedent on @HK being with W only I think - regarless of @DKQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: *dependent|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, but if W has the KQ@d the location of the K@h is irrelevent|pg||
nt|capercliff: as W cannot attack trump|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - then you're betting on two cards being "right" instead of only one|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: though methods prevented NS from finding their fit -- in fact par is 110 NS -- EW have voluntarily gotten too high. surely S would have reopened with a double, though, had the EW ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: dim part score their way so nothing very eciting|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  or 3NX making 3|pg||
nt|garnetts: good morning Henry |pg||
nt|blum1956: not on that particular board, Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi; just thought I'd throw in an easy one|pg||
nt|garnetts: cash AK's and cross ruff looks best to me |pg||
nt|ady: can make on a sort of cross ruff|pg||
nt|garnetts: that always lets South make her small trumps ---|pg||
nt|garnetts: might go off if somehting gets ruffed but not likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be 100 here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not be surprised if the Hacketts bid it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: probably 11 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lose @H & @D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: coffee, good idea|pg||
nt|lestergold: and ice cream i was just served by my bridge widow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E playing W for a 19 count with two heart honors|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: Do you have any time limit in this tournament? 20 boards and 2 hours?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|garnetts: North deservedly got his wings clipped next door|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting lead choice by N|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: here best play would be  a @c finesse at trick 2 and South p lays two round of trump then a @h is played from East  defense must be very careful Il would back declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|nt|garnetts: Made a marginal TOD and then raised freely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: A@D ruff a @D then draw  till end in defeat|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can shuffle his cards and chuck a rabndom one in the air and the contract wont make|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - NS needs to get @S into play|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: lucky the @SJ coming down|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i see on the board where towsend and bakshi missed 6@d gold and forrester with a similar barrage were allowed to play in 4@s off 2 undoubnled for a gain of 11 imps!!!|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @cK would not be a good choice|pg||
nt|henryb:  but not enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true though it would still be one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: an original K@c doesnt even let it thru|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: only 8 tricks on that|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: yes 3@H bid was desperate in OR|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb:  11 tricks look fairly easy: @cAK, spade ruff, @dAK, diamond ruff, black suit ruff, diamond ruff with the trump K|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|nt|henryb:  in some order|pg||
nt|lestergold: the play is uninteresting what is interesting is how thye managed to overbid their hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nice card by tosh to make high diamond discards easy for N|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: obviously the 1N call has a widish range, esp. at these colours. still 3N was a lot for John to bid, having siad that, he was hoping that if the hand makes exactly nine tricks it ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt matter if they played hearts or NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  The only good thing about this result is that the other table is not unlikely to reach 3@h and go down there also|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard @dA and @dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear...if the auction starts 1D-P-3D, who knows where the carousel will stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: no pressure here surely can dsicard 2 spades anda club|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blum1956: it could be 12 if East had the @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  five trumps in hand, two in dummy and AKAK|pg||
nt|blum1956: if Brunner plays a trump now she restricts herself to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: why not play a small @d as E?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes a time limit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure how long|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: needed to play @H earlier|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: and has done so|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can discard high Ds also, as the cards played on the first round of D made clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes no probs at all|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SA and @D|pg||

pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: "on a partly self funding basis"|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the auction would make sense if 2D had a particular meaning. but the oeprator already said some bids were omitted|pg||
nt|lestergold: partnership of this calbre should get to the slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: David isn;t playing in this match, but we do get to hear about Mike's dog:):)|pg||

nt|lestergold: and manyh firends|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to find a trial bid on N, perhaps 2nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: like the aunts' cat in "Adventures in Card Play" :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: felix tyhe dog|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is tosh who must surely recognise the slammish nature of his hand|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|blum1956: the NS cards fit together beautifully. Only 24 HCP of flat distribution but 4@h absolutely on top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that 1@H rebid by opener is any 20+ hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i gather they play a polish kind of club but i was told at the start they were playing std!!!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like that|pg||

pc|s3|nt|haans: Gui-Yang bid that deal as many beginners would|pg||

nt|lestergold: club switch tho and has to guess hearts mayve dangerous to duck rgua spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: now co tract in danger|pg||
nt|lestergold: discard on spade ace useless|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a blind spot I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Cameron must find the @H now|pg||
nt|lestergold: up with ace of spades and establish those dims quickly|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|othered1: 6@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: that should stop the @C lead against 6N|pg||

pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: you have to be rich to play bridge nowadays|pg||

nt|sybarra: does N bid 6 nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East is  Hallberg     South is   Garvey|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please enter the names, Nicky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: if your pard style is to make light off shape doubles and uj knwop pard won't punish you I think its  risk versus reqward ratio just about acceptable|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Well, it does take a club lead to defeat slam|pg||

nt|marlowepi: once N makes a positive response, which I assume 1H was, he doesnt have all that much extra. S is the one with all the controls. i can see a lot of pairs missing that slam|pg||
nt|neobas: I play 2@C in this situation at 95% Forcing... p can only pass with 5+ @Cs and a very minimal hand|pg||

nt|othered1: Only very slightly nsulting.  This hasn't exactly been a confident auction|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: N has to show his good 5-card @h before S can act|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not keen on the heart lead. to me best chance of beating 3S on this auction would be to lead a minor king, try to get an ace out of dummy before hearts are set up|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think we saw the actual auction wasa problem with it operator wise o think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E very likely to have 6 hearts on this auction, not something like Axxxx.|pg||
nt|neobas: Effective 4@S bid here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: No basis in this mathmatically though |pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@c was challenging as opposite to 6|pg||
nt|neobas: Though it didn't help in the CR|pg||
nt|sybarra: or play it this way,  this will work also|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: depends if you are sure East is short in @h on the bidding    probable|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: 4 or 5 imps, possibly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A quiet 2 down it seems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can hear the groan over here|pg||
nt|lestergold: selway of course has so much mnore han a minimum response that he felt he had to cue and erichsen back pedalled to warn selway that he was minimum for his splinter i think a good ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: must play a spade now |pg||
pc|s4|pg||

mb|2H|nt|garnetts: At the vulnerability that does suprise me |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the west hand looks a normal weak 2|pg||
nt|blum1956: just to find the opponents in the hearts game|pg||
nt|ady: now juming in at the 3 level   seems odd|pg||
nt|yo_yo: double now?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I see they follow Meyer's line of opening 1@S with weak 5-5 hands|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: Senior has the space tov stick 2@h in here at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Michelle bids a Jacoby 2NT agreeing @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like an old rubber bridge moan to me--you were not good enough to bid two but you could bid three  :) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: John might get the @H wrong now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C or @H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 1 hes vulnerable 2 he only has 3 hearts and 3 he is minimum point count |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well the light opening bid as against a "weak " 2 may prove dividende here|pg||
nt|sybarra: my typical trump support for pard (E hand) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: tempting for osbourne to bid on but he did his work with the preempt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has N denied 4@H i wonder|pg||
nt|ady: can make 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the play-record here was wrong and N has 4 @Hs in the end|pg||
nt|georgia19: I guess, never mind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: confess i would open the W hand at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and second round double expresses his hand now very well|pg||
nt|georgia19: 2@d showing one major|pg||
nt|othered1: open with?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless playing 2H = 9-12 or the like|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: in this case   not an advantage  because 3 @c could be stronger|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: Garvey has looked at the vulnerbaility and respected it for once but as it happens i think 2@s rolls in|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Palau worked that it showed distribution and not strength with the adverse bidding|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: after a @S to K in CR decl play for the double-finess in @d|pg||

nt|ady: Holland judged well to take what they can|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: 2 places to play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT is that "choose your minor"?|pg||
nt|lestergold: first round double abnd south would have easily gone overboard in hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: good lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: has no other option here |pg||
nt|yo_yo: gtg now, bye everyone  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks Mike/Ralf|pg||
nt|yo_yo: David |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@h is makeable on a @s lead and a lucky @hKx in front|pg||
nt|othered1: double by south is one of the stranger bids I"ve seen|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, yes, but he has to be thinking there is something odd about the W auction, since she passed as dealer and does not have 4 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like 3@h on west's hand here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: in my opinion it is merely maximum for 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry N dbl|pg||
nt|othered1: Without complicated methods, 3@H looks OK to me.  If  you play weak jump shifts by passed  hand, 2@H may do.  But you have to keep major focus on @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is simply not a 3 level bid whenever partner has no heart fit likely to get into trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: as here and with a vengeance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you dont bid 3H on this hand, what passed hand WOULD bid it? it is already a borderline opener as it is|pg||
nt|othered1: And isn't 4@H a reasonable spot, whatdo you think is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: West checking system card|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: its not so much that north denied 4 hearts that he didnt promise 4@h a first round doubole would have either promised 4@h or a very stgrong hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blum1956: Brunner's pass was clearly forcing. Should she not have doubled herself?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: i think most double on that North hand and it doesnt promise 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: nice cheap trick|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: down 3   |pg||
nt|lestergold: a downside of tyhe artificial 2@d bid as 2@s would have bought the contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: looks like at least one heart loser prob 2 likely club loser and dim loser not a great contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: Now the @S switch required|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: one more "H please|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|garnetts: better cash a club now |pg||
nt|sybarra: 11 imps for Crouch as the stopped in 3 nt on bd 11|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: strange to open 1Nt and then bid 2@H over a Multi by S|pg||
nt|lestergold: i expected it first its fave vulnerbaiklity and second Gravey is known to bid without much provocation|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey never paid hi trainfare to solihull to pass|pg||
nt|georgia19: alter that quick or it'll stick:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think Garvey has more than one pass card in his bidding box|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: He rarely has his bid|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: i wonder what 2D by W would have meant. could hardly be GF by passed hand|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: that is against a normal layout i mean|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cK|pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Had to cash @CA first|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|garnetts: I still cannot see the logic of failing to bid 2@S and then bidding 3@S on a queen high suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 21 imps lead  entering last hand of first half for Doussot Delfour are the title holders|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: Why, without looking at the actual hand, are 2@C losers likely?  don't your finesses ever win?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: if spades break normally there is no diamond loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: actuaolly rarely in my case Ed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would want to be in this game at IMPs. even NV|pg||
nt|lestergold: it doesnt change my view taht i would not bid 3@h with the west hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so what hand WOULD bid 3H as a PH?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least the JH to impriove th trick taking security of the heart suit for example|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I've done wrong discard by W |pg||
nt|othered1: At what point does your suggested hand become an opening, or at least a weak 2 or multi?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK but then it for sure is not a PH anymore|pg||

nt|sharkey: slam bidding has been the main difference|pg||

mb|1C|nt|garnetts: If West had opned 2@S is North really going to double?  Certainly won't bid 3@H |pg||

nt|georgia19: I think they'll get there, hopefully ony to 6|pg||

nt|pelu: the last slam gave - as exp - 11 IMPs to Small|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a very ciommon british disease this love of the wak no  trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the spades are very dodgy|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess west can justify 2@H because of the stiff @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c from W?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh overcall not so clear but not likely to get nailed even when it could, and may disrupt EW just enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i wouldnt play it with gun to my head but very widespread in uk|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: It looks as if Twonsend thinks this shows a hand that would have made a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play the double as penalty of a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could be in difficulty here if e/w keep doubling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play it shows @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a slam below par obviously when you must play that suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: :) ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx fellow commentators for you time |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if east can double showing values  west will surely pass|pg||

mb|2D|nt|othered1: are we into relays?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like (again)|pg||
nt|lestergold: extra values but even 5@s is alittle precarious|pg||
nt|georgia19: got that wrong then|pg||
nt|lestergold: but above 12.855 Roland|pg||
nt|georgia19: Garvey not interested over weak NT|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup, well done Laure :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I prefer the agreement that x is pens after a weak notrump and a suit after a strong/medium notrump |pg||

mb|2N|nt|lestergold: Small has a sign off now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small's diamond suit does not like like slam, material|pg||

mb|3C|nt|pelu: where did N find that X???|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR|pg||
nt|blum1956: Against weak NT it is better to play "diamonds or strong, starting from a strong NT"|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Some decided to dbl 3NT next door--someone should have redoubled |pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks look a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: This is truely poor bridge from EW--|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's not better about either, just depends which hand comes along|pg||
nt|ady: might well make on the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however I would have expected a pair of such quality as townsend Bakhshi to have discussed this one|pg||

nt|lestergold: well time to put brakes on as cards lie 11 tricks ok |pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think the brakes are going on|pg||

nt|sharkey: EW 3 NT CR|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: well kin'sare on|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|othered1: Here east may get squeezed in the minors for 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h bid by the darimng Malinowski who probably adds on three points for his own card play|pg||
nt|lestergold: which im afraid isa  more reliable method of hand evaluation than some|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny, but if you play support doubles, allowing east to distinguish between 3 and 4-card support, you'll likely stay out.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|georgia19: or not!|pg||
nt|georgia19: hi all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: it should be incumbent upon players wanting to represent their country to have sorted this out |pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are a newish partnership|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H favourable this should make|pg||
nt|blum1956: the strongest part of the weak NT - you make the opponents not to know their HCP's. They often land in 22-23 HCP 3NT. Still you nead to beat that.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: King's were on but Small is still plunging headlong there|pg||
nt|lestergold: very un disciplined in my view|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a not even good enuf for roland im trying to work out how the cards would have to lie for thsi slam to be makeable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must win @cA if S plays a small from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will know that from the lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: well I am moaning the lead was awful--and South should have doubled |pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: South must double to keep EDW honest and North on track--so he doesn't look elsewhere for a lead like he has |pg||
nt|ady: e/w have useful lower diamond pips|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: I am corrected, Townsend/Bakhshi not a "newish" partner|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a NEW partnership|pg||
nt|blum1956: the game of bridge is not that all for high card points|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS doing well for EW on this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is interesting and instructional to see play like this and where it stems from---North started with a bad lead because he though his side needed to find fast tricks  |pg||
nt|blum1956: West must establish a trick in a minor suit  to discard his 4th heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: If Souht had doubled then his opening lead would have been like ace and another heart |pg||
nt|garnetts: this would also have left dec to get on with it and he would have no chance |pg||
nt|garnetts: Shows that bridge relies upon so many tells -|pg||
nt|blum1956: is he going not to play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D  would have been killing switch if 9 was with south|pg||
nt|ady: has to cover or will go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to be in 6 on that possibility |pg||
