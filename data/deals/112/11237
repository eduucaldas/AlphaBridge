nt|lestergold: because west would know that weaast didnt know about his club void|pg||
nt|sfoxa: lucky NS - they continue slow but steady climbing to the top - on their opps backs|pg||
nt|lestergold: east heard his vul partner bid 5D and he held 4c what did he thin his partner had?|pg||
nt|lestergold: very poor pass by east6|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C want to get off|pg||

nt|roswolf: when there is an unusal auction tou must try and judge what is going on - here with long clubs abd tops in the majors 6 diamonds must be laydown 80% of the time with west bidding ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vul|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffee board now|pg||
