nt|daman: related*|pg||
nt|brolucius: A big hand to welcome us all to the event.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will probably see Angelini's version of Precision at this table|pg||
nt|lml: hello Sabine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think both pairs play 2/1|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Good Morning =) Buon giorno|pg||
nt|sharkey: so almost half way and a close match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor is probably disappointed that we won't see Acol in action|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: Buon pomeriggio a tutti! Good evening to everybody! =)|pg||

nt|ritong: ciao roberta|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning, Roberta:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no idea what system EW play, but we will see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini will likely open 1NT passed to West|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yesterday we had several deals where the points were divided 20-20 (not usually a good sign for entertaining viewing). I see here that the Great Dealer has made it 21-19 for a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: change. Ah, yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who will double, presumably|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong finish in the last 4 boards in the previous round surged Padova ahead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can have my share of the danish wine when it comes, rob|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course Gazzilli (1Maj 1NT, 2@C=gazzilli to introduce natural hand or many strong hands)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS seems easy enough here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 18/19 (20)|pg||
nt|cicus: there was a hand yesterday when the bidding was at 5@D with Fantoni thinking|pg||
nt|cicus: I went to have dinner and when I returned he was still in thoughts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Team Villa Fabbriche from beautiful Tuscany, Angelini from (also beautiful) Rome|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off.....|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Avram|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|daman: want a big hand?   clap clap clap|pg||
nt|mariner1: very close match after this many boards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: =) ty|pg||
nt|haans: Padova Bridge are not a team to run over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and they're off|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jcmax: Will w show his 2-suiter over a 1@S opening?|pg||
nt|april7: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-15  5+ diamonds, unbalanced|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: So 1@C  16+|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 -15 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning Liz and David|pg||
nt|bridge_one: both team are playing in the best formation|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcmax: How many rounds have been played so far?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: BUONA SERA A TUTTI!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Semi-finals now, knockout|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A surprise|pg||
nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs apperently|pg||
nt|bridge_one: gazzilli convention was invented by ... mister Gazzilli :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning, Roland and everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13  sorry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is unbalanced |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Pulgo is a slow player|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Pulga|pg||
nt|roswolf: nortth should raise@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: technically very strong|pg||
nt|daman: East will bid his @Cs no matter what|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bid on with 652... |pg||
mb|r|nt|mariner1: 4@H seems simple enough here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or his two half-suits?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S down from the top and 4@C makable by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe be wrong) but shape is tooooooooooo  good |pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Angelini replaced by Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No point in my opinion since it's not your hand. Then all you achieve is to give the show away|pg||
nt|cicus: now a somewhat unlucky 4@H to begin with|pg||
nt|cicus: gm Liz and David|pg||
nt|april7: what does 21d opening sow?|pg||
nt|daman: most of us would open the East hand at the one level notwithstanding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S for NS, 4@C for E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: I think everyone would but over 5@S at some point!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: was rdbl conventional?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT has some good prospects here EW|pg||
nt|cuttysark: no contract is comfotrable when they hold all the aces|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the auction will reach 5@S|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ralfwil: 32 hp on EW - let us see what happens|pg||
nt|daman: doesn't seem to be a slam in sight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes doubled a 12-14 NT in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  W looking at the security of the @h suit instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North escaped to 2@C and is playing there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a strong player in 60/70|pg||
nt|bridge_one: from Milan|pg||
nt|april7: what's 2@D opening?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think Rinaldi will bid 4@h now , instead 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D 5+@D 9/12|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think I might have bid 4 @H on the way |pg||
nt|roswolf: if it just shows a max pass + spade support then north should bid on now|pg||
nt|daman: North's hand is significantly devalued on the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13 (good 9) it reads on their CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H will result in a minus for EW|pg||
nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: that makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  misfit may slow them down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 11 tricks on this layout. No squeeze|pg||
nt|brolucius: Five hearts, a diamond and a spade - one down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they switch to spades in time|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure they will|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TRue, but hearts could have been 2-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3 or 4N likely spot|pg||
nt|daman: do we know what system EW are playing/|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a throw in for 12 - or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: undo please|pg||
nt|odysseus69: whenever I commentate I notice that every man opens balanced 11 - I wonder if the disease has spread to wwmens bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has, mostly because N-S can't attack spades. The suit is frozen for the defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be -1 but @h leads may create more problems for declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H could be better to give at the pattner more information about to decide after a 5@c by West|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: 2NT=22-24|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N or 4@S plays ok,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: dbl of course takeout|pg||
nt|andyv:  a Roland slam missed|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but for a sac it is good since opps hands have improved|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, Roland 13 is the limit of 2open by E/W|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  I like 3N by S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nice easy game to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - the 9s and 10s coming into play here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini will want to show AK@C?|pg||
nt|daman: a plus for NS    but, probably a push|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: 3NT is a fine contract |pg||
nt|jcmax: hmmm good double fit , I am not so sure it is not EW's hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally roland but we all know that many top players don;t worry so much about that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I predict a flat board|pg||
nt|cicus: I expect a push, though|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we dont need 6 of us to analyse the play on this hand|pg||
nt|daman: you can reheat your coffees     this contract is in no danger|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had a bit to spare for his sequence, but the singleton spade entitled him to take a gloomy view of his hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially on a @D lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: D lead is right into the jaws|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but could Angelini know that?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Here is an example wher the @DJ in either hand would just make a huge difference.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon Rob, Bob, Andy and Hans|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure looks like 2 losers to em|pg||
nt|mariner1: me|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi ralf|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Ralf|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Ralf:)|pg||
nt|haans: hejsan Ralf|pg||
nt|jcmax: But since NS are bidding all the way to 4@S it doesn't matter anyway :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: low from xx   2/4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can actually make 12 tricks on any lead, but you need to guess well|pg||
nt|lestergold: north kinder mullered in the majors and end played|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcmax: There would be 12 tricks on normal breaks.|pg||
nt|lml: he has so many top tricks it doesnt much matter about the diamond lead|pg||
nt|daman: better switch to @Ss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but he can't afford to cash the other top honour|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but more difficult|pg||
nt|daman: he can see the dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he cashes another @c they lose the 1 @s trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: no Roland, he could not and should be happy to play 4@s IMO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the popularity of two-suited bids, and the tendency to use them whenever possible regardless of which side stands to benefit more, is well-established|pg||
nt|jtr: Do you also predict tonight's lottery numbers Liz?|pg||
nt|peachy: bidding might not be the same, what do you think?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a squeeze and endplay for 12 now|pg||
nt|daman: a @S is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  W sequence did show some slam interest|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcmax: But it is always extremely difficult to evaluate in the bidding. Especially when the suit never gets mentioned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: if the defence switches to diamonds in time that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A priori. 3-1: 50%  2-2: 40%  4-0: 10%   so you have not really been unlucky|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I shall predict if you like David, but I am usually wrong|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Versace could have had  Qxxxx  xx  xxx  KQx  and then 3NT isn't exactly a great spot|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North wondering whether declarer is trying to steal 1 club trick- clearly they dont lead 4th highest|pg||
nt|daman: South should be commended for not leading the @H King|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Is that Angelini or Versace sitting North?! Nice switch.|pg||
nt|cicus: even after a 1H opening the final contract is likely to be 4@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I did not predict the 4@H opening|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, that would exclude some combinations anyway|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C was not too bad a contract. You can take both major-suit finesses (counting 11 tricks if one wins) and perhaps ruff a heart to bring the total to twelve.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The lead indicates that he has something in majors|pg||
nt|daman: the @D 3 is a Slavinsky lead I am told|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 if declarer can sneak a spade|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam much worse than a hook since there are usually 2 @s losers|pg||
nt|daman: as some would|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: yes wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, that's why it's a Roland slam|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcmax: in this kind of situation knowing the count is very important|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s decent spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini-Versace N-S in the open room. Fantoni-Nunes sitting out|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps anyway|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: yes - S will duck|pg||
nt|jcmax: it is important for e now to know the W had an original 5-card suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: would be easy to do |pg||
nt|daman: I am told in the OR    NS are in 5@H doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: that wont make|pg||
nt|daman: so a big pickup for Fabrbriche|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: wow now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: Andy Roland slams make :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @HA play works :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so he tell me:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  tells|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: they just defy the odds :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: He seems to know|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: now they get all their tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: now small spade|pg||
nt|daman: 11 IMPs to be exact|pg||
nt|april7: claim now|pg||

nt|odysseus69: more work in 3NT here|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, only a humble part score but there was a good point of interest.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 2@c was down while 2@D would probably make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass  1@H   4@D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now this is a Roland slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this is  a serious slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in Open Room in 4@H DBL on 1|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maybe not. He probably just figured with a sure trump trick there still would be time to switch back to @H later after the count in @D was known. Very good play by versace!|pg||
nt|cicus: as for opening 4@H , I expect somewhat risky actions from the underdogs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and we did not get any score here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I imagine made 5|pg||
nt|daman: there will definitly be a swing    depends on who is on the winning end|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: We are back in business in the slam zone again|pg||
nt|andyv:  and another slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time its infrangible|pg||
nt|daman: would any of us open 1@H?|pg||
nt|daman: there's that word again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not after a multi opening. Way too good in most people's books, but not for E-W here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer a heart to weak 2- too much outside tehheart suit|pg||
nt|daman: too many syllables    gives me a headache|pg||
nt|hedyg: might not have been exactly as we saw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East discarded a diamond? Then declarer pitched a winner?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 6@S there|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, even 5@d has to be considered|pg||
nt|brolucius: Twelve tricks can be made in spades.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: Lauria I meant :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another 4@H maybe - needs a spade lead to make|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h looks normal to me in 3rd position|pg||
nt|april7: thats an easy 4@H without competition|pg||
nt|roswolf: a choice of games here|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H?  or 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to pick 4 @H |pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, i told both team with the best formation - no true - in open room Versace Angelini (i thought Versace Lauria)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio, plying in open room, are clients of BBO - each day Failla play here|pg||
nt|jtr: Here also maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Commentating.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double seems normal now|pg||
nt|andyv:  opposite a passed pd, 4@d still leaves a bit too much room to N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most top pairs play take-out double through at least 4@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: 6@h on a finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: my weak 2s dont have ak combos outside the trump suit not in forn of  partner im avers to missing gamers|pg||
nt|andyv:  should show max w@hs|pg||
nt|daman: ogusty|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might bid just 2@S, meaning that will be high enough if partner has spades. But they play their multi quite strong (as is apparent), so West bids 2NT with 16 points in case a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game is there by sheer power.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam there better than 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or negative doubles if you like|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a good hand for playing in @s|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely he will pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One of the stronger 1@H overcalls I have seen|pg||
nt|april7: W could overcall 1@S, modern style, but doesn't consume biddingspace|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Quite good, yes, but is it worth bidding at the five-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: however on the bidding @ss might well be 4-1 or even 5-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: club finesse or no spade lead too|pg||
nt|andyv:  may get there now|pg||
nt|daman: West might not expect such a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl again|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one about the same as the last one with one difference|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N=slam killer|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 18-19?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 3N both have play here|pg||
nt|cicus: good idea, that double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 2@C by North i think is conventional, similar roudy|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: a little more work to do here|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a bidder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass and bid 5@S now, even considering six|pg||
nt|mariner1: all of Roland's slams are serious (to him) :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam makes|pg||
nt|jtr: This is getting unpleasant|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East has done well - he wanted to play in spades!|pg||
nt|cicus: Fantoni is waiting with the axe but Nunes will not cooperate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At some point he will if they keep bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: defence on top and this looks tough|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems nobody bids their 5-card suits nowadays|pg||
nt|cicus: Rinaldi may not take 2@S as a transfer|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@H, I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if west makes a try tho east will accept|pg||
nt|hedyg: George pls stop clicking on the commentator's curse button|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six too much, surely?|pg||
nt|bobh1: the hook is on and the @ss are guessable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks on a finess and solving the @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems like an unusual call here|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone know what 4@h is?|pg||
nt|haans: no takers :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: clearly @cs with slam interest lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says 5@c slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s u mean rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops yes 4@S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose a heart to Jack and diamond to Q|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even if W gets 2 @S tricks cannot see making|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be then - two @D tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h might also|pg||
nt|jtr: Odd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4333   109x in @C AJ10 in @D may be 3Nt better for N|pg||
nt|daman: nice bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: South's double of 3S was dubious, with two kings in unbid suits.|pg||
nt|daman: the double of 3@S might give him pause to think partner would have values outside @Ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s by W would have gotten a 5@d bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Intersting the @S suit never got mentioned here. But I guess no need if there is no fit.|pg||
nt|daman: hah!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes David, therefore "considering"|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm judging by his hand not what i know of their system|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 3N here|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4n probably says no interest|pg||
nt|andyv:  i play 4@s as 4-4 minors slam try makes sense to use 4@h as a 5 card minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|bobh1: so NS will get credit for trying but no actual imps most likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4nt is what I want to play if partner has any other vision|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the old days this 3C bid would mnean N knew where their fit was|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: onbiously they are used to opening heavy multis|pg||
nt|cicus: N relieved|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: just find A@C in W and ruff 1@H for 6|pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting @S lead into 6n makes the slam easier|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt can never be blackwood but maybe Turbo|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now its into 4N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D over 3@C would ask for full layout|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think he felt very optimistic at 2NT vulnerable|pg||
nt|april7: 10 or  11 tricks depends on @D play|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: Q@S on and 3 3 means no issue here except how many he makes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is more probable that 4@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: In case anyone is wondering why N bid 2NT instead of just 3NT, he was probably catering to his partner holding a 6-card @S suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would seem natural to set up a couple of heart tricks first. He can always come back to spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  six no picnic with small @c lead from W and we saw some similar action yesterday those type of leads|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will attack spades right away|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: nicely done|pg||
nt|jtr: Why not double 2NT?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't understand the 2@S bid - if they can open 1@C with 5 diamonds why not give South the chance to rescue himself?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have to avoid a spade or club lead if you want to defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean the 2@H bid of course|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Pretty neat, anyway, to reach a slam after a multi opening.|pg||
nt|jtr: We knew:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: Since @H is the communication 4th @H may become good|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcmax: East's pass over 1@H is also interesting. In my view passing with that kind of hand makes it so much easier for the opponents to come into the bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he rated Pass and 5@S (removing the double) as stronger than an immediate 5@S. But I'm not sure whether the hand is worth such a meaning. He has few honors in the majors.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  4N seems like a shot in the dark... i'd have liked to know about the K of @d on this hand|pg||
nt|cicus: now he makes exactly 3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 1 was flat (as I perdicted :))|pg||
nt|cicus: a healty 6 IMP for Angelini|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North may as well go for the ruff - if decalrer had a second diamond loser he would discard it|pg||
nt|cicus: even if he misses that, S also knows to give N a ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec points out that the @c play could be risky|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would take by North first trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, depending on their agreements, he might also have been interested in knowing if his partner had a diamond fragment to show|pg||
nt|bobh1: now perhaps shift attention to the other major|pg||
nt|jcmax: The opponents are both ducking. Usually a very good idea when ther is no obvious line of defence. Let declarer play something and at the same tim disrupt his communication a bit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the case for taking the first trick in dummy is strong. he wants E to be on lead next, noit W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for this reason was more easy for declarer to keep 2 entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand; he is not particularly concerned about a diamond switch|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure though|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is the Haman rule,  IF you can play 3 nt.....|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: do you think this was a pass and pull auction?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  he has his 10 tricks and will gain an 11th by just cashing out|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3NT is the right contract here|pg||
nt|daman: he now has a one way @D play because of transportation issues|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: unclear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what i did NOT say was that the ace was the best play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@S is correct to give the idea to have doubleton|pg||
nt|bobh1: creating the illusion that @ss are foul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe. i would be concerned about a diamond switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting @SQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes very interesting|pg||
nt|jcmax: Lauria is a very tricky player! :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: trying to get declarer to change his line|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it works |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: but the idea is important|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks safe wenough in 3@H?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which he duly did|pg||
pc|h9|nt|april7: but he won't finesse|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: nice play|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would mean pass was forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need plenty of good luck in the majors (even in clubs) to make 6@S. A contract of 5@S is about right.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the other room S bid 5 @H over 5 @d..N thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: all roads as they say|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree that this lead makes it clear abotr the @s situation. Can be an offensive lead from the @sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't have much to lead from|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  closest to thumb works just as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D back and duck by W would be interesting|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however no way to beat 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Lauria found the right lead  Not too hard on their bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: at least S should have known better|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: The 3@S rebid must have meant 'I should have opened 1@H instead. Sorry!'|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: nothing wrong if that is the agreed style but west would not be able to bid that way with the average Brit's idea of a weak 2 at these colours|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcmax: Would s have discarded another @S if E continued with another @D I wonder|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: making one trick in @d is sufficient to make 9 triks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  or the @C K as a spec points out|pg||
nt|daman: the hacketts would have the AK of @Ds less|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On board 1, the operator in the open room lost the play in 6NT at some point, but eventually we had a claim for 13 tricks. So Lauria must have guessed the line|pg||
nt|daman: is it possible the scoring s not hooked up?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D play well as W does not have one to lead|pg||

nt|mariner1: nice 6@C here|pg||

nt|sharkey: slam here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland you are on|pg||

nt|jtr: oh not quite|pg||
nt|jtr: If West bids it is|pg||
nt|cicus: there is a small banana skin here|pg||
nt|cicus: but I think W is going to give away the show|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland, someone hasnt heard of Wash&Go|pg||
nt|cicus: I think everyone would bid some 2-suited call as west, hard to blame|pg||
nt|jtr: That should double your royalty|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: viene momentaneamente sospeso il gioco per contestare la licita di n-s del board 18|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, NS discussing bd 18 bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: or a ruling?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It as fairly clear that they did not know what they were doing, but EW have not been damaged|pg||
nt|cicus: nly by their own bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga thought 2@H would be a transfer to 2@S. Rinaldi was not on the same wavelength, but as Liz said, E-W have not been damaged|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can guess,  bet it went K of @D  etc |pg||
nt|roswolf: really 13 tricks?|pg||
nt|daman: making 4 or 5 Roberta?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cicus: I am not sure I would have understood that 2@H either|pg||
nt|april7: its a mistake for sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 4|pg||
nt|daman: not 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: give a sec |pg||
nt|sybarra: we will sort it out |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D 4+cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: PI% 4|pg||
nt|daman: made 4    thanks Roberta|pg||
nt|april7: small @S lead is best agains a @S contract|pg||
nt|daman: Giorgio     does 1@D always pronise a 4 card major?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be interesting |pg||
nt|bridge_one: no, 1@D only 4+@D|pg||
nt|daman: since they play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it't 3NT+4|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We do not have a score on board 1 in this room, that's all|pg||
nt|daman: thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, they are still playing board 17. 6@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@s on bd 1, after 9 tricks declarer thinking since a while what to play on opps small @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the thing is that you can't bid this making slam|pg||
nt|daman: is Lauria on this team?|pg||
nt|daman: or another?|pg||
nt|daman: I do not have the link to find out|pg||
nt|jtr: On the contrary, E/W had the chance of a better score|pg||
nt|cicus: the death sentence of the @HQ is now signed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: These transfers in competition are wonderful - reminds you of the very beginning of transfers when everyone forgot|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  don't care for 2@c bid here... looks like a 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is on this team, playing with Giubilo i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The North hand is hard to express, with so many bids being weak nowadays.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c bid to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 4h can be made  double dummy- but not even Nunes would do it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Modern methods will reveal that you are off one ace and the queen of trump|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: Between Pass and 1NT on the North cards. I like the Pass, really.|pg||
nt|hedyg: is that the correct name Roland?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Liz :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: hi liz!|pg||

nt|daman: thanks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphztg: np|pg||
nt|roswolf: they may well get to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: precision 2@c opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s makes |pg||
nt|bobh1: slam not terrible|pg||
nt|cicus: agree with 4@H?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: Looks a bit much to me - balanced quacks|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: headed to 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe to 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: which on the lie of the cards will make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Liz|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3rd seat favorable liberties|pg||
nt|cicus: I find the hand has too many losers and you won't shut out spades if they have them|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont want to indicate i have any defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: i would feel sick if my opponents bid this to 6 spades - I hate lucky slams|pg||
nt|hedyg: Giammi on BBO|pg||
nt|andyv:  and OR is in that contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I abstain, also regarding the 2@H overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is getting exciing|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@C forcing Roberta?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play EW here|pg||
nt|bobh1: if the @cs were 4-3 and the @ds 3-3 i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and harts 22|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashed right into it |pg||
nt|daman: vaulted|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP ITALIAN BOLD NESS|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcmax: The West hand has only 14 hcp, but it is immensely control-rich with 4 1st-round controls. It might be an idea to open a strong club instead.|pg||
nt|hedyg: N showed @hs by X but Versace decided it would be too costly to defend|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think W should open 1@C here,,,,,,, just too much for 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot open 1@c if they play precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not?|pg||
nt|april7: N can't be shortened with @D so will make because @C behave|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should just lose the obvious tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S lead from A106 can lose a trick, so K in @C seam natural|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't dbl|pg||
nt|daman: I'm all for the red card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was worth 3@H, easily.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems very conservative|pg||
nt|andyv:  N seemed worth of one try|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all as E? i like to bid with an ace a major|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with the ace in my suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all pass*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I never pass with an ace|pg||
nt|andyv:  i never have an ace to pass with|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think vulnerable there is too great a risk of losing a lot of 100s|pg||
nt|hedyg: good, i am not alone|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's hand was better than it looks. He had minor honors in partner's suits (just where you want them) and aces outside, where you need quick tricks. Some players would have bid ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: more than 3@H on those values.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: its not ust a matter of taking a first round heart hook|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand went down hill with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|daman: our side had an automatic tap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room East passed in 1st seat; then South opened a Multi, and E-W reached 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 2 that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of work to o even double dummy to make this|pg||
nt|daman: really|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he puts up qS and plays to run a low heart it would have chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: because he is not strong enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could upgrade the hand which I think he should|pg||
nt|jcmax: After a 2@C opening I don't believe there is any chance one can get to 6@C. not that I necessarily believe one should be there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but common practice is to not let pd play 1@c if you have any type of bid available|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even 1NT is an underbid|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes opening like this can keep the opps out of a cold gtame|pg||
nt|andyv:  first swing board|pg||
nt|april7: the 10 of @S made E forbid leading @S|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sharkey: heavy opening - some would have selected 2 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks natural to me. Jump shift, 19-21, 5+ clubs, 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - N's 3@S stronger than 4@S - they may be on their way|pg||
nt|andyv:  and an expensive one it would seem|pg||
nt|bobh1: this will even things up i thing|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 4@S so we should have a very close match now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s  in the sleep for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: have to fault E I think|pg||
nt|bobh1: After rdbl, red at imps, I'm bidding game|pg||
nt|haans: depend on what xx did mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And easier after 3@h from S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: unless rdbl means something other than what i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no @S lead? :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: about 6% i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade lead not the issue|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure you would bid at the table Roland :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 tricks is a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only 1 too many |pg||
nt|april7: before there were 13 tricks, also impossible|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: maybe better than 6% but even below roland stanmdards which says it all|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: If it is being suggested that East should double 4@H, then I don't agree at all. His club values are worthless in defence.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slow 4S may force South to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: just thinking the same Victor :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a horrible, room consuming auction. No-one knows how many keycards they are missing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South must bid slam now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: if east doubled4h then Nunes might well make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree David|pg||
nt|bobh1: at matchpoints i might tread more carefully|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes after 3@H E knows W has @H shortage so nothing wasted|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if it means something else, W's willingness to play at 3 level should have been enough for E to go to game|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sharkey: forgetting female intuition Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: in real world you are never dealt ideal hands for your conventions|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|mariner1: K&R (A865 AJ8 AJ5432 ---) = 17.60|pg||
nt|lml: 6@S went down even after the diamond lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: to me hand is easily a 1@C opener|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR|pg||
nt|lml: on the first board|pg||
nt|lml: even if you open 1@C it is not clear to me you will get to a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is worth 17.6 on the K&R Hand Evaluator, so it would not be unreasonable to upgrade to 16+, would it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Axxx+AJx+-+AJxxxx|pg||
nt|lml: you have a minimum 1@C opener and partner has a minimum positive|pg||
nt|hedyg: but what is it worth when pd has no fit?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, nothing to worry about, and the opponents are feeling sick in a minute or two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but satisfies the RW test - it makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: slightly less than 50%....|pg||
nt|sharkey: S thinking Grand??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because she has no idea as to how many aces partner has|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As W my bid is 2nt showing an offensive limit with a 4-card @s support|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: I would take my chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 100 instead of 50 is not worth much. If instead your double tips declarer into the winning line, you will have a big headache for a while.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did bid 3@s directly over 3@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think also you have to be aware they could be jerking you around|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Instead of RD|pg||
nt|andyv:  trust partner and you don't have to worry that much about the opps|pg||
nt|bobh1: at these colors quite likely|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mariner1: in that case you pass :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no chance of bidding 7 - just reflecting about life|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Sabine, would you upgrade that to 1@C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll never know|pg||
nt|sybarra: revoke in other room? |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: youdouble and no bang down of the ace of hearts thats for sure|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: look  partner overcalled red   I double|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not figure this out |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|daman: jitters|pg||
nt|sybarra: some suggested @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe lost the trump ace in with the clubs?|pg||
nt|april7: why?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: or would you bid 1@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: upgrading it to 1@C seems less distorting than opening it 2@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: certainly below roland standards because has no play|pg||
nt|sybarra: (sorry we are being funny) |pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: spade 9 best|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't mind 1NT, facing a passed hand, but it is time to re-evaluate when partner shows both majors.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Baroni is feeling sick already. Her only chance is that declarer has five spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: 3NT clued them into the @H situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: any spade works,  but he may not know that at the table |pg||
nt|roswolf: well the play seems to me funny peculiar:(:)|pg||
nt|april7: good  try by E and N might go wrong, trumping with K and finessing for 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: NOT the K |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: any other spade|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 in @S the contract is safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if West can take with the 10 after Q8 in North are sufficient|pg||
nt|april7: could be wrong, N has a problem@he is thinking!!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: np with the @H - |pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  10 imps|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh no |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: By the way, advancing the jack on the first round is not the best line. Low to hand is best if you have enough entries, and she had (@HK)|pg||

nt|roswolf: nooooooooooooooooo|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: 9@S 10@s and after K in @S A@d|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe he did on a different line|pg||
nt|brolucius: How many times have I heard players say 'I had to double them after your overcall!'  An overcall shows playing strength in the suit bid, not necessarily much defence. How many ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: tricks did East hold himself?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west didnt get in to his spade  but Nunes has to lose a dim 2 hearts and a club whatever|pg||

nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Eugenio Mistretta|pg||
nt|eugenio123: ty|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it can be set by the ruff in @Ds|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I guess Pulga is going to open 2@d|pg||
nt|cicus: if s is going to play it|pg||
nt|eugenio123: most of italian players use this convention to show 18/20 balanced|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C by NS and only 2@H by EW if defended correctly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, before i thoght E/W made only 2 tricks, not 3|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: a slam ew|pg||
nt|bobh1: not a good one|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but can they make it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H 14+5+@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Forcing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: this is one of their 11-13 bids|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, definitely. thought I already had said that. :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or East|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seem to be a lot of 2-suiters.But we have yet to see someone bid one|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW has play|pg||
nt|mariner1: can also be beat best defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: both down if play game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: that is when you went flying|pg||
nt|april7: without ruffing value E should pass|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: 1@H would show 14+ points, so Fantoni has to open at the two-level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which system do E-W play? Livorno Diamond?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead causes issues if W plays it|pg||
nt|jcmax: But it seems EW are not playing strong club, because now West opened 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nightmare-ish I suppose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Michaels and inflation |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course 3 NT no problem without @S lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C=majors- 2D- you pick|pg||
nt|ritong: any imp counts, players like versace play to optimize every board reasonably|pg||
nt|brolucius: With four tens, even a timid bidder such as myself would have opened the North hand.|pg||
nt|daman: 11 HCP   4 10's   2 1/2 quick tricks    would anyone open the North hand/|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will end it|pg||
nt|mariner1: have to play S for the AJx @D and that is not intuitive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only we had their CC, but we don't|pg||
nt|eugenio123: anyway it doesn't seem hard to reach to 4@h|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd probably give it a try myself if I did not regularly played a strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont like the double by north - perhaps trying to get the last board and set back!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S here showing @H and a minor|pg||
nt|april7: needs a 4th @C and a @H less to X|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: 4h for sure here|pg||
nt|daman: Roberta said she will correct it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she has|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n makes too|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT also OK.|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Roberta|pg||
nt|mariner1: well there goes the 1@C arguement :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib informs me they bid slam OR as well previous board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East rushes to pick hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: even if they are not super happy with the contract:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is the spot Open Room|pg||
nt|andyv:  reality gets in the way of these slams|pg||
nt|bobh1: fantoni nunes avoided the bad slam on the first board|pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder if they will bid the one that makes|pg||
nt|haans: slam do not feel natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by West probably bec open in 3th position|pg||
nt|jcmax: In Italy I believe Ghestem is quite popular, so this may actually specifically show @S+@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2n maybe shows some values in the context of having passed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am giving it a go at the moment, but it rarley comes up :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and a lack of aces should devalue the hand too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl means 4@s - with 13hcp need|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3-3 in @s and find the @dJ will make|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may invite with 4N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N asking the minor probably|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: As played by the (in)famous Lanzarotti-Buratti many years ago|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so 2 east West pairs upset by last- 2 N/s pairs jubilant|pg||
nt|daman: I would open|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would, I am afraid|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he completes the transer with a weak NT|pg||
nt|cicus: I expected a transfer here|pg||
nt|eugenio123: now I wonder what is 2@h ,they should play transfer |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: When logic and proportion, Have fallen sloppy dead, And the White Knight is|pg||
nt|mariner1: talking backwards, And the Red Queen's "off with her head!", Remember what|pg||
nt|mariner1: the dormouse said :|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, is this a transfer or not (look at board 18)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I noticed Minardo bid 1@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: bid slam on this and you will never win|pg||
nt|mariner1: "Bid those Roland slams" :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't think Fantunes will bid this one either|pg||
nt|andyv:  they didn't|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes Ghestem would pinpoint the suits|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like it is lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga thinks it is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe it is a constructive, not forcing bid? Unlucky that it has wrongsided the game|pg||
nt|cicus: are you sure David  1@D showed @Hs?|pg||
nt|peachy: they may still not be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North thinks it is a transfer. He likes transfers?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 200 only|pg||
nt|sharkey: beats 130|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't be afraid, open|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to apologize for making a sensible bid.|pg||
nt|daman: OMG  if Roland would open?   then it has to be right :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they invinted 10-12 NTs for timid bidders|pg||
nt|hedyg: right! we would all open|pg||
nt|andyv:  invented|pg||
nt|hedyg: primes and great spots|pg||
nt|hedyg: plus a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I know some players who would reach 3NT on the East-West cards|pg||
nt|april7: but its not always good!!!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: whenever I do that I end in the 3-3 but they are headed to 3NT here|pg||
nt|daman: I am informed that 1@D promises a 4 card major  otherwise a weak NT 12-14   fixed by the system    is that true?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Meanwhile, E/W have bid the hand commendably - realising that they had no middle cards and staying low.|pg||
nt|mariner1: then 2N asking range?|pg||
nt|bobh1: bad trump break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally the pairs who play ghestem in Italy use the exclusion rule (so 3@C means no @C)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think they use micheal's|pg||
nt|jcmax: My own partnership has recently switched from unspecified 2-suiters to ghestem. We believe in many situation it is just so important to know the 2nd suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Some play that you complete with any minimum hand|pg||
nt|eugenio123: what's going on?|pg||
nt|cicus: S gives up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: if they were down more going in maybe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the disvantage to play ghestem is to lose 3@C preemptive overcall|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: but 100 on EW|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty daman|pg||
nt|daman: what 100 are you referring to Ralf/|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be a relay bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N fails on a @S lead from N|pg||
nt|jcmax: if it was Ghestem, then 2N would most likely ask for the range. 3@C would be MIN. And who would disagree with that?:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, something is going off|pg||
nt|cicus: he does not want to play 6@H doubled|pg||
nt|jtr: Another discussion will ensue|pg||
nt|cicus: taing away Fantoni's time|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: board 3|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h down 2|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: don't see that N can Dbl this - too risky|pg||
nt|cicus: *taking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know if they can respect the contract, I guess they can't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spectator: Are these guys experts? I understand the question, but they usually are. Everyone can have misunderstandings|pg||
nt|cicus: BTW it seems to me 1@D was some negative reply|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing makes sense to me|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I know both of them ( Pulga Rinaldi ) and they used to play well|pg||
nt|jtr: Except that 2@h was misunderstood|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe they are not a regular partnership? This does not look like a complicated position|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|lml: I dont think it was a relay I just dont think he had another good bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that the E-W names are not really what we see.  East is Minaldo with an  L,   West is Matteucci. Could you check that please, Roberta?|pg||
nt|tendenz: Hi all, 1@H is 3+ cards, 1@S is 3+cards, because they cannot bid 1nt. 1nt is an artificial answer, transfer for @C (weak or strong)|pg||
nt|lml: thanks ... makes sense|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh so good to have an expert on the system, grazie!!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: itè possible... they can't tell me their name, ty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Aldo :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Is North really pondering over the lead now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least 8 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tendenz: You wellcome, I usually play with Matteucci|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In the old days with manual given hands, they always sait that the queen always watched the jack|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not know if they have special treatments with three suiters, but bypassing @ss looks dangerous to me with west hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 2Nt asking about suit and strength of hand|pg||
nt|april7: here it was successful|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eugenio123: they play togetehr for years|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: K&R (T4 AT4 AT984 KT7) = 13.25 |pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead in Open Room made this easier|pg||
nt|cicus: Padova had a lot of misunderstandings yesterday|pg||
nt|bridge_one: re Geof|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|odysseus69: I agree - 4 tricks not enough and if 1 down not worth the pressure|pg||
nt|cicus: I think the main reason why they lost|pg||
nt|cicus: if you want to build a serious partnership, discussion should begin at the 3rd roungd of bidding, not end there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One would think that 1@C-1@D would come quite early in the system file|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess they just didnt prepare for this as much as they should|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|tendenz: 1@d is natural, or only 2+ wit 18-20 bal hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: The system is called Nightmare I believe|pg||
nt|mariner1: aptly so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may use a checkback system|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italian superstars are not desperate; they are sitting back and waiting for their opponents to stumble; so far it's working|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcmax: It seems almost impossible to me to avoid bidding to 3NT with the EW cards. The best thing to do would have been an auction like 2N-3N where S could not have bid for the lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Barry Crane rule...Q over in minors and under in Majors|pg||
nt|cicus: the sequence is simple enough to be included in their system notes|pg||
nt|jtr: Probably this is a newish developement of the system too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I just think Rinaldi forgot the convention|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Again, East-West have not been damaged, so maybe there is no need to call the TD|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that 1@C and 1@D are both artificial, it would be normal to play 2@H as a transfer. The auction begins with 1NT so to speak|pg||
nt|jtr: The specs have been damaged though|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is surely encouraging to see the big boys have misunderstandings?|pg||
nt|jtr: It is?|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate them myself and don't like to watch them either|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean the misunderstandings not the boys|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcmax: well, maybe we get some more 2-suiters and a chance to find out what NS really are playing :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew promoting a trump trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think Ghestem makes it harder to judge good/bad positions with some suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: combinations|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am being asked whether NS are junior players. anyone knows?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT seems to be better than 4@H (where you are looking for a 10th trick).|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: I am in shock. England have 4 SL wickets down for 17 runs after 5 overs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: can it be true?|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with @d Jxxx facing possible singleton, which would be good for a @s scontract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphztg: scusate x i nomi.... nn li ho capiti molto bene quando me li hanno detti... scusate =(|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Ghestem.html   for those asking|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble with using Michaels on this East hand is that partner will not know what to do next time with a little more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dangerous to play more trumps now. If someone has four, she will go a lot down. Better to play spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: East's 2@C presumed for Majors - surprised W didnt bid @S to for lead purposes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: there are other reasons why Michaels was a bad idea |pg||
nt|cuttysark: When I am n a silly contract I like to get it over with quickly|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  non aggressive lead by N most likely to cost a trick|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They can bowl a bit sometimes - but can they score any runs?|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Excellent slam (by my standards). I would be surprised if they don't bid it|pg||
nt|daman: casual*|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 19 OR in 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: nw a slam NS|pg||
nt|cicus: mentally|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems to be an easy hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a great start for Vill Fabbriche - too early in the morning?|pg||
nt|cicus: here comes a good result for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand will be a tempter for n/s|pg||
nt|sybarra: tempting for what?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: 3N NS here as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It should be called a GIB (or Deep Finesse) slam, not a Roland slam.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You would, of course, take the double diamond finesse Roland - maybe a small entry problem?|pg||
nt|daman: it might be possible with a strong club auction    but a 2@C auction?   do they have the room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No entry problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  a finesse and a dbl finesse....yes... good slam, Roland:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: now|pg||
nt|daman: there are 4 sessions of bridge left    Fabbriche needs to slowly cip away at the iceberg to the tune of 20 IMPs per session    a tall order but Padova almost did it yeaterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just doesnt fit |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt down with K@S in West - otherwise could be make if opps don't play @H|pg||
nt|daman: chip*|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 1NT 12-14 (in theory)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf    Nightmare as played by Grainger-Lavee from Canada|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see action here if anyone gets frisky|pg||
nt|sharkey: Battle of the part scores coming up|pg||
nt|bobh1: vulnerable to a @c ruff but not on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C has an issue with a @D lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this kind of misfit seems to get people overboard|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H usually 3-card support|pg||

nt|jcmax: non preoccuparti roberta.:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well seems no one will on this auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: conservative 3D bid unless it sahows full values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even 4@C is too high|pg||
nt|sharkey: N's making up for it by overbidding|pg||
nt|carleone22: oynuyosun su topu :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: This will not be easy to bid in my view|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Franchi Montanari are juniores|pg||
nt|jcmax: we can all see slam makes. But how should it be bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many asked about that|pg||
nt|daman: South should pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a classic Roland slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Let's see if West can visualize a slam now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H not a hopeless contract to b in but would fail here maybe by even two tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice fitting hands and a very nebulous 4@h which might be bid if E/W were vul|pg||
nt|jcmax: do we know how strong the 1NT opening is?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT 12-15|pg||
nt|mariner1: they can beat 2@H however should N dbl? not to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he should pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: just a little different dist EW and this would make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am lost|pg||
nt|sharkey: S thinking slam...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H?|pg||
nt|sharkey: How many points in this deck of cards?|pg||
nt|sharkey: N not done - or...?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D 4cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes kibbers are calling for 6@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: The key issue is probably the singleton @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@d makes not 6@c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: 3@d might make|pg||
nt|sybarra: calm heads prevailed here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt or 3@C would be bid by a sizeable section of players when they should just pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: will west lie|pg||
nt|hedyg: Roland said jacks should be worth 1/2 hcp|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s now is usefull for all ...|pg||
nt|bobh1: to figure that out you'd need to see the opp's hands|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt 4@c i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now a push|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: conservatism will pay here|pg||
nt|lestergold: need t uess spade to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: When there was a slight pause, I thought the players were taking a smoking break. This reminded me of an item of news today that RyanAir were going to sell no-smoke cigarettes on ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: their flights (£6 for 6), which give you some nicotine when you suck on them. I wonder if this product will be allowed at bridge tables.|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice discilined pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C shape inquiry|pg||
nt|cicus: 30 HCP balanced, but @S109 makes a big difference|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|daman: I understand Roberta |pg||
nt|daman: do you have shares in that stock david/|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, she said (I guess) that all the scoring problems are due to using a French computer.|pg||
nt|sharkey: My assumptions about part scores is wrong|pg||
nt|daman: I put my money on 3 NT    maybe 4NT at most|pg||
nt|jcmax: So now N bid 3@S. does S know this is the A? I would say not and expect 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fix @C interst for slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: if 3@c is anything close to natural, N has a nice hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and now 4@c|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@c now would tend to say that 3@s was the A|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade  5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: the battle that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure why they are not bidding the hands they are dealt, says a spectator. He may have a point|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they are playing a game with which I am not familiar- a famous quote|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he really has very little|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a replay of the Tour @D'Italia on TV now so all I need is some pasta and|pg||
nt|mariner1: vino :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: it was too  much to bid vulnerable without a clear fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I offer a beer if less than 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  same contract in OR so only wondering if any imp swings|pg||
nt|andyv:  martini, Ralf|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcmax: it depends on what double means. Optional would be good here promising at least 3@H and the majority of hcp. The Polish like to play that way.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm guessing 11|pg||
nt|haans: seems fair|pg||
nt|haans: 11|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni refuses to cue bid with an aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Checking for the @s Quee soon i guess|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Disappointing. They can't win if they don't bid their cold slams|pg||
nt|daman: J10's are worth 3/4 of a point|pg||
nt|hedyg: puppet sequence|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has nothing to offer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: perhaps they're counting Vienna points?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A brave gamble, George. Do you have Scottish ancestors?|pg||
nt|daman: none|pg||
nt|hedyg: must have|pg||
nt|daman: 100% Irish|pg||
nt|bobh1: lauria is tricky but not that tricky|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room EW are in 4@H DBL here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4@S means A, otherwise another bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: don't underestimate him! )|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i dont know if they play turbo with @C trump|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: We are not mean - just careful|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile on board 19, S did get to 4@hs|pg||
nt|jtr: How do we play this @s suit?  Odds must be close|pg||
nt|cicus: spades lie most favourably, even after a @D ruff you won't lose 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How would you play the hand on say a club lead?|pg||
nt|cicus: take in hand and lead a small spade to 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing the spade suit for one loser is not the only problem|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  odd line of play|pg||
nt|hedyg: opposite 12 really not enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprise, surprise!|pg||
nt|daman: the difference between a Scotsman and a canoe?     A canoe tips|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: wrong slam from the wrong side|pg||
nt|bobh1: unlucky for them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C depending by the auction - impossible North can have cards to make 7, and North must have one hoght card in a minor to bid in this way|pg||
nt|bobh1: from any side but from this side lead is obvious|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead is possible after the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West know @H is stopped by south (3NT),|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobh1: i think when your hand is that barren you have to get desperate|pg||
nt|cicus: if good news, ruff @D otherwise go for hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You also need a 12th trick from somewhere|pg||
nt|jtr: Well you have other chances if you just pick up the @ss|pg||
nt|jtr: @hs or @ds|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: weird|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing for doubleton in @s in South|pg||
nt|jtr: Lets see how the master tackles it anyway|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Slowly?|pg||
nt|cicus: let's see how Fantoni does it, I assume he's going to choose best line|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcmax: This is unlucky in my view. It should be better odds to play in your longer suit. But now it is lucky again because the @D was not led.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: @ss 3-2 with an honour onside then you can set up the 5th @h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: now off?|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|lestergold: fantunes wont let this make now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand declarers choice in 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was an obvious danger why not play safely for his contract|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: Lead suggests hearts are not breaking|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobh1: is it garozzo who says "always lead your singleton"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would lead @S the same - difficult @D lead will work after the auction|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: I once tried to buy something in England for a £5 note issued by the Bank of Scotland. "No way, we don't accept foreign currency", said the salesman|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Racist jokes would cost you a suspended prison sentence over here. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: +100 will be a fine score|pg||
nt|hedyg: happened to me too :(|pg||
nt|jtr: If an honour pops up by Sotuh then you can ruff a @d|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: it is amazing to see this sort of error at this level|pg||
nt|bobh1: by the time he reaches the decision in @hs he will have 9 in the bag|pg||
nt|jtr: 4-2 is ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have a ruling on board 18|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cicus: really?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Your fault for accepting the note in the first place. I wouldn't.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tell us more|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|nt|daman: baffles the mind|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: By the way, they don't have to accept Scottish notes in England. The banks must, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  8@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: and his table presence will enable him to get he @hs right|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  something's gone awry|pg||
nt|lestergold: only the contract|pg||
nt|daman: yes  undo needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: input error operator?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sharkey: so 500 to Baroni-Golin|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be suicidal to take @h hook...but W's tank certainly clearing up the picture|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ruling on board 18. 3@H-1 becomes 3@Dx-2, so not 7, but 12 IMPs tor Angelini. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wrong explanation|pg||
nt|jtr: Now just @hs 4-2 as i said|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I hear that in Itay they have done away with Appeals Committees|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow i dont understand that ruling|pg||
nt|cicus: wrong or not, Nunes should have X-ed 2NT, he has it set in his own hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you may add 5 IMPs to the Angelini score. We can't do that through the software|pg||

nt|cuttysark: They had better accept my notes in England!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be surprised if benito's principle was quite as general as that. more likely:  lead your side-suit singleton when you have 2-3 trumps|pg||
nt|cicus: well at the Bermuda Bowl plaers were discouraged fom appealing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced. Forcing|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@d was quickly defeated next door|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s seem to have got a little too high for no real reason in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|brolucius: If anything interesting happens on this deal, I am a Dutchman.|pg||
nt|andyv:  get the shoes out, David|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play EW|pg||
nt|lml: its always nice to have a new toy|pg||
nt|jcmax: Anyway, I was saying that in my view the Poles are the best in this world at doubling cooperatively. The Italians are good when one has a takeout dbl that the other one can pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni did not bother to play @c when in with A@s, he switched to @H, might go down in 4 @H now|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT usually played as forcing to game (in spades) nowadays. Some used to play it as at least a game-try.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E defense a bit soft... should have taken @d and led back @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, but there the TDs consulted|pg||
nt|cicus: true|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One wonders why 5@D rather than 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  0-11  no 4-card major|pg||
nt|jtr: East could maybe have given the option with 4NT on the bidding next door|pg||
nt|cicus: west bid a natural 1@D in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@C for me now would be majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C/@D down always|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak for E/W|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  1S xfer to NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: Back to good ole 3 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  which is what happened in OR... now S doesn't have 9 tricks without risking contract|pg||
nt|jcmax: I know only one thing: it is impossible to always find the winning lead.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be pass|pg||
nt|jtr: Lauria found a great lead I wonder why South didnt bid 4@h for the lead?|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT does that for them, hopefully|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Have they discussed 1NT I wonder|pg||
nt|jtr: South is wondering too|pg||
nt|peachy: I was just about to wonder the same|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North seems determined to test partner's knowledge of the system|pg||
nt|peachy: it must be frustrating for all 4 players when one side is on shaky footing|pg||
nt|cicus: it is entirely plausible with the S hand that N has a strong NT|pg||
nt|cicus: but he is going to check for a major anyway :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: How? by doubling?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe 3@D is natural and he can roll out the cuebid whatever it means|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: eay 3N here |pg||
nt|daman: it was corrected to -1|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot here for anyone|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: depends on agreement, now 3@D is surely something unnatural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S are making it very hard on themselves I think. It's tough enough to play against these guys, so when you add self-inflicted pressure, you are in dire straits|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yesterday we had Wet, Wet, Wet. Today it is Dire Straits. Switch to the music channel|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: many pairs play that East must show his singleton here - but the final contract would be the same|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's 4S (on a relatively good hand) rather suggests that West had not already forced to game.|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel estimated that his @cs were not worth a mention|pg||
nt|jcmax: N will not be unhappy to have stopped so low when he sees dummy|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: another 3n|pg||
nt|mariner1: W showing good discipline|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: cards friendly here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, David...Hedy corrected me:  clogs|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not a difficult game, this one|pg||
nt|jtr: They reached the correct contract What a surprise:)|pg||
nt|cicus: S may have intended his pass as forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm e/w got too high too|pg||
nt|april7: 1 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: anytime to be aggressive don't work|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: anybody bid 2@d in E?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this one is declarer-proof|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that it is particularly good|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: you can have another cup of tea David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am still waiting for something interesting to happen on the deal. Only then, will I seek some suitable forfeit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: NOT leading a dim might hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: East might have opened|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 boards...6 pretty flat hands....Angelini lucky to be even at this point|pg||
nt|haans: @D lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@D being off is key to total tricks here|pg||
nt|lml: I would open 1@d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: The first IMP exchange occured on board 4 - Posillipo picking up 5 IMPs - the missed undertrick costing 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club layout is so nice that you can make all four tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d may be different fron normal transfert|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: we all thought the last hand was easy and look what happened|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: my guess is 10. S is endplayed |pg||

nt|jcmax: if it's natural it seems like a good idea. would it be natural?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|tendenz: it's natural|pg||
nt|daman: pretty simple|pg||

pc|c9|nt|roswolf: now they will a spade ruff as well|pg||

nt|mariner1: 18-20 2+ or natural|pg||
nt|ritong: what are we doing with cards in hand, manoli?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising he did not try to slip through a club to the king. Worth a try.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@hs made in OR|pg||
nt|cicus: but makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lucky that both diamonds are onside, and dummy has enough club entries for the double finesse|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: they dont have an embankmant in italy to sleep on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c lead had made it more difficult for declarer to take more than 9 tricks|pg||

nt|jtr: And 4@s here is certainly lucky!|pg||
nt|cicus: extremely , and still on a guess !|pg||
nt|cuttysark: needs a good guess in clubs: East cashed two red aces, then underled, but Lauria got it right (doesnt he always)|pg||
nt|jtr: ah possible|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec says maybe 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder if Nunes upgrades|pg||
nt|jtr: Great looking 14|pg||
nt|cicus: this is an excellent 14 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he might open 1@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Compared to that crap 11 of Fantoni's|pg||
nt|cicus: I noticed he does not usually upgrade though|pg||
nt|cicus: they like their 1NT opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the multiway transfert are used a lot in the last times|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: They both do frequently, so 11-14 is more like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean you put yourself in Fantunes pasta machine and they make bolognese fo u quickly|pg||
nt|daman: whew|pg||
nt|mariner1: many precision pairs use a @H relay over a neg @D response to show the|pg||
nt|mariner1: different NT range by opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: another quiet 1N EW here?|pg||
nt|tendenz: 1@c is 15 or more nightmarish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S a lucky make|pg||
nt|daman: I'm glad this is a close match (hope that doesn't curse one team)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spare me from those who would find an excuse not to open 2@S on the South cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: right david  the way he played that hand, we can safely say that manoli is not very easy with vugraph|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS|pg||
nt|cicus: now it is less easy for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No more transfers, please|pg||
nt|jtr: Some people are unused to defending against a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surely this is a double??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s may be 10/12|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north may pass at the score to generate a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I only would expect NS to bid to 3NT if S for some reason had chosen to open 3@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely this is a pass?:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I hope rinaldi passes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rinaldi checking to see if this is a transfer|pg||

nt|cicus: hmm, I was sure E takes some rescue action|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfurtunately not best idea this time |pg||

nt|ritong: possible|pg||
nt|ritong: although i do not pretend to be the meanest guy:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Fantoni's pass is|pg||
nt|sybarra: *unfortunately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am not sure 2@s 10/12 (with 2@D weaker multi) but many pair in Italy use this system|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the cards of N/S are in perfect fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|april7: N might inquire about a singleton if possible, and finds the perfect fit to bid 4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: 1@S a relay to 1N?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a 4-card major|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done East responding|pg||
nt|jtr: West will maybe?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: another easy 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also E/W play 4@D|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either natural or any 16+ hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pass = less than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|ritong: concurrence is severe...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that you have co-commentated with David Burn, then.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt not so long to make - with Jxx in @c North would try, perhaps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even the most macho N would be unlikely to overcall 1NT with the N hand:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe they play a compulsory redouble - East will pull now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: weak hand with both minors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: redouble is forced|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe now they play inverted dbl so rinaldi may bid dbl|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so easy to catch them now|pg||
nt|cicus: I play T/O X-s in this situation|pg||
nt|jtr: Some play X as specifically 3 cards|pg||
nt|cicus: this hand qualifies :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: @c lead helps the defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might not lead @c now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Don't know why Golin did not blast 4@S before|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  NT 12-14?|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards vey favourable indee for e/w reverse north and south and Fantunes would be making chopped liver of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't want to invite with that hand, do you?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats too conservative unless forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: inter alia, yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W returned 3rd @s in OR, now same squeeze except this time in @D and @h for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well you dont get too many free gelatos from these two|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a little spumoni|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must watch his communications|pg||
nt|brolucius: I did not realise this was a cookery broadcast.|pg||
nt|andyv:  should go after @ds first|pg||
nt|lestergold: you dont realise a lot of things David|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is true.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you play against fantunes you get ur goose cooked|pg||
nt|daman: and all the hands are not chopped liver|pg||
nt|lestergold: some of them are schmaltz herring|pg||
nt|daman: don't be so wishy-washy Henri   take a view|pg||
nt|andyv:  you got your @d lead, Haans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: You could feel this coming on - he willnot be comfortable with this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  2nd dbl not recommended for faint at heart|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: This is getting one-sided|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and may not go the distance (96 boards)|pg||
nt|cicus: only good thing for Fabbriche is that there are 4 1/2 segments left to play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: To be fair, this is not a great game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, 2@S is weak , not 10/12 for N/S - so natural the pass by N|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's forcing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes 4s is a bit lucky but East is very minimal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Must be since Baroni cue bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may take 4@D as cue... - since no @C cue no damage|pg||
nt|jcmax: In my view N has no reason whatsoever to bid 3N on this auction. Partner is super maximum for bidding3@C now. but he just didn't have a different bid|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't understand 2@s, if they play t/o dbl he should've bid dbl, if they don't he should've bid pass ( in my opinion )|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: Versace taking his trick|pg||
nt|haans: better leads when you see all the cards|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: Versace would love to lead trump..|pg||

nt|odysseus69: anagram (nearly) for lollipops|pg||
nt|andyv:  so far,not a part score day|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the fact that partner suppoirted the suit does not really strengthen the case for a diamond lead. first, dummy is likely short, so declarer has diamond length. secondly, you want S ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to have WASTED DIAMOND STRENGTH --if the hand is pure you are not likely to beat the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 2@S weak AQJ10 and Q10xx out are a very good hand - |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW just need to stay low here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 4@h seems to be the order of the day here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13  5+ diamonds, unbalanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: when you are well behind in a match i have a principle to never be max for my bid but always to upgrade - this way you can generate some action without risking too much|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 2@S now would be invitational with 4+ cards. He may have a better option, not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Roland has been hacking into the dealing bot again|pg||
nt|lestergold: why did I say that?|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mariner1: grand here?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7 in 3 different way here|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: You did not point out, Mike, that Nunes has doubled in the 'sandwich position'.|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats enough food - Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT can make double dummy, but I doubt that it will in real life|pg||
nt|ritong: worse|pg||
nt|daman: would we all bid 2@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Quite so - but this may excape the axe if West bids 2@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@D or 7N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't look like it. He does have good cards, but not oposite a singleton spade|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@S should be easy to be bid|pg||

nt|eugenio123: after he knows the support|pg||
nt|sybarra: and versace upgraded and our table did not  |pg||
nt|roswolf: therefore i would have opened 1@S NOT 2|pg||

nt|lestergold: but what has roland been up to?|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N seems to do better justice to the W hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course - :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@H looks good. I ahd not noticed the 5-5 shape.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam but very close|pg||
nt|bobh1: most tricks in @hss but since they only give you credit for 13, 7n|pg||
nt|jcmax: This should theoretically not be ifficult to bid. There is a fit and W can just ask for aces and place the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought west would bid 4@D over 2NT to give the close suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Next set in 3 hours. Lunch break after this (board 32)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C looks a better save|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: after 1@h - D i had prefered 1nt as W, not 1@s|pg||

nt|lestergold: itsa 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is close|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes close but no cigar|pg||
nt|lml: I would be disappointed not to be in it until I discovered the break|pg||
nt|mariner1: since E is limited and so is W should the even be thinking game?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: villa Fabriche might have gained an imp by leading a diamond|pg||
nt|peachy: they might get a very short lunch break|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: i means that KQJ10xx x xx K10xx it is ok for 2@S, but AQJ10xx x xx Q10xx can be dangerous|pg||

pc|hK|nt|daman: Roland is watching his minions commentate|pg||
nt|lml: well they did well to avoid the game anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d doesnt|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has followed a strong sequence. I would have bid just 3@H (=a raise to 2@H) on the first round.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The vugraph schedule web page has been updated, so you can get an impression of what's on offer in the weeks to come (broadcasts that we are aware of that is)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it has been rather slow|pg||
nt|cicus: raise on 3 small is dubious if 2@S can be 4 so there may be other inferences|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S can indeed be 4 cards, per sys card|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4 NT quantative here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If declarer avoids a diamond lead and she guesses hearts, she is in fine shape. On a diamond lead she is destined to go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H*|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has nothing to cue...will stop at 4@h|pg||

nt|daman: Padova prends le devant par trois longeurs     Padova takes the leas my 3 IMPs (lengths)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: after the 1H response, 7 should be a foregone conclusion|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think you hav 17 tricks in @hs with reasonable breaks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: no slaminterest |pg||
nt|bobh1: ho hum|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S maybe some sort of range?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C here was a slam check|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's enough tricks to make a heart grand on this board and to defeat an opposing heart game on the hext one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may pair use the rule that after two round od cue 4Nt is cue also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there should be an escrow account:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: I thought W would confirm @H and then ask for key cards|pg||

nt|cicus: I wonder what X would have been , maybe penalty?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: would it be the upset of the year if Angelini lost?|pg||
nt|brolucius: What was the point of South's double? Getting too high is his fault, as I see it (although no doubt Angelini will apologise for it.)|pg||
nt|bobh1: hopefully 4n is some kind of KC inquiry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe there is a tournament prize for the longest auction|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: No idea why Nunes doubled instead of bidding 1@S.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H set as trump here I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: N worried about making game after seeing dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt key cards here, not cue|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: we all know you cannot spell Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: now its george he spelt onions minions|pg||
nt|hedyg: many Italians play Ghestem in which case @S/@C was known in E, so Versace could bid 3@H or unusual vs unusual with a better hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if so, that 2S bid was awfully wasteful...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: goooing to get trump lead|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: That would be strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent Irene Baroni!|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - offensive vs small slams|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead vs Grand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good lead- the old rule about attacking against small slams still works (sometimes)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And those who claim that you must never lead away from a king against a slam will get food for thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S makes this West should hide her cards more carefully....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i was doing a doing a disservice to womens bridge by suggesting a trump lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This 4@H bid contrasts with getting to 2@H opposite a re-opening: even if South has shown a good hand, he did not start with 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl could have been two things...1) able to punish one of their suits and 2) a limit raise in @hs with only 3|pg||
nt|april7: why that way|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: hes still okay in 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GIB will likely tell you that there is an overtrick, but the thing is that GIB plays with all cards in view|pg||
nt|daman: I would find it difficult to criticize Alfredo|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wow, South bid 4@S at the other table. I prefer a double to that.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its interesting how these chaps no when to avoid bidding their six card spade suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S (10)         Double (5)         4@S (2)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, he could bid 2@S with a sound raise to 3@H and a direct 3@H with a lesser hand (which is what he held).|pg||

pc|d5|nt|andyv:  it looks like Alfredo was hedging his bets|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are so few opportunities, we should criticise him while we can! |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could bid 2@s to show a limit raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry David, i was too slow|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's what they play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think North did too much with a minimum 5-3-3-2 opposite an invitational bid at best|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s could also show a @s stopper|pg||
nt|andyv:  and invite values|pg||
nt|jtr: Playing this way in case @ss 4-1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: 4@s on S must be some kind of suicide....|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't think anyone will agree with this line|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: More important to be able to bid two sorts of heart-support hand. |pg||

nt|cicus: EW can make 6@D here but should not bid it|pg||

nt|jtr: With the opening bid, yes|pg||

nt|april7: generous by Fantoni!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do hope so!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: indeed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@h and 5+ other (not @s)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The big hands at the start of this session represented a false dawn. Disappointing collection since then.|pg||
nt|daman: Angelini closing the gap    the rally is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead makes no difference if he plays @H immediately, no entry to the N hand for the 3rd @d|pg||
nt|sharkey: Since @C finesse was to be taken anyway and if 3-3 @D loser would go away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is that is natural|pg||
nt|odysseus69: unlucky grand- would be sick to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I might even open 5@C at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know that West is very strong when it goess pass pass to you|pg||
nt|hedyg: never bet with Roland, he is always right :(|pg||
nt|daman: he owes me 27 of them|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul too much for E|pg||
nt|bobh1: prob 4@h -1|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: S can count losers,,,,,,,,, I say no slam :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hedy Grey believes 2S was a nebulous reverse. 2N asked & 3H confirmed a big heart raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: having been an operator,  sometimes they hide the cards   |pg||
nt|sybarra: so operator has difficulty seeing all the cards sometimes |pg||
nt|april7: finally a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a limit raise|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cuttysark: Quit while you are ahead - that's the Scottish advice|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if the bidding does not die quickly then someone will come to grief here|pg||
nt|ritong: might be bloody|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was borderline, especially facing a passed hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why roland keeps on dealing 20/20s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is too wet|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 or 5 depending on your temperament|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think I wud have picked 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: those autographed by Roland are worth much more on eBay|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for no game :)|pg||
nt|haans: tell opps nothing some chance|pg||
nt|jtr: South may try something?|pg||
nt|sybarra: fit jump |pg||
nt|april7: no limit raise, gf!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm each to their own|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D a splinter (in Italoy always limited at 11/12 hcp)|pg||
nt|sybarra: splinter/no splinter (fit) |pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: They are currently fetching a Scottish £5 note.|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes the defence a lot easier|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew can make 3@s so 4@h is par contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: Will E save here? Phantom?|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get to 3@s if you don't bid it:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  he passed 1N...why in the world would he bid now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a fantunes passed hand  they open light|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will be interesting. What do you think about pass on S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a transfer to spades no doubt|pg||
nt|daman: whack 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: guess west likes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: what i think is for once fantunes are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 2@S with the @c fit|pg||
nt|cicus: a transfer?|pg||
nt|jtr: lolol|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S was 6 4 I think|pg||
nt|jcmax: NOw this is an auction I understand!|pg||
nt|mariner1: promised 4@H and 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I'm sure they've been in trouble before|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w might be able to get close to 3N but in reality this is likely to cost the great executioners|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos they werent likely to bid 3N on ther combined 20|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do North or East have anything to think about?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H looks like too much work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would be a fair shot by West now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wet wet wet- tell all Roland- another of your specialities|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D is wet too|pg||
nt|daman: at least|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right on, sister|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, may be 2@S multiway rever - it is used but may pairs in Italy|pg||
nt|peachy: have mercy on S.. :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a splinter in any suit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no i think @S|pg||
nt|april7: for me game hand!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere to use hight splinter with void and 3@S generic with a sgl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H 3@s = splinter any sgl|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: The only real decision was whether North stuck 2NT. That was a quite possible action on his hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that a band, Victor, or was?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now 5H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wet Wet Wet  I mean|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure- I knew you knew - I was expecting a history with some of their hits|pg||
nt|sharkey: If E bids 5@H West will bid again!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and how|pg||
nt|sharkey: and she'll bid too much... |pg||
nt|sharkey: So either an underbid or an overbid - can't see them landing in 6 of anything|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C is transfer to 4@H  Namyats or similar|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess E did|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough situation in 4th for big balanced hands|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: east not showing too much respect for his partne here|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the work begins|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor knows about Wet Wet Wet because the members are Scottish. The band was formed in Clydebank in the early 80's|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone pass the W hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash two @s and switch to @c|pg||
nt|bobh1: south african |pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: I think so.|pg||
nt|jtr: Immediate 1NT is usually 11-14ish|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I was cruel on him, I know how miserable he is feeling now|pg||
nt|jtr: I am surprised he didnt rebid 2NT but maybe their methods differ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some play 11-16 over a major in case partner responds to a double at the 2-level and you have to bid 2NT with 15|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|lml: going to make |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think best defense can beat it|pg||
nt|mariner1: another close dbl...... better to pass and hope the confusion causes a set|pg||
nt|lml: he has to play diamonds to make I think|pg||
nt|lml: if they play trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: it is well now that sabine and daniela play a completely natural system with no fancy artificialities:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well known|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: I cannot see why east has puled this double|pg||
nt|ritong: go and get em fulvio|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally in Italy the first rever is multiway|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Slow as ithe bidding was, East should have thought longer before pulling partner's double. Surely Double and Double had only one meaning?|pg||
nt|lml: I would have ducked the spade though|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually 7@H is not an overbid - just extremely unlucky it doesn't make|pg||
nt|jtr: I play 11-15 with a range enquiry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but they could use also a polish style, where 1@H 4@d = i want play 4@h |pg||
pc|h7|nt|cuttysark: I am sure some will bid, but I am chicken|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: And East had brilliant defence against spades himself, a singleton club and two trumps. |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is all about now whether east can restrict his iamond losers to only one|pg||
nt|ritong: a small @d is coming that s for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are4 black suit tricks available in dummy but communications are very bad |pg||
nt|brolucius: East is lucky that there is any play for game their way. He could not expect West to hold three hearts when he said that he wanted to defend.|pg||
nt|ritong: unless he tries the @c hook to pitch a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps a @c finess and a @s discard followed by @d10 can make anything|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: minaldo is thinking........ |pg||
nt|ritong: who would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club hook followed by a spade discard sill leaves a lot of diamonds to deal with- he could then afford to lose 2 dimaonds but not three|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that is why i suggested " a @d now"|pg||
nt|andyv:  David, is that before or after the 800?:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are a chicken, Liz, what does that leave me to be?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what do you want to bid on the 4 level?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: now more @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a game finally doesn't make!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That makes you some person|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga has to find three discards and he won't like that|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: A fox?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: and then squeeze W should bring the game in|pg||
nt|april7: I play:3NT= singl.@C,4@C=  sinlg.@D and 4@D = singl.@S, 3@S = a void|pg||
nt|bridge_one: typical the use of this gadget with few points and unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  but normal result|pg||
nt|april7: 3@S a void somewhere|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere to bid the void, to not give information about the lead when i have a sgl without chance to play slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: more probable the sgl that void, and more usefull don't tell where|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: but greed wins again|pg||
nt|mariner1: South African Texas|pg||
nt|bobh1: with south african responder has the option of declaring or being dummy|pg||
nt|haans: 6 deals Nothing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Having waved goodbye to a sizable penalty against 3@S doubled, Minaldo would very much like to make 4@H. But in this life wishes do not always come true.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: everybody has his own conventions!!:):)|pg||

nt|lml: tough hand for declarer and defenders.|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lesson in not making close dbl's|pg||
nt|hedyg: or beat it if you do|pg||
nt|mariner1: you only gain 1 imp if beating it one anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  since they opened 3@s:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: however you lose the natural minor bids|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you want to bid, you need that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not very valuable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't see a problem with dbl but then it's 6:30am here:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is that the hour of madness, where you come from?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hedy adds that this nebulous reverse was invented by Garozzo, and that he even plays it himself:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Speeding thinks up thank God!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see if Fulvio upgrades this hand to 1@H (14+)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The alternative is 2@H  10-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: well they are down 36:0 this segment so 1 imp would be nice|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud E have bid 7@H with 6 trumps only - after pd bid 6@H on her own?|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely bid next door|pg||
nt|peachy: i think too good for 2H (10-13)|pg||
nt|april7: I think you can't fool opps.always, if you have the right cards, they can't take your tricks away, better to give right informations to peven if Opps know about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: from an income to -500|pg||
nt|hedyg: keep 3 NT as option?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: I booked in for this session because I thought it might be all over by the 6th session. Shows what I know.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, 4@D is sensible|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, the danger is part has the right hand for 3 nT to be the last winning game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Absurd to hope for 3NT, as I see it. Much more important to pre-empt.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 8 will be a push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems they never upgrade|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I dislike 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's ask K&R|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  question was whether first Dbl asked for pd's 2nd suit and 2nd dbl was penalty or coop since it was in front of @s bidder|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thank goodness the West hand was not dealt in an American event.|pg||
nt|mariner1: at the risk of 5|pg||
nt|lml: I think if he ducks the spade he can make it after three rounds of hearts on the diamond club squeeze|pg||
nt|mariner1: ot more if the dbl gave the line|pg||
nt|mariner1: or|pg||
nt|lml: but he does have to duck the spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: but all in all, giving an exact picture of your hand asap is certainly the reasonable option|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2 3 imps is nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 15.5|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: EW cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: i have a feeling fireworks are about to go off|pg||
nt|bobh1: not on this hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: it is solely designed for use when playing on bbo vugraph, so no commentator has any idea of what we are doing and therefor cannot criticise us|pg||
nt|bridge_one: true, the idea was of Garozzo, for juniores team|pg||
nt|cicus: or so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c 9/13 5+@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting auction in the other room to a poor contract|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: the defense had its chances after that|pg||
nt|mariner1: can S pass this?|pg||
nt|lml: I couldnt|pg||
nt|lml: even if it was allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks in hearts, E-W have a save in 5mi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone but me who prefers 1@H to double?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in hearts - 9 in minors so potential for small swing - |pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm with you Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry. This is 4th of 5. But could have been over by the 5th session. That's what I should have said.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h can go for a ride|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@S by West if South passes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lightner doubles on the 4 level?|pg||
nt|bobh1: pretty good 1n|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another 3nt on EW|pg||
nt|peachy: in the given sys, I would have chosen 1H, but I trust Fantoni knows better what they have to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14.70|pg||
nt|cicus: but that using that count an opening bid starts from about 13 points|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2N shows 5+spades, invitational plus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AJ+AJ98xx+Kxx+xx|pg||
nt|jtr: and now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well he has a ratty 13|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@S is not so cold - beaten by 4 rounds of hearts (thank you)|pg||
nt|ritong: !!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..wow|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could get to high here maybe|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: doubling 2 NT establishes a forcing situation, imho|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: if west wants his pard to bid his second suit, he simply passes 3@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, but still makes the 2nd dbl questionable|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, i'll go with that|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at it this way: how on earth can West take the (huge) penalty against 3@S other than by doubling at every opportunity?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that there is no doubles for penalty in modern bidding.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Im  with the double|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has taken a vow of silence|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel really is pessimistic|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Who needs a diamond stopper|pg||
nt|jtr: A shrug and 3NT:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s looks best actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: looks more like 10|pg||
nt|lml: hes vulnerable|pg||
nt|lml: East is hoping hes going to pull to spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s making|pg||
nt|lml: but 3NT not making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if only they could invent something like that for declarer play:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl by South was takeout of course|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  if first dbl is GF, then pass would also be forcing... just depends on agreements|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not GF. It suggests interest in penalising the opponents. (Like redouble over a double).|pg||
nt|ritong: GF might be atad exaggerated  let s make it " board is ourse, don t let em get away with it"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|andyv:  OK...next:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think after 3@H he can guess the @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@s followed by high club|pg||
nt|brolucius: A generous adjective.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is cold and might even get doubled|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow he heard me!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I wonder what the double means|pg||
nt|lml: if anything|pg||
nt|lml: I sometimes play it means dont lead a heart|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C good sacrifice|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt winning bridge|pg||

nt|peachy: impressive\|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: don't lead anything except a @H :)|pg||

nt|bobh1: the defense has too much to do|pg||
nt|jtr: Wonders of thought transference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT shows 5+ spades, invitational or better|pg||

nt|april7: but 3NT ok!! very good choice by S!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: Couple of diamond ruffs would be handy|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: he wanted to X 4 @s maybe|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lml: and that is a good meaning on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to beat 3N when declarer starts with 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they try to set up a @h or @c trick, that will give declarer his 9th|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will hook @h and claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it has play|pg||
nt|april7: finally a swing for NS|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: there is an old expression in sweden 3nt will always be right|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  D not too creative|pg||
nt|ritong: or very brave  accepting possible double game swing that way is temerity, imho|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, it is quite good with maximum point count and a decent 5-card suit. The KJ bare in @S is a minus though.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jtr: Great judgment anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: In me if he saw the comment:)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

mc|9|nt|andyv:  ok, that was creative|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 23    EW are playing a tame 3@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably hoping 4@H would fail - as it probably would if he doubled|pg||
nt|daman: so a big swing back to Angelini|pg||
nt|mariner1: is Hammon Swedish? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: they both have had a good board on the same hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: West played @C6 and then @C7. If that denied a doubleton (as is normal), then East's 3rd club is hard to understand. |pg||
nt|bobh1: kit woolsey likes to say: bidding 3n is a dirty job but somebody has to do it|pg||
nt|jcmax: Always good not to go down. Especially when vulnerable. Even though +90 isn't much, it still feels good.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @H lead would beat the contract, but impossible after the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is an interesting hand maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: we all gone to same school|pg||
nt|roswolf: and this hand could have its moments too|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  another 4@h hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Did he not realise that there was no need to answer to doorbell?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would anyone overcall 1@S here?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boderline.|pg||
nt|ritong: very envisageable|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would not, bad suit and too many @ds|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, not quite borderline.|pg||
nt|cicus: good start to a club partial|pg||
nt|cicus: would be even better if X wer T/O now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: promise my pard bids 3@s over that and i come in|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores at http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirank.html|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 3N EW any lead if they find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Precision-ish, 10-15 with 6 clubs, or 5 clubs and a 4c major|pg||
nt|lml: or both|pg||
nt|brolucius: You certainly wouldn't overcall 1@H if your suit was hearts. 1@S does at least take away space.|pg||
nt|hedyg: remember that pd is a passed hand now!|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East know West with less of 10 hcp if unbalanced, so can easy pass also with 4@s notvuln|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S = conventional?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am not sure about 1@S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  2N invite with 4 ... could be better hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could be costly|pg||
nt|bobh1: in this case is better|pg||
nt|roswolf: or just a psyche|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could be also 4cards ....|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  and overbidders delight hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on as it is|pg||
nt|tomi2: both, south and west try to show a constructive raise via 2nt / the cuebid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume 1@s conventional after the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 6@S weak or less of 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use 1@H 1@s 0/4 cards|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: 3@S was a bit risky, but East was short in hearts and felt he had to act. The story may have a happy ending.|pg||
nt|bobh1: even white he should drive to game at imps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Duplicating the auction in the other room, (apart from the transfer)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: After elimination, E can play @d and anoter to the @dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|lml: brb|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no way to beat this as the card lay|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, can just take 4@hs on lead|pg||
nt|april7: thats for minors probably|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 1@h 1Nt 5@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm nice auction this:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades cold- 5H down 2 - but no need to save when they dont bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  E is border line... but with prime cards... good 3@s bid|pg||
nt|bobh1: there is no % languishing in 3@h at imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N will lead which @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on the range of 2N bid|pg||
nt|haans: game still need 50% nonvul?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at this table they know the match is close|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than P from E?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at the other,fantunes probably think they are still behind|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, no reason for him to suspect that they've gained any ground.|pg||
nt|bobh1: as the number of boards dwindles, this mind set could be a factor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing shoes|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now where s could double for the @S lead, declarer will have to guess the @C suit|pg||
nt|april7: a lot of points are involved here, everybody is bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c after DBL is natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: well south should know what is going on|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume Fantoni will bid 3@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The diamond length is an asset. I bid|pg||
nt|cicus: such is when you are too quick, Liz :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no :) pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: question is : whay will nunes play after the trump ace|pg||
nt|haans: but the master never seem deperate |pg||
nt|bobh1: a @c to the K is my favorite play but i don't think is percentage|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, you should certainly start with the jack|pg||
nt|april7: E suspects something, the strongest person here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Fantoni passed bec the partner passed at 2Nt telling not a good hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: West know the partner full of high cards in @d after the sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west could bid anything here depending on what he thinks is going on 4@S is not out of the picture|pg||
nt|roswolf: but now is|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: He can't quite make 4 on this layout, and he might have been in game if he had overcalled. So in this case Angelini did the right thing by passing|pg||
nt|brolucius: We must remember (at the end of the session) how good Roberta has been. I hope I am not invoking commentators' curse but everything has been excellent so far.|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the Michaels hand bd 24 Fantoni bid 1 @s over 1@H with 87432|pg||
nt|haans: desperate|pg||
nt|jcmax: The percentage play looking only at the suit is running the Jack. Here, however, if N has AQx or AQxx, declarer cannot succeed anyway, because there is no entry to dummy if N ducks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: what*|pg||
nt|ritong: ofc|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: cover and suit blocks|pg||
nt|andyv:  what was that all about?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there might be an entry, but not quick enough|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Silly me|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: rather than considering signing off in 3@h it seems E had slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can W have a strong hand on this bidding and E has 12!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Angelini did what he could to bloack the suit, and he succeeded|pg||
nt|jcmax: The same however is true if if North has Axx and s singleton Q|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: 2@h is ugly|pg||
nt|bobh1: this could cost the match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This should make. 1 IMP to VF, at last?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not trivial - but if he plays for Qx diamonds in East he will triumph|pg||
nt|cicus: luckily, @Ds have to be led only once from dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jtr: A mountain of work to do|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No convenient dummy entry with htis forcing game|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 finesses with one entry|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as is 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but less:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  who said bridge was a pretty game?|pg||
nt|mariner1: some miscommunications here somehow|pg||
nt|haans: sort of given it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  E very inconsistant on two boards (see board 3)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in open room played 4@S, so no, but if would play only 3@S this hand could be a double score|pg||
nt|april7: either a push or 1 imp|pg||
pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: once West decided to make the most encouraging noise - 3D might have worked better than 3H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H is normal, I would have thought, with such poor spades. Prefer 1@S when the suit is good.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is surely not a beautiful game|pg||
nt|hedyg: stopped opps from playing 4 @H, he is in 3 @s|pg||
nt|jcmax: The only 3-1 case where declarer can win is if S has singleton A|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe ruff high, 2 round of trums ending in dummy, then a @D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  if playing wk/st michaels, probably 1@s is the value bid on that hand|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 possibly now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not much in it |pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|ritong: some other black card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't matter a lot with this format, but ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E did not know, hoping for A10 doubelton in N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now @S by West|pg||
nt|april7: ruff with ace, its then a push|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: better A in @c, yes !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can't have A in @s, so the ruff the A was obliged|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: not his day|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: NS play odd encouraging and Angelini had no odd card in @h..|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this works because @c are 3-3 and N cannot have more than 2 @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead directer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My experience is that Michaels does not work well with intermediate hands. Weak or very strong are better in my opinion|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcmax: If @C are 2-2 then he has to guess|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|ritong: you simply cannot afford tp michael intermediate hands with a passed pard  the result will be 4 times out of 5 that ooponents play with open hands , and no compensation to that|pg||

nt|mariner1: 5@D has a shot|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D i amn't weak|pg||
nt|daman: if Fabbbriche could manoeuver a couple more gains in this session the deficit would be much more manageable |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@c pass 2@D/@H transfert are played from many pairs in Italy|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont play well but may be better then 3@H|pg||
nt|daman: might be down 1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, maximum one down at 3@c|pg||
nt|april7: in OR S was not disciplined|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make a bunch of @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: on a good day?  game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: yes but a lot of work to do in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@S=5+@Hs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Importat to find the spade fit|pg||
nt|haans: do not think they have system for 5m|pg||
nt|andyv:  pressure will really be on EW now and they should know it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the same contract as 3nt as I see it|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 11 EW Open Room are in the 4@H|pg||
nt|cicus: @SJ a great card,|pg||
nt|cicus: in OR @DQ took a trick , obviously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT  no singleton   3@C  relay   3@D  3262|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West know opps are weak, so he can bid his suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: is this a coffee break type hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: leading for pd with a weak hand, hoping to hit his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An excellent example. 4-4 plays better than 6-3. 7@S makes, 7@H does not|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has shown 5+@hs and 4@s so far|pg||
nt|haans: certain they have 11 as loser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C perfect - no key maximum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: solid @D , so 3@D seam correct|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: more wet|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao a tutti  had great fun wish you the same|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is it? Hearts seems to play OK.|pg||
nt|haans: they need a break?|pg||
mc|10|nt|tomi2: nrth's bidding does not look like 11 hcp with 3 card fit to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nor to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not in seven, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Au revoir, Henri!|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: sorry for my english =(|pg||
nt|brolucius: A fine result, anyway. Well done.|pg||
nt|andyv:  1 or 4@s with N?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think he should just start trumps right away, before the second heart|pg||
nt|jtr: Score wise maybe|pg||
nt|cicus: I meant if you guess @Ds you might as wel be in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 30 sek break|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N Open Room also on 12|pg||
nt|jtr: Odd 2@h bid by West next door|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Normal to get to 4@H E-W, and then the lead if East is declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only a club beats it|pg||
nt|lml: I was thinking that North really wants to get a club director in|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always 1@S, nowadays, it seems.|pg||
nt|mariner1: with a @S lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would want to mention these clubs|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: but West is probably going to play hearts now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am a 1@S man - you can still control the auction when you have spades|pg||
nt|jtr: and those points!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Being a VG operator would be one of my worst nightmares. Incredibly difficult. (I like to take a few seconds sleep every minute or so.)|pg||
nt|daman: Padova keeps hanging around  only down 2 this set so far|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 4@s|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That´s right, but the @h4 indicated an honour in @h on E so a shift was easy|pg||
nt|april7: another swing possible for NS|pg||
mb|d|nt|polpkeeper: 47-3 Catania a 4 mani dalla fine|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: women's final presumably|pg||
nt|jtr: East may need to duck the @dJ to have a chance of beating this|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: especially when playing|pg||
nt|ritong: wish claudio not to learn too much about his part s hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|andyv:  good to let the opps get their suits in|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 1@S 'man', Liz. Tell us more. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But even on a non-club lead, declarer has to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's all academic|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2N=5+@s invite|pg||
nt|ritong: heun?|pg||
nt|daman: whatever that means|pg||
nt|andyv:  invite +|pg||
nt|ritong: ah:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is a little wet|pg||
nt|bobh1: some guessing to do here |pg||
nt|cicus: IMPs coming to Villa|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: 5 imps al b.10 e 6 al b.11 incassati da Catania, avanti su Reggio Emilia 30-6 nel tempo. Siciliane +89 in totale |pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|april7: everything should be X now!!!|pg||
nt|daman: they are down by a ton  they should double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 2Nt or 3Nt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: I am also a 4@S woamn on the second round|pg||
nt|brolucius: Politely put.|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's what happens when you are a 1@s bidder:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Woman, even|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hmm..|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the face of it, North is lucky to find South with such good spades. He was not really consulted on the matter.|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he has inferences we do not get clearly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes needs little help for 6 so may bid 5@c here|pg||
nt|ritong: my remark is innocent, i do not undersay anithing mean|pg||
nt|ritong: any*|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2nt forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: popular in Italy- the Mexican 2D showing balanced 19/20 -or maybe 18/20|pg||
nt|jcmax: Which contract would you like to be in looking only at the ew cards?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with good @H Lauria would bid 3@H immediatly (i suppose)|pg||
nt|mariner1: however 4@H and 4@S make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6N is too much, though it has more than zero play single-dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: one of these is, imo, that with @s Hx, he would cue his know @c singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: known*|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S was a bid made without sufficient thought. The North hand is huge, particularly with the singleton club.|pg||
nt|andyv:  now hope everything is sitting wrong for N|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, oddly 3N because ther basically are 9 tricks no matter what. In any other contract something might break badly. But bidding to 3N seems a very difficult feat to achieve.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would like to be in 1C played by S|pg||
nt|daman: how can they do that?   if he thinks they can make 3NT   he should be doubling 2@Hs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: the gains on 4@H disappearing, Lauria is playing 4@c X|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl at 1Nt is 13 minimum|pg||
nt|april7: might go down, has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so minimum 24 hcp with east full of cards|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  5 loser hand, vul against vul, I prefer 4@s immediately|pg||
nt|bobh1: the hands don't mesh that well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C fixing @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: cue|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S would fix @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: on 4@HX|pg||
nt|tomi2: both players have 4333, that makes 4@S go down even with @H finesse working, no discards and no @H9|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: good card, the @s Q|pg||
nt|andyv:  good choice on this layout but @s lead will not bother N|pg||
nt|ritong: the K would have said too much|pg||
nt|ritong: one can underlead trump Kxx, but not Qxx, apart when the bidding had situated it already, like the 4@h doubled hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
nt|bobh1: plenty of values|pg||
nt|april7: only if E plays J of @D on small from N|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|mariner1: @c come home so @D by E when in with @S makes N guess|pg||
nt|jtr: Great play!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  low @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there it is|pg||
nt|haans: good defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good try|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be no guess|pg||
nt|haans: were is @CQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he overcalled vulnerable at the 2-level without @HAKJ, so ....|pg||
nt|mariner1: E pretty much has to have it 2@H vul overcall|pg||
nt|bridge_one: saying at the partner: i have a interesting hand but not too much ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i means 4@H by west|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do not think it is at all clear to bid 3H as E.....that might get you to the only game you cant make|pg||
nt|bobh1: E's hand is just too distributional to consider 3n altho i agee it is the best spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but E might bid 3D instead of 3H|pg||
nt|cicus: sensational|pg||
nt|april7: switch to @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make 9 tricks with aq final against East|pg||
nt|daman: he will continue @Hs I think   passive|pg||
nt|april7: N took @H in wrong hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: needed to keep option |pg||
nt|bridge_one: take a 3th round of @C - after @h @h @S @S and @c for East|pg||
nt|bridge_one: winning 2 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|april7: W could overtake @C a play @D very difficult situation|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if opps don't play @C then North play small @C two times|pg||
nt|daman: Fantoni is a notoriously slow player    some people say "thoughtful"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need that West play @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to beat|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Earlier today we had the women on vugraph. On one hand three players underbid, so Victor Silverstone thought they were members of the Scottish pop band named Wet Wet Wet|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East must give the distribution first ... i agree with 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but he has a spade entry|pg||
nt|jtr: Now he needs the @s guess|pg||
nt|peachy: speechless with admiration|pg||
nt|jtr: But not typeless:)|pg||
nt|peachy: not quite..|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: He is a favourite to have an outside ace, is he not?|pg||
nt|andyv:  opening lead of low @d would have been more bothersome|pg||
nt|bobh1: first hurdle|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: Would East bid with @SK in addition to these other goodies?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|bobh1: now can endplay E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and E is caught for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: not good either, because S then makes 2 @D tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for East not easy - North could have Q in @D but also Q in @C ....|pg||
nt|daman: maybe he can endplay him later in the play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably East will paly a mojor suit now|pg||
nt|april7: 2 of @S might be a signal|pg||
nt|roswolf: passive defence is the key  iexpect e/w to get this right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: that was 800 and 5 imps to Padova|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, that was the clue|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hurrayyyyyy|pg||
nt|april7: for N the endplay is the only chance|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|lml: play for stiff king of hearts or stiff jack|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobh1: and over 3@h, W, with his piddling @ds cannot rebid 3n|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 8 tricks, 6 imps. At last!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but the play is clear also for West, so i think down bec Q in @c is a card very usefull to play @D from W|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  things not going well for N|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Is he?|pg||
nt|andyv:  c'est tout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 7 now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: he chose stiff king|pg||
nt|mariner1: no outs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cicus: I just was about saying guessing spades is unlikely...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8 again|pg||
nt|jtr: Virtually a tie now....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 chance to play Q in @C for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs to exit with the spade|pg||
nt|april7: J of @C overtaken by W and @D, but then SN plays @D and @D and has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: Zugzwang in chess|pg||
nt|bobh1: another solid result for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: Zugzwang - German Chess term describing a situation where one player is|pg||
nt|mariner1: put at a disadvantage because he has to make a move - the player would like|pg||
nt|mariner1: to pass and make no move. In "Game Theory" it specifically means a win is|pg||
nt|mariner1: changed to a loss|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 25 will cost Angelini, Nunes bid 4@H over 3@s which might have made but Fantoni bid 4NT and now they are at 5 @H...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The heart is wrong (slight surprise on the bidding) but that is not enough|pg||
nt|cicus: but David :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|bobh1: so the auction got to 4 of a major by momentum|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|april7: bravo|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree about showing distribution, and that is why i think 3D is a viable (though perhaps not best) call -- if i had 5 hearts i would bid 3H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: small @D from E!!!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: You don't have to wear a tie on Saturdays|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We may add that to the manual before too long|pg||
nt|april7: ping pong|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it was not usefull to play K in @s from dummy to discard the K in @h, bec then no entry for @d|pg||

nt|brolucius: I think my mother would have spotted how to play this one by now. Ah, Nunes has seen the light.|pg||
nt|lml: and the next board to compare is good for Padova|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably they use 3@h with a good suit ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Janet and Artur hardly tough - Hackets past sell-by date |pg||
nt|andyv:  going to be difficult to stay out of trouble with E/W hand|pg||
nt|daman: that was a 15 IMPs swing hand|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here 6@C are ON !|pg||
nt|april7: another chance for NS|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H if they get there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nightmare is the name of the E-W system|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone dlb with E hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 4@h on EW, but will go down|pg||
nt|haans: 4-1 in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl|pg||
nt|mariner1: that nasty @H break should beat it though,,,,,,,, right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But P looks right after a weak nt|pg||
nt|bobh1: cant imagine E considering trying for game opposite a weak nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a pretty good system actually, where you, among other excellent features, get an 18-19 balanced opened at the 1-level|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all those who think i am crazy --- get in line :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@d=1M and 3@c=@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  this might keep them low|pg||
nt|mariner1: true also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A double and a transfer coming|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a chance for the trailing team|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: 1NT 12-14|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: 3@H by North will no doubt request correction if South holds spades. No, he has bid more strongly.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT on any lead but a spade, ducked|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Transfer? we haven't had one of them for a while|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 4333 you need to improvise re runout|pg||
nt|cicus: now where is E going after the XX?|pg||
nt|april7: but they will aslo play in @S, thats so in bridge|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobh1: so he has some sort of scrambling maneuver in mind|pg||
nt|daman: 1@H = @Ss|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H = 4@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming 1@H was a transfer then n/s might get locked in to @S |pg||
nt|april7: for sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now the only chance is Pulga think to have more chance playing at NT|pg||
nt|daman: impossible for North to pass|pg||
nt|teino: con attacco cuori si portano a casa anche 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  need to get @cs started if any chance to set this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that you play the right hand for the stiff @CA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand worth a 3@s bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with concentrtion of honors in S and @H 3@H is sure, also with light hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 clubs on a @H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but will he consider NT's|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good idea shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops sorry  ace of @D |pg||
mb|4N|nt|jcmax: the only thing declarer was concerned about was not losing 3@H tricks. If he had needed to play the suit for 1 loser only he would have played it differently|pg||
nt|roswolf: i doubt it too|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: balanced 8-10 probably|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: and he struck gold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: saved by the bell|pg||
nt|jtr: South went somewhere instead|pg||
nt|cicus: he solved it|pg||
nt|jtr: Went mad IMO|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet they try 6 sp also |pg||
nt|april7: the are destined for playing in @S|pg||
nt|daman: seems normal|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ritong: creative lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, not exactly what I had in mind:) but may well work!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, amazing. |pg||
nt|andyv:  good spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: He was worth showing a strong club raise and that is (presumably) what 2@D meant. Normal bid is 2@S on that hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a relay|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even with a singleton trump ace, a spade lead looks best from North. What else?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't imagine he is thinking about his lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Dano says 2@D asks for a 4 card major, here @h|pg||
nt|haans: up to 3@S?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh no! Important to read up on your deence to 1NT - must pass with 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: He would have played a low @H away from the A playing N for either 10x or H10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no - North know Qin @S out, so possible to switch in NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and destined they are |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C 4@s sure 5+@c|pg||
nt|daman: if fantoni doubles    maybe they will pull to 6NT|pg||
nt|april7: S should have bid 6@C and maybe N would have passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: north might get this right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S giving a void|pg||
mb|6N|nt|mariner1: 2N seems to have no chance here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d multi|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H pass/correge|pg||
nt|jcmax: that means if N had played low he would have inserted the 8 from his hand and if losing to an honor he would then try to run the jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: not so easy to make this|pg||
nt|bobh1: as is sometimes the case, by not striking gold he might have stolen the hand in 1n|pg||
nt|cicus: the obligatory XX makes it easier to distinguish between long suits and weak hands|pg||
nt|jtr: It would have been interesting to see what developed had he been sane|pg||
nt|roswolf: good bid|pg||
nt|daman: bravo!!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: well done Pulga :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed a wow bid|pg||
nt|april7: 14 imps back!!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the void means long clubs ! so better 6Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: you bid immediately with 5+, wait a round with 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is balanced 18/20 for E/W|pg||
nt|sybarra: no ruffs on opening lead, for sure :) |pg||
nt|april7: very good decision!!!|pg||
nt|daman: I predict a @H lead by Fantoni :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) it is always good to see great judgment|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|april7: doesn't need even @S finesse|pg||
nt|daman: 14 IMPs to Fabbriche|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: he will go down several in a flash|pg||
nt|lml: if cue bidding is not mandatory I wouldnt do it on the south hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  N doesn't want to ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  Laurie would never pass 1N|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobh1: guess -1|pg||
nt|roswolf: btw what a crazy double in the other room - may have got n/s into 6nt|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: A @c lead can create some problems, but not @d|pg||
nt|april7: take with ace, play K of @C|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: and he didnt|pg||
nt|mariner1: agree on the non cue with S|pg||
nt|bobh1: you're right he would balance|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  not now he won't|pg||
nt|andyv:  E fell asleep at the switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to play K@s after @c lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then go to dummy and finesse !J|pg||
nt|lml: to make 5|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D asking for @c back|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: for N/S probably 20/22|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or weak major|pg||
nt|bobh1: was thinking if bal 18-20 for ns, s could pass it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: One more segment tonight (in Italy). Restart at 21.15 local time, in about 2 hours and 10 minutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: well @H being 3 3 and AJx @S makes this pretty easy|pg||
nt|lml: yes hard to make less than 4 no matter what|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: But E found the best defence|pg||

pc|c9|nt|april7: overtricks possible ow|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: North should have ruffed with the @CA, which might have promoted his partner's trumps. Not as the cards lie, in fact.|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: e ho supposto male|pg||

nt|mariner1: now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mariner1: and now the penultimate board of the session,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a chance here|pg||
nt|daman: imagine if he had made 3NT on Board 13   the score would be 121 - 89|pg||
nt|april7: another chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I really like this defence, but a @d to @sK and a @h to @sQ....|pg||
nt|ritong: guess claudio said something like " good lead buddy"|pg||
nt|brolucius: An amazing lead to find. It would be great to know what inspired it. |pg||
nt|hedyg: lead is down to 14 now|pg||
nt|lml: they dont have any bad boards now that I can see but isnt it 18|pg||
nt|brolucius: What has a bad suppository got to do with it?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: the hand Versace opened 4@d OR opened 5@D and N bid 6@d|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Making 4@H was always going to eb a huge score|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need to improve your Italian David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is an excellent 6@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  another slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3n|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 3nt - on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Disappointing if the answer is: I had not sorted my hand correctly. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  natual 14+ or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session in 139 minutes|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam is alluring here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantunes have no weak 2 available, hence Claudio's pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume push board now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: Too good for you, Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Hanno il bord al contrario....|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|cicus: EW play their system in a very disciplined way|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E should bid 4@c to take up space|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c was natural, so now 3 @c is cuebid|pg||
nt|april7: 13 imps possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@h = 4@S ,,,, 1@s by South i presume 3/4 cards|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: i meant this segment, sry|pg||
nt|haans: gazzilli version|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ural or any 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either natural .....|pg||
nt|bobh1: the major suits lie very badly for NS though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 911 rushed to Rob's house one day when he was commentating because a Good Samaritan kib noted that he had failed to use the word "penultimate" to announce the next-to-last board ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and called it in|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam at the score is not impossible and n/s will be on a high|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-11  4+ hearts also applies over the take-out double|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was West not worth 1@S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not anymore:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: down from 36|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: what was 1@D here?|pg||
nt|cicus: (no 2@H by west)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, 1@s minimum balanced|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: nunes really wants to take room|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's dbl a bit unorthodox|pg||
nt|ritong: away from opps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I now prefer 1nt from W |pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how much Nunes would have bid if he had 2 hcps?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but Nunes had a bid before me...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't know why Nunes is operating. What does he think that E-W can make. Only 3NT, it seems, and he is vulnerable against not. |pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess E is allowed to pass!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's forcing, in theory|pg||
nt|bobh1: not the way i play gazzilli|pg||
nt|mariner1: told ladies score is close also; running scores at|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirank.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he might be steaming after the small @c with Qx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think you should double 5@D. This risk is that partner pulls|pg||
nt|lml: its hard because partner might have more |pg||
nt|lml: he was under pressure over 5@d|pg||
nt|lml: this could be a number |pg||
nt|lml: but you have a point|pg||
nt|hedyg: Aldo?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is a little dangerous with only three spades. No harm done here though|pg||
nt|bobh1: so EW have another foul up |pg||
nt|haans: gazzilli are often after 1M but 1m are also stated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Minaldo took a view but was not successful|pg||
nt|bobh1: his 3rd one this set|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H forcing (they use another bid to bid the inviting hand with 6@H)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well I try to remember the prepostantepenultimate|pg||
nt|jtr: Or 3@h even|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c id forcing conventional|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: looks like a 1 @c opening to me|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: é scappato gerli? =)|pg||
nt|hedyg: si :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: that lead lets it home|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's a make. I can't understand why Baroni did not lead a top diamond|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will be reached in other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C could be only 2 cards|pg||
nt|april7: should bid slam because thea are trailing|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  very anemic bidding for these two|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Pomares must now hope that diamonds are 7-1, and they are|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Was North worth 3@H en route?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Versace use 1@S pass 3@C to give the hand inviting with 6@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seems to be no danger hey will get too high now|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe an imp back to the leaders|pg||
nt|sybarra: may feel you dont try to make it up in one bd |pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  4@h in OR by W|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: io fossi in te m offenderei|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a quick off 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: should Versace have bid 4@c over 2@s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that South expected North to cue-bid the @HK if he held it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think Versace was worth more than a 4@s bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is wet, but did Roberta not say that Angelini is South and Versace North on this deal?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perfect fits require a bit of overbidding someties|pg||
nt|bobh1: not now no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rob, never end a sentence with a prepostanteultimate|pg||
nt|sybarra: on the other hand we saw Pulga "swing" on the 2 sp hand |pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: she did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hanno il bord al contrario....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: possibly - something about the board being contrario|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1 or 2 IMP for E/W now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: A strange auction. Presumably 2NT would have been conventional by West on the second round, otherwise that was a sensible option.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: usualy it is partner who is contrary|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, may be Versace changed that convention :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Yes, Versace is declarer, Roberta tells me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: I dont see too many minus positions for north south|pg||
nt|daman: au contrario|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: should put match out of reach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my book, If I have taken a devil in the boat, I have ro put him on terra firma. after 1@s I may not pass|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With this defence she does not even have to hope|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|vugraphztg: =) scherzo|pg||
nt|lml: Padova needs a big finish to catch them here|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we get ready for last hand we want to say Many thanks, to our excellent operator Roberta.   .. A job well done!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: didn t north open 1@c?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SK was an unlucky choice. Now Fantoni can't attack spades any more|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I see it, West would do better to show a little something by bidding 1@S on the first round, rather than make such a leap next time.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must know that N has all outstanding honoue´rs, so a @h to K and a @c and cover|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 1@C did not show more than 2+ cards|pg||
nt|ritong: looks free to cross to hand via a @h, tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But then @cQJ alone|pg||
nt|ritong: he draw ace first|pg||
nt|ritong: correctly, btw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S confirmed a club suit, though. With a balanced 15+ hand he would have rebid NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No, @cA must be wrong with so few communication cards|pg||
nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: north has 4+|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i always catch stiff jack in partners hand when i make that lead too|pg||
nt|daman: Brava Roberta !|pg||

pc|c6|nt|daman: he will claim|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|haans: talposy: it could show any rever: or monocolor @d, or @d-@c or bal 18-19 with 4@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I like W just rebidding 3N to show this type of hand, probably not allowed|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Nightmare............. hence the name :)|pg||
nt|april7: @S finesse now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: I stand correcte4d   BRAVA Roberta!!!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This board tightened the gap, so still there is a match|pg||
nt|daman: the next session should begin in roughly 2 hours|pg||
nt|brolucius: If E/W are playing normal multi, 3@H should be natural. Presumably everyone knows what they are doing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, dinner breaks in Italy are longer than elsewhere :)|pg||
nt|daman: kudos to the Pavoda team for holding their own against several world champions|pg||
nt|brolucius: As are smoking breaks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back at 1:00 am Los Angeles, 4:00 am New York, 10.00 Paris, 9:00 am London, 6:00 pm Sydney|pg||

nt|mariner1: which day Hedy? :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not me!|pg||
nt|daman: said the Walrus|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|brolucius: And always a pleasure to have Hedy on board!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the board is again turned 180°|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lot!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|jtr: And, of course, Roland Wald, without whom none of this would be possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: that spade suit is much too weak and to short for me to mention|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Fantoni has read it as natural, it seems.|pg||
nt|hedyg: next week Tuesday?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would double as East - may as well suggest hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us and thank you Roberta for a job well done.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
nt|daman: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: so Versace has the N hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C a Bergen or similar type raise///////////|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h again|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 14 NS are in 2@H Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: they are playing their 4 1 git|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h can be made with a correct guess in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: played 18/20 for many years ....|pg||
nt|jtr: he doesnt look a year older either|pg||
nt|cicus: easy to make 6@D her, only you have to find it|pg||
nt|jtr: TTFN people Gotta go|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lot!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: K&R rates the East hand as exactly 21.00 as the point count suggests|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: wimpy would be there :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D 14+hcp forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ+A10x+KJx+AKxxx|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you everyone, it has been a pleasure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: tomorrow of course specs, dont listen to Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS do a good job finding the game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Living dangerously|pg||
nt|andyv:  those are good to practice|pg||
nt|andyv:  have a lot more play than the 1-1 fits|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moyse would not approve, not to mention Burn's Law (Rules)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you shouls be able to find game with 27 HCP and no competition|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back in 2 hours and 10 minutes with the first segment of the final|pg||
nt|bobh1: ok thought u said 18-20|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East has good casrd in partner's suits and great controls|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: Maybe I do them an injustice and 4@H showed a strong hand. That is more likely.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the adventure begins|pg||
nt|ritong: je dis donc 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: oups pv sry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that double was ill-judged- no tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then again, I don't understand golins double on no tricks in @D. now Baroni has even an cae, she could be weaker with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing good @ss instead of 5@ds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S lead in open|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course, we need to thank our specs!  you all are the BEST, good comments, good humor!!  we love you |pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  tough choice now but S's cards just don't look helpful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well judged by Angelini. A 4th spade would have attracted a double, no doubt.|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@S is making as well, but is carries more risk|pg||
nt|cicus: it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back at 14.30 local time, in 2 hours and a wee bit|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H is accepting @Ds, I wonder?|pg||
nt|cicus: another area to discuss with your favourite partner|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Just showing interest, I would say - unless he would break the transfer with @SAQx|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: 2@D= 10-15, 6+@D or 5 @d + 4@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E wants to play a forcing game, a @h seems more in order|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does not want to ruff|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Partner bid clubs (yes, I know, clus are dead)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws  (Rules - never|pg||
nt|mariner1: play in a contract where the O's have more trumps than you)|pg||
nt|bobh1: this seems to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  wish i'd know about that law before....|pg||
nt|bobh1: pitch a @c on a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no problems any longer I think. This was the 2nd last card I had lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: does any lead beat it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: SSD was down by 11 at the start and now up by 12|pg||
nt|bobh1: underleading the @d might work|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West cannot have as many as 10 points here - not clear he has 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  same contract in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are E/W playing the multi? In that case South would not know West's suit and 3@H would be a natural bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Has a chance on a D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  thanks to all the specs, Roland, George, Mike, Henri, Ralf and Roberta for a most enjoyable time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No always a @d and a @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows pd has @ds as well as @cs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is a master of reaching the correct conclusions|pg||
nt|april7: should make though, although @H lead is best, must ruff 2 @D in dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Right, spade can't disappear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, the contract can be made even on a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He takes his time, but he usually gets it right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  everyone knew what to do on the @d:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a @c lead S had to play @sQ  to kill @s10|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx all. we are unpaid volunteers, but we do accept complementary cases of Brunello di Montalcino:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the best are you Shirley :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chmitty: l'entameur a commencé par 6@s maitres|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising that both pairs should get so high on these values. But if bidding was easy, hardly anyone would play bridge, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only -1 so 2 imps to NS|pg||
nt|daman: thnaks everyone|pg||
nt|daman: thanks*|pg||
nt|april7: another swing, this timefor Fantoni|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is essentially an easy make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, i presume 4@H made here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|lml: Versace was actually a touch too good for that bid|pg||
nt|lml: I counted 16|pg||
nt|bobh1: once you don't underlead at trick 1, you are lost|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That can wait. First he will lead a diamond up|pg||
nt|mariner1: more Italy and others on the schedule, Roland has been busy!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: End of a horrible set for Villa Fabbriche - let's hpe they are revived by lunch|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|mariner1: anyone know what the SSD stands for?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Besides, West can't play another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching. Hope to see you back later today|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, thank you all. enjoy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For full vugraph schedule, please go to http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  and bookmark it!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but passed pd?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he knows pd is exactly 1 4 4 4 so he can play @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: i tell my students that to double what counts are aces and trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: see you later! BYE|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what value there was in ducking unless W played pd for xx in clubs...even then doesn't make any sense|pg||
nt|jcmax: Thanks all and have a good night! Bye bye!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: And Qx|pg||

nt|ralfwil: after @hA E can play a @c|pg||
nt|bobh1: they have some imps coming to them on 15|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: With the match this close, Angelini may want to field the 4 top guns for the last segment in 55 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni-Nunes and Lauria-Versace|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|hedyg: assume E would have bid with A@s?|pg||
nt|lml: I would have bid without it :)|pg||
nt|lml: so I think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  yes, board 27 was a big pick up for Padova|pg||
