nt|ralfwil: 2@c from me as S|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: west could have shut the auction up by 3D here|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 6S looks infrangible tho not easy to bid with confidence|pg||
mb|2S!|an|16+ and 6+spades|nt|nickf: good slam here NS, too bad the spades dont break|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|granguru: Good result for NS  in open. They should lose 2@H and 2 black aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: the qH a very big card here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|lestergold: now by showing hearts north has paved the way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Depending on what 2@s shows, I had thoughts about supporting with @sK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they have reversed the board again, Smith has the south hand and Merven has the E hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: Here W declared the @H suit..Problably 3@H will just make |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north is too powerful to just 'sign' off in 4S maybe 5Swould be a better choice|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Mike! S has 3 key cards @sK, @hQ abd @cA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: south with key honours in the majors should know what to do if north bids 5S which after all is likely to be pretty safe|pg||

nt|ralfwil: instead of 4@c|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||

nt|lestergold: Kelsey wrote an excellent boojk on slam bidding many years ago which I think certainly in the Ul l;aid the foundation s of sound slam bidding priinciples|pg||
