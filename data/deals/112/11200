mb|p|mb|3N|nt|glen: and 3@S a bit useless, given 2NT denied 4@Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Easy to make 6NT with all cards exposed, but that would require an anti-percentage view in diamonds|pg||

mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|glen: often best to make passive leads against 6NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although a 4-2 break is more likely than 3-3, it's still better to go for the drop because you also have the 10|pg||
nt|glen: the idea of passive lead is don't give up the 12th trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That caters to Jx offside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So a competent declarer should go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was that a contradiction, hope not|pg||
