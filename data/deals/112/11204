nt|jallerton: John Howard & Andy Bowles vs Jeremy & someone (Keith Bennett?)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C can be set|pg||
nt|jallerton: Jeremy Dhondy that is|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: timing to beat 2@C very important|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is delicate|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm not convinced E/W were on the same wavelength about the double of 2@C|pg||
nt|panja: is this a 'double the player' kind of double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well so much for 2@C DBL|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah the tease|pg||
nt|jallerton: I don't think they play together too often. Alan plays more with Heather's husband, Jeremy|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: how many HCP has N shown?|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: and south accepts|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Importaht to play a @d in trick 2 I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to run a @D through but only one|pg||
nt|jallerton: but that could run into a @D ruff later|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think as the cards lay playing on trumps is ok too|pg||
nt|jallerton: could be right to play trumps and see what the defence play back|pg||
nt|mariner1: no more entries to dummy|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, but the defence have to play something when they are on lead.  May not be obvious to exit in @s|pg||

pc|c6|nt|mariner1: especially the K@S|pg||
nt|panja: with the @C lead, 13th @H, 4th in N hand, will be the 8th trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead makes declarer work|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||

nt|jallerton: E/W missed slam here in the closed room|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: tough to bid slam....... E has the stiff @H needed but not a lot to bid with|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: but West is in 4th seat....|pg||
nt|roswolf: perfect fit slam but will need the opps help to bid it i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h from S?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@H, I would think, yes|pg||
nt|panja: y, 4@H on the strength of @D fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jallerton: In fact 7@h is cheap|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@H perhaps?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Virtually impossible to get to slam after this start|pg||
mb|5S|nt|panja: leave it to EW..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@S is a great call|pg||
nt|roswolf: is east inspired!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice bid from W!|pg||
nt|mariner1: risking going off in game to try to reach slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: world champion courage|pg||
nt|jallerton: Punting 6@s is also a possibility|pg||
nt|panja: what is E supposed to think?|pg||
nt|panja: how does he decide whether to raise or not?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think E has a raise now........ though its tough to do with no count|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have 5 trumps and a useful singleton therefore i bid 6|pg||
nt|panja: well, if we understood the basis, we could discuss the raise...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with that|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@S says its not Aces she needs|pg||
nt|panja: let us say..no two losers in any suit..and top trumps..5@S shows..|pg||
nt|jallerton: But if East held @sJxxx @h xx @dxxxx @ccc that would still be enough for slam|pg||
nt|jallerton: @c xxx I mean|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|mariner1: something to ask for controls........|pg||

nt|mariner1: but the 10@C blocks his suit I missed that|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|roswolf: do both pairs play natural systems?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jallerton: N/S: 5-card majors, strong NT, 2/1 FG, 3 x weak 2s|pg||
nt|panja: 3N will play well on B12, not 4@H|pg||
nt|jallerton: North might try 3@s now as she can see the potential of a @s ruff in 4@h|pg||
nt|panja: automatic 3@S by N, I would think...|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N will a small @S lead not so much fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy north will try 3ny|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With some luck we will have comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1 after this board. 2 segments of 12 boards|pg||
nt|mariner1: in 3N with a small @S the @H suit does not come in and no quick way back to it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me is this sequence not forcing, so N can pass|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|jallerton: the winning action would be to pass 3@h, but that's too much of a position I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: W found the @S lead|pg||
nt|panja: y, pass would have been best, but very very difficult to pass Vul..|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heather Dhondy is a World Champion. Frances Hinden (Finch) and Graham Osborne (mayors) are among our regular commentators|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|panja: two more tricks for EW?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a @c shift -2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|panja: @S4 is almost a command for @C..|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|roswolf: which is ignored!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: This @dA was a little bit hasty|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|panja: doubles played solo|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|mc|9|nt|roswolf: probably a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: We have short break|pg||
nt|panja: this is why passing 3@H is such a difficult, and possibly bad, decision|pg||
nt|jallerton: Heather making sure that she beats the contract, Geoff|pg||
nt|panja: you cannot be sure you aren't going down in 3@H, nor that 4@H does not make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: E/W play four-card majors with a weak no trump.|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed a sound strategy|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: N/S five-card majors and a 15-17 no trump|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
