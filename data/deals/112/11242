mb|p|nt|bobh1: 4@h has a shot |pg||

nt|bobh1: very risky decision to sit for 3@s doubled|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa: they did. IMHO, E's hand deserves normal 1S opening. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: on this hand, doesn't work. But dbl of 3@S=100% penalty after bidding 2NT|pg||
nt|bobh1: E's bidding was "gutsy"|pg||
nt|rodal f: Fore shure and a new bad one for NS|pg||

nt|rodal f: Re open and pass from N? No|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as there is not much similarity between this 2@S opening and the last one  |pg||

pc|d3|nt|bobh1: on the prev deal, 1S also|pg||

nt|bobh1: to beat 5@h requires a @c lead|pg||
nt|haans: @H finesse|pg||
nt|bobh1: which is i think the right lead on this auction|pg||
nt|sfoxa: would u underlead KJ or partner's suit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: i meant to beat a declarer who has seen the hand records|pg||

mc|12|nt|haans: in pairs you do miss slams you do not have time|pg||
nt|bobh1: they must enforce slow play penalties very severely because bidding something other than 4@h doesn't take that much time|pg||
nt|rodal f: Since I don't like Bergen rais me and my partners also use minisplinter. So 3@C - 3@D - 3@S and u are there by no problem|pg||

nt|mdgraham: you have to define your strength for a direct splinter - 10-12 is quite playable. With a stronger hand you can go via 2NT  |pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

nt|chick: 100% right|pg||
mc|9|nt|bobh1: this is rather shortsighted because the demographics of the game in the US are terrible|pg||
nt|rodal f: In Norway all conventions are OK at the top turneys. Need to announce them 2 weeks before tuneystart so everyone can put up a defence. Other turneys we have some ruuls|pg||
