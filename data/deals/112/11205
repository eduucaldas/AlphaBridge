nt|jallerton: though I prefer 1@h response with !Qxx in @d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: bidding a poor slam is how many try to recover points- but now they wont get beyond 5D if they do get there|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should persuade north to stay low|pg||
nt|jallerton: hopefully not as low as 2@h!|pg||
nt|jtr: Over 3@c is South worth more than 3@d?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north may even pass unless they have some agreement about partial diamond fit|pg||

nt|roswolf: wrong again:(|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: easy lead- I agree|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice 4@d bid even so|pg||

nt|odysseus69: this is a good stop - as the cards lie|pg||
nt|jallerton: even 11 tricks looks beyond North on this layout.  As David says, just needs @c 4-3 to make|pg||
nt|jallerton: or honour-honour doubleton perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: so a piece of bad luck again|pg||

nt|jtr: And her doule of 2@c would be take-out?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Jeffrey- does Francis know the half time score - or would a double of 2C have been take-out?|pg||

nt|jtr: I would define it with a penalty double once South passes 1NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: If you play double as pens, you are stuck if you hold a 2452 11-count, say|pg||
nt|roswolf: it should be penalty imo|pg||
nt|jtr: I play that in all 'dead' auctions, doubles are penalties|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: my old fashioned style is that when we have stopped bidding and they make a late entry especially after 1NT - double is penalty|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with 1NT (strong)?|pg||
nt|jtr: I just said that Victor|pg||

mc|5|nt|jallerton: North can claim to shorten the agony|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east has rescued - wise man|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: East presumably could have shown a high card raise to 3@D another way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: again South should double this at the score|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jallerton: what is more, he has rescued into the 4-4 fit breaking 3-2 rather than the 5-4 fit breaking 4-0|pg||

nt|roswolf: apparently |pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d was probably either @h or raise to 2NT or BAron|pg||

nt|jallerton: 3@d lowest 4-card suit with slam interets|pg||
nt|roswolf: the stratosphere has been reached|pg||

nt|vugraphzwf: 2S was baron|pg||
nt|roswolf: more imps back to hinden|pg||
nt|jallerton: In fact, D10 in West hand makes 6NT a better slam than 6@h|pg||
nt|jtr: 6NT slightly better|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: West tried to bid 6h on 6nt.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah !!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6nt is better than 6H - if hearts 4-1 could make with spade king right either doubleton or with 4 hearts|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes it does|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jtr: Speeds things up|pg||
nt|jallerton: East perhaps missed the inference that West had not bid 3@C, therefore 4@c could not be natural and must agree @h|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Hinden- Allerton is the more recognised partnership but Hinden-Osborne have played some|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: Here we go with the second half.|pg||
nt|xenya: good evening everyone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: One of my favourite ways to creae swings is to pass where opposite number is sure to bid |pg||
nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: East/West play five-card majors, weak no trump and a prepared club. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: here I would decline to try any weak 2 as South|pg||

pc|c5|nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah double dummy?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wanting swings this is a standard pass from me- anyway I dont like 6-3-2-2 too much |pg||
nt|jallerton: it's a very good suit.  Much more to gain from passing @HAQ7542|pg||
nt|jtr: Scary:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when you are 66 down with 15 boards to play you want to be a little creative|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will not be pretty -2 or -3|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe a 4@h opening then?|pg||
nt|xenya: especially as game for EW is not certain at all |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the point is that you know that this for most is a standard weak 2 and you hope that this will be the wrong time|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the wrong time|pg||

nt|jtr: As Jeffrey said, with a weaker suit pass might be a sensible alternative|pg||
pc|hT|nt|odysseus69: 4H is the alternative but since I start by looking for passes and 4H is too rich for my old blood I prefer pass|pg||
