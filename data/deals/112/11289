nt|ritong: well, west did not know if she had to play a @d or a @s|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: east has a problem here|pg||
nt|royhughes: If 3@c is forcing, that looks right|pg||

nt|royhughes: 5@c is interesting if you worry about a 3-0 break in trumps|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ritong: one more time, the rule would have worked|pg||

nt|pamela: jeepers she must know  her P's opening bid style I would not have baled|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: "whenever pard invites and you have a shortness, just accept"|pg||

nt|ritong: however, it does not work everytime|pg||
mc|8|nt|royhughes: Right -- it's hard to tell if you have the right shortness, and there is no room to investigate|pg||
nt|ritong: but i m sure you break better than even if you accept automatically|pg||
