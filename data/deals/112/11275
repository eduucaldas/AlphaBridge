nt|daman: related*|pg||
nt|brolucius: A big hand to welcome us all to the event.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will probably see Angelini's version of Precision at this table|pg||
nt|lml: hello Sabine|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: Good Morning =) Buon giorno|pg||
nt|sharkey: so almost half way and a close match it is|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: Buon pomeriggio a tutti! Good evening to everybody! =)|pg||

nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no idea what system EW play, but we will see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini will likely open 1NT passed to West|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yesterday we had several deals where the points were divided 20-20 (not usually a good sign for entertaining viewing). I see here that the Great Dealer has made it 21-19 for a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: change. Ah, yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who will double, presumably|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong finish in the last 4 boards in the previous round surged Padova ahead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|daman: want a big hand?   clap clap clap|pg||
nt|mariner1: very close match after this many boards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: =) ty|pg||
nt|haans: Padova Bridge are not a team to run over|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 1@C  16+|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 -15 NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcmax: How many rounds have been played so far?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: BUONA SERA A TUTTI!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Semi-finals now, knockout|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A surprise|pg||
nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs apperently|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H seems simple enough here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Angelini replaced by Lauria|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT has some good prospects here EW|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: 32 hp on EW - let us see what happens|pg||
nt|daman: doesn't seem to be a slam in sight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes doubled a 12-14 NT in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  W looking at the security of the @h suit instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North escaped to 2@C and is playing there|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H will result in a minus for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: that makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  misfit may slow them down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 11 tricks on this layout. No squeeze|pg||
nt|brolucius: Five hearts, a diamond and a spade - one down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they switch to spades in time|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure they will|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3 or 4N likely spot|pg||
nt|daman: do we know what system EW are playing/|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a throw in for 12 - or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: undo please|pg||
nt|odysseus69: whenever I commentate I notice that every man opens balanced 11 - I wonder if the disease has spread to wwmens bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has, mostly because N-S can't attack spades. The suit is frozen for the defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be -1 but @h leads may create more problems for declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: 2NT=22-24|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N or 4@S plays ok,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: dbl of course takeout|pg||
nt|andyv:  a Roland slam missed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  I like 3N by S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nice easy game to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - the 9s and 10s coming into play here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini will want to show AK@C?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: 3NT is a fine contract |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we dont need 6 of us to analyse the play on this hand|pg||
nt|daman: you can reheat your coffees     this contract is in no danger|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had a bit to spare for his sequence, but the singleton spade entitled him to take a gloomy view of his hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially on a @D lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: D lead is right into the jaws|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but could Angelini know that?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Here is an example wher the @DJ in either hand would just make a huge difference.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon Rob, Bob, Andy and Hans|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure looks like 2 losers to em|pg||
nt|mariner1: me|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi ralf|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Ralf|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Ralf:)|pg||
nt|haans: hejsan Ralf|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: low from xx   2/4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can actually make 12 tricks on any lead, but you need to guess well|pg||
nt|lestergold: north kinder mullered in the majors and end played|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcmax: There would be 12 tricks on normal breaks.|pg||
nt|lml: he has so many top tricks it doesnt much matter about the diamond lead|pg||
nt|daman: better switch to @Ss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but he can't afford to cash the other top honour|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but more difficult|pg||
nt|daman: he can see the dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he cashes another @c they lose the 1 @s trick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: no Roland, he could not and should be happy to play 4@s IMO|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a squeeze and endplay for 12 now|pg||
nt|daman: a @S is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  W sequence did show some slam interest|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcmax: But it is always extremely difficult to evaluate in the bidding. Especially when the suit never gets mentioned.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Versace could have had  Qxxxx  xx  xxx  KQx  and then 3NT isn't exactly a great spot|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North wondering whether declarer is trying to steal 1 club trick- clearly they dont lead 4th highest|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Is that Angelini or Versace sitting North?! Nice switch.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C was not too bad a contract. You can take both major-suit finesses (counting 11 tricks if one wins) and perhaps ruff a heart to bring the total to twelve.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The lead indicates that he has something in majors|pg||
nt|daman: the @D 3 is a Slavinsky lead I am told|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 if declarer can sneak a spade|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam much worse than a hook since there are usually 2 @s losers|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|hedyg: yes wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, that's why it's a Roland slam|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: yes - S will duck|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|hedyg: wow now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: Andy Roland slams make :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @HA play works :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so he tell me:)|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim button not working|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria-Giubilo are in 6NT next door. Let's see how Lauria plays it|pg||
nt|bobh1: not yet desperation time but Angelini would prefer some action boards|pg||
mc|10|nt|bobh1: this one is probably a push|pg||

nt|odysseus69: more work in 3NT here|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, only a humble part score but there was a good point of interest.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 2@c was down while 2@D would probably make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass  1@H   4@D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now this is a Roland slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this is  a serious slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and we did not get any score here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I imagine made 5|pg||
nt|daman: there will definitly be a swing    depends on who is on the winning end|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: We are back in business in the slam zone again|pg||
nt|andyv:  and another slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time its infrangible|pg||
nt|daman: would any of us open 1@H?|pg||
nt|daman: there's that word again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not after a multi opening. Way too good in most people's books, but not for E-W here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer a heart to weak 2- too much outside tehheart suit|pg||
nt|daman: too many syllables    gives me a headache|pg||
nt|hedyg: might not have been exactly as we saw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East discarded a diamond? Then declarer pitched a winner?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 6@S there|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, even 5@d has to be considered|pg||
nt|brolucius: Twelve tricks can be made in spades.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Commentating.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double seems normal now|pg||
nt|andyv:  opposite a passed pd, 4@d still leaves a bit too much room to N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most top pairs play take-out double through at least 4@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: 6@h on a finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: my weak 2s dont have ak combos outside the trump suit not in forn of  partner im avers to missing gamers|pg||
nt|andyv:  should show max w@hs|pg||
nt|daman: ogusty|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might bid just 2@S, meaning that will be high enough if partner has spades. But they play their multi quite strong (as is apparent), so West bids 2NT with 16 points in case a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game is there by sheer power.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam there better than 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or negative doubles if you like|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a good hand for playing in @s|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely he will pass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: Quite good, yes, but is it worth bidding at the five-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: however on the bidding @ss might well be 4-1 or even 5-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: club finesse or no spade lead too|pg||
nt|andyv:  may get there now|pg||
nt|daman: West might not expect such a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl again|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one about the same as the last one with one difference|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N=slam killer|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 18-19?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: a little more work to do here|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a bidder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass and bid 5@S now, even considering six|pg||
nt|mariner1: all of Roland's slams are serious (to him) :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam makes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|odysseus69: defence on top and this looks tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if west makes a try tho east will accept|pg||
nt|hedyg: George pls stop clicking on the commentator's curse button|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six too much, surely?|pg||
nt|bobh1: the hook is on and the @ss are guessable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks on a finess and solving the @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems like an unusual call here|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone know what 4@h is?|pg||
nt|haans: no takers :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: clearly @cs with slam interest lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says 5@c slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose a heart to Jack and diamond to Q|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even if W gets 2 @S tricks cannot see making|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be then - two @D tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South's double of 3S was dubious, with two kings in unbid suits.|pg||
nt|daman: the double of 3@S might give him pause to think partner would have values outside @Ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s by W would have gotten a 5@d bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Intersting the @S suit never got mentioned here. But I guess no need if there is no fit.|pg||
nt|daman: hah!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes David, therefore "considering"|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm judging by his hand not what i know of their system|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 3N here|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4n probably says no interest|pg||
nt|andyv:  i play 4@s as 4-4 minors slam try makes sense to use 4@h as a 5 card minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|bobh1: so NS will get credit for trying but no actual imps most likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4nt is what I want to play if partner has any other vision|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: onbiously they are used to opening heavy multis|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: just find A@C in W and ruff 1@H for 6|pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting @S lead into 6n makes the slam easier|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt can never be blackwood but maybe Turbo|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now its into 4N|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  six no picnic with small @c lead from W and we saw some similar action yesterday those type of leads|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: nicely done|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Pretty neat, anyway, to reach a slam after a multi opening.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: Since @H is the communication 4th @H may become good|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcmax: East's pass over 1@H is also interesting. In my view passing with that kind of hand makes it so much easier for the opponents to come into the bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he rated Pass and 5@S (removing the double) as stronger than an immediate 5@S. But I'm not sure whether the hand is worth such a meaning. He has few honors in the majors.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  4N seems like a shot in the dark... i'd have liked to know about the K of @d on this hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: do you think this was a pass and pull auction?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  he has his 10 tricks and will gain an 11th by just cashing out|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: unclear|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|ritong: but the idea is important|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|daman: nice play|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would mean pass was forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need plenty of good luck in the majors (even in clubs) to make 6@S. A contract of 5@S is about right.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the other room S bid 5 @H over 5 @d..N thinking|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree that this lead makes it clear abotr the @s situation. Can be an offensive lead from the @sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't have much to lead from|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  closest to thumb works just as well|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: The 3@S rebid must have meant 'I should have opened 1@H instead. Sorry!'|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: nothing wrong if that is the agreed style but west would not be able to bid that way with the average Brit's idea of a weak 2 at these colours|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  or the @C K as a spec points out|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On board 1, the operator in the open room lost the play in 6NT at some point, but eventually we had a claim for 13 tricks. So Lauria must have guessed the line|pg||
nt|daman: is it possible the scoring s not hooked up?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D play well as W does not have one to lead|pg||

nt|hedyg: they are|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland you are on|pg||

nt|hedyg: 6@s on bd 1, after 9 tricks declarer thinking since a while what to play on opps small @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the thing is that you can't bid this making slam|pg||
nt|daman: is Lauria on this team?|pg||
nt|daman: or another?|pg||
nt|daman: I do not have the link to find out|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  don't care for 2@c bid here... looks like a 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is on this team, playing with Giubilo i think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: The North hand is hard to express, with so many bids being weak nowadays.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c bid to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 4h can be made  double dummy- but not even Nunes would do it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Modern methods will reveal that you are off one ace and the queen of trump|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hi Liz|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3rd seat favorable liberties|pg||
mb|3H|nt|odysseus69: i would feel sick if my opponents bid this to 6 spades - I hate lucky slams|pg||
nt|hedyg: Giammi on BBO|pg||
nt|andyv:  and OR is in that contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is getting exciing|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@C forcing Roberta?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: The West hand has only 14 hcp, but it is immensely control-rich with 4 1st-round controls. It might be an idea to open a strong club instead.|pg||
nt|hedyg: N showed @hs by X but Versace decided it would be too costly to defend|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think W should open 1@C here,,,,,,, just too much for 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot open 1@c if they play precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't dbl|pg||
nt|daman: I'm all for the red card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was worth 3@H, easily.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems very conservative|pg||
nt|andyv:  N seemed worth of one try|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all as E? i like to bid with an ace a major|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with the ace in my suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all pass*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I never pass with an ace|pg||
nt|andyv:  i never have an ace to pass with|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think vulnerable there is too great a risk of losing a lot of 100s|pg||
nt|hedyg: good, i am not alone|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's hand was better than it looks. He had minor honors in partner's suits (just where you want them) and aces outside, where you need quick tricks. Some players would have bid ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: more than 3@H on those values.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its not ust a matter of taking a first round heart hook|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand went down hill with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|daman: our side had an automatic tap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room East passed in 1st seat; then South opened a Multi, and E-W reached 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 2 that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of work to o even double dummy to make this|pg||
nt|daman: really|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he puts up qS and plays to run a low heart it would have chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: because he is not strong enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could upgrade the hand which I think he should|pg||
nt|jcmax: After a 2@C opening I don't believe there is any chance one can get to 6@C. not that I necessarily believe one should be there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but common practice is to not let pd play 1@c if you have any type of bid available|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even 1NT is an underbid|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes opening like this can keep the opps out of a cold gtame|pg||
nt|andyv:  first swing board|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: heavy opening - some would have selected 2 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks natural to me. Jump shift, 19-21, 5+ clubs, 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - N's 3@S stronger than 4@S - they may be on their way|pg||
nt|andyv:  and an expensive one it would seem|pg||
nt|bobh1: this will even things up i thing|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 4@S so we should have a very close match now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s  in the sleep for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: have to fault E I think|pg||
nt|bobh1: After rdbl, red at imps, I'm bidding game|pg||
nt|haans: depend on what xx did mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And easier after 3@h from S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: unless rdbl means something other than what i think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|brolucius: If it is being suggested that East should double 4@H, then I don't agree at all. His club values are worthless in defence.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slow 4S may force South to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: just thinking the same Victor :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a horrible, room consuming auction. No-one knows how many keycards they are missing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South must bid slam now|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east doubled4h then Nunes might well make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree David|pg||
nt|bobh1: at matchpoints i might tread more carefully|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes after 3@H E knows W has @H shortage so nothing wasted|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if it means something else, W's willingness to play at 3 level should have been enough for E to go to game|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: forgetting female intuition Roland|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|mariner1: K&R (A865 AJ8 AJ5432 ---) = 17.60|pg||
nt|lml: 6@S went down even after the diamond lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: to me hand is easily a 1@C opener|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR|pg||
nt|lml: on the first board|pg||
nt|lml: even if you open 1@C it is not clear to me you will get to a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is worth 17.6 on the K&R Hand Evaluator, so it would not be unreasonable to upgrade to 16+, would it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Axxx+AJx+-+AJxxxx|pg||
nt|lml: you have a minimum 1@C opener and partner has a minimum positive|pg||
nt|hedyg: but what is it worth when pd has no fit?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, nothing to worry about, and the opponents are feeling sick in a minute or two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but satisfies the RW test - it makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: slightly less than 50%....|pg||
nt|sharkey: S thinking Grand??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because she has no idea as to how many aces partner has|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As W my bid is 2nt showing an offensive limit with a 4-card @s support|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|daman: I would take my chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 100 instead of 50 is not worth much. If instead your double tips declarer into the winning line, you will have a big headache for a while.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did bid 3@s directly over 3@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think also you have to be aware they could be jerking you around|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Instead of RD|pg||
nt|andyv:  trust partner and you don't have to worry that much about the opps|pg||
nt|bobh1: at these colors quite likely|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: in that case you pass :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no chance of bidding 7 - just reflecting about life|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Sabine, would you upgrade that to 1@C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll never know|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: youdouble and no bang down of the ace of hearts thats for sure|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|lml: or would you bid 1@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: upgrading it to 1@C seems less distorting than opening it 2@C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: spade 9 best|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't mind 1NT, facing a passed hand, but it is time to re-evaluate when partner shows both majors.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Baroni is feeling sick already. Her only chance is that declarer has five spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: or East|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: that is when you went flying|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: 1@H would show 14+ points, so Fantoni has to open at the two-level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which system do E-W play? Livorno Diamond?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead causes issues if W plays it|pg||
nt|jcmax: But it seems EW are not playing strong club, because now West opened 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nightmare-ish I suppose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Michaels and inflation |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C here|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2C=majors- 2D- you pick|pg||
nt|ritong: any imp counts, players like versace play to optimize every board reasonably|pg||
nt|brolucius: With four tens, even a timid bidder such as myself would have opened the North hand.|pg||
nt|daman: 11 HCP   4 10's   2 1/2 quick tricks    would anyone open the North hand/|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will end it|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 4h for sure here|pg||

nt|brolucius: 3NT also OK.|pg||

nt|andyv:  they invinted 10-12 NTs for timid bidders|pg||
nt|hedyg: right! we would all open|pg||
nt|andyv:  invented|pg||

nt|hedyg: plus a 5 card suit|pg||

pc|c4|nt|lml: whenever I do that I end in the 3-3 but they are headed to 3NT here|pg||
nt|daman: I am informed that 1@D promises a 4 card major  otherwise a weak NT 12-14   fixed by the system    is that true?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Meanwhile, E/W have bid the hand commendably - realising that they had no middle cards and staying low.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: but 100 on EW|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty daman|pg||
nt|daman: what 100 are you referring to Ralf/|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3N fails on a @S lead from N|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: board 3|pg||

nt|daman: ok|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think it was a relay I just dont think he had another good bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that the E-W names are not really what we see.  East is Minaldo with an  L,   West is Matteucci. Could you check that please, Roberta?|pg||
nt|tendenz: Hi all, 1@H is 3+ cards, 1@S is 3+cards, because they cannot bid 1nt. 1nt is an artificial answer, transfer for @C (weak or strong)|pg||
nt|lml: thanks ... makes sense|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh so good to have an expert on the system, grazie!!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: itè possible... they can't tell me their name, ty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Aldo :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Is North really pondering over the lead now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least 8 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tendenz: You wellcome, I usually play with Matteucci|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In the old days with manual given hands, they always sait that the queen always watched the jack|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: i do not know if they have special treatments with three suiters, but bypassing @ss looks dangerous to me with west hand|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: K&R (T4 AT4 AT984 KT7) = 13.25 |pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead in Open Room made this easier|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: I agree - 4 tricks not enough and if 1 down not worth the pressure|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tendenz: 1@d is natural, or only 2+ wit 18-20 bal hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The system is called Nightmare I believe|pg||
nt|mariner1: aptly so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may use a checkback system|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italian superstars are not desperate; they are sitting back and waiting for their opponents to stumble; so far it's working|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcmax: It seems almost impossible to me to avoid bidding to 3NT with the EW cards. The best thing to do would have been an auction like 2N-3N where S could not have bid for the lead.|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: 3NT seems to be better than 4@H (where you are looking for a 10th trick).|pg||

pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: the trouble with using Michaels on this East hand is that partner will not know what to do next time with a little more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dangerous to play more trumps now. If someone has four, she will go a lot down. Better to play spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: East's 2@C presumed for Majors - surprised W didnt bid @S to for lead purposes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: there are other reasons why Michaels was a bad idea |pg||

pc|sT|nt|sharkey: More than one way to play @H suit - low towards dummy - which would work if N held Hx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer needs singleton heart honour, Hx or both honours with South, and she gets lucky|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: if west had ducked that heart he would have made more tricks|pg||

pc|h7|nt|lestergold: eggsactly|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: You did not point out, Mike, that Nunes has doubled in the 'sandwich position'.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@H looks good. I ahd not noticed the 5-5 shape.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam but very close|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Need a @D lead to have a chance to set 6 NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: Roland is watching his minions commentate|pg||
nt|lml: well they did well to avoid the game anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d doesnt|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has followed a strong sequence. I would have bid just 3@H (=a raise to 2@H) on the first round.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4 NT quantative here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If declarer avoids a diamond lead and she guesses hearts, she is in fine shape. On a diamond lead she is destined to go down|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: would it be the upset of the year if Angelini lost?|pg||
nt|brolucius: What was the point of South's double? Getting too high is his fault, as I see it (although no doubt Angelini will apologise for it.)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: No idea why Nunes doubled instead of bidding 1@S.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H set as trump here I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: N worried about making game after seeing dummy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: we all know you cannot spell Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: now its george he spelt onions minions|pg||
nt|hedyg: many Italians play Ghestem in which case @S/@C was known in E, so Versace could bid 3@H or unusual vs unusual with a better hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: goooing to get trump lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: had to keep that 10 @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5H= 2 without Q probably|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: That would be strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent Irene Baroni!|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - offensive vs small slams|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead vs Grand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good lead- the old rule about attacking against small slams still works (sometimes)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And those who claim that you must never lead away from a king against a slam will get food for thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S makes this West should hide her cards more carefully....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i was doing a doing a disservice to womens bridge by suggesting a trump lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This 4@H bid contrasts with getting to 2@H opposite a re-opening: even if South has shown a good hand, he did not start with 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl could have been two things...1) able to punish one of their suits and 2) a limit raise in @hs with only 3|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: hes still okay in 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GIB will likely tell you that there is an overtrick, but the thing is that GIB plays with all cards in view|pg||
nt|daman: I would find it difficult to criticize Alfredo|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wow, South bid 4@S at the other table. I prefer a double to that.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its interesting how these chaps no when to avoid bidding their six card spade suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S (10)         Double (5)         4@S (2)|pg||
nt|ritong: matteucci kindly warned|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Humans should go down|pg||
nt|sharkey: We'll all make an overtrick from here so not surprised that GIB agrees with us Roland|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well play diamond now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: and 4 was unlikely anyway on repeated club plays|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes, but could have made 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First hurdle is to guess spades. That is not obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hearts rather|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he could bid 2@S with a sound raise to 3@H and a direct 3@H with a lesser hand (which is what he held).|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: yep nunese smelt a misfit anhe read SJ Simon'sold book|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|andyv:  it looks like Alfredo was hedging his bets|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are so few opportunities, we should criticise him while we can! |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could bid 2@s to show a limit raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry David, i was too slow|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's what they play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think North did too much with a minimum 5-3-3-2 opposite an invitational bid at best|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s could also show a @s stopper|pg||
nt|andyv:  and invite values|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: 4@s on S must be some kind of suicide....|pg||

pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: I don't think anyone will agree with this line|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: More important to be able to bid two sorts of heart-support hand. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: we were in agreement there|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: my idea is the adrenalina generated by the 800 on the previous board is the main culprit|pg||

nt|mariner1: well so much for no game :)|pg||
nt|haans: tell opps nothing some chance|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: They are currently fetching a Scottish £5 note.|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes the defence a lot easier|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew can make 3@s so 4@h is par contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: Will E save here? Phantom?|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get to 3@s if you don't bid it:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  he passed 1N...why in the world would he bid now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a fantunes passed hand  they open light|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will be interesting. What do you think about pass on S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a transfer to spades no doubt|pg||
nt|daman: whack 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: guess west likes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: what i think is for once fantunes are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 2@S with the @c fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I'm sure they've been in trouble before|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w might be able to get close to 3N but in reality this is likely to cost the great executioners|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos they werent likely to bid 3N on ther combined 20|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do North or East have anything to think about?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H looks like too much work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would be a fair shot by West now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wet wet wet- tell all Roland- another of your specialities|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D is wet too|pg||
nt|daman: at least|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: The only real decision was whether North stuck 2NT. That was a quite possible action on his hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that a band, Victor, or was?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now 5H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wet Wet Wet  I mean|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure- I knew you knew - I was expecting a history with some of their hits|pg||
nt|sharkey: If E bids 5@H West will bid again!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and how|pg||
nt|sharkey: and she'll bid too much... |pg||
nt|sharkey: So either an underbid or an overbid - can't see them landing in 6 of anything|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C is transfer to 4@H  Namyats or similar|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess E did|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: east not showing too much respect for his partne here|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the work begins|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor knows about Wet Wet Wet because the members are Scottish. The band was formed in Clydebank in the early 80's|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone pass the W hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash two @s and switch to @c|pg||
nt|bobh1: south african |pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: I think so.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|lml: going to make |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think best defense can beat it|pg||
nt|mariner1: another close dbl...... better to pass and hope the confusion causes a set|pg||
nt|lml: he has to play diamonds to make I think|pg||
nt|lml: if they play trump|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: I cannot see why east has puled this double|pg||
nt|ritong: go and get em fulvio|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Slow as ithe bidding was, East should have thought longer before pulling partner's double. Surely Double and Double had only one meaning?|pg||
nt|lml: I would have ducked the spade though|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually 7@H is not an overbid - just extremely unlucky it doesn't make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: I am sure some will bid, but I am chicken|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: And East had brilliant defence against spades himself, a singleton club and two trumps. |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is all about now whether east can restrict his iamond losers to only one|pg||
nt|ritong: a small @d is coming that s for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are4 black suit tricks available in dummy but communications are very bad |pg||
nt|brolucius: East is lucky that there is any play for game their way. He could not expect West to hold three hearts when he said that he wanted to defend.|pg||
nt|ritong: unless he tries the @c hook to pitch a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps a @c finess and a @s discard followed by @d10 can make anything|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: minaldo is thinking........ |pg||
nt|ritong: who would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club hook followed by a spade discard sill leaves a lot of diamonds to deal with- he could then afford to lose 2 dimaonds but not three|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that is why i suggested " a @d now"|pg||
nt|andyv:  David, is that before or after the 800?:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are a chicken, Liz, what does that leave me to be?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what do you want to bid on the 4 level?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: now more @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a game finally doesn't make!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: A fox?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: and then squeeze W should bring the game in|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  but normal result|pg||
mc|9|nt|ritong: but greed wins again|pg||
nt|mariner1: South African Texas|pg||

nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|lml: tough hand for declarer and defenders.|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lesson in not making close dbl's|pg||
nt|hedyg: or beat it if you do|pg||
nt|mariner1: you only gain 1 imp if beating it one anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  since they opened 3@s:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: however you lose the natural minor bids|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you want to bid, you need that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not very valuable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't see a problem with dbl but then it's 6:30am here:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is that the hour of madness, where you come from?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, that's 7am|pg||
nt|hedyg: hour of sleeping here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: How many diamonds wil South bid?|pg||
nt|ritong: 4 looks ok|pg||
nt|bobh1: well . . . something|pg||
nt|bobh1: enough imps to even the match|pg||
nt|haans: close to nothing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: well they are down 36:0 this segment so 1 imp would be nice|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud E have bid 7@H with 6 trumps only - after pd bid 6@H on her own?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: from an income to -500|pg||
nt|hedyg: keep 3 NT as option?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: I booked in for this session because I thought it might be all over by the 6th session. Shows what I know.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, 4@D is sensible|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, the danger is part has the right hand for 3 nT to be the last winning game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Absurd to hope for 3NT, as I see it. Much more important to pre-empt.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 8 will be a push|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  question was whether first Dbl asked for pd's 2nd suit and 2nd dbl was penalty or coop since it was in front of @s bidder|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thank goodness the West hand was not dealt in an American event.|pg||
nt|mariner1: at the risk of 5|pg||
nt|lml: I think if he ducks the spade he can make it after three rounds of hearts on the diamond club squeeze|pg||
nt|mariner1: ot more if the dbl gave the line|pg||
nt|mariner1: or|pg||
nt|lml: but he does have to duck the spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: but all in all, giving an exact picture of your hand asap is certainly the reasonable option|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2 3 imps is nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: EW cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: i have a feeling fireworks are about to go off|pg||
nt|bobh1: not on this hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: the defense had its chances after that|pg||
nt|mariner1: can S pass this?|pg||
nt|lml: I couldnt|pg||
nt|lml: even if it was allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks in hearts, E-W have a save in 5mi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone but me who prefers 1@H to double?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in hearts - 9 in minors so potential for small swing - |pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm with you Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry. This is 4th of 5. But could have been over by the 5th session. That's what I should have said.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h can go for a ride|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@S by West if South passes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lightner doubles on the 4 level?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another 3nt on EW|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: well he has a ratty 13|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@S is not so cold - beaten by 4 rounds of hearts (thank you)|pg||
nt|ritong: !!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..wow|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could get to high here maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: doubling 2 NT establishes a forcing situation, imho|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: if west wants his pard to bid his second suit, he simply passes 3@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, but still makes the 2nd dbl questionable|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, i'll go with that|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at it this way: how on earth can West take the (huge) penalty against 3@S other than by doubling at every opportunity?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that there is no doubles for penalty in modern bidding.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Im  with the double|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has taken a vow of silence|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel really is pessimistic|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: looks more like 10|pg||
nt|lml: hes vulnerable|pg||
nt|lml: East is hoping hes going to pull to spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s making|pg||
nt|lml: but 3NT not making|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  if first dbl is GF, then pass would also be forcing... just depends on agreements|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not GF. It suggests interest in penalising the opponents. (Like redouble over a double).|pg||
nt|ritong: GF might be atad exaggerated  let s make it " board is ourse, don t let em get away with it"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|andyv:  OK...next:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think after 3@H he can guess the @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@s followed by high club|pg||
nt|brolucius: A generous adjective.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is cold and might even get doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I wonder what the double means|pg||
nt|lml: if anything|pg||
nt|lml: I sometimes play it means dont lead a heart|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C good sacrifice|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt winning bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: guess this always makes with careful play|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure they can beat this|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: don't lead anything except a @H :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't beat it |pg||
nt|bobh1: the defense has too much to do|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: i have to leave - enjoyed - ty all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: bye|pg||
nt|odysseus69: bye Carl|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cuttysark: Couple of diamond ruffs would be handy|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: he wanted to X 4 @s maybe|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: and that is a good meaning on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to beat 3N when declarer starts with 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they try to set up a @h or @c trick, that will give declarer his 9th|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will hook @h and claim|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: there is an old expression in sweden 3nt will always be right|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  D not too creative|pg||

pc|h9|nt|andyv:  ok, that was creative|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 23    EW are playing a tame 3@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably hoping 4@H would fail - as it probably would if he doubled|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Would anyone overcall 1@S here?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boderline.|pg||
nt|ritong: very envisageable|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mariner1: 3N EW any lead if they find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Precision-ish, 10-15 with 6 clubs, or 5 clubs and a 4c major|pg||
nt|lml: or both|pg||
nt|brolucius: You certainly wouldn't overcall 1@H if your suit was hearts. 1@S does at least take away space.|pg||
nt|hedyg: remember that pd is a passed hand now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2N invite with 4 ... could be better hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could be costly|pg||

mb|3S|nt|andyv:  and overbidders delight hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on as it is|pg||
nt|tomi2: both, south and west try to show a constructive raise via 2nt / the cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@S was a bit risky, but East was short in hearts and felt he had to act. The story may have a happy ending.|pg||
nt|bobh1: even white he should drive to game at imps|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: After elimination, E can play @d and anoter to the @dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|lml: brb|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no way to beat this as the card lay|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, can just take 4@hs on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades cold- 5H down 2 - but no need to save when they dont bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  E is border line... but with prime cards... good 3@s bid|pg||
nt|bobh1: there is no % languishing in 3@h at imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N will lead which @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on the range of 2N bid|pg||
nt|haans: game still need 50% nonvul?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at this table they know the match is close|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than P from E?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at the other,fantunes probably think they are still behind|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, no reason for him to suspect that they've gained any ground.|pg||
nt|bobh1: as the number of boards dwindles, this mind set could be a factor|pg||
mb|4N|nt|cuttysark: The diamond length is an asset. I bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: question is : whay will nunes play after the trump ace|pg||
nt|haans: but the master never seem deperate |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He can't quite make 4 on this layout, and he might have been in game if he had overcalled. So in this case Angelini did the right thing by passing|pg||
nt|brolucius: We must remember (at the end of the session) how good Roberta has been. I hope I am not invoking commentators' curse but everything has been excellent so far.|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the Michaels hand bd 24 Fantoni bid 1 @s over 1@H with 87432|pg||
nt|haans: desperate|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: what*|pg||
nt|ritong: ofc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: cover and suit blocks|pg||
nt|andyv:  what was that all about?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobh1: rather than considering signing off in 3@h it seems E had slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can W have a strong hand on this bidding and E has 12!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Angelini did what he could to bloack the suit, and he succeeded|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: 2@h is ugly|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||

nt|andyv:  who said bridge was a pretty game?|pg||
nt|mariner1: some miscommunications here somehow|pg||
nt|haans: sort of given it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  E very inconsistant on two boards (see board 3)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: once West decided to make the most encouraging noise - 3D might have worked better than 3H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H is normal, I would have thought, with such poor spades. Prefer 1@S when the suit is good.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is surely not a beautiful game|pg||
nt|hedyg: stopped opps from playing 4 @H, he is in 3 @s|pg||

pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: popular in Italy- the Mexican 2D showing balanced 19/20 -or maybe 18/20|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: one of these is, imo, that with @s Hx, he would cue his know @c singleton|pg||

nt|bobh1: the hands don't mesh that well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: on 4@HX|pg||

nt|andyv:  good choice on this layout but @s lead will not bother N|pg||

mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: Janet and Artur hardly tough - Hackets past sell-by date |pg||
nt|andyv:  going to be difficult to stay out of trouble with E/W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H if they get there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nightmare is the name of the E-W system|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone dlb with E hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 4@h on EW, but will go down|pg||
nt|haans: 4-1 in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl|pg||
nt|mariner1: that nasty @H break should beat it though,,,,,,,, right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But P looks right after a weak nt|pg||
nt|bobh1: cant imagine E considering trying for game opposite a weak nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a pretty good system actually, where you, among other excellent features, get an 18-19 balanced opened at the 1-level|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  2@d=1M and 3@c=@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  this might keep them low|pg||
nt|mariner1: true also|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 3@H by North will no doubt request correction if South holds spades. No, he has bid more strongly.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT on any lead but a spade, ducked|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so he has some sort of scrambling maneuver in mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  need to get @cs started if any chance to set this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that you play the right hand for the stiff @CA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand worth a 3@s bid?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: balanced 8-10 probably|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: and he struck gold|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: creative lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, not exactly what I had in mind:) but may well work!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, amazing. |pg||
nt|andyv:  good spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: He was worth showing a strong club raise and that is (presumably) what 2@D meant. Normal bid is 2@S on that hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a relay|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even with a singleton trump ace, a spade lead looks best from North. What else?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't imagine he is thinking about his lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Dano says 2@D asks for a 4 card major, here @h|pg||
nt|haans: up to 3@S?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: not so easy to make this|pg||
nt|bobh1: as is sometimes the case, by not striking gold he might have stolen the hand in 1n|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  good auction|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|ritong: he will go down several in a flash|pg||

nt|figb_rama: beh Rodolfo, anche voi in finale di Coppa Italia l'anno scorso avevate lottato|pg||
nt|figb_rama: forse non così ma quasi|pg||

nt|rcerreto: sì, un paio di "bucce di banana"|pg||
nt|figb_rama: stasera inizia la finale|pg||
nt|cuan: ma fulvio is thinking ?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: a 5@d potrebbe però esserci l'attacco K@h|pg||

nt|mdisacco: ma anche 5Q con l'attacco di KC|pg||
nt|cuan: ma sono avviati a slam|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|maqeda: forse un fraintendimento sul 3sa|pg||
nt|rcerreto: qualcuno ha idea di cosa fosse il 4@s di fantoni?|pg||
nt|toniemme: attacco a coppe e contratto regalato..|pg||
nt|rialc2: senza contro a @S temo attaccherà a @H|pg||
nt|rcerreto: probabile, purtroppo per i patavini|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ma Fantoni pensa|pg||
nt|toniemme: 4@C con quinta minore nera sconosciuta e il 10 secco di @D..purtroppo non descrive il j@H...|pg||
nt|cuan: secondo me misunderstanding sul significato di 3NT|pg||
nt|rcerreto: qui è successo un rebelòt|pg||
nt|toniemme: carino rebelòt con lo strano accento...|pg||
nt|rialc2: anche dall'altra parte quando al circolo aprono di 2@C crodo e poi dichiarano 3SA!!|pg||
nt|mdisacco: a San Paolo i Fantunes aveva apportato qualche modifica al sistema, e hanno avuto un paio di incmprensioni|pg||
nt|cuan: secondo me fulvio pensa al fit picche|pg||
nt|maqeda: o forse al fit a @C|pg||
nt|rialc2: purtroppo per noi all'ultimo board i nostri han reglato 4@H|pg||
nt|maqeda: in effetti ha detto 4@S|pg||
nt|cuan: il 4@S suona come stop, non come cue|pg||
nt|maqeda: si hai ragione|pg||
nt|mdisacco: dal mancato contro a 4P sembra che l'ipotesi "fit a P" sia ragionevole|pg||
nt|toniemme: e 3SA indica le @S vicino alle @D?|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: fulvio thinking|pg||
nt|toniemme: 3SA dovrebbe essere 54 minore ..|pg||
nt|cuan: è ammissibile ora il passo, se tu stai dichiarando sul fit picche ?|pg||
nt|teino: sembra ci sia un board segnato male; non siamo sicuri|pg||
nt|maqeda: il board 3|pg||
nt|rialc2: certo che, pur sapendo che non hai capito niente, pensare che 5@D sia un + che discreto contratto con quelle di Fulvio è inverosimile|pg||
nt|figb_rama: è arrivato Lorenzo, che dice alla 3 in chiusa gli hanno fatto 4@S+1|pg||
nt|figb_rama: per cui in questo caso c'è un errore nello score|pg||
nt|figb_rama: che vale 10|pg||
nt|maqeda: questo rivoluziona tutto|pg||
nt|maqeda: questa potrebbe essere un board decisivo|pg||
nt|teino: angelini a +4 smbra|pg||
nt|mdisacco: Angelini è quindi avanti du due..|pg||
nt|figb_rama: contando i 2 imps di penalità per Padova la situazione attuale corretta DOVREBBE pertanto essere Angelini +4|pg||
nt|mdisacco: sì, di 4|pg||
nt|toniemme: di diu?|pg||
nt|rialc2: e se non attacca @H battono 5@D. Purtroppo l'ulyima è un disastro|pg||
nt|toniemme: du due?|pg||
nt|figb_rama: finita la semifinal femminile tra Reggio Emilia e Posillipo. RE vince 152-136|pg||
nt|mdisacco: beh, 4C si possono fare comunque, il problema è che non sembra possiate guadagnare|pg||
nt|toniemme: ah de quater..))))|pg||
nt|teino: qua pero...|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui e quo...|pg||
nt|mdisacco: certo che qua 4 li potete segnare|pg||

nt|maqeda: finale thriller|pg||
nt|mdisacco: solo il 10P|pg||
nt|rialc2: alla 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There won't be a final if Fulvio never bids|pg||

nt|rcerreto: ma l'ultimo board lo giocheranno o vanno a cena??|pg||
nt|rcerreto: qualcuno ha tenuto conto da quanto tempo Fulvio sta pensando?|pg||
nt|mdisacco: siamo sicuri che non ci sia un intervento arbitrale in corso?|pg||
nt|maqeda: non sembra|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: sicurissimi Fulvio is thinking|pg||
nt|mdisacco: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: almeno 16 min da quando è partita la licita|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but Nunes had a bid before me...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't know why Nunes is operating. What does he think that E-W can make. Only 3NT, it seems, and he is vulnerable against not. |pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess E is allowed to pass!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's forcing, in theory|pg||
nt|bobh1: not the way i play gazzilli|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: he might be steaming after the small @c with Qx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think you should double 5@D. This risk is that partner pulls|pg||

nt|lml: this could be a number |pg||
nt|lml: but you have a point|pg||
nt|hedyg: Aldo?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is a little dangerous with only three spades. No harm done here though|pg||

nt|mariner1: so a quick off 1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4@S is wet, but did Roberta not say that Angelini is South and Versace North on this deal?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perfect fits require a bit of overbidding someties|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: she did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hanno il bord al contrario....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: possibly - something about the board being contrario|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: A strange auction. Presumably 2NT would have been conventional by West on the second round, otherwise that was a sensible option.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: usualy it is partner who is contrary|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, Versace is declarer, Roberta tells me|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: I dont see too many minus positions for north south|pg||
nt|daman: au contrario|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: should put match out of reach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my book, If I have taken a devil in the boat, I have ro put him on terra firma. after 1@s I may not pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: With this defence she does not even have to hope|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|nt|vugraphztg: =) scherzo|pg||
nt|lml: Padova needs a big finish to catch them here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: didn t north open 1@c?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SK was an unlucky choice. Now Fantoni can't attack spades any more|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I see it, West would do better to show a little something by bidding 1@S on the first round, rather than make such a leap next time.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must know that N has all outstanding honoue´rs, so a @h to K and a @c and cover|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 1@C did not show more than 2+ cards|pg||
nt|ritong: looks free to cross to hand via a @h, tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But then @cQJ alone|pg||
nt|ritong: he draw ace first|pg||
nt|ritong: correctly, btw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S confirmed a club suit, though. With a balanced 15+ hand he would have rebid NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No, @cA must be wrong with so few communication cards|pg||
nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: north has 4+|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|daman: he will claim|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|haans: talposy: it could show any rever: or monocolor @d, or @d-@c or bal 18-19 with 4@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I like W just rebidding 3N to show this type of hand, probably not allowed|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Nightmare............. hence the name :)|pg||
mc|8|nt|ritong: when he has exactly 4, you have the contract with 5 @c tricks when south has stiff H|pg||

nt|figb_rama: e lo stop a 3@H alla 16?|pg||
nt|figb_rama: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: si ha provqto ma meno &|pg||
nt|toniemme: l'errore al giro prima..dopo RDB nord dovrebbe licitare 3@D...both majors (inglese per Maurizio)...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: last board of set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Roberta, our outstanding operator in Bologna. Grazie!!|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play 80 boards total?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Victor Silverstone, Thomas Gotard and Carl Mathiesen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8o boards, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: =) Grazie a voi che c avete seguito!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then Angelini should have bid 4@c to get a @H cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 1@S showed a positive response (as was the case in Classic Precision, with a double showing around 5-7), then North might be reluctant to show any signs of life. Still, North ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: might have cue-bid 3@H and then shut up shop.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm sure there was pure disgust on that hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last hand this session.......|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Roberta (Italy), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the La Federazione Italiana Gioco Bridge and all the|pg||

nt|mariner1: Hans Sjöström (Sweden), Bob Heitzman and Andy Vinock (USA), and Roland|pg||
nt|mariner1: Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA).......|pg||
nt|bobh1: great job Roberta|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for ensuring that this event is brought to BBO vugraph. Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|odysseus69: with 7-5 beetr to bid 7 card suit then perhaps later introduce clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our outstanding operator in Bologna ,Roberta, brava!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sn di nuovo col bord al contrario|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently|pg||
nt|mariner1: at it!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you all for a great time...Roland, Rob, Hans, Bob, Roberta and all the specs who made this a lot of fun for me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Also to George and Roland! |pg||
nt|lml: 3NT looks like the normal spot too|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe east will throw in a curve|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our hardworking operator in Bologna ,Roberta,well done !|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: thanks to Fred and BBO for broadcasting this fine event   and thanks to Roland Wald for his yeoman work coordinating it all   come back soon for more |pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a lot to pass with though shape is not great|pg||
nt|lml: very good job|pg||
nt|hedyg: to my excellent fellow commentators Sabine Auken, Linda Lee, Rob Brown, Aldo Gerli and of course Roland Wald for donating their time and expertise to guide us through these ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: boards.as well as to the FIGB with Gianluca Frola for bringing this event to BBO|pg||
nt|lml: I really expected East to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next set in 2 hours and 25 minutes after a lunch break. 14.30 local time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like a smooth 5D on South not a slow anything|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent session. Well done!|pg||
nt|hedyg: to my excellent fellow commentators Liz McGowan, George Holland, David Bird, Andy Vinock and of course Roland Wald for donating their time and expertise to guide us through these ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: boards.our appreciation to the FIGB with Gianluca Frola for bringing this event to BBO|pg||
nt|daman: how many of us would make a negative double with the east hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back at 8:10 am Los Angeles, 11:10 am New York, 17.10 Paris, 4:10 pm London|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|daman: I stand correcte4d   BRAVA Roberta!!!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This board tightened the gap, so still there is a match|pg||
nt|daman: the next session should begin in roughly 2 hours|pg||
nt|brolucius: If E/W are playing normal multi, 3@H should be natural. Presumably everyone knows what they are doing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, dinner breaks in Italy are longer than elsewhere :)|pg||
nt|daman: kudos to the Pavoda team for holding their own against several world champions|pg||
nt|brolucius: As are smoking breaks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back at 1:00 am Los Angeles, 4:00 am New York, 10.00 Paris, 9:00 am London, 6:00 pm Sydney|pg||

nt|lml: love that emoticon|pg||
nt|mariner1: which day Hedy? :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not me!|pg||

nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|brolucius: And always a pleasure to have Hedy on board!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the board is again turned 180°|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lot!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tomi2: that spade suit is much too weak and to short for me to mention|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Fantoni has read it as natural, it seems.|pg||
nt|hedyg: next week Tuesday?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would double as East - may as well suggest hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us and thank you Roberta for a job well done.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
nt|daman: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: so Versace has the N hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C a Bergen or similar type raise///////////|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h again|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 14 NS are in 2@H Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: they are playing their 4 1 git|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h can be made with a correct guess in @s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: wimpy would be there :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: tomorrow of course specs, dont listen to Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS do a good job finding the game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Living dangerously|pg||
nt|andyv:  those are good to practice|pg||
nt|andyv:  have a lot more play than the 1-1 fits|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moyse would not approve, not to mention Burn's Law (Rules)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: you shouls be able to find game with 27 HCP and no competition|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back in 2 hours and 10 minutes with the first segment of the final|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Maybe I do them an injustice and 4@H showed a strong hand. That is more likely.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the adventure begins|pg||
nt|ritong: je dis donc 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: oups pv sry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that double was ill-judged- no tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then again, I don't understand golins double on no tricks in @D. now Baroni has even an cae, she could be weaker with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing good @ss instead of 5@ds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  tough choice now but S's cards just don't look helpful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well judged by Angelini. A 4th spade would have attracted a double, no doubt.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= 10-15, 6+@D or 5 @d + 4@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E wants to play a forcing game, a @h seems more in order|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does not want to ruff|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Partner bid clubs (yes, I know, clus are dead)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws  (Rules - never|pg||
nt|mariner1: play in a contract where the O's have more trumps than you)|pg||
nt|bobh1: this seems to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  wish i'd know about that law before....|pg||
nt|bobh1: pitch a @c on a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no problems any longer I think. This was the 2nd last card I had lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: does any lead beat it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: SSD was down by 11 at the start and now up by 12|pg||
nt|bobh1: underleading the @d might work|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  same contract in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are E/W playing the multi? In that case South would not know West's suit and 3@H would be a natural bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Has a chance on a D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  thanks to all the specs, Roland, George, Mike, Henri, Ralf and Roberta for a most enjoyable time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No always a @d and a @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows pd has @ds as well as @cs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Right, spade can't disappear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, the contract can be made even on a club lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone knew what to do on the @d:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a @c lead S had to play @sQ  to kill @s10|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|chmitty: l'entameur a commencé par 6@s maitres|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising that both pairs should get so high on these values. But if bidding was easy, hardly anyone would play bridge, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only -1 so 2 imps to NS|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: Versace was actually a touch too good for that bid|pg||
nt|lml: I counted 16|pg||
nt|bobh1: once you don't underlead at trick 1, you are lost|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That can wait. First he will lead a diamond up|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|mariner1: anyone know what the SSD stands for?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Besides, West can't play another club|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: yes but passed pd?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he knows pd is exactly 1 4 4 4 so he can play @H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: i tell my students that to double what counts are aces and trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: see you later! BYE|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what value there was in ducking unless W played pd for xx in clubs...even then doesn't make any sense|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: And Qx|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: still AKQ and KQ|pg||
nt|lml: not bad suits but ok|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @hA E can play a @c|pg||
nt|bobh1: they have some imps coming to them on 15|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: With the match this close, Angelini may want to field the 4 top guns for the last segment in 55 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni-Nunes and Lauria-Versace|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: assume E would have bid with A@s?|pg||
nt|lml: I would have bid without it :)|pg||
nt|lml: so I think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, board 27 was a big pick up for Padova|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough set for Padova... they played very well|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Padova have made 4@S on 27, and another likely game swing on 29|pg||
