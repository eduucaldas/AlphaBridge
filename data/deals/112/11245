mb|3C|nt|lml: I think most people would bid 2@C on the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 2H???????????????|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa: and bid by E - I would jump to heart game after dbl|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he thought he was too good for 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Showing steel W    In my eyes, but...|pg||
nt|lml: we are missing something here|pg||
nt|jwit: How can east possibly bid only 2H???????????|pg||
nt|jwit: Maybe it went 1S 2C P 2H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa: NT once more?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|bobh1: 7@d is cold, 6n has no play|pg||
nt|sfoxa: u r right, Bob, grand in diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: there is a danger with this double|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Just to find it Bob|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: something went very wrong here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: north second pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as many are tired now. They had better bridge from the morning|pg||
nt|bobh1: N should not pass for starters|pg||
nt|jwit: South is so powerful, maybe he should bid 3S over 2S rather than double|pg||
nt|lml: yes I agree with that|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a normal 1n bid|pg||
nt|lml: North and South both should have bid|pg||
nt|lml: more|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: was he hoping to double them in 1@s for penalties?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa: or just slept away his turn with 1NT bid?|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes I like 1NT over 1S, but even on this auction, I feel South should have bid 3S over 2S|pg||
mc|11|nt|bobh1: i would reluctant to double with that hand but they possibly play it is 100% takeout|pg||
nt|lml: and after all that I would have bid over 3NT|pg||
nt|chick: what bid, Linda?|pg||
nt|lml: 4@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: S does have a tremendous hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: As I wrote. NS lost 4% at last session and went from 3 til 12. 24th place had 57.38% and NS 59.06%|pg||
nt|lml: North knows I dont just have diamonds or I would have bid them earlier|pg||
nt|sfoxa: 4 diamond sould show strong hand (18+) with 5+ diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: 24 best to the final in december|pg||
nt|lml: and probably hearts too|pg||
nt|lml: for the double|pg||
nt|lml: 3@D would have shown a good hand with diamonds|pg||
nt|sfoxa: 24 best - but not pairs, but players. long-term score is kept individually, so each of the 24 on top will choose a partner for final|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure why he ducked that.  doesnt he have 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: The still are nr. 12 and have 2.07% down til 24th place|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Sveta. I misundstood the info from the morning. Sr all|pg||
nt|jwit: This might have been a more feasible auction on the last- 1C 1S 1NT 2S 3S P 4D for starters.|pg||
nt|sfoxa: sounds good|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes players dont get to slam because of prrempts.  here is was just spade overcall and raise|pg||
nt|lml: if your system doesnt handle that much interference you better review it|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: tempo|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@HW-1 in the other room.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|bobh1: right and presumably these guys are top level and conscious of that|pg||
mb|1D|an|0-6 any|nt|lml: its harder when you are tired|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|lml: tempo is still a problem even at the very top from time to time|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bobh1: i'm sure|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: and declarer has every right to use that information|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jwit: Will have to guess spade to make this|pg||
nt|rodal f: Makeabel|pg||
nt|bobh1: failure to lead a @s a clue|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bobh1: a low @s lead by N is possible imo|pg||
nt|lml: I like playing clubs before spades here|pg||
nt|bobh1: don't see the grounds for a trump lead|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: If he test @D first I belive he will fail the @S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: will north lead a small spade now>|pg||
nt|lml: guesses?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think he will guess right|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|chick: If N doesn't lead a spade, he will guess right for sure|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobh1: i am wrong :)|pg||
nt|lml: it was really hard to guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobh1: why did N lead a trump?|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was lucky right:)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
mc|9|nt|bobh1: to me it's easy|pg||
nt|lml: you do great |pg||
nt|lml: you did great... good guessing|pg||
nt|lml: nice spade play by north too|pg||
nt|bobh1: transparent (just kidding lol)|pg||
nt|bobh1: a @s at trick one would be really tricky|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with some of your thinking Bob.  It is unattractive to lead a spade from the queen|pg||
nt|lml: but it was also unattractive to lead clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: it is just forbidden|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently declarer has " mirror" hands|pg||
pg||

nt|rodal f: Say it an other way. W had to good @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|lml: Martens is about to have some thinking to do|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: altho the acbl does bar a lot of conventions, it does not forbid underleading aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|lml: well someone should suggest that to them then|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jwit: If NS found their 5C dive over 4S, EW would have to find a heart ruff to beat it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: you can envisage such fancy leads when auction gave clues|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|sfoxa: NS game in clubs would be beaten by heart ruff only.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: did it give any clue here? no.|pg||
nt|lml: do you think South should bid over 4@S|pg||
nt|lml: or north should pull?|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S was a real pressure bid for north-south|pg||
nt|bobh1: my clue here is i don't make random trump leads and i don't lead from doubletons when i am strong|pg||
nt|jwit: I don't think North should pull, and it's a tough bid for South with such a balanced hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for them. If any I'll say S|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa: agree - NS are lucky with such club fit, but it happens not always|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||

mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Seems as A@D are to be off all times now:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: 3 spades for EW is a limit with this layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hard to get to as well|pg||
mb|d|nt|jwit: South will double|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: I still dont see them above 3|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: I would redouble with West hand over Double, couldn't have a better hand for 2S bid|pg||

nt|lml: not enitrely sure he will get it right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: ouch|pg||
nt|bobh1: ignoring the play clues it is certainly possible on the auction for S to have 2 spades|pg||
nt|lml: and we are all wrong|pg||
mc|8|nt|lml: it looked like North hand 3 hearts|pg||
nt|lml: to me|pg||
nt|lml: and 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|bobh1: balancing with a double when non-vul doesn't take much of a hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: when it goes 1M-2M|pg||
nt|lml: and probably 4C but no more than 5|pg||
nt|lml: so he had to have 2 or 3 spades|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose he could have had 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last 2 boards are up. A special BIG THX to the vug operator(s). Thx all specs. Have given many nice signals. Big thx to all co commentators witch have been here from 10.00 til now. ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: why arent we seeing any scores.  Can someone tell us|pg||
mb|1C!|an|15+|nt|chick: because it is pairs and the boards aren't finished|pg||
nt|lml: thanks :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chick: new opponents for NS each round|pg||
mb|d|an|4+!H|mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|bobh1: important to play the right major|pg||
nt|jwit: 4 of a major likely on this one.  Spade split might cause some mild problems.|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is not it|pg||
nt|chick: but no way to know the 'right' major|pg||
nt|ritong: martens has a tiny clue|pg||
nt|bobh1: better honor structure in @ss|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive for shure it's a normal neg X|pg||
nt|ritong: when you have a choice between two suits of equal length|pg||
nt|ritong: not the case here, @s fit is not clear|pg||
nt|ritong: but when it is the case|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wandering for a sac?|pg||
nt|ritong: rather pick the one where you do not have the ace|pg||
nt|sfoxa: NS are 19th, EW - 12th as for now. This round may change a lot for both pairs.|pg||
nt|ritong: the reason being, doing so, you avoid the possibility of the start with a ruff|pg||
nt|bobh1: strange to think of a sac with Qxx of trumps|pg||
nt|rodal f: Other table ended 5@HN-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: maybe at favorable|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|sfoxa: after spade start declarer has either to allow ruff or lose 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobh1: not the best dee|pg||
nt|lml: with Qxx of trumps it isnt clear to lead a short suit when you have a side AKQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think 3@d implied 4|pg||

pc|c5|nt|bobh1: the toughest contract to defend against|pg||
nt|jwit: 1NT with a stiff club?????????????|pg||
nt|lml: at match points bidding 1NT is always ok my friend used to say|pg||
nt|sfoxa: peacefull last one|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any been ay 3NT in team? Here it's ok I belive|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: yes mps is its own game.|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps sure|pg||
nt|jwit: I certainly would never rebid 1NT with the North hand with a stiff and two good spade honors|pg||
nt|lml: I think a lot of people would agree with you Jon|pg||
nt|lml: it is definitely a mps bid|pg||
nt|bobh1: me too its a style issue|pg||
nt|lml: I wish I would but it isnt in me iehter|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|lml: here it worked out great|pg||
nt|chick: its style for me, as well, because I hate playing 4-3 fits |pg||
nt|jwit: Even at matchpoints, it rates to be wrong|pg||
nt|sfoxa: i know several Polish pairs playing rebid 1NT after diamond opening as 4-cards in hearts with limited hand (up to 17)|pg||
nt|lml: and there is the extra points: the majors figure to be breaking badly|pg||
nt|lml: and you are not likely to be any higher than 1NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa: not sure about this one, but it happened|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree with that Linda, but you still have the possibility of 2 club ruffs in the dummy|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm sure that rebidding 2@s would be the panel's choice in the master solvers' club|pg||
nt|lml: yes those are the points in favor of bidding|pg||
nt|lml: spades|pg||
nt|lml: maybe the downside is that your spades are too good |pg||
nt|rodal f: There u are right Bob|pg||
nt|lml: partner is going to need good spades if he is going to ruff|pg||
nt|jwit: Just give partner the J of spades instead of teh Q10 of clubs, and spades will play infinitely better.|pg||
nt|bobh1: so bidding 1n instead is anti-field but not an unreasonable shot |pg||
nt|lml: you are right there too|pg||
nt|jwit: After all, he did go out of his way to bid 1S over the double.  Certainly rates to have a better spade holding than he actually has|pg||
nt|lml: since everyone of us said we wouldnt bid it... probably antifield|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|jwit: lol|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: he is going to make a fair number of tricks now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobh1: i think it's a reasonable shot . . . depends on whether i think i need a board maybe|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: I think he was trying to sneak a diamond through a sleep defender there|pg||

pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||

nt|lml: good morning|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Linda :)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|55, minimum one major; weak|mb|d|nt|sfoxa: would NS manage to 3NT after weak W's opening? |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: W showing majors weak, so maybe yes|pg||
nt|jwit: South may seek to penalize |pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk3: This 2@D opening is known as Wilkosz|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: national  convention - Wilkocz, named after his author|pg||
nt|bobh1: so before we say multi; now we see another popular use for 2@d|pg||
nt|Walddk3: One major and any other suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|Walddk3: Disallowed in most countries in pairs events, but not so in Poland|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: I need to think about the best way to defend against that.  But North South did great|pg||
nt|lml: multi is much easier|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It's very difficult because there is no known suit to cue bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but this vulnerable opening isn't one to be recommended|pg||
nt|bobh1: same is true of multi i suppose|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|chick: yes, and that's the ACBL excuse for banning it|pg||
nt|lml: you can cuebid a major and guess its the right one|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: among other things|pg||

nt|jwit: Fourth spade gives declarer a little discarding problem|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: this one is difficult and I think it would be brown sticker|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr for beeing a bit late|pg||
nt|sfoxa: quite popular defense in Poland - to double with spades (as if opener has hearts) and to wait with hearts |pg||
nt|bobh1: S has to decide whether the @c K is onside or the @hs cooperating|pg||
nt|jwit: If you discard the Q of clubs, you are relying on hearts behaving|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|nt|bobh1: i think the @hs are a better shot myself|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: declarer disagrees|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cA|nt|lml: declarer has to decide what suits west has|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree with the heart 10.  Without it, it is a lot closer|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bobh1: declarer seems to be playing for neither|pg||
nt|chick: so do I, bob, because if hearts are 4-2 it's 50%, but if 5-1, you can find out in time|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h7|mc|9|nt|lml: I also think declarer is not likely to have 5 clubs|pg||
nt|jwit: So, it was very good defense to play four rounds of spades first|pg||
nt|lml: so he probably doesnt have many at all|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think south thought about the auction enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but hard to imagine vul open bid without points|pg||
nt|lml: still he only has 3 cards to hold clubs|pg||
nt|bobh1: kind of a shocking line of play if it really went that way at the table|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose as a defense you could use 2@H to show heart shortness and takeout of hearts and 2@s the same for spaes and double to show cards|pg||
nt|lml: what do you think?|pg||
