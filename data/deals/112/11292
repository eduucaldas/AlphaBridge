nt|janm: And it's probably not clear to N that spades is where they belong - S might have bid 3@s just to make a strong noise?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|granguru: right in such minmum hands is better to treat them as 5-5 in order not to express a huge hand after minor-major-major |pg||

nt|granguru: Even S opened it was hard not to find @HA with N..as @HQ and @DJ is pretty little for a support|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Yes, you're probably right about that, and then she'd have made it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|granguru: so the @HJ finesse instead of @HK was wrong|pg||
