mb|d|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: con qualche aiutino forse anche 4@s|pg||

nt|daman: related*|pg||
nt|brolucius: A big hand to welcome us all to the event.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will probably see Angelini's version of Precision at this table|pg||
nt|lml: hello Sabine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think both pairs play 2/1|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Good Morning =) Buon giorno|pg||
nt|sharkey: so almost half way and a close match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor is probably disappointed that we won't see Acol in action|pg||
nt|hedyg: depends if you want to watch something different lol|pg||
nt|daman: Alfredo is nice to watch :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Buon pomeriggio a tutti! Good evening to everybody! =)|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the tight scoreline is a bonus.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S play Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao roberta|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning, Roberta:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no idea what system EW play, but we will see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini will likely open 1NT passed to West|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yesterday we had several deals where the points were divided 20-20 (not usually a good sign for entertaining viewing). I see here that the Great Dealer has made it 21-19 for a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: change. Ah, yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who will double, presumably|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong finish in the last 4 boards in the previous round surged Padova ahead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can have my share of the danish wine when it comes, rob|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course Gazzilli (1Maj 1NT, 2@C=gazzilli to introduce natural hand or many strong hands)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS seems easy enough here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 18/19 (20)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: want a big hand?   clap clap clap|pg||
nt|mariner1: very close match after this many boards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: =) ty|pg||
nt|haans: Padova Bridge are not a team to run over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and they're off|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jcmax: Will w show his 2-suiter over a 1@S opening?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: So 1@C  16+|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 -15 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: How many rounds have been played so far?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: BUONA SERA A TUTTI!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Semi-finals now, knockout|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A surprise|pg||
nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs apperently|pg||
nt|bridge_one: gazzilli convention was invented by ... mister Gazzilli :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 4@H seems simple enough here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or his two half-suits?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Angelini replaced by Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No point in my opinion since it's not your hand. Then all you achieve is to give the show away|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT has some good prospects here EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 32 hp on EW - let us see what happens|pg||
nt|daman: doesn't seem to be a slam in sight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes doubled a 12-14 NT in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  W looking at the security of the @h suit instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North escaped to 2@C and is playing there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a strong player in 60/70|pg||
nt|bridge_one: from Milan|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: 2@H will result in a minus for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: that makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  misfit may slow them down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 11 tricks on this layout. No squeeze|pg||
nt|brolucius: Five hearts, a diamond and a spade - one down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they switch to spades in time|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure they will|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  3 or 4N likely spot|pg||
nt|daman: do we know what system EW are playing/|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a throw in for 12 - or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: undo please|pg||
nt|odysseus69: whenever I commentate I notice that every man opens balanced 11 - I wonder if the disease has spread to wwmens bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has, mostly because N-S can't attack spades. The suit is frozen for the defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be -1 but @h leads may create more problems for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT=22-24|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N or 4@S plays ok,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: dbl of course takeout|pg||
nt|andyv:  a Roland slam missed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I like 3N by S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nice easy game to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - the 9s and 10s coming into play here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini will want to show AK@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 3NT is a fine contract |pg||
nt|jcmax: hmmm good double fit , I am not so sure it is not EW's hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally roland but we all know that many top players don;t worry so much about that|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: well we dont need 6 of us to analyse the play on this hand|pg||
nt|daman: you can reheat your coffees     this contract is in no danger|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had a bit to spare for his sequence, but the singleton spade entitled him to take a gloomy view of his hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially on a @D lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: D lead is right into the jaws|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but could Angelini know that?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Here is an example wher the @DJ in either hand would just make a huge difference.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon Rob, Bob, Andy and Hans|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure looks like 2 losers to em|pg||
nt|mariner1: me|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi ralf|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Ralf|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Ralf:)|pg||
nt|haans: hejsan Ralf|pg||
nt|jcmax: But since NS are bidding all the way to 4@S it doesn't matter anyway :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: low from xx   2/4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can actually make 12 tricks on any lead, but you need to guess well|pg||
nt|lestergold: north kinder mullered in the majors and end played|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcmax: There would be 12 tricks on normal breaks.|pg||
nt|lml: he has so many top tricks it doesnt much matter about the diamond lead|pg||
nt|daman: better switch to @Ss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but he can't afford to cash the other top honour|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but more difficult|pg||
nt|daman: he can see the dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he cashes another @c they lose the 1 @s trick|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Roland, he could not and should be happy to play 4@s IMO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the popularity of two-suited bids, and the tendency to use them whenever possible regardless of which side stands to benefit more, is well-established|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: yes a squeeze and endplay for 12 now|pg||
nt|daman: a @S is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  W sequence did show some slam interest|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcmax: But it is always extremely difficult to evaluate in the bidding. Especially when the suit never gets mentioned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: if the defence switches to diamonds in time that is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Versace could have had  Qxxxx  xx  xxx  KQx  and then 3NT isn't exactly a great spot|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North wondering whether declarer is trying to steal 1 club trick- clearly they dont lead 4th highest|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is that Angelini or Versace sitting North?! Nice switch.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: 6@C was not too bad a contract. You can take both major-suit finesses (counting 11 tricks if one wins) and perhaps ruff a heart to bring the total to twelve.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The lead indicates that he has something in majors|pg||
nt|daman: the @D 3 is a Slavinsky lead I am told|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 if declarer can sneak a spade|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam much worse than a hook since there are usually 2 @s losers|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|hedyg: yes wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, that's why it's a Roland slam|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcmax: in this kind of situation knowing the count is very important|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s decent spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini-Versace N-S in the open room. Fantoni-Nunes sitting out|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps anyway|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: yes - S will duck|pg||
nt|jcmax: it is important for e now to know the W had an original 5-card suit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: Andy Roland slams make :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: well the @HA play works :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so he tell me:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  tells|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: they just defy the odds :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: He seems to know|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: now they get all their tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|haans: now small spade|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: now no entry left in west for any squeezes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand much of this|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: cashing out|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  claim button not working|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria-Giubilo are in 6NT next door. Let's see how Lauria plays it|pg||
nt|bobh1: not yet desperation time but Angelini would prefer some action boards|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: this one is probably a push|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: When declarer is in 3NT on a combined total of 32 points, I feel entitled to devote my attention to a cup of tea.  |pg||
nt|lestergold: dont believe everything u see folks|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
mc|9|nt|andyv:  really didn't cash @cA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: now that must be interesting |pg||

pc|sJ|nt|fulvio2002: tanto per sintetizzare|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||

nt|odysseus69: more work in 3NT here|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, only a humble part score but there was a good point of interest.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 2@c was down while 2@D would probably make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass  1@H   4@D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now this is a Roland slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this is  a serious slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in Open Room in 4@H DBL on 1|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maybe not. He probably just figured with a sure trump trick there still would be time to switch back to @H later after the count in @D was known. Very good play by versace!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and we did not get any score here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I imagine made 5|pg||
nt|daman: there will definitly be a swing    depends on who is on the winning end|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: We are back in business in the slam zone again|pg||
nt|andyv:  and another slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time its infrangible|pg||
nt|daman: would any of us open 1@H?|pg||
nt|daman: there's that word again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not after a multi opening. Way too good in most people's books, but not for E-W here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer a heart to weak 2- too much outside tehheart suit|pg||
nt|daman: too many syllables    gives me a headache|pg||
nt|hedyg: might not have been exactly as we saw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East discarded a diamond? Then declarer pitched a winner?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 6@S there|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, even 5@d has to be considered|pg||
nt|brolucius: Twelve tricks can be made in spades.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: Lauria I meant :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio, plying in open room, are clients of BBO - each day Failla play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Commentating.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double seems normal now|pg||
nt|andyv:  opposite a passed pd, 4@d still leaves a bit too much room to N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most top pairs play take-out double through at least 4@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: 6@h on a finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: my weak 2s dont have ak combos outside the trump suit not in forn of  partner im avers to missing gamers|pg||
nt|andyv:  should show max w@hs|pg||
nt|daman: ogusty|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might bid just 2@S, meaning that will be high enough if partner has spades. But they play their multi quite strong (as is apparent), so West bids 2NT with 16 points in case a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game is there by sheer power.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam there better than 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or negative doubles if you like|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a good hand for playing in @s|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely he will pass|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Quite good, yes, but is it worth bidding at the five-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: however on the bidding @ss might well be 4-1 or even 5-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: club finesse or no spade lead too|pg||
nt|andyv:  may get there now|pg||
nt|daman: West might not expect such a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl again|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one about the same as the last one with one difference|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N=slam killer|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 18-19?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 3N both have play here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: a little more work to do here|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a bidder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass and bid 5@S now, even considering six|pg||
nt|mariner1: all of Roland's slams are serious (to him) :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam makes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|odysseus69: defence on top and this looks tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if west makes a try tho east will accept|pg||
nt|hedyg: George pls stop clicking on the commentator's curse button|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six too much, surely?|pg||
nt|bobh1: the hook is on and the @ss are guessable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks on a finess and solving the @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems like an unusual call here|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone know what 4@h is?|pg||
nt|haans: no takers :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: clearly @cs with slam interest lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says 5@c slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s u mean rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops yes 4@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose a heart to Jack and diamond to Q|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even if W gets 2 @S tricks cannot see making|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be then - two @D tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h might also|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South's double of 3S was dubious, with two kings in unbid suits.|pg||
nt|daman: the double of 3@S might give him pause to think partner would have values outside @Ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s by W would have gotten a 5@d bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Intersting the @S suit never got mentioned here. But I guess no need if there is no fit.|pg||
nt|daman: hah!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes David, therefore "considering"|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm judging by his hand not what i know of their system|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 3N here|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4n probably says no interest|pg||
nt|andyv:  i play 4@s as 4-4 minors slam try makes sense to use 4@h as a 5 card minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|bobh1: so NS will get credit for trying but no actual imps most likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4nt is what I want to play if partner has any other vision|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the old days this 3C bid would mnean N knew where their fit was|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: onbiously they are used to opening heavy multis|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: just find A@C in W and ruff 1@H for 6|pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting @S lead into 6n makes the slam easier|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt can never be blackwood but maybe Turbo|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now its into 4N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D over 3@C would ask for full layout|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: Q@S on and 3 3 means no issue here except how many he makes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is more probable that 4@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: In case anyone is wondering why N bid 2NT instead of just 3NT, he was probably catering to his partner holding a 6-card @S suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would seem natural to set up a couple of heart tricks first. He can always come back to spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  six no picnic with small @c lead from W and we saw some similar action yesterday those type of leads|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will attack spades right away|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: nicely done|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Pretty neat, anyway, to reach a slam after a multi opening.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Since @H is the communication 4th @H may become good|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcmax: East's pass over 1@H is also interesting. In my view passing with that kind of hand makes it so much easier for the opponents to come into the bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he rated Pass and 5@S (removing the double) as stronger than an immediate 5@S. But I'm not sure whether the hand is worth such a meaning. He has few honors in the majors.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  4N seems like a shot in the dark... i'd have liked to know about the K of @d on this hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would take by North first trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, depending on their agreements, he might also have been interested in knowing if his partner had a diamond fragment to show|pg||
nt|bobh1: now perhaps shift attention to the other major|pg||
nt|jcmax: The opponents are both ducking. Usually a very good idea when ther is no obvious line of defence. Let declarer play something and at the same tim disrupt his communication a bit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the case for taking the first trick in dummy is strong. he wants E to be on lead next, noit W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for this reason was more easy for declarer to keep 2 entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand; he is not particularly concerned about a diamond switch|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: do you think this was a pass and pull auction?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  he has his 10 tricks and will gain an 11th by just cashing out|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: unclear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what i did NOT say was that the ace was the best play|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@S is correct to give the idea to have doubleton|pg||
nt|bobh1: creating the illusion that @ss are foul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe. i would be concerned about a diamond switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting @SQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes very interesting|pg||
nt|jcmax: Lauria is a very tricky player! :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: trying to get declarer to change his line|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|ritong: but the idea is important|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which he duly did|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|daman: nice play|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would mean pass was forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need plenty of good luck in the majors (even in clubs) to make 6@S. A contract of 5@S is about right.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the other room S bid 5 @H over 5 @d..N thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: all roads as they say|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree that this lead makes it clear abotr the @s situation. Can be an offensive lead from the @sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't have much to lead from|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  closest to thumb works just as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D back and duck by W would be interesting|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however no way to beat 3NT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: The 3@S rebid must have meant 'I should have opened 1@H instead. Sorry!'|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: nothing wrong if that is the agreed style but west would not be able to bid that way with the average Brit's idea of a weak 2 at these colours|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcmax: Would s have discarded another @S if E continued with another @D I wonder|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bridge_one: making one trick in @d is sufficient to make 9 triks|pg||
mc|9|nt|andyv:  or the @C K as a spec points out|pg||
nt|daman: the hacketts would have the AK of @Ds less|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly my point!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On board 1, the operator in the open room lost the play in 6NT at some point, but eventually we had a claim for 13 tricks. So Lauria must have guessed the line|pg||
nt|daman: is it possible the scoring s not hooked up?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Roland you are on|pg||

nt|hedyg: 6@s on bd 1, after 9 tricks declarer thinking since a while what to play on opps small @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the thing is that you can't bid this making slam|pg||
nt|daman: is Lauria on this team?|pg||

nt|hedyg: he is on this team, playing with Giubilo i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The North hand is hard to express, with so many bids being weak nowadays.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c bid to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 4h can be made  double dummy- but not even Nunes would do it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Modern methods will reveal that you are off one ace and the queen of trump|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hi Liz|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3rd seat favorable liberties|pg||
mb|3D|nt|odysseus69: i would feel sick if my opponents bid this to 6 spades - I hate lucky slams|pg||
nt|hedyg: Giammi on BBO|pg||
nt|andyv:  and OR is in that contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is getting exciing|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@C forcing Roberta?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play EW here|pg||
nt|bobh1: if the @cs were 4-3 and the @ds 3-3 i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and harts 22|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcmax: The West hand has only 14 hcp, but it is immensely control-rich with 4 1st-round controls. It might be an idea to open a strong club instead.|pg||
nt|hedyg: N showed @hs by X but Versace decided it would be too costly to defend|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think W should open 1@C here,,,,,,, just too much for 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot open 1@c if they play precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't dbl|pg||
nt|daman: I'm all for the red card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was worth 3@H, easily.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems very conservative|pg||
nt|andyv:  N seemed worth of one try|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all as E? i like to bid with an ace a major|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with the ace in my suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all pass*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I never pass with an ace|pg||
nt|andyv:  i never have an ace to pass with|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think vulnerable there is too great a risk of losing a lot of 100s|pg||
nt|hedyg: good, i am not alone|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's hand was better than it looks. He had minor honors in partner's suits (just where you want them) and aces outside, where you need quick tricks. Some players would have bid ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: more than 3@H on those values.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its not ust a matter of taking a first round heart hook|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand went down hill with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|daman: our side had an automatic tap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room East passed in 1st seat; then South opened a Multi, and E-W reached 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 2 that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of work to o even double dummy to make this|pg||
nt|daman: really|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he puts up qS and plays to run a low heart it would have chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: because he is not strong enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could upgrade the hand which I think he should|pg||
nt|jcmax: After a 2@C opening I don't believe there is any chance one can get to 6@C. not that I necessarily believe one should be there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but common practice is to not let pd play 1@c if you have any type of bid available|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even 1NT is an underbid|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes opening like this can keep the opps out of a cold gtame|pg||
nt|andyv:  first swing board|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: heavy opening - some would have selected 2 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks natural to me. Jump shift, 19-21, 5+ clubs, 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - N's 3@S stronger than 4@S - they may be on their way|pg||
nt|andyv:  and an expensive one it would seem|pg||
nt|bobh1: this will even things up i thing|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 4@S so we should have a very close match now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s  in the sleep for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: have to fault E I think|pg||
nt|bobh1: After rdbl, red at imps, I'm bidding game|pg||
nt|haans: depend on what xx did mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And easier after 3@h from S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: unless rdbl means something other than what i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no @S lead? :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: about 6% i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade lead not the issue|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: maybe better than 6% but even below roland stanmdards which says it all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: If it is being suggested that East should double 4@H, then I don't agree at all. His club values are worthless in defence.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slow 4S may force South to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: just thinking the same Victor :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a horrible, room consuming auction. No-one knows how many keycards they are missing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South must bid slam now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: if east doubled4h then Nunes might well make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree David|pg||
nt|bobh1: at matchpoints i might tread more carefully|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes after 3@H E knows W has @H shortage so nothing wasted|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if it means something else, W's willingness to play at 3 level should have been enough for E to go to game|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: forgetting female intuition Roland|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|mariner1: K&R (A865 AJ8 AJ5432 ---) = 17.60|pg||
nt|lml: 6@S went down even after the diamond lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: to me hand is easily a 1@C opener|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR|pg||
nt|lml: on the first board|pg||
nt|lml: even if you open 1@C it is not clear to me you will get to a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is worth 17.6 on the K&R Hand Evaluator, so it would not be unreasonable to upgrade to 16+, would it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Axxx+AJx+-+AJxxxx|pg||
nt|lml: you have a minimum 1@C opener and partner has a minimum positive|pg||
nt|hedyg: but what is it worth when pd has no fit?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, nothing to worry about, and the opponents are feeling sick in a minute or two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but satisfies the RW test - it makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: slightly less than 50%....|pg||
nt|sharkey: S thinking Grand??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because she has no idea as to how many aces partner has|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As W my bid is 2nt showing an offensive limit with a 4-card @s support|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: I would take my chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 100 instead of 50 is not worth much. If instead your double tips declarer into the winning line, you will have a big headache for a while.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did bid 3@s directly over 3@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think also you have to be aware they could be jerking you around|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Instead of RD|pg||
nt|andyv:  trust partner and you don't have to worry that much about the opps|pg||
nt|bobh1: at these colors quite likely|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mariner1: in that case you pass :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no chance of bidding 7 - just reflecting about life|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Sabine, would you upgrade that to 1@C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll never know|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: youdouble and no bang down of the ace of hearts thats for sure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: look  partner overcalled red   I double|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: or would you bid 1@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: upgrading it to 1@C seems less distorting than opening it 2@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: certainly below roland standards because has no play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: spade 9 best|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't mind 1NT, facing a passed hand, but it is time to re-evaluate when partner shows both majors.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Baroni is feeling sick already. Her only chance is that declarer has five spades|pg||

nt|brolucius: 3NT also OK.|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Roberta|pg||
nt|mariner1: well there goes the 1@C arguement :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib informs me they bid slam OR as well previous board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East rushes to pick hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: even if they are not super happy with the contract:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is the spot Open Room|pg||
nt|andyv:  reality gets in the way of these slams|pg||
nt|bobh1: fantoni nunes avoided the bad slam on the first board|pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder if they will bid the one that makes|pg||
nt|haans: slam do not feel natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by West probably bec open in 3th position|pg||
nt|jcmax: In Italy I believe Ghestem is quite popular, so this may actually specifically show @S+@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2n maybe shows some values in the context of having passed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: 3-3 in @s and find the @dJ will make|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may invite with 4N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N asking the minor probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As played by the (in)famous Lanzarotti-Buratti many years ago|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so 2 east West pairs upset by last- 2 N/s pairs jubilant|pg||
nt|daman: I would open|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mariner1: When logic and proportion, Have fallen sloppy dead, And the White Knight is|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: I noticed Minardo bid 1@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: bid slam on this and you will never win|pg||
nt|mariner1: "Bid those Roland slams" :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't think Fantunes will bid this one either|pg||
nt|andyv:  they didn't|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes Ghestem would pinpoint the suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 200 only|pg||
nt|sharkey: beats 130|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't be afraid, open|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to apologize for making a sensible bid.|pg||
nt|daman: OMG  if Roland would open?   then it has to be right :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they invinted 10-12 NTs for timid bidders|pg||
nt|hedyg: right! we would all open|pg||
nt|andyv:  invented|pg||
nt|hedyg: primes and great spots|pg||
nt|hedyg: plus a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I know some players who would reach 3NT on the East-West cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: whenever I do that I end in the 3-3 but they are headed to 3NT here|pg||
nt|daman: I am informed that 1@D promises a 4 card major  otherwise a weak NT 12-14   fixed by the system    is that true?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Meanwhile, E/W have bid the hand commendably - realising that they had no middle cards and staying low.|pg||
nt|mariner1: then 2N asking range?|pg||
nt|bobh1: bad trump break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally the pairs who play ghestem in Italy use the exclusion rule (so 3@C means no @C)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think they use micheal's|pg||
nt|jcmax: My own partnership has recently switched from unspecified 2-suiters to ghestem. We believe in many situation it is just so important to know the 2nd suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: if they were down more going in maybe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the disvantage to play ghestem is to lose 3@C preemptive overcall|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: but 100 on EW|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty daman|pg||
nt|daman: what 100 are you referring to Ralf/|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be a relay bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N fails on a @S lead from N|pg||
nt|jcmax: if it was Ghestem, then 2N would most likely ask for the range. 3@C would be MIN. And who would disagree with that?:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: board 3|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h down 2|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: don't see that N can Dbl this - too risky|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: I dont think it was a relay I just dont think he had another good bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that the E-W names are not really what we see.  East is Minaldo with an  L,   West is Matteucci. Could you check that please, Roberta?|pg||
nt|tendenz: Hi all, 1@H is 3+ cards, 1@S is 3+cards, because they cannot bid 1nt. 1nt is an artificial answer, transfer for @C (weak or strong)|pg||
nt|lml: thanks ... makes sense|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh so good to have an expert on the system, grazie!!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: itè possible... they can't tell me their name, ty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Aldo :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Is North really pondering over the lead now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least 8 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tendenz: You wellcome, I usually play with Matteucci|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In the old days with manual given hands, they always sait that the queen always watched the jack|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: i do not know if they have special treatments with three suiters, but bypassing @ss looks dangerous to me with west hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 2Nt asking about suit and strength of hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: K&R (T4 AT4 AT984 KT7) = 13.25 |pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead in Open Room made this easier|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: I agree - 4 tricks not enough and if 1 down not worth the pressure|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tendenz: 1@d is natural, or only 2+ wit 18-20 bal hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: The system is called Nightmare I believe|pg||
nt|mariner1: aptly so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may use a checkback system|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italian superstars are not desperate; they are sitting back and waiting for their opponents to stumble; so far it's working|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcmax: It seems almost impossible to me to avoid bidding to 3NT with the EW cards. The best thing to do would have been an auction like 2N-3N where S could not have bid for the lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Barry Crane rule...Q over in minors and under in Majors|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcmax: well, maybe we get some more 2-suiters and a chance to find out what NS really are playing :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew promoting a trump trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think Ghestem makes it harder to judge good/bad positions with some suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: combinations|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am being asked whether NS are junior players. anyone knows?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c4|pc|s6|nt|brolucius: 3NT seems to be better than 4@H (where you are looking for a 10th trick).|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am in shock. England have 4 SL wickets down for 17 runs after 5 overs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: can it be true?|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with @d Jxxx facing possible singleton, which would be good for a @s scontract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphztg: scusate x i nomi.... nn li ho capiti molto bene quando me li hanno detti... scusate =(|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Ghestem.html   for those asking|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: the trouble with using Michaels on this East hand is that partner will not know what to do next time with a little more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dangerous to play more trumps now. If someone has four, she will go a lot down. Better to play spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: East's 2@C presumed for Majors - surprised W didnt bid @S to for lead purposes|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: there are other reasons why Michaels was a bad idea |pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  non aggressive lead by N most likely to cost a trick|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They can bowl a bit sometimes - but can they score any runs?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Did she really insert the queen?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She did|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: but the 4@H was played by S so -200 and -200 was 9 imps and not a push|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, she said (I guess) that all the scoring problems are due to using a French computer.|pg||
nt|sharkey: My assumptions about part scores is wrong|pg||
nt|daman: I put my money on 3 NT    maybe 4NT at most|pg||
nt|jcmax: So now N bid 3@S. does S know this is the A? I would say not and expect 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fix @C interst for slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: if 3@c is anything close to natural, N has a nice hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If anything interesting happens on this deal, I am a Dutchman.|pg||
nt|andyv:  get the shoes out, David|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play EW|pg||
nt|lml: its always nice to have a new toy|pg||
nt|jcmax: Anyway, I was saying that in my view the Poles are the best in this world at doubling cooperatively. The Italians are good when one has a takeout dbl that the other one can pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni did not bother to play @c when in with A@s, he switched to @H, might go down in 4 @H now|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT usually played as forcing to game (in spades) nowadays. Some used to play it as at least a game-try.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E defense a bit soft... should have taken @d and led back @s|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  1S xfer to NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: Back to good ole 3 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  which is what happened in OR... now S doesn't have 9 tricks without risking contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: eay 3N here |pg||
nt|daman: it was corrected to -1|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot here for anyone|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: many pairs play that East must show his singleton here - but the final contract would be the same|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's 4S (on a relatively good hand) rather suggests that West had not already forced to game.|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel estimated that his @cs were not worth a mention|pg||

pc|c2|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10 tricks|pg||

nt|odysseus69: this one is declarer-proof|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: you can have another cup of tea David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am still waiting for something interesting to happen on the deal. Only then, will I seek some suitable forfeit.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: NOT leading a dim might hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: East might have opened|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 boards...6 pretty flat hands....Angelini lucky to be even at this point|pg||
nt|haans: @D lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: Q@D being off is key to total tricks here|pg||
nt|lml: I would open 1@d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: The first IMP exchange occured on board 4 - Posillipo picking up 5 IMPs - the missed undertrick costing 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club layout is so nice that you can make all four tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: we all thought the last hand was easy and look what happened|pg||

nt|jcmax: if it's natural it seems like a good idea. would it be natural?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: indeed we werent expeting declarer to play a misere line tho|pg||
nt|tendenz: it's natural|pg||
nt|daman: pretty simple|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: as opposed to the other kind|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: 18-20 2+ or natural|pg||
nt|ritong: what are we doing with cards in hand, manoli?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising he did not try to slip through a club to the king. Worth a try.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@hs made in OR|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: they dont have an embankmant in italy to sleep on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c lead had made it more difficult for declarer to take more than 9 tricks|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wont be able to repeat club finesse safely|pg||
nt|jcmax: @C lead here is excellent because it doesn't give declarer anything from the start. and he doesn't have a lot of dummy entries to play towards his hand|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|mariner1: 18-20 would be balanced we saw|pg||

mb|4D|nt|sharkey: 4 NT quantative here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If declarer avoids a diamond lead and she guesses hearts, she is in fine shape. On a diamond lead she is destined to go down|pg||

nt|bobh1: ho hum|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S maybe some sort of range?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C here was a slam check|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's enough tricks to make a heart grand on this board and to defeat an opposing heart game on the hext one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may pair use the rule that after two round od cue 4Nt is cue also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there should be an escrow account:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: I thought W would confirm @H and then ask for key cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now weve got onions into it|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: would it be the upset of the year if Angelini lost?|pg||
nt|brolucius: What was the point of South's double? Getting too high is his fault, as I see it (although no doubt Angelini will apologise for it.)|pg||
nt|bobh1: hopefully 4n is some kind of KC inquiry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe there is a tournament prize for the longest auction|pg||
mb|5H|nt|brolucius: No idea why Nunes doubled instead of bidding 1@S.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H set as trump here I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: N worried about making game after seeing dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt key cards here, not cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: we all know you cannot spell Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: now its george he spelt onions minions|pg||
nt|hedyg: many Italians play Ghestem in which case @S/@C was known in E, so Versace could bid 3@H or unusual vs unusual with a better hand|pg||

mb|7H|nt|odysseus69: goooing to get trump lead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Excellent Irene Baroni!|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - offensive vs small slams|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead vs Grand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good lead- the old rule about attacking against small slams still works (sometimes)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And those who claim that you must never lead away from a king against a slam will get food for thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S makes this West should hide her cards more carefully....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i was doing a doing a disservice to womens bridge by suggesting a trump lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This 4@H bid contrasts with getting to 2@H opposite a re-opening: even if South has shown a good hand, he did not start with 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl could have been two things...1) able to punish one of their suits and 2) a limit raise in @hs with only 3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: hes still okay in 3|pg||

nt|daman: wow|pg||

pc|h8|nt|lml: and 4 was unlikely anyway on repeated club plays|pg||

pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: First hurdle is to guess spades. That is not obvious|pg||

nt|hedyg: @d lead makes no difference if he plays @H immediately, no entry to the N hand for the 3rd @d|pg||

mb|3N|nt|lestergold: if the bidding does not die quickly then someone will come to grief here|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2NT was borderline, especially facing a passed hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why roland keeps on dealing 20/20s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is too wet|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 or 5 depending on your temperament|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: They are currently fetching a Scottish £5 note.|pg||

nt|andyv:  can't get to 3@s if you don't bid it:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  he passed 1N...why in the world would he bid now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a fantunes passed hand  they open light|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3h a transfer to spades no doubt|pg||
nt|daman: whack 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: guess west likes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: what i think is for once fantunes are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 2@S with the @c fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S was 6 4 I think|pg||
nt|jcmax: NOw this is an auction I understand!|pg||
nt|mariner1: promised 4@H and 6@D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: I'm sure they've been in trouble before|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w might be able to get close to 3N but in reality this is likely to cost the great executioners|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos they werent likely to bid 3N on ther combined 20|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do North or East have anything to think about?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H looks like too much work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would be a fair shot by West now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wet wet wet- tell all Roland- another of your specialities|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D is wet too|pg||
nt|daman: at least|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right on, sister|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, may be 2@S multiway rever - it is used but may pairs in Italy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: The only real decision was whether North stuck 2NT. That was a quite possible action on his hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that a band, Victor, or was?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now 5H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wet Wet Wet  I mean|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure- I knew you knew - I was expecting a history with some of their hits|pg||
nt|sharkey: If E bids 5@H West will bid again!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and how|pg||
nt|sharkey: and she'll bid too much... |pg||
nt|sharkey: So either an underbid or an overbid - can't see them landing in 6 of anything|pg||

nt|andyv:  since they opened 3@s:)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: If you want to bid, you need that convention|pg||

nt|brolucius: Is that the hour of madness, where you come from?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|hedyg: well they are down 36:0 this segment so 1 imp would be nice|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud E have bid 7@H with 6 trumps only - after pd bid 6@H on her own?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: from an income to -500|pg||
nt|hedyg: keep 3 NT as option?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: I booked in for this session because I thought it might be all over by the 6th session. Shows what I know.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, 4@D is sensible|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, the danger is part has the right hand for 3 nT to be the last winning game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Absurd to hope for 3NT, as I see it. Much more important to pre-empt.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 8 will be a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  question was whether first Dbl asked for pd's 2nd suit and 2nd dbl was penalty or coop since it was in front of @s bidder|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thank goodness the West hand was not dealt in an American event.|pg||
nt|mariner1: at the risk of 5|pg||
nt|lml: I think if he ducks the spade he can make it after three rounds of hearts on the diamond club squeeze|pg||
nt|mariner1: ot more if the dbl gave the line|pg||
nt|mariner1: or|pg||
nt|lml: but he does have to duck the spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: but all in all, giving an exact picture of your hand asap is certainly the reasonable option|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2 3 imps is nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: EW cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: i have a feeling fireworks are about to go off|pg||
nt|bobh1: not on this hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: it is solely designed for use when playing on bbo vugraph, so no commentator has any idea of what we are doing and therefor cannot criticise us|pg||
nt|bridge_one: true, the idea was of Garozzo, for juniores team|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: the defense had its chances after that|pg||
nt|mariner1: can S pass this?|pg||
nt|lml: I couldnt|pg||
nt|lml: even if it was allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks in hearts, E-W have a save in 5mi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone but me who prefers 1@H to double?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in hearts - 9 in minors so potential for small swing - |pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm with you Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry. This is 4th of 5. But could have been over by the 5th session. That's what I should have said.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h can go for a ride|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@S by West if South passes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lightner doubles on the 4 level?|pg||
nt|bobh1: pretty good 1n|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: another 3nt on EW|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: well he has a ratty 13|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@S is not so cold - beaten by 4 rounds of hearts (thank you)|pg||
nt|ritong: !!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..wow|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could get to high here maybe|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 2 NT establishes a forcing situation, imho|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: if west wants his pard to bid his second suit, he simply passes 3@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, but still makes the 2nd dbl questionable|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, i'll go with that|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at it this way: how on earth can West take the (huge) penalty against 3@S other than by doubling at every opportunity?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that there is no doubles for penalty in modern bidding.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Im  with the double|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has taken a vow of silence|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel really is pessimistic|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: looks more like 10|pg||
nt|lml: hes vulnerable|pg||
nt|lml: East is hoping hes going to pull to spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s making|pg||
nt|lml: but 3NT not making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if only they could invent something like that for declarer play:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  if first dbl is GF, then pass would also be forcing... just depends on agreements|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not GF. It suggests interest in penalising the opponents. (Like redouble over a double).|pg||
nt|ritong: GF might be atad exaggerated  let s make it " board is ourse, don t let em get away with it"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|andyv:  OK...next:))|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: i think after 3@H he can guess the @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@s followed by high club|pg||
nt|brolucius: A generous adjective.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is cold and might even get doubled|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what the double means|pg||
nt|lml: if anything|pg||
nt|lml: I sometimes play it means dont lead a heart|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C good sacrifice|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt winning bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: guess this always makes with careful play|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure they can beat this|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: don't lead anything except a @H :)|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: he wanted to X 4 @s maybe|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: and that is a good meaning on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to beat 3N when declarer starts with 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they try to set up a @h or @c trick, that will give declarer his 9th|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will hook @h and claim|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: there is an old expression in sweden 3nt will always be right|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  D not too creative|pg||
nt|ritong: or very brave  accepting possible double game swing that way is temerity, imho|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, it is quite good with maximum point count and a decent 5-card suit. The KJ bare in @S is a minus though.|pg||

nt|lml: thats what Versace is thinking about|pg||
nt|lml: could it really be possible?|pg||
nt|hedyg: also E is a passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play 10-14 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: is that right Aldo?|pg||
nt|tendenz: they play 12-14|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh ok ty|pg||
nt|lml: East might just have it I suppose.  but it is so unlikely|pg||
nt|lml: but if he does havve it South can make 5|pg||
nt|lml: what temptation|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he is going down if W has it...so take the chance?|pg||
nt|lml: the reason he knows he doesnt have it is West would not have thrown away diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he pitched like a man with the @CA|pg||

nt|ritong: as usual|pg||
nt|lml: its easier when you are up by 35|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry pd, if i had known that A@H was in E........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: West played @C6 and then @C7. If that denied a doubleton (as is normal), then East's 3rd club is hard to understand. |pg||
nt|bobh1: kit woolsey likes to say: bidding 3n is a dirty job but somebody has to do it|pg||
nt|jcmax: Always good not to go down. Especially when vulnerable. Even though +90 isn't much, it still feels good.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is an interesting hand maybe|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: we all gone to same school|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  another 4@h hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing the balanced 18-19|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Did he not realise that there was no need to answer to doorbell?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would anyone overcall 1@S here?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boderline.|pg||
nt|ritong: very envisageable|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would not, bad suit and too many @ds|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, not quite borderline.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: promise my pard bids 3@s over that and i come in|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores at http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirank.html|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: 3N EW any lead if they find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Precision-ish, 10-15 with 6 clubs, or 5 clubs and a 4c major|pg||
nt|lml: or both|pg||
nt|brolucius: You certainly wouldn't overcall 1@H if your suit was hearts. 1@S does at least take away space.|pg||
nt|hedyg: remember that pd is a passed hand now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2N invite with 4 ... could be better hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could be costly|pg||
nt|bobh1: in this case is better|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  and overbidders delight hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on as it is|pg||
nt|tomi2: both, south and west try to show a constructive raise via 2nt / the cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@S was a bit risky, but East was short in hearts and felt he had to act. The story may have a happy ending.|pg||
nt|bobh1: even white he should drive to game at imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: After elimination, E can play @d and anoter to the @dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|lml: brb|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no way to beat this as the card lay|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, can just take 4@hs on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades cold- 5H down 2 - but no need to save when they dont bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  E is border line... but with prime cards... good 3@s bid|pg||
nt|bobh1: there is no % languishing in 3@h at imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N will lead which @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on the range of 2N bid|pg||
nt|haans: game still need 50% nonvul?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at this table they know the match is close|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than P from E?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at the other,fantunes probably think they are still behind|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, no reason for him to suspect that they've gained any ground.|pg||
nt|bobh1: as the number of boards dwindles, this mind set could be a factor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing shoes|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now where s could double for the @S lead, declarer will have to guess the @C suit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: The diamond length is an asset. I bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: question is : whay will nunes play after the trump ace|pg||
nt|haans: but the master never seem deperate |pg||
nt|bobh1: a @c to the K is my favorite play but i don't think is percentage|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, you should certainly start with the jack|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't quite make 4 on this layout, and he might have been in game if he had overcalled. So in this case Angelini did the right thing by passing|pg||
nt|brolucius: We must remember (at the end of the session) how good Roberta has been. I hope I am not invoking commentators' curse but everything has been excellent so far.|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the Michaels hand bd 24 Fantoni bid 1 @s over 1@H with 87432|pg||
nt|haans: desperate|pg||
nt|jcmax: The percentage play looking only at the suit is running the Jack. Here, however, if N has AQx or AQxx, declarer cannot succeed anyway, because there is no entry to dummy if N ducks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: what*|pg||
nt|ritong: ofc|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: cover and suit blocks|pg||
nt|andyv:  what was that all about?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there might be an entry, but not quick enough|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobh1: rather than considering signing off in 3@h it seems E had slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can W have a strong hand on this bidding and E has 12!|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini did what he could to bloack the suit, and he succeeded|pg||
nt|jcmax: The same however is true if if North has Axx and s singleton Q|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: 2@h is ugly|pg||
nt|bobh1: this could cost the match|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: as is 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but less:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  who said bridge was a pretty game?|pg||
nt|mariner1: some miscommunications here somehow|pg||
nt|haans: sort of given it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  E very inconsistant on two boards (see board 3)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: once West decided to make the most encouraging noise - 3D might have worked better than 3H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H is normal, I would have thought, with such poor spades. Prefer 1@S when the suit is good.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is surely not a beautiful game|pg||
nt|hedyg: stopped opps from playing 4 @H, he is in 3 @s|pg||
nt|jcmax: The only 3-1 case where declarer can win is if S has singleton A|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  if playing wk/st michaels, probably 1@s is the value bid on that hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|ritong: some other black card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't matter a lot with this format, but ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E did not know, hoping for A10 doubelton in N|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: NS play odd encouraging and Angelini had no odd card in @h..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: this works because @c are 3-3 and N cannot have more than 2 @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead directer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My experience is that Michaels does not work well with intermediate hands. Weak or very strong are better in my opinion|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcmax: If @C are 2-2 then he has to guess|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|ritong: you simply cannot afford tp michael intermediate hands with a passed pard  the result will be 4 times out of 5 that ooponents play with open hands , and no compensation to that|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: Declarer is heading for success. Well played! (I hope I am not premature.) |pg||
nt|ralfwil: so E should not play @dQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: excellent point|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but it works also because N has @d8!|pg||
nt|andyv:  still can play Q@d|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobh1: but @c to the K is so satisfying when it is right|pg||
nt|jcmax: So it feels like running the J is still slightly better theoretically|pg||

nt|cuttysark: you should Michaels with good suitw when playing the hand will be advantageous. Strength not important|pg||
nt|ritong: seems that R & i agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are you a worried man?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt no make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these calculations are affected somewhat by the fact that NS are nonvul and S is a passed hand. in other words, the spades are probably 5-4. if they were 6-3, W would have more ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: options because if N has D ace then dummy is reachable|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  more fun for the specs this way... another point made by spec... If S had K@d, that would have been a 12 count and he would have opened 1N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not Michaels when it can only help opponents to know the distribution|pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW make 4@S on the Moysian here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: seems like a flattish board though|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S by E?|pg||

nt|mariner1: on 11 EW Open Room are in the 4@H|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lml: is this a coffee break type hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: leading for pd with a weak hand, hoping to hit his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An excellent example. 4-4 plays better than 6-3. 7@S makes, 7@H does not|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has shown 5+@hs and 4@s so far|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, I see. But 7@S is borderline with J-10-x-x-x missing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so SSD takes the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Angelini up by 10 now and time running out quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  choice of leads here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well can N shift to a @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H continuation makes the game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best E can do now is playing @h10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think so. He knows hearts can't be running with 109xx in the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: Since the singleton @C this time is with the trump ace. nothing can endanger 6@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: on a bad day A@D would be in N|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: It's good enough to be bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  not borderline anymore|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would want to be in it too David|pg||

nt|jcmax: A @S lead is best, but declarer can unblock his heart honours, cross with a @C to his ace and discard the @S-loser before playing trumps|pg||

nt|jcmax: Which contract would you like to be in looking only at the ew cards?|pg||

nt|bridge_one: with good @H Lauria would bid 3@H immediatly (i suppose)|pg||
nt|mariner1: however 4@H and 4@S make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6N is too much, though it has more than zero play single-dummy|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: one of these is, imo, that with @s Hx, he would cue his know @c singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: known*|pg||

nt|andyv:  now hope everything is sitting wrong for N|pg||

mb|4D|nt|andyv:  5 loser hand, vul against vul, I prefer 4@s immediately|pg||
nt|bobh1: the hands don't mesh that well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C fixing @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: cue|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S would fix @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: on 4@HX|pg||
nt|tomi2: both players have 4333, that makes 4@S go down even with @H finesse working, no discards and no @H9|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: good card, the @s Q|pg||
nt|andyv:  good choice on this layout but @s lead will not bother N|pg||
nt|ritong: the K would have said too much|pg||
nt|ritong: one can underlead trump Kxx, but not Qxx, apart when the bidding had situated it already, like the 4@h doubled hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
nt|bobh1: plenty of values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: @c come home so @D by E when in with @S makes N guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  low @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there it is|pg||
nt|haans: good defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good try|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be no guess|pg||
nt|haans: were is @CQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he overcalled vulnerable at the 2-level without @HAKJ, so ....|pg||
nt|mariner1: E pretty much has to have it 2@H vul overcall|pg||
nt|bridge_one: saying at the partner: i have a interesting hand but not too much ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i means 4@H by west|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do not think it is at all clear to bid 3H as E.....that might get you to the only game you cant make|pg||
nt|bobh1: E's hand is just too distributional to consider 3n altho i agee it is the best spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but E might bid 3D instead of 3H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Earlier today we had the women on vugraph. On one hand three players underbid, so Victor Silverstone thought they were members of the Scottish pop band named Wet Wet Wet|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East must give the distribution first ... i agree with 3@H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: He is a favourite to have an outside ace, is he not?|pg||
nt|andyv:  opening lead of low @d would have been more bothersome|pg||
nt|bobh1: first hurdle|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|bobh1: now can endplay E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and E is caught for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: that was 800 and 5 imps to Padova|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: play for stiff king of hearts or stiff jack|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobh1: and over 3@h, W, with his piddling @ds cannot rebid 3n|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  things not going well for N|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Is he?|pg||
nt|andyv:  c'est tout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: he chose stiff king|pg||
nt|mariner1: no outs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|s2|nt|mariner1: Zugzwang in chess|pg||
nt|bobh1: another solid result for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: Zugzwang - German Chess term describing a situation where one player is|pg||
nt|mariner1: put at a disadvantage because he has to make a move - the player would like|pg||
nt|mariner1: to pass and make no move. In "Game Theory" it specifically means a win is|pg||
nt|mariner1: changed to a loss|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: bd 25 will cost Angelini, Nunes bid 4@H over 3@s which might have made but Fantoni bid 4NT and now they are at 5 @H...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The heart is wrong (slight surprise on the bidding) but that is not enough|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|bobh1: so the auction got to 4 of a major by momentum|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
mc|11|nt|marlowepi: i agree about showing distribution, and that is why i think 3D is a viable (though perhaps not best) call -- if i had 5 hearts i would bid 3H|pg||

nt|mariner1: that nasty @H break should beat it though,,,,,,,, right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But P looks right after a weak nt|pg||
nt|bobh1: cant imagine E considering trying for game opposite a weak nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a pretty good system actually, where you, among other excellent features, get an 18-19 balanced opened at the 1-level|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all those who think i am crazy --- get in line :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@d=1M and 3@c=@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  this might keep them low|pg||
nt|mariner1: true also|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@H by North will no doubt request correction if South holds spades. No, he has bid more strongly.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT on any lead but a spade, ducked|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobh1: so he has some sort of scrambling maneuver in mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  need to get @cs started if any chance to set this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that you play the right hand for the stiff @CA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand worth a 3@s bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with concentrtion of honors in S and @H 3@H is sure, also with light hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcmax: the only thing declarer was concerned about was not losing 3@H tricks. If he had needed to play the suit for 1 loser only he would have played it differently|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: balanced 8-10 probably|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: and he struck gold|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: creative lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, not exactly what I had in mind:) but may well work!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, amazing. |pg||
nt|andyv:  good spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: He was worth showing a strong club raise and that is (presumably) what 2@D meant. Normal bid is 2@S on that hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a relay|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even with a singleton trump ace, a spade lead looks best from North. What else?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't imagine he is thinking about his lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Dano says 2@D asks for a 4 card major, here @h|pg||
nt|haans: up to 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: He would have played a low @H away from the A playing N for either 10x or H10|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: 2N seems to have no chance here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d multi|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H pass/correge|pg||
nt|jcmax: that means if N had played low he would have inserted the 8 from his hand and if losing to an honor he would then try to run the jack|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: not so easy to make this|pg||
nt|bobh1: as is sometimes the case, by not striking gold he might have stolen the hand in 1n|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  good auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is balanced 18/20 for E/W|pg||

pc|d3|nt|andyv:  not now he won't|pg||
nt|andyv:  E fell asleep at the switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to play K@s after @c lead|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I really like this defence, but a @d to @sK and a @h to @sQ....|pg||
nt|ritong: guess claudio said something like " good lead buddy"|pg||
nt|brolucius: An amazing lead to find. It would be great to know what inspired it. |pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Disappointing if the answer is: I had not sorted my hand correctly. |pg||

nt|haans: gazzilli version|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ural or any 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either natural .....|pg||
nt|bobh1: the major suits lie very badly for NS though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 911 rushed to Rob's house one day when he was commentating because a Good Samaritan kib noted that he had failed to use the word "penultimate" to announce the next-to-last board ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and called it in|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-11  4+ hearts also applies over the take-out double|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was West not worth 1@S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not anymore:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: down from 36|pg||

nt|hedyg: what was 1@D here?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: nunes really wants to take room|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's dbl a bit unorthodox|pg||
nt|ritong: away from opps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I now prefer 1nt from W |pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how much Nunes would have bid if he had 2 hcps?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but Nunes had a bid before me...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't know why Nunes is operating. What does he think that E-W can make. Only 3NT, it seems, and he is vulnerable against not. |pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess E is allowed to pass!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's forcing, in theory|pg||
nt|bobh1: not the way i play gazzilli|pg||
nt|mariner1: told ladies score is close also; running scores at|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirank.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he might be steaming after the small @c with Qx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think you should double 5@D. This risk is that partner pulls|pg||
nt|lml: its hard because partner might have more |pg||
nt|lml: he was under pressure over 5@d|pg||
nt|lml: this could be a number |pg||
nt|lml: but you have a point|pg||
nt|hedyg: Aldo?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is a little dangerous with only three spades. No harm done here though|pg||
nt|bobh1: so EW have another foul up |pg||
nt|haans: gazzilli are often after 1M but 1m are also stated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Minaldo took a view but was not successful|pg||
nt|bobh1: his 3rd one this set|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H forcing (they use another bid to bid the inviting hand with 6@H)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well I try to remember the prepostantepenultimate|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: looks like a 1 @c opening to me|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: é scappato gerli? =)|pg||
nt|hedyg: si :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: that lead lets it home|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's a make. I can't understand why Baroni did not lead a top diamond|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will be reached in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  very anemic bidding for these two|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Pomares must now hope that diamonds are 7-1, and they are|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Was North worth 3@H en route?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Versace use 1@S pass 3@C to give the hand inviting with 6@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seems to be no danger hey will get too high now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  4@h in OR by W|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: io fossi in te m offenderei|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a quick off 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: should Versace have bid 4@c over 2@s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that South expected North to cue-bid the @HK if he held it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think Versace was worth more than a 4@s bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is wet, but did Roberta not say that Angelini is South and Versace North on this deal?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perfect fits require a bit of overbidding someties|pg||
nt|bobh1: not now no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rob, never end a sentence with a prepostanteultimate|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: she did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hanno il bord al contrario....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: possibly - something about the board being contrario|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: A strange auction. Presumably 2NT would have been conventional by West on the second round, otherwise that was a sensible option.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: usualy it is partner who is contrary|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, may be Versace changed that convention :)|pg||

pc|cK|nt|ritong: didn t north open 1@c?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SK was an unlucky choice. Now Fantoni can't attack spades any more|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I see it, West would do better to show a little something by bidding 1@S on the first round, rather than make such a leap next time.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must know that N has all outstanding honoue´rs, so a @h to K and a @c and cover|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 1@C did not show more than 2+ cards|pg||
nt|ritong: looks free to cross to hand via a @h, tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But then @cQJ alone|pg||
nt|ritong: he draw ace first|pg||
nt|ritong: correctly, btw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S confirmed a club suit, though. With a balanced 15+ hand he would have rebid NT|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: =) Grazie a voi che c avete seguito!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then Angelini should have bid 4@c to get a @H cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 1@S showed a positive response (as was the case in Classic Precision, with a double showing around 5-7), then North might be reluctant to show any signs of life. Still, North ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: might have cue-bid 3@H and then shut up shop.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm sure there was pure disgust on that hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last hand this session.......|pg||

nt|lml: 3NT looks like the normal spot too|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe east will throw in a curve|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our hardworking operator in Bologna ,Roberta,well done !|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: thanks to Fred and BBO for broadcasting this fine event   and thanks to Roland Wald for his yeoman work coordinating it all   come back soon for more |pg||

nt|bobh1: thx all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 18/19 bal 2@d|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: I stand correcte4d   BRAVA Roberta!!!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This board tightened the gap, so still there is a match|pg||
nt|daman: the next session should begin in roughly 2 hours|pg||
nt|brolucius: If E/W are playing normal multi, 3@H should be natural. Presumably everyone knows what they are doing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, dinner breaks in Italy are longer than elsewhere :)|pg||
nt|daman: kudos to the Pavoda team for holding their own against several world champions|pg||
nt|brolucius: As are smoking breaks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back at 1:00 am Los Angeles, 4:00 am New York, 10.00 Paris, 9:00 am London, 6:00 pm Sydney|pg||

nt|mariner1: which day Hedy? :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not me!|pg||
nt|daman: said the Walrus|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|brolucius: And always a pleasure to have Hedy on board!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the board is again turned 180°|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lot!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2: that spade suit is much too weak and to short for me to mention|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Fantoni has read it as natural, it seems.|pg||
nt|hedyg: next week Tuesday?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would double as East - may as well suggest hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us and thank you Roberta for a job well done.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
nt|daman: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: so Versace has the N hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C a Bergen or similar type raise///////////|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h again|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 14 NS are in 2@H Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: they are playing their 4 1 git|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h can be made with a correct guess in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: played 18/20 for many years ....|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mariner1: fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lot!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: wimpy would be there :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: tomorrow of course specs, dont listen to Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS do a good job finding the game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Living dangerously|pg||
nt|andyv:  those are good to practice|pg||
nt|andyv:  have a lot more play than the 1-1 fits|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moyse would not approve, not to mention Burn's Law (Rules)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: you shouls be able to find game with 27 HCP and no competition|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back in 2 hours and 10 minutes with the first segment of the final|pg||
nt|bobh1: ok thought u said 18-20|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: Maybe I do them an injustice and 4@H showed a strong hand. That is more likely.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the adventure begins|pg||
nt|ritong: je dis donc 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: oups pv sry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that double was ill-judged- no tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then again, I don't understand golins double on no tricks in @D. now Baroni has even an cae, she could be weaker with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing good @ss instead of 5@ds|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  tough choice now but S's cards just don't look helpful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well judged by Angelini. A 4th spade would have attracted a double, no doubt.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: 2@D= 10-15, 6+@D or 5 @d + 4@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E wants to play a forcing game, a @h seems more in order|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does not want to ruff|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Partner bid clubs (yes, I know, clus are dead)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws  (Rules - never|pg||
nt|mariner1: play in a contract where the O's have more trumps than you)|pg||
nt|bobh1: this seems to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  wish i'd know about that law before....|pg||
nt|bobh1: pitch a @c on a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no problems any longer I think. This was the 2nd last card I had lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: does any lead beat it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: SSD was down by 11 at the start and now up by 12|pg||
nt|bobh1: underleading the @d might work|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  same contract in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are E/W playing the multi? In that case South would not know West's suit and 3@H would be a natural bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Has a chance on a D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  thanks to all the specs, Roland, George, Mike, Henri, Ralf and Roberta for a most enjoyable time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No always a @d and a @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows pd has @ds as well as @cs|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Right, spade can't disappear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, the contract can be made even on a club lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  everyone knew what to do on the @d:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a @c lead S had to play @sQ  to kill @s10|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx all. we are unpaid volunteers, but we do accept complementary cases of Brunello di Montalcino:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chmitty: l'entameur a commencé par 6@s maitres|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising that both pairs should get so high on these values. But if bidding was easy, hardly anyone would play bridge, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only -1 so 2 imps to NS|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h3|nt|lml: Versace was actually a touch too good for that bid|pg||
nt|lml: I counted 16|pg||
nt|bobh1: once you don't underlead at trick 1, you are lost|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That can wait. First he will lead a diamond up|pg||
nt|mariner1: more Italy and others on the schedule, Roland has been busy!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: anyone know what the SSD stands for?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Besides, West can't play another club|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but passed pd?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he knows pd is exactly 1 4 4 4 so he can play @H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: i tell my students that to double what counts are aces and trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: see you later! BYE|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what value there was in ducking unless W played pd for xx in clubs...even then doesn't make any sense|pg||
nt|jcmax: Thanks all and have a good night! Bye bye!|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: And Qx|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all!|pg||
