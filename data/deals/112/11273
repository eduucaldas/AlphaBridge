nt|nigel_k:  So he can try clubs and revert to spades when in the second time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|haans: yes no overtake|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: the boys have asked me to delete any negative comments about their play  :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not overtaking and play partner for @cQ is better as well, otherwise it is always making|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|haans: that is a beginners overcall|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|haans: no game in other room was well done|pg||
nt|haans: and please lead your suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|nigel_k:  It's a good hand for strong club because I would really hate either 1@h or 2@c on that hand|pg||
nt|haans: acceptable|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 7@C best|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|nigel_k:  3@c is a diamond preempt|pg||
nt|motbocaj: 7@C at IMP's and 7NT at matchpoints?|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|nigel_k:  After the preempt you'd be very unlucky not to make 7NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good case for wheeling out the Old Black here|pg||
nt|motbocaj: The transfer pre-empt does give the other side more flexibility e.g. a double here that wouldn't be available after 3@D Dbl Pass|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If 4NT two suited not Blackwood I prefer it to 4@d|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|motbocaj: If double over 3@D showed  both Majors what might 4@D show? It's a fine distinction|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|mdgraham: this is like the old joke about the driver in the country who asks a local how to get to London.....I wouldn't have started from here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|motbocaj: This is going to degenerate into 5NT pick a slam.. PLEASE|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@D was a bit like that|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Now he doesn't know which key card is missing|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And the @sK is not needed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: you really think South should have taken control here |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: 4NT and then some number of hearts|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||

nt|rnmalik: the first and the last board-slam hands|pg||
nt|haans: As always we thank Lix Fitzgerald  vugh graph operator that does the real job|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: my pleasure|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  A good hand to discuss with partner responses to takeout doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: Bailey  played it, but he says thanks  :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Obviously West didn't expect East to keep bidding a 3 card suit, even with a very weak hand|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|nigel_k:  1@s will be two suits of the same rank|pg||
nt|haans: burrow are already in slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Liz, nicely done|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: i Bermuda Bown a long time ago italian did bid 3 carder three times ended right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 7@C not bad|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|nigel_k:  North/South are doing well to interfere with the strong club|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I would bid 4@C on 3@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and that would be RKC|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: lead = still looking for u suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: did not even try :) |pg||

nt|vugraphzxe: last board of this round|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: there will be another 12 boards to play|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the other table N/S stopped in 1NT on board 10 so Central Districts will close the gap to just a handful of IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: starting shortly|pg||
