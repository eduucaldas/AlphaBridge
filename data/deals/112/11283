mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mariner1: it is presently 57 40 I think|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|janm:  Our score is as it was at the start of this segment. Operator, I think you need to close the table and then start by joining to closed room instead of starting up this table|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|mc|9|pg||
qx|o28|st||md|2SJT2HJ85DJ985CKT2,SA65HK9DAT764CA98,SKQ74HQ2DKQ3CJ753,S983HAT7643D2CQ64|sv|n|nt|janm:  Isn't 57-40 before board 25? And that board was another pickup for the GIBS team|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: no games again , EW in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think so...and they picked up one more imp on board 26|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, NS picked up 1 imp|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes score is only through 24|pg||
nt|mariner1: as Jan said the rooms are no longer linked|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 24 should have been either 10 or 11 imp pick up|pg||
nt|andyv:  someone said S went down 2 in 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: W just has to pass here, 15 and no fit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|janm:  This isn't going to be a happy contract for EW - but although W was a little pushy, he did have all Aces & Kings (and the K in trumps too), which means his hand is a lot better than the point count|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might have bid this thinking they needed a swing score|pg||
nt|janm:  If East had been a tiny bit better - J of hearts and trade the minors, it would be an okay game|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Yes, I would tend to blame East|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  even kxx of @h could have worked|pg||
nt|janm:  Hard for EW to know that they've picked up all (or almost all) of the deficit - they have to know they have a plus card, but not how plus|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|h6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the pickups were a lot of 5's and 6's which might not be that obvious to|pg||
nt|mariner1: them|pg||
nt|janm:  Yes, and even if you know you got all the partscores right, it's hard to expect the other pair to get them all wrong :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W is just aggressive|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|janm:  Aggressive, but not crazy :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|janm:  xx, AQxxxx, Kx, xxx in East would be a pretty good shot at game|pg||
nt|andyv:  but you would already be in game with that hand|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  E shoud 6 card @h suit and about 6-7 hcp|pg||
nt|janm:  Of course, East would bid game with that much - how about xx, Axxxxxx, Qxx, x|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  again, you would be in game|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  7 card major suits headed by Ace belong in game over strong NT:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|janm:  Maybe, depending on how aggressive E is (I guess the fact that he invited with this hand does suggest he'd bid game with those|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: well also though you have a 15 and kx,,,,,, if P had what you needed he might|pg||
nt|mariner1: have stretched.......... though the game call could well be STOM for all we|pg||
nt|mariner1: know...........|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  W's lack of a third heart and intermediates made game very unlikely|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|janm:  I do like Aces!|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 card suit...i'd bid game and hope:)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|janm:  Strange for E to bid 1@s instead of Michaels, unless they don't play 2@c as Michaels?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mariner1: no game again|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: 4@H off in Closed Room here|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow 1@s just doesn't feel right with that hand but they probably play wk/st michaels|pg||
nt|janm:  I knew there was a reason I didn't like weak-strong Michaels :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: next session in 64 minutes|pg||
nt|janm:  S upgrading here? Looks like a normal 15-17 1NT to me|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  may play 14-16 range|pg||
nt|imodefense: South NT system, 1NT=10-12, rebid 1NT=13-16|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|imodefense: sorry, N-S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|andyv:  12 tricks with @c hook on|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|janm:  And of course it doesn't affect the result, since N would get them to game anyway|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: ty Masaru good info|pg||
nt|janm:  Thanks, that makes sense then|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|mariner1: NS in 4@H here Closed Room|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H made 6|pg||

pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Final, 2 segments of 16 boards, starting in 1 hour. Welcome back then|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Roland|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Good morning|pg||
pc|c2|nt|janm:  Not sure whether 4@h or 3NT is better here - Both need something reasonable in hearts, I guess, and 3NT needed diamonds not horrible, but could have survived some bad heart breaks|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Roland...........|pg||
mc|11|nt|janm:  At any rate, with the cards favorable, both will make |pg||
