nt|hedyg: i have no idea what system EW play, but we will see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini will likely open 1NT passed to West|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yesterday we had several deals where the points were divided 20-20 (not usually a good sign for entertaining viewing). I see here that the Great Dealer has made it 21-19 for a ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A surprise|pg||
nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs apperently|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: looks like a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT has some good prospects here EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 32 hp on EW - let us see what happens|pg||
nt|daman: doesn't seem to be a slam in sight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes doubled a 12-14 NT in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  W looking at the security of the @h suit instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North escaped to 2@C and is playing there|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H will result in a minus for EW|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: that makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  misfit may slow them down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 11 tricks on this layout. No squeeze|pg||
nt|brolucius: Five hearts, a diamond and a spade - one down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they switch to spades in time|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure they will|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  3 or 4N likely spot|pg||
nt|daman: do we know what system EW are playing/|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a throw in for 12 - or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: undo please|pg||
nt|odysseus69: whenever I commentate I notice that every man opens balanced 11 - I wonder if the disease has spread to wwmens bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has, mostly because N-S can't attack spades. The suit is frozen for the defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be -1 but @h leads may create more problems for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: 2NT=22-24|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N or 4@S plays ok,,,,,,,|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like 3N by S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nice easy game to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - the 9s and 10s coming into play here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini will want to show AK@C?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: 3NT is a fine contract |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well we dont need 6 of us to analyse the play on this hand|pg||
nt|daman: you can reheat your coffees     this contract is in no danger|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had a bit to spare for his sequence, but the singleton spade entitled him to take a gloomy view of his hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially on a @D lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: D lead is right into the jaws|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but could Angelini know that?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Here is an example wher the @DJ in either hand would just make a huge difference.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: low from xx   2/4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can actually make 12 tricks on any lead, but you need to guess well|pg||
nt|lestergold: north kinder mullered in the majors and end played|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jcmax: There would be 12 tricks on normal breaks.|pg||
nt|lml: he has so many top tricks it doesnt much matter about the diamond lead|pg||
nt|daman: better switch to @Ss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but he can't afford to cash the other top honour|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but more difficult|pg||
nt|daman: he can see the dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he cashes another @c they lose the 1 @s trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: no Roland, he could not and should be happy to play 4@s IMO|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: yes a squeeze and endplay for 12 now|pg||
nt|daman: a @S is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcmax: But it is always extremely difficult to evaluate in the bidding. Especially when the suit never gets mentioned.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace could have had  Qxxxx  xx  xxx  KQx  and then 3NT isn't exactly a great spot|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North wondering whether declarer is trying to steal 1 club trick- clearly they dont lead 4th highest|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Is that Angelini or Versace sitting North?! Nice switch.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: 6@C was not too bad a contract. You can take both major-suit finesses (counting 11 tricks if one wins) and perhaps ruff a heart to bring the total to twelve.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The lead indicates that he has something in majors|pg||
nt|daman: the @D 3 is a Slavinsky lead I am told|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 if declarer can sneak a spade|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes wd|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|sharkey: yes - S will duck|pg||

nt|odysseus69: more work in 3NT here|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and we did not get any score here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I imagine made 5|pg||
nt|daman: there will definitly be a swing    depends on who is on the winning end|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: We are back in business in the slam zone again|pg||
nt|andyv:  and another slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time its infrangible|pg||
nt|daman: would any of us open 1@H?|pg||
nt|daman: there's that word again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not after a multi opening. Way too good in most people's books, but not for E-W here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer a heart to weak 2- too much outside tehheart suit|pg||
nt|daman: too many syllables    gives me a headache|pg||
nt|hedyg: might not have been exactly as we saw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East discarded a diamond? Then declarer pitched a winner?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 6@S there|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, even 5@d has to be considered|pg||
nt|brolucius: Twelve tricks can be made in spades.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|4D|nt|brolucius: Commentating.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double seems normal now|pg||
nt|andyv:  opposite a passed pd, 4@d still leaves a bit too much room to N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most top pairs play take-out double through at least 4@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: 6@h on a finess|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: my weak 2s dont have ak combos outside the trump suit not in forn of  partner im avers to missing gamers|pg||
nt|andyv:  should show max w@hs|pg||
nt|daman: ogusty|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might bid just 2@S, meaning that will be high enough if partner has spades. But they play their multi quite strong (as is apparent), so West bids 2NT with 16 points in case a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game is there by sheer power.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam there better than 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or negative doubles if you like|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a good hand for playing in @s|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely he will pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Quite good, yes, but is it worth bidding at the five-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: however on the bidding @ss might well be 4-1 or even 5-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: club finesse or no spade lead too|pg||
nt|andyv:  may get there now|pg||
nt|daman: West might not expect such a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl again|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: a little more work to do here|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a bidder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass and bid 5@S now, even considering six|pg||
mb|5S|nt|odysseus69: defence on top and this looks tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if west makes a try tho east will accept|pg||
nt|hedyg: George pls stop clicking on the commentator's curse button|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six too much, surely?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose a heart to Jack and diamond to Q|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even if W gets 2 @S tricks cannot see making|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be then - two @D tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South's double of 3S was dubious, with two kings in unbid suits.|pg||
nt|daman: the double of 3@S might give him pause to think partner would have values outside @Ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s by W would have gotten a 5@d bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Intersting the @S suit never got mentioned here. But I guess no need if there is no fit.|pg||
nt|daman: hah!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes David, therefore "considering"|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: onbiously they are used to opening heavy multis|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: just find A@C in W and ruff 1@H for 6|pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow leads|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  six no picnic with small @c lead from W and we saw some similar action yesterday those type of leads|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: nicely done|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: Pretty neat, anyway, to reach a slam after a multi opening.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: Since @H is the communication 4th @H may become good|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcmax: East's pass over 1@H is also interesting. In my view passing with that kind of hand makes it so much easier for the opponents to come into the bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he rated Pass and 5@S (removing the double) as stronger than an immediate 5@S. But I'm not sure whether the hand is worth such a meaning. He has few honors in the majors.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  4N seems like a shot in the dark... i'd have liked to know about the K of @d on this hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: do you think this was a pass and pull auction?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: unclear|pg||
pc|d7|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ritong: but the idea is important|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: nice play|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would mean pass was forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need plenty of good luck in the majors (even in clubs) to make 6@S. A contract of 5@S is about right.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the other room S bid 5 @H over 5 @d..N thinking|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On board 1, the operator in the open room lost the play in 6NT at some point, but eventually we had a claim for 13 tricks. So Lauria must have guessed the line|pg||
nt|daman: is it possible the scoring s not hooked up?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D play well as W does not have one to lead|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Roland you are on|pg||

nt|hedyg: 6@s on bd 1, after 9 tricks declarer thinking since a while what to play on opps small @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the thing is that you can't bid this making slam|pg||

nt|hedyg: he is on this team, playing with Giubilo i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The North hand is hard to express, with so many bids being weak nowadays.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c bid to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 4h can be made  double dummy- but not even Nunes would do it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Modern methods will reveal that you are off one ace and the queen of trump|pg||

mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: i would feel sick if my opponents bid this to 6 spades - I hate lucky slams|pg||
nt|hedyg: Giammi on BBO|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is getting exciing|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@C forcing Roberta?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: The West hand has only 14 hcp, but it is immensely control-rich with 4 1st-round controls. It might be an idea to open a strong club instead.|pg||
nt|hedyg: N showed @hs by X but Versace decided it would be too costly to defend|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think W should open 1@C here,,,,,,, just too much for 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot open 1@c if they play precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't dbl|pg||
nt|daman: I'm all for the red card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was worth 3@H, easily.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems very conservative|pg||
nt|andyv:  N seemed worth of one try|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all as E? i like to bid with an ace a major|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with the ace in my suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all pass*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I never pass with an ace|pg||
nt|andyv:  i never have an ace to pass with|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think vulnerable there is too great a risk of losing a lot of 100s|pg||
nt|hedyg: good, i am not alone|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's hand was better than it looks. He had minor honors in partner's suits (just where you want them) and aces outside, where you need quick tricks. Some players would have bid ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: more than 3@H on those values.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: its not ust a matter of taking a first round heart hook|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand went down hill with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|daman: our side had an automatic tap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room East passed in 1st seat; then South opened a Multi, and E-W reached 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 2 that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of work to o even double dummy to make this|pg||
nt|daman: really|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he puts up qS and plays to run a low heart it would have chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: because he is not strong enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could upgrade the hand which I think he should|pg||
nt|jcmax: After a 2@C opening I don't believe there is any chance one can get to 6@C. not that I necessarily believe one should be there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but common practice is to not let pd play 1@c if you have any type of bid available|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even 1NT is an underbid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: heavy opening - some would have selected 2 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks natural to me. Jump shift, 19-21, 5+ clubs, 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - N's 3@S stronger than 4@S - they may be on their way|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|brolucius: If it is being suggested that East should double 4@H, then I don't agree at all. His club values are worthless in defence.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slow 4S may force South to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: just thinking the same Victor :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a horrible, room consuming auction. No-one knows how many keycards they are missing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South must bid slam now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: if east doubled4h then Nunes might well make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree David|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: forgetting female intuition Roland|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mariner1: K&R (A865 AJ8 AJ5432 ---) = 17.60|pg||
nt|lml: 6@S went down even after the diamond lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: to me hand is easily a 1@C opener|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR|pg||
nt|lml: on the first board|pg||
nt|lml: even if you open 1@C it is not clear to me you will get to a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is worth 17.6 on the K&R Hand Evaluator, so it would not be unreasonable to upgrade to 16+, would it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Axxx+AJx+-+AJxxxx|pg||
nt|lml: you have a minimum 1@C opener and partner has a minimum positive|pg||
nt|hedyg: but what is it worth when pd has no fit?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, nothing to worry about, and the opponents are feeling sick in a minute or two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but satisfies the RW test - it makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: slightly less than 50%....|pg||
nt|sharkey: S thinking Grand??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because she has no idea as to how many aces partner has|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: I would take my chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 100 instead of 50 is not worth much. If instead your double tips declarer into the winning line, you will have a big headache for a while.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: in that case you pass :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no chance of bidding 7 - just reflecting about life|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Sabine, would you upgrade that to 1@C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll never know|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

pc|s2|nt|daman: look  partner overcalled red   I double|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|lml: or would you bid 1@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: upgrading it to 1@C seems less distorting than opening it 2@C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade 9 best|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't mind 1NT, facing a passed hand, but it is time to re-evaluate when partner shows both majors.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Baroni is feeling sick already. Her only chance is that declarer has five spades|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe he did on a different line|pg||
nt|brolucius: How many times have I heard players say 'I had to double them after your overcall!'  An overcall shows playing strength in the suit bid, not necessarily much defence. How many ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: tricks did East hold himself?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west didnt get in to his spade  but Nunes has to lose a dim 2 hearts and a club whatever|pg||

nt|odysseus69: not forgetting singleton Q with West|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|daman: this is one of their 11-13 bids|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, definitely. thought I already had said that. :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or East|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: that is when you went flying|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: 1@H would show 14+ points, so Fantoni has to open at the two-level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which system do E-W play? Livorno Diamond?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead causes issues if W plays it|pg||
nt|jcmax: But it seems EW are not playing strong club, because now West opened 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nightmare-ish I suppose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Michaels and inflation |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course 3 NT no problem without @S lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C=majors- 2D- you pick|pg||
nt|ritong: any imp counts, players like versace play to optimize every board reasonably|pg||
nt|brolucius: With four tens, even a timid bidder such as myself would have opened the North hand.|pg||
nt|daman: 11 HCP   4 10's   2 1/2 quick tricks    would anyone open the North hand/|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: 4h for sure here|pg||
nt|daman: Roberta said she will correct it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she has|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n makes too|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT also OK.|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Roberta|pg||
nt|mariner1: well there goes the 1@C arguement :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib informs me they bid slam OR as well previous board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East rushes to pick hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: even if they are not super happy with the contract:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: As played by the (in)famous Lanzarotti-Buratti many years ago|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I noticed Minardo bid 1@H over 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 200 only|pg||
nt|sharkey: beats 130|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't be afraid, open|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to apologize for making a sensible bid.|pg||
nt|daman: OMG  if Roland would open?   then it has to be right :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they invinted 10-12 NTs for timid bidders|pg||
nt|hedyg: right! we would all open|pg||
nt|andyv:  invented|pg||
nt|hedyg: primes and great spots|pg||
nt|hedyg: plus a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I know some players who would reach 3NT on the East-West cards|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: whenever I do that I end in the 3-3 but they are headed to 3NT here|pg||
nt|daman: I am informed that 1@D promises a 4 card major  otherwise a weak NT 12-14   fixed by the system    is that true?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Meanwhile, E/W have bid the hand commendably - realising that they had no middle cards and staying low.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: but 100 on EW|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty daman|pg||
nt|daman: what 100 are you referring to Ralf/|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: board 3|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h down 2|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|lml: I dont think it was a relay I just dont think he had another good bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that the E-W names are not really what we see.  East is Minaldo with an  L,   West is Matteucci. Could you check that please, Roberta?|pg||
nt|tendenz: Hi all, 1@H is 3+ cards, 1@S is 3+cards, because they cannot bid 1nt. 1nt is an artificial answer, transfer for @C (weak or strong)|pg||
nt|lml: thanks ... makes sense|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh so good to have an expert on the system, grazie!!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: itè possible... they can't tell me their name, ty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Aldo :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Is North really pondering over the lead now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least 8 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tendenz: You wellcome, I usually play with Matteucci|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not know if they have special treatments with three suiters, but bypassing @ss looks dangerous to me with west hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: K&R (T4 AT4 AT984 KT7) = 13.25 |pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: I agree - 4 tricks not enough and if 1 down not worth the pressure|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|tendenz: 1@d is natural, or only 2+ wit 18-20 bal hand|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: The system is called Nightmare I believe|pg||
nt|mariner1: aptly so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may use a checkback system|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcmax: It seems almost impossible to me to avoid bidding to 3NT with the EW cards. The best thing to do would have been an auction like 2N-3N where S could not have bid for the lead.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT seems to be better than 4@H (where you are looking for a 10th trick).|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: I am in shock. England have 4 SL wickets down for 17 runs after 5 overs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: can it be true?|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with @d Jxxx facing possible singleton, which would be good for a @s scontract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphztg: scusate x i nomi.... nn li ho capiti molto bene quando me li hanno detti... scusate =(|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble with using Michaels on this East hand is that partner will not know what to do next time with a little more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dangerous to play more trumps now. If someone has four, she will go a lot down. Better to play spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: East's 2@C presumed for Majors - surprised W didnt bid @S to for lead purposes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|odysseus69: there are other reasons why Michaels was a bad idea |pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  non aggressive lead by N most likely to cost a trick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not sure why they are not bidding the hands they are dealt, says a spectator. He may have a point|pg||

mb|3N|nt|lml: it was too  much to bid vulnerable without a clear fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N|pg||

nt|hedyg: Fantoni did not bother to play @c when in with A@s, he switched to @H, might go down in 4 @H now|pg||

nt|sharkey: Of course - :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@H looks good. I ahd not noticed the 5-5 shape.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: after 1@h - D i had prefered 1nt as W, not 1@s|pg||

nt|lestergold: itsa 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is close|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes close but no cigar|pg||
nt|lml: I would be disappointed not to be in it until I discovered the break|pg||
nt|mariner1: since E is limited and so is W should the even be thinking game?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sharkey: Need a @D lead to have a chance to set 6 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Roland is watching his minions commentate|pg||
nt|lml: well they did well to avoid the game anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d doesnt|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has followed a strong sequence. I would have bid just 3@H (=a raise to 2@H) on the first round.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4 NT quantative here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If declarer avoids a diamond lead and she guesses hearts, she is in fine shape. On a diamond lead she is destined to go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H*|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this segment takes a wild turn|pg||
nt|daman: Padova prends le devant par trois longeurs     Padova takes the leas my 3 IMPs (lengths)|pg||
nt|daman: lead*|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: now weve got onions into it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: would it be the upset of the year if Angelini lost?|pg||
nt|brolucius: What was the point of South's double? Getting too high is his fault, as I see it (although no doubt Angelini will apologise for it.)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: No idea why Nunes doubled instead of bidding 1@S.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H set as trump here I think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: we all know you cannot spell Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: now its george he spelt onions minions|pg||
nt|hedyg: many Italians play Ghestem in which case @S/@C was known in E, so Versace could bid 3@H or unusual vs unusual with a better hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: goooing to get trump lead|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|hedyg: had to keep that 10 @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5H= 2 without Q probably|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent Irene Baroni!|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - offensive vs small slams|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead vs Grand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good lead- the old rule about attacking against small slams still works (sometimes)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And those who claim that you must never lead away from a king against a slam will get food for thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S makes this West should hide her cards more carefully....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i was doing a doing a disservice to womens bridge by suggesting a trump lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This 4@H bid contrasts with getting to 2@H opposite a re-opening: even if South has shown a good hand, he did not start with 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl could have been two things...1) able to punish one of their suits and 2) a limit raise in @hs with only 3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: hes still okay in 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GIB will likely tell you that there is an overtrick, but the thing is that GIB plays with all cards in view|pg||
nt|daman: I would find it difficult to criticize Alfredo|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wow, South bid 4@S at the other table. I prefer a double to that.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its interesting how these chaps no when to avoid bidding their six card spade suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S (10)         Double (5)         4@S (2)|pg||
nt|ritong: matteucci kindly warned|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Humans should go down|pg||
nt|sharkey: We'll all make an overtrick from here so not surprised that GIB agrees with us Roland|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well play diamond now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lml: and 4 was unlikely anyway on repeated club plays|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes, but could have made 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: First hurdle is to guess spades. That is not obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hearts rather|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he could bid 2@S with a sound raise to 3@H and a direct 3@H with a lesser hand (which is what he held).|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: yep nunese smelt a misfit anhe read SJ Simon'sold book|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like Alfredo was hedging his bets|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are so few opportunities, we should criticise him while we can! |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could bid 2@s to show a limit raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry David, i was too slow|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's what they play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think North did too much with a minimum 5-3-3-2 opposite an invitational bid at best|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s could also show a @s stopper|pg||
nt|andyv:  and invite values|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: 4@s on S must be some kind of suicide....|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, he had that as well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: I don't think anyone will agree with this line|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|brolucius: More important to be able to bid two sorts of heart-support hand. |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: my idea is the adrenalina generated by the 800 on the previous board is the main culprit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: they all got off wheels|pg||

nt|mariner1: no games however action possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room declarer got a club lead, guessed hearts and scored all 13|pg||
nt|daman: there's an outside chance the 800 might be a push|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are you tempted to place another bet with Roland?|pg||
nt|daman: I amnot|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may cost you serious T-shirts.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@h and 5+ other (not @s)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The big hands at the start of this session represented a false dawn. Disappointing collection since then.|pg||
nt|daman: Angelini closing the gap    the rally is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead makes no difference if he plays @H immediately, no entry to the N hand for the 3rd @d|pg||
nt|sharkey: Since @C finesse was to be taken anyway and if 3-3 @D loser would go away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is that is natural|pg||
nt|odysseus69: unlucky grand- would be sick to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I might even open 5@C at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know that West is very strong when it goess pass pass to you|pg||
nt|hedyg: never bet with Roland, he is always right :(|pg||
nt|daman: he owes me 27 of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Quit while you are ahead - that's the Scottish advice|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if the bidding does not die quickly then someone will come to grief here|pg||
nt|ritong: might be bloody|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was borderline, especially facing a passed hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why roland keeps on dealing 20/20s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is too wet|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 or 5 depending on your temperament|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think I wud have picked 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: those autographed by Roland are worth much more on eBay|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: They are currently fetching a Scottish £5 note.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: a fantunes passed hand  they open light|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will be interesting. What do you think about pass on S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a transfer to spades no doubt|pg||
nt|daman: whack 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: guess west likes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: what i think is for once fantunes are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 2@S with the @c fit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure they've been in trouble before|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w might be able to get close to 3N but in reality this is likely to cost the great executioners|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos they werent likely to bid 3N on ther combined 20|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do North or East have anything to think about?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H looks like too much work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would be a fair shot by West now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wet wet wet- tell all Roland- another of your specialities|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D is wet too|pg||
nt|daman: at least|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: The only real decision was whether North stuck 2NT. That was a quite possible action on his hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that a band, Victor, or was?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now 5H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wet Wet Wet  I mean|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure- I knew you knew - I was expecting a history with some of their hits|pg||
nt|sharkey: If E bids 5@H West will bid again!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and how|pg||
nt|sharkey: and she'll bid too much... |pg||
nt|sharkey: So either an underbid or an overbid - can't see them landing in 6 of anything|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess E did|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: east not showing too much respect for his partne here|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the work begins|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor knows about Wet Wet Wet because the members are Scottish. The band was formed in Clydebank in the early 80's|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone pass the W hand?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: I think so.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|lml: going to make |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think best defense can beat it|pg||
nt|mariner1: another close dbl...... better to pass and hope the confusion causes a set|pg||
nt|lml: he has to play diamonds to make I think|pg||
nt|lml: if they play trump|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: I cannot see why east has puled this double|pg||
nt|ritong: go and get em fulvio|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: Slow as ithe bidding was, East should have thought longer before pulling partner's double. Surely Double and Double had only one meaning?|pg||
nt|lml: I would have ducked the spade though|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually 7@H is not an overbid - just extremely unlucky it doesn't make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: I am sure some will bid, but I am chicken|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: And East had brilliant defence against spades himself, a singleton club and two trumps. |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is all about now whether east can restrict his iamond losers to only one|pg||
nt|ritong: a small @d is coming that s for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are4 black suit tricks available in dummy but communications are very bad |pg||
nt|brolucius: East is lucky that there is any play for game their way. He could not expect West to hold three hearts when he said that he wanted to defend.|pg||
nt|ritong: unless he tries the @c hook to pitch a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps a @c finess and a @s discard followed by @d10 can make anything|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: minaldo is thinking........ |pg||
nt|ritong: who would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club hook followed by a spade discard sill leaves a lot of diamonds to deal with- he could then afford to lose 2 dimaonds but not three|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that is why i suggested " a @d now"|pg||
nt|andyv:  David, is that before or after the 800?:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are a chicken, Liz, what does that leave me to be?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what do you want to bid on the 4 level?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: now more @hs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: A fox?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: and then squeeze W should bring the game in|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: but greed wins again|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Having waved goodbye to a sizable penalty against 3@S doubled, Minaldo would very much like to make 4@H. But in this life wishes do not always come true.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|brolucius: More like a grouse.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: no, he disced @D on A@c first|pg||
nt|hedyg: in Hungary 4@D by W would be as in leaping Michaels..|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW they may pick up IMPs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland just knows about cricket and pop bands and even bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also know that England will be hammered later today against SL|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: The ladies are on pause (spero sia giusto =p)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually 7@C wud be a great save against small slam - off -800 only|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it seems that play has been slow- did we start on time?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: W passed Pd's 6@H in OR!|pg||
nt|sharkey: 13 IMPs back - close again|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looking at the bidding OR guess E didnt promise much when she bid 4@H thus passing 6@H understandable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so 8 boards in 1 and half hours- too slow -|pg||

mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: from an income to -500|pg||

nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: I booked in for this session because I thought it might be all over by the 6th session. Shows what I know.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, 4@D is sensible|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, the danger is part has the right hand for 3 nT to be the last winning game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Absurd to hope for 3NT, as I see it. Much more important to pre-empt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  question was whether first Dbl asked for pd's 2nd suit and 2nd dbl was penalty or coop since it was in front of @s bidder|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thank goodness the West hand was not dealt in an American event.|pg||
nt|mariner1: at the risk of 5|pg||
nt|lml: I think if he ducks the spade he can make it after three rounds of hearts on the diamond club squeeze|pg||
nt|mariner1: ot more if the dbl gave the line|pg||
nt|mariner1: or|pg||
nt|lml: but he does have to duck the spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: but all in all, giving an exact picture of your hand asap is certainly the reasonable option|pg||

nt|sharkey: I'm with you Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry. This is 4th of 5. But could have been over by the 5th session. That's what I should have said.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h can go for a ride|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@S by West if South passes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lightner doubles on the 4 level?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well he has a ratty 13|pg||

nt|ritong: !!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..wow|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: doubling 2 NT establishes a forcing situation, imho|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: if west wants his pard to bid his second suit, he simply passes 3@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, but still makes the 2nd dbl questionable|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, i'll go with that|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at it this way: how on earth can West take the (huge) penalty against 3@S other than by doubling at every opportunity?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that there is no doubles for penalty in modern bidding.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Im  with the double|pg||

nt|lml: or both|pg||
nt|brolucius: You certainly wouldn't overcall 1@H if your suit was hearts. 1@S does at least take away space.|pg||

nt|tomi2: both, south and west try to show a constructive raise via 2nt / the cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@S was a bit risky, but East was short in hearts and felt he had to act. The story may have a happy ending.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: He can't quite make 4 on this layout, and he might have been in game if he had overcalled. So in this case Angelini did the right thing by passing|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, amazing. |pg||
nt|andyv:  good spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: He was worth showing a strong club raise and that is (presumably) what 2@D meant. Normal bid is 2@S on that hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a relay|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even with a singleton trump ace, a spade lead looks best from North. What else?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: I really like this defence, but a @d to @sK and a @h to @sQ....|pg||
nt|ritong: guess claudio said something like " good lead buddy"|pg||
nt|brolucius: An amazing lead to find. It would be great to know what inspired it. |pg||
nt|hedyg: lead is down to 14 now|pg||
nt|lml: they dont have any bad boards now that I can see but isnt it 18|pg||
nt|brolucius: What has a bad suppository got to do with it?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: the hand Versace opened 4@d OR opened 5@D and N bid 6@d|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Making 4@H was always going to eb a huge score|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need to improve your Italian David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is an excellent 6@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  another slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Disappointing if the answer is: I had not sorted my hand correctly. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  natual 14+ or 15+ balanced|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: Too good for you, Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Hanno il bord al contrario....|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E should bid 4@c to take up space|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c was natural, so now 3 @c is cuebid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: i meant this segment, sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-11  4+ hearts also applies over the take-out double|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was West not worth 1@S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not anymore:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: down from 36|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: what was 1@D here?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: nunes really wants to take room|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's dbl a bit unorthodox|pg||
nt|ritong: away from opps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I now prefer 1nt from W |pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how much Nunes would have bid if he had 2 hcps?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but Nunes had a bid before me...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't know why Nunes is operating. What does he think that E-W can make. Only 3NT, it seems, and he is vulnerable against not. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he might be steaming after the small @c with Qx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think you should double 5@D. This risk is that partner pulls|pg||
nt|lml: its hard because partner might have more |pg||
nt|lml: he was under pressure over 5@d|pg||
nt|lml: this could be a number |pg||
nt|lml: but you have a point|pg||
nt|hedyg: Aldo?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is a little dangerous with only three spades. No harm done here though|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: looks like a 1 @c opening to me|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: é scappato gerli? =)|pg||
nt|hedyg: si :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: that lead lets it home|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's a make. I can't understand why Baroni did not lead a top diamond|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  very anemic bidding for these two|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Pomares must now hope that diamonds are 7-1, and they are|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Was North worth 3@H en route?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  4@h in OR by W|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: io fossi in te m offenderei|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a quick off 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: should Versace have bid 4@c over 2@s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that South expected North to cue-bid the @HK if he held it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think Versace was worth more than a 4@s bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is wet, but did Roberta not say that Angelini is South and Versace North on this deal?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perfect fits require a bit of overbidding someties|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: she did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hanno il bord al contrario....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: possibly - something about the board being contrario|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: A strange auction. Presumably 2NT would have been conventional by West on the second round, otherwise that was a sensible option.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: usualy it is partner who is contrary|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Yes, Versace is declarer, Roberta tells me|pg||

nt|lml: Padova needs a big finish to catch them here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: didn t north open 1@c?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SK was an unlucky choice. Now Fantoni can't attack spades any more|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I see it, West would do better to show a little something by bidding 1@S on the first round, rather than make such a leap next time.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must know that N has all outstanding honoue´rs, so a @h to K and a @c and cover|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 1@C did not show more than 2+ cards|pg||
nt|ritong: looks free to cross to hand via a @h, tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But then @cQJ alone|pg||
nt|ritong: he draw ace first|pg||
nt|ritong: correctly, btw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S confirmed a club suit, though. With a balanced 15+ hand he would have rebid NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No, @cA must be wrong with so few communication cards|pg||

nt|brolucius: If 1@S showed a positive response (as was the case in Classic Precision, with a double showing around 5-7), then North might be reluctant to show any signs of life. Still, North ...|pg||

nt|mariner1: so NS do a good job finding the game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Living dangerously|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you shouls be able to find game with 27 HCP and no competition|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Maybe I do them an injustice and 4@H showed a strong hand. That is more likely.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the adventure begins|pg||
nt|ritong: je dis donc 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: oups pv sry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that double was ill-judged- no tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then again, I don't understand golins double on no tricks in @D. now Baroni has even an cae, she could be weaker with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing good @ss instead of 5@ds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  tough choice now but S's cards just don't look helpful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well judged by Angelini. A 4th spade would have attracted a double, no doubt.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: 2@D= 10-15, 6+@D or 5 @d + 4@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E wants to play a forcing game, a @h seems more in order|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does not want to ruff|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Partner bid clubs (yes, I know, clus are dead)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  same contract in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are E/W playing the multi? In that case South would not know West's suit and 3@H would be a natural bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Has a chance on a D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  thanks to all the specs, Roland, George, Mike, Henri, Ralf and Roberta for a most enjoyable time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No always a @d and a @s|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|chmitty: l'entameur a commencé par 6@s maitres|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising that both pairs should get so high on these values. But if bidding was easy, hardly anyone would play bridge, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only -1 so 2 imps to NS|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|lml: Versace was actually a touch too good for that bid|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: yes but passed pd?|pg||
