nt|Walddk2: 10 or 11 tricks depending on how well he guesses hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are home now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|april7: but 5 is ok, Qof @D could be ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clubs a non-issue on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: I wonder if Smolanko had a little try for game, and gave it up after a 2@d minimum response|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS to gain 1 IMP more?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think so - looks like 9 tricks are available|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: New @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Kan kill it by a neew @C|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gracelin: not necessary game forcing, just showed some range and West thought his 3 is enough for game.|pg||
nt|haans: sort of agree with you but Mackwell boys never passed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: duck first @H|pg||
nt|gracelin: then you lose your own club suit.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same but J21: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=22|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: decarer will probably play hearts to be 4-4, and guess spade|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjent: Playing safe with the @hK, and back to 8 tricks...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: AND @C NOW|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: or some one discards a heart :)|pg||
nt|haans: dummy is 3 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: N must step in in @S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He should probably continue clubs after drawing trumps - might have an endplay in some scenarios|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, if West started with @CK10x, he would be endplayed|pg||
nt|roman505:  Not much Bagchi can do here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Awaya bit:) WAS hard for NS to bid the 3NT here. And the % are mic for get it home:)|pg||

nt|april7: now E is home,unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: seen it :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt close to forcing nowdays|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW just bid and make a 25 HCP game with a runnable 5-card suit, what's the surprise |pg||
nt|april7: the suprise is not the bid but the defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: double dummy|pg||

nt|super nova: Do you remember that one bill?|pg||
nt|benjent: Last board of this set. Thanks to my co-commentator Rodal|pg||

nt|super nova: yes.. it was crazy|pg||
nt|rodal f: And stole the contract|pg||
nt|benjent: Thanks also to Jane on the keys and of course the players for putting on the show|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|super nova: SA V NSW|pg||
nt|super nova: SA winning|pg||
nt|rodal f: 29HP total. Will they bid as the other table?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: Is this a good slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|super nova: Clubs or heart slam|pg||
nt|rodal f: Started 1H - 2@C in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is excellent|pg||
nt|super nova: 6c is par.. 7 h or 7c no way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is it a good grand slam?|pg||
nt|super nova: :-S|pg||
nt|super nova: no|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% grand approx|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see the same good bidding here? But by 2-2@C needed|pg||
nt|benjent: This contract drifted 3 off in the Open room - let's see if Khokan can do better....|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will be minimum2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: this is the last board all results can be ound at http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=09ANCT&header=abf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at least to The Australian Federation - BBO by all there nice people. ( Wald are at sleep) We was Bjรธrn and Frank from norway trying to help|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||
nt|super nova: Just thinking about the extra 6% that bill mentioned|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: But you can pick up singleton J or Q with North|pg||
pc|c2|nt|elivero: And thx to Frank that use so mucth of his time for uss here,,thx Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: In the otherroom S bidded 1@S. Gave room for the opps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|april7: now a crossruff is coming|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Losing to doubleton QJ - that's the extra 6%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if you guess it|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would play it that way based on restricted choice if an honour was played from N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you don't, you consign yourself to 40%|pg||
nt|elivero: there we go:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|benjent: Low @d to the J looks like the best ployt to create tricks, but doesn't work here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can play small !X to A and @D|pg||
nt|benjent: Might still generate a little by playing @c to the A then a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Makes 5|pg||
nt|benjent: Snap, Rodal!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or. Best small @D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: I take my words back:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D 4rth. Then after 3@H a que on the road?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cQ|nt|april7: thats the last hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Their auction was a little mysterious, but I suppose once West 4th-suited, East was bidding a slam|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|vugrapha3: Play has finished and will resume in about 20 minutes time.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: that is, 2100 EST|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Thanks to everybody. See you when play resumes.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Congratulations to SA|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roman505:  They came home against an ACT team which had led most of the round robin|pg||
nt|rodal f: And afterthe ques. 5@H = do u like ure quality at @H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to stop at 4|pg||
nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Perhaps as commented elsewhere, it is often unwise to use 4NT with weak trumps.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Thank you all. Bye now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thanks all see u next year :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|april7: thanks all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: Still their auction lacks conviction.  For example, did anyone see a diamond cue bid from West?|pg||
nt|benjent: Well done Khokan, tightens the match up a little|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will hang at 5 loosers as I see it. Right Bjรธrn?:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: 6 on?|pg||
