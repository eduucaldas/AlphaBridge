pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Smart can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2NT is textbook stuff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bagchi "see red" (the vulnerability) and bids 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't that show 11-12 with a C stopper?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: if you double 2@H please hide  = no more bidding|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes ... tougher if you take a point or two away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's see|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use 11-14 NT openings so this show 15 - 17(18)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: precion at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: precision|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: the 2NT bid was not the best idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he will let this ride to his queen and advance @H10 to the queen|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Was a spot for 6@S here. Still tough @S are 1-4|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|april7: the X was also wrong, because E makes it now and W WAS FORCED  TO CONTINUE BIDDING ANYWAY|pg||
nt|haans: you can not sell precision withn that bidding|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: On either black suit switch, it seems N/S has 5 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: By there systemcard. How to get in the key cards?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4d key card|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|benjent: So small opportunity for SA if Lusk-De Luca can bid 6@s in the other room - not clearcut, but De Luca is an ... enthusiastic ... bidder|pg||
