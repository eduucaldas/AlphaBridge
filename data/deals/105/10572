nt|andy_h: Usually in these types of auctions where 1 person has shown 2 suits and their partner took preference, is to lead trumps.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kaapo: The Swedish bridge federation has put up a nice presentation, only in Swedish though: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.1917|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT might be 11-13 or so|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D probably a multi style, showing a long major|pg||
nt|tomi2: Max Ellerbeck did :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: I would. Maybe South is worried about @Hxxx but that wouldn't detour me in not doubling. By X-ing you get 3 suits across|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: So for those who missed it, Poland came in first in the girls series, followed by France and the Netherlands|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would consider a pass here, but thats the reason I am not playing there anymore... I am too old|pg||

nt|Jacki: Does someone in here need to be ungagged to comment?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: good one for your system talk: is 2NT natural here or does it show no preference...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The U26 Open category has a day off today, hence they don't have running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: south is now "endplayed" I think he should try some kind of 2NT bid and wait for something good to happen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for me 2NT is not natural in auctions where one opp opened and the other bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, then Nab will bid 3@D and will become declarer, thats the best that can happen to south :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: useful in these positions to play what you play over 2NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only one level higher|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: i have here the CC of the Swedish girls. when play slows down i will present a brief description|pg||
nt|rodal f: By normal defence it might was. 3NT are 1 down|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bazý ellerde vugraf operatörleri oynanan kartlarý yanlýþ girebiliyorlar ama sonradan düzeltiyorlar|pg||

nt|mdgraham: pull out the old blunderbuss and bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: dbl probably (I can doulbe one of the suits) |pg||
nt|mamos: NS lopk a little high already|pg||
nt|mamos: hi shirley|pg||
nt|mamos: realistically West has little choice but to sell out to this|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that easy to think game with E,,, I wouldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 3H =inv 5-5|pg||
nt|ozgull: açýk odadan anladýðýmýz gibi ingilizler 12-14 NT oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|kastan88: misfit on NS, possible that West will start doubling now|pg||
nt|kastan88: he was faster (West)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Simonsen is thinking|pg||
nt|andy_h: Very nice treatment of the 2NT bid in competition - showing 2 places to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a @H lead might end it anyway|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d alerted as Walsh i assume|pg||
nt|ronpa: No reason to do something else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here, of course, 3NT may be a club stop and running diamonds, so it is not so clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @C10 and a small spade from dummy?|pg||
nt|mamos: he'sd like to do something  but what ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can imagine S being especially unlucky, given his semi-wasted @S values|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I personally wouldn't have bid with N's hand. All it's going to do is that it may excited partner (when you don't really want to given the void in clubs). Given N has 3spadeds ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: (marking shortage with partner) then S may still re-open|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i wouldnt have doubled in N either... what if pd simply has 12 HCP and good 6-card @C, I dont want to be anywhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl of 3@S = dont lead that pd|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the question here is what happens at the 6 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: Decl can't handle the Jxxx with W|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes they play walsh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead in either major gives a trick|pg||
nt|ronpa: and 3NT from West seat is cold on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: Please let me know if you need to be ungagged|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so the way is free for quite some undertricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: X must be some game invitation|pg||

pc|cK|nt|kaapo: Sweden is tied on the 4th place and Latvia tied on the 7th|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will lead spades anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: this spot looks just fine|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: it says: 17+ 1@c with nebulous 1@D, 5card M's|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ozgull: ingiltere'de beginnerlara 1NT açýþý 12-14 tür diye gösterildiði için öyle tahmin ettim|pg||
nt|MolvaM: vugrafta daha sýk yer alabilmemiz için takýmýmýzýn klasmanda yükselmesi gerek|pg||
nt|yuval10: N did well to remove the 3NT, but 5@disn't likely to make either|pg||

nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice fit EW but no slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can watch Max Ellerbeck's nice defense to 3@S in the movie, he found the @C ruff in 2nd trick accorcing to their signaling methods and so they defeated 3@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the 9 showed the @C switch?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't really blame West for passing 2@C. Maybe East should have opened - his hand sure looked like an opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, time to wake up, jan|pg||
nt|elbec: manno and di franco play weak no trump "Nightmare" style|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N EW has play|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@C looks unlikely to stop EW bidding the game in a major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you are French, of course|pg||
mb|1S|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either: 12-14 bal OR natural 12+ OR 18+ any distr.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||

nt|sybarra: pass or correct?|pg||
nt|henryb: to respond or not to respond, that is the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting |pg||
nt|ronpa: nice agreement of 3@H to play, but only 8 trix because of bad @H break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like five rapid losers|pg||
nt|charles_l: what style is that?|pg||
nt|mamos: West has some problem now a very good hand opposite a double at this level|pg||

nt|tomi2: hmm was watching BBO TV and it looked like... sry|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Nab using Sabine's tactic: bid 2@D over 1@C whenever possible :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: West probabbly will do better confirming his spade fit some way|pg||

mb|3N|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bir þekilde karo üzerinden keycard sormayý denkleþtirmek iyi fikir olabilir|pg||
nt|ozgull: karo k pik as olsa mesala 13 hcp|pg||
nt|eerbil: Ingiliz takýmý zon durumuna göre deðiþken 1NT açýþý kullanýyor gibiler, uygun zon durumu 10-12 olsa gerek|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Latvia dont alert the 3-rd dbl:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what would 2NT after 2@S have been? |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2NT does not exist but must be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curiously, the scoring system seems to believe there hasn't been an exchange of IMPs yet in this match|pg||
nt|ronpa: 2@S also goes down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hi Charles1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||
nt|waso: yes|pg||
nt|waso: one of each|pg||
nt|wwalter: 3@h was a little optimistic :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: team style|pg||
nt|kaapo: A kibitzer has read in the bulletin, that NS would play strong club|pg||
nt|kastan88: interesting, how now EW will find their spades game, I would bid 2nd round 2@S with E hand, IMO showing 7...20 with 5-card @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hard decision 4 Mr. Lauks|pg||
nt|kastan88: now it is hard to West find good bid another than pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he will bid 4 sp?:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but 4@H only 3 down|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr even 2 down only|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi I'm Frank from Norway, Welcome also to Geir:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi Rodal & ty|pg||
nt|ritong: i think south would have bid if her LHO wasn t a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: like 1@d, then pass any bid|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming it is not a super forcing one:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: Burda 4NT briaz karýþýk gibi|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 5@C now... well, 3@S may even be better news|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H now? or what?|pg||
nt|frusco: sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North tell that South has four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure,  does that sound like @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE communicating in writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it all cues?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@S is cue, but does it SHOW or DENY @S control?:)|pg||
nt|frusco: 4@d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after the support |pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a head start for Sweden I see|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: OR playing 5@D by N|pg||

nt|Gerben42: so flat board... |pg||
nt|tomi2: they will not be the only ones in that slam... |pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2@S is nonforcing, what hand would West need for slam anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|pelu: and a ruff will deefeat|pg||
pc|h3|nt|charles_l: now S has no entry|pg||

nt|xenya: but you are right, Charles -- now it's easier|pg||

nt|rodal f: :) Ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4NT will be just a little exciting but safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not clear they get there|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has a very good cards so i guess he'll bid game|pg||
nt|ronpa: so 2@S went 2 off and first imps to turkey. and now comes a flat 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 580 or 980|pg||

nt|mdgraham: transfer break?|pg||
nt|othered1: with that opening, there's a chance to stay out, but still one high|pg||
nt|elbec: Di franco passed with an 11 HCPs count even with 2 aces (not following Bava's law). They're very serious about 1nt range (12-14)|pg||
nt|othered1: with rounded suit lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with bidding do you expect the k of @C with W?|pg||
nt|mamos: in fact it's a 5/7 hand I think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|poohbear: without an early @c play declarer can set up a pitch in the @d suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they get there|pg||
nt|syl: first big event for all4|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or jump|pg||
nt|mamos: so West's 2NT showed a Spade raise and North has cue-bid   - South  won't like his J high suit much|pg||

nt|mariner1: now to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club lead will solve a guess three|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|waso: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like some 2 way checkbac auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D seems to be a GF chec back or relay|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 2@D is artifical and gameforcing, says nothing about @D's|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well this seems bullet proof for NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT was in fact suggested by a kib|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can refil coffee 's |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, yeah|pg||
nt|poohbear: not exactly a nobrainer 6C could have been bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no brainer in 3 nt  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but you are right Barry |pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps. Should that be East's bid? |pg||
nt|tomi2: I like that range, it gives you room in other auctions because there your bids are either NF or GF, like 1@D - 1@S - 2@C - 3@S... you can set a force here without using 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: was that a joke Bas?|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, E spoiled that, now we have to settle for 660 and coffee|pg||
nt|ritong: bas retranscripts undirect infos|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean in NT|pg||
nt|pelu: only one lead can defeat: lead @H4!!! and u will have a trick on @HJ :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows where all the spots are|pg||
nt|mamos: but South wont be encouraged I think|pg||
nt|mamos: @SA doesnt seem to be a very valuable card (indeed it isnt)|pg||
nt|mariner1: lead helps some|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South goes for the four-carder, which doesn't give declarer anything he can't get anyway |pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 6S on a 4-3?- some relays bbefore 3NT I expect|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidb: should be a normal board|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the players must've heard him/her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Other room roads splitted at 2@C. There 2@D|pg||
nt|gh1: i think is dificult too bid 7 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep |pg||
nt|ronpa: I think they play 3@H shows min with 4@H's and 2NT shows the better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not many still play 3@h as maxi and 4 card fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe it s with 5 cards:)|pg||
nt|ritong: threatened with a @c ruff, declarer might go for the trumps and claim 9|pg||
nt|othered1: This should go quickly, if NS can run @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to set up K@D for a @S pitch....|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poohbear: need a @c lead or a @s lead and a @c shift|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the defense to prevail|pg||
nt|gracelin: usually it's played over a 1NT rebid, but here they extended to any rebid.|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he will support partnesr spades showing 4 card support and 12+hcp whil a direct jump to 4@S would indicate more shape and less high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: could beat it with a low H lead |pg||
nt|tomi2: spade bids below 4@S would have been invitational to slam after 2@D|pg||
nt|gracelin: but really tough under the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: but after south bid strong and his screenmate even thinks now ot go on maybe east should try some agressive lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: Any other lead will see 4S home|pg||
nt|tomi2: "they are thinking of taking more than 10 tricks and I must hold them to 9 - then I need some miracle"|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr. Simonsen does not appear to like passing just yet|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it's always the case when opponent bid to a game|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know if N/S are a long time partnership?|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably " i want @h lead"|pg||
nt|sten: and France is up to a good start|pg||
pc|dT|nt|syl: the pld rebid problem: 1@d-1@S-? 1444|pg||
nt|rodal f: E are asking in 4NT so exlution gone there|pg||
nt|gh1: stop in 6dia in open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think the better bidding is 3diam not 3 clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 6@D|pg||
nt|frusco: eheheh |pg||
nt|ritong: he is not at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: im trying to work out if 6@s can be made|pg||
nt|capercliff: I think it can on a squeeze|pg||
nt|charles_l: as a junior i played 1n=14-16, so i opened all 11s :)|pg||
nt|elbec: nice lead by andrea|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kör ataðýna zorlanýr mý?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not that I play it myself, but there's a decent case for playing these 2M jumps as invitational - in that if you have an invitational hand, you don't need to bid 1@S as, if the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: auction gets competitive, you may need to guess whether to still bid 3@S or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@d with the E hand, maxi, 4 card fit, doubleton @d|pg||
nt|frusco: the mouse is alive...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphztr: do U think they know abou diam fit?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: they will|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he reverse the @c play?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tomi2: maybe north took 4@S as some splinter bid for either hearts or dias or so? I am just suggesting|pg||
nt|gracelin: As thomas said, south will bid less spades after 2D if he has slam ambition|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'about'|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why don't E show the @D support?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: when?|pg||
nt|gh1: i think he bid 4dia now|pg||
nt|yuval10: that surely made declarer's work even easier|pg||
nt|mamos: North doesn't care|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H? |pg||
pc|hT|nt|waso: u teach bridge at schools?|pg||
nt|syl: *old|pg||
nt|syl: nope|pg||
nt|waso: only clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: do U think 3clubs is diam support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S only shot is for k of @C to be on side |pg||
nt|sybarra: but has to time getting to his hand carefully |pg||
nt|mamos: North has bid slam opposite a negative double right this time but a little adventurous perhaps :)  I'm getting old|pg||
nt|sybarra: what a result in the other room! |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: also k of  @D |pg||
nt|mamos: lol      |pg||
nt|mamos: well looking at North and South (if you were awake and alert) you might as well be in seven as six|pg||
nt|sybarra: and nice 7 since it makes |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not that I really want to be in it) |pg||
nt|h bertens: prefer 6@H, always make without a @D lead, looks good contract to me|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|davidb: same bidding same contract in OR|pg||
nt|ozgull: direkt 2NT birþeye tranfer olduðu için böyle yapmak zorunda olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 kör, 2 karo ve 1 trefl lövesi?|pg||
nt|eerbil: kör ataðý gelse de defans trefl lövesine yetiþemiyor|pg||
nt|gracelin: or north treated 4S as kick-back with Heart agreed ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: zatorski chose the safe way of just raising to 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Skjetne is surprised to have the tray returned back empty|pg||
nt|andy_h: One major downside of course, is that you prevent partner from describing the nature of their hand as 2M takes up a lot of room.|pg||
nt|capercliff: N cannot protect both @h and @c, but perhaps he is pitching after dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: sonuç olarak bu borddan kaybýmýz olmayacaðýný görmek iyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: oynayan kör as alýnca yerden karo oynayýp 10'lu empasý yapmasý gerek|pg||
nt|ozgull: en azýndan karoyu bilmesi lazým|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|tomi2: because partner did not reverse and they are plying together just this year because Wiankowskis Partner is too old for this event|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: has an awfully good hand opposite a strong JS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|poohbear: I prefer 3H|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: no deal|pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h ruff and claim|pg||
nt|mariner1: with a @H lead he can pull 2 trumps and lead @D..... has time to now pitch @S or @c|pg||

nt|gracelin: at least 13 imps|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will blame their coach for this kind of accident.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, but they should work on their system and this is one of the fragment you should have agreed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: which is why you dont play 2@S as GF :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|capercliff: 6@c as it happens has no chance at all|pg||

nt|sybarra: guilt??|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and hi cliff|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N was made on 3 in OR -- declarer played @DA, then small to the Q, dropping the Jack|pg||
nt|athene: double from south might turn this into a battle of the major suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can actually make 6 @H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|syl: entertaining 3@c...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she's not in red|pg||
nt|syl: INvul vs vul :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thx|pg||
nt|gh1: 3s can make here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: but I think shes very pretty:) and she likes hearts:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: or just fast?|pg||
nt|ronpa: yeah Padon-Tarnovski were never accused of slow play|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rayhaa: resting 4@s now|pg||
nt|mariner1: its both :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|poohbear: i am not sure what NT range NS are playing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anadolunun bazý bölgelerinde elde þikan yokken keycard sormadan þlem deklare eden oyuncularý kulübe almýyorlar|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah  its bridge! |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Who expects to go down 800 and gain 6 IMPs?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess the 2 first-round controls made it 1@S, with 6412 I would go 2@H|pg||
nt|mildredb: some really foul breaking suits |pg||
nt|andy_h: Bad breaks for whoever becomes declarer|pg||
nt|tomi2: wonder if South said "thank you partner" when his dummy came down in OR|pg||
nt|henryb: but lead said no stiff club, unless it was led -- and then he could not help it|pg||
nt|athene: and it's possible things might escalate|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ar5 the other room play 2@S now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At5|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!d+M|nt|kaapo: I think EW play 10-13 1NT when non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|kastan88: if partner has 2 diamond tricks, then this 2@S is down, if not, even @H ducking not better, just easy to count declarer's distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shitshappening:)|pg||
nt|gh1: Ax in H ig spade lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Near by 3NT but 2 are enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not necessarily a quality|pg||
nt|ronpa: I wonder if NS play transfers now|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh they do|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they do|pg||
nt|ronpa: so X = 4+ @H's while 1@H would show @S suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and also they are good players|pg||
nt|elbec: 3rd position light opening by andrea. 1@d shows 4+@d in an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mamos: it might be easy to bid 3NT here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|poohbear: 3@c is a " mixed raise " 6-8 points and 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gracelin: now south is stuck with no chance to ask for a club stopper|pg||
nt|tomi2: just bid 3NT and pray :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Brave young man will bid 3NT himself.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they dont know that yet|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be laughing in comparison perhaps |pg||
nt|sybarra: or over beers later |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Most likely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Mildred :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: similar here I'm afraid|pg||
nt|ronpa: Rdbl= @D honour|pg||
nt|ritong: now gazzilli|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm  -  Tournament Site|pg||
nt|gulyas: gazilli in action?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be Gazilli|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi Mikael|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure that is the right play though -- after 2 rounds of @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: They might stop at 3@H|pg||
nt|ort21: someone has the live results ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, NS are playing my system :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: good grand to bid|pg||
nt|henryb: and unlucky to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|syl: 4h-nice save|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bogen actually alerted 3@H, Johansen did not...|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to agree with pard whether this bid is asking or telling |pg||
nt|rodal f: A good try also in 3@SNS|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=11&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|Gerben42: only can E act ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I have been told there has been a revoke in OR|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c means " i have a good hand but no convenient bid"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so whats wrong with 2 @H|pg||
nt|ritong: strength|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a better hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: dinnertime for me - see you later guys|pg||
nt|sybarra: is X like a support dbl?|pg||
nt|h bertens: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: 11 daha çok iyi baþladýk|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or 4 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just forcing |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have not have time ro look ar rhe systems, Do E/W play 12-14 nt ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a sort of phantom save here in 4@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a doubble score for Nor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the weak jump poses a recurring problem for North- bid 3S with a 2S bid or pass and guess what to do when South reopens with a double|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so 4 IMP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well said Victor|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davidb: good lead .needs 10 only to be a good one better than Sp|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is braver and bid the higher contract|pg||
nt|kastan88: now @D shift?|pg||
nt|gh1: now a x and 3H:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: -1 looks very cheap|pg||
nt|tomi2: and after my p bids 3@S I would not say thank you partner as south!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@S was easy to Dbl, maybe a Dbl of 2@H would have been already correct|pg||
nt|ritong: and 3@h tends to show 5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H would not give credit to his 18 count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: allows a jump to 3@H to show 5/5 shape at least|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: And how do you bid a 14 HCP 5-4 @S-@C?|pg||
nt|capercliff: can anyone tell me what E/W are playing?|pg||
nt|capercliff: could be precision|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes, strong @c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3 imps to Russia on 4, for stopping one level lower|pg||
nt|elbec: enjoy your dinner charles.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Charles|pg||
nt|othered1: bye, Charles!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|poohbear: Game is decent but would go down unless declarer could ferret out the offside singleton King|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both major suits are nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|ort21: tx |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S should deny as many as three hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: S denied 3+ cards in @H i believe|pg||
nt|ritong: personnally i open 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: I wonder whether 4@d shows a void|pg||
nt|ritong: when east is short in @ds with a good hand, all his features necessarily work good, from west s point of view|pg||
nt|athene: you are right this is a part-score hand, but lots of part-score hands are played in 4@H or above, these days :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no dbl so might work|pg||
nt|charles_l: many methods - smolen etc to bid to 4@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the origin of the Curse is unknown, although the most popular explanation is that the orders for the Battle of Culloden were written on the @D9 |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_playing_card_nicknames Nine_higher_card|pg||
pc|d9|nt|poohbear: not impossible if he finds out about Souths honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: well whatever works in your system |pg||
nt|ritong: but i do not play gazzilli|pg||
nt|ritong: i play "ritong", modestly lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 @H to me does not promise 5 |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Di Franco looking rather agitated|pg||
nt|mdgraham: every convention has a price|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mildredb: i would play X of 3@D as penalty by west|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's a bit unclear whether E should act over (3@D)-P-(P)-   (I wouldn't) but now the 3@S makes it easier!|pg||
nt|yuval10: some may think that the bidding was switched, but it wasn't...|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have to give up something to gain something|pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as you and pard play same system |pg||
nt|ritong: give up on weak two is not such a big deal|pg||
nt|capercliff: it is im informed, with transfers usually|pg||
nt|ritong: it certainly doesn t henry|pg||
nt|henryb: it could, with 3@d showing a stiff|pg||
nt|ritong: good point|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: I am confident that my former junior partner would have bid 3nt, so I hope he is sitting south in his match :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but even if south declarered 3NT, West might cash CK then shift to HQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same two down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora has his head on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As soon as the @SJ came down Nab thanked :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think I would lead a club in this auction, trying to get "natural" tricks first|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as I said, I would dbl 2@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after that, the party starts :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: as EW play mini-NT |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is comfy - take a club ruff in dummy |pg||
nt|mikael_w: But even whith strong @c E:s hand sure look like a NT-opening |pg||
nt|elbec: nice contract by manno di franco|pg||
nt|h bertens: dbl...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kastan88: yeah, it is easy to say here, if we can see all hands, not easy to find right switch for West|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Good X, 4@S should go off a few|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so |pg||
nt|yuval10: and yet another disaster for Sweden in the OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should make nicely|pg||
nt|henryb: but no; 6@d showed the void|pg||
nt|henryb: I think a @s lead beats 7|pg||
nt|othered1: and not very aggressive bidding by west.|pg||
nt|elbec: EW could make 10 tricks in @h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: bidding was wierd in closed room.  North opened 2C and NS stopped in 4D.|pg||
nt|ritong: also, you can have multi 2@d and 2@c for any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is a good treatment to play 1M-1NT-2NT as forcing to game, with 54, or 6+ in your main suit, and jump shifts showing 55 and also GF|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 4 very unlucky for Dutch because even small slam would have gained imps at most matches|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem bu elden 11 kazanacaklarýný düþünmüyordur herhalde.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Don't agree with 4@S btw|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: I meant in ope room|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was for both majors weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: sinche they bid 3 suits and my partner also I think club is the one I can expect to get most|pg||
nt|ritong: o_0?|pg||
nt|henryb: 7@h surely|pg||
nt|henryb: this was well bid|pg||
nt|ritong: not dow<n yet|pg||
nt|henryb: operator; 7@d is a very unlikely bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|poohbear: South should try to conceal honors by winning the Ace of ! and returning the Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N bid 1H with 3 cards. Maybe is transfer for spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I lie:)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|poohbear: @cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: So there isn't much in the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: just ruff it!|pg||
nt|charles_l: potential loser in each suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: Stafie's pard opened the bidding and he has good hand with K of @S,   and will look for signal for entry |pg||
nt|tomi2: hope W will not play @SA|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes looks like it would qualify for a 14-16|pg||
nt|ritong: but if declarer tries to join his hand via @c J...|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if @H back might not have been more effective.  Now just play @D|pg||
nt|othered1: Take 8 tricks. losing only 3@S (regardless split) and two rounded|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra has left to procure drinks (barefooted)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: i'm not sure what was the 1@h overcall by N in the OR, a psych possible, over 1@c strong when P is passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: white lie. now relatively easy: @d ruff, @s, @d ruff @hQ, @sA, draw trumps and claim|pg||
nt|athene: both north and south are maximum for passing over 4@H, i think|pg||
nt|h bertens: this one also not very lucky, could go down 4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: sorry She |pg||
nt|rodal f: Home if J@C are to be found|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Tomi he played before :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it backfired big time|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kastan88: now @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: last week I pinned two singleton honors with my partners, I am expert in this :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Tough @HA underlead here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she is immediately joined at the water cooler by two male players :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: 7 diam was more interesting:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East had to win 1st diamond|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec said 5. It's right if 140 + 50 but 110 + 50 give 4IMP|pg||
nt|sten: the contract is safe now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 300 extra now :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yuval10: i think it was a psych,hence S's 2@h|pg||
nt|rayhaa: had to duck @d Q to have a chance for 11|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: Declarer has seen 12 points in south. If he sees the QJ of @h or if he sees no overuff in @ds then he prob gets it right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: On the previous 2 boards Russia scored 7 then 12|pg||
nt|gh1: and -1|pg||
nt|gulyas: gazilli fills another gap, where you are 16-18(19), and try to figure out what and how high to play (2@D usually shows 8+, and sets a GF)|pg||
nt|henryb: to explain the auction: 4N was "Roman key card blackwood", 5@c showed one or four of the 5 keys, 5@d asked about the @hQ, 6@d said "I've got that and a surprise in @d|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently W couldn't raise 1@H as that would show a strong hand, and he was reluctant to go the three level later |pg||
pc|d7|nt|poohbear: yes terrible holding in everysuit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: S should play another @H now|pg||

nt|mildredb: wow, no one has a void :)|pg||

nt|pelu: S could X - but she dont wont pd to bid |pg||
nt|charles_l: but +620?|pg||
nt|charles_l: np|pg||
nt|mamos: a sixth trick salvaged but 5 imps away|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a play and made 6 in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: I think 3@S was an overbid too, for that matter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW looks right here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: hi all, in from the Open|pg||
nt|waso: 5c  -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam time|pg||
nt|henryb: and only if South has them|pg||
nt|ritong: however, the "bad spiral" we talked about previously seems to get in place|pg||
nt|mariner1: must have been a @c lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: in fact S led Q@S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidb: great  grand ! but not easy to reach even 6 .perfect fit. void vs o points|pg||
nt|tomi2: watching the other results on hand 5 you see some could stop in 2@S or 3@D and did not get doubled, only 3@S and upwards got punished|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think nobody was going to double 3@D here too|pg||
nt|hedyg: bergen raise|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@C is 6-9 and 4@S's, and he has to be carefull|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they dont explain|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam is down on A@d and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only alert|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are right, only explain if asked|pg||
nt|ronpa: Bar might try 3@H now and padon will accept with 4@D, this might lead to slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi  wk in one major |pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h would be the best contract normally|pg||
nt|athene: yes, north can show diamonds but east will just bid quite a lot of spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S leads might cause a problem|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 4@H and 3N makes EW with a few correct guesses|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H and Q@S right, along with the Aces|pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: why -1|pg||
nt|waso: 6c|pg||
nt|waso: 6c -1   |pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry Bar is thinking not Cicek|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bar= Tarnovski|pg||
nt|arigun: @d lead will not be too difficult|pg||
nt|athene: and west will raise that to quite a lot more spades|pg||
nt|pelu: no 2@D (or 2@H) here from East = both majors - it a convention from Norway (Ekren)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: 6@D on board 3 has was bid 5 times out of 20|pg||
nt|poohbear: u mean 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think thats ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing same contract previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S thinking of a splinter?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 4@D - reckon that should show the ace|pg||
nt|ronpa: 4@D just says I accept invitation and have a good hand|pg||
nt|ronpa: he will bid 3@S with min and 4@S is medium hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a funky multi |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good defence is to play double as 13-15 approx or any 20+|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hand is really a bunch of junk |pg||
nt|mikael_w: 5@c seems to be a decent contract|pg||
nt|elbec: let's see what happens now? would the bidding finish?|pg||
nt|athene: normally a 5-5 shape is very powerful if you have a known fit|pg||
nt|athene: but here, east goes a little more cautiously|pg||
nt|athene: having the 1@H bid over him is very bad|pg||
nt|athene: it means, not only are the hearts useless as a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: but it will be hard to ruff them in dummy without getting over-ruffs|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess @S leads do not work either as N does not have enough entries to lead more|pg||
nt|mariner1: than 2 times|pg||
nt|mamos: will a club ruff scupper 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: not easy for defenders I think it will make|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on TOOLBAR|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: will see|pg||
nt|waso: i dont believe east will pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4H?|pg||
nt|waso: east will play the hand  5c  or 6c  |pg||
nt|syl: what about 5@C in 1. seat|pg||
nt|kaapo: *was bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: J@C was found? Adrian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: kind of Last Train, then|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ozturk woke up|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no diamond lead now...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit late for that, really|pg||
nt|ronpa: this hand is super maximum, also Q@H looks good after 3@H bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure @d lead still|pg||
nt|xenya: an awkward hand for natural methods|pg||
nt|charles_l: EW must find game here|pg||
nt|rayhaa: makes on @d finesse|pg||
nt|charles_l: @cA in S too|pg||
nt|mariner1: and then OPEN or CLOSED|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I believe Ruso should bid to define her hand once partner responds. I would bid 2@c'|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she bid 3diam|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not good|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5clubs in 1st seat|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe without the ace of diam|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 pairs collected 1100 defending against 2@HX|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally West @D was 32, so was difficult to East assume, that partner 2 is from doubleton, probably Jxx|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D shows 5+ cards (if bal 12-14) or 4+ unbal in their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then North can get into the act and SOuht won't have this guess as to whether to re-open or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: any gazilli experts in the audience? I was asked what you do with 5@S-4@C wk (my guess was 2@D showing either minor)|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contract have bad breaks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but whith this layout in @c it will be tough offcurse|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||
nt|mildredb: probably 7 back now|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep but ruff?|pg||
nt|ronpa: other table bid the slam and @D was led so chance for another big pickup for Israel|pg||
nt|ritong: poor sikora must be muttering some black polish just now|pg||
nt|henryb: At the other table the Norwegian pair managed to go 3 down in 6@h|pg||
nt|elbec: unusual or natural 2nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder what 2N is -- just natural?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: me too:)|pg||
nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney tahmin ediyorum þu anda çok moralliler|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D for me is an underbid but it works out well here|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N of course is rigid|pg||
nt|henryb: sorry, the dutch pair.|pg||
nt|ritong: we had translated:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe its a mistake or a lie from operator:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no alert for 2nt|pg||
nt|othered1: If east had extras, 3@H would be attractive here, but the double really didn't help EW|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is obviously a splinter raise|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphztr: but she lead a club|pg||
nt|syl: @d trap may avoided.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hanna gabor thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think she dont like 3sp bid|pg||
nt|syl: 3@H rebid would have been the simplest|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep she have right hand on the head|pg||
nt|yuval10: making 10 tricks in @s is a lot...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h looks like going down|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has to play @d after he wins the first @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: too many conventional bidding for Sweden ... I think...|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, "wk"?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, 12-14, say|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 11-14, I s'pose|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is probably not the first time W has played in his singleton trump suit in hand |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohh my, the result from OR will not be easy to match here|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck a @s and W is dead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N with W seems like it eats up a lot of room here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1 down looks the only result expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well W must not have realized the 2@S was a game try here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bazý çiftler kontrdan sonraki koz tutuþlarýný göstermek için transferli deklareler oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|eerbil: Arda'nýn kontrdan sonra eðer transfer oynuyorlarsa iyi kör yükseltmesi anlamýnda 2@d demesi daha iyi olurdu|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: aie|pg||
nt|syl: 5@C NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: with those weak spots, I would not be interested to penalize opponents in 2D, so would Cue 3D instead.|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, all tabes should find a slam here|pg||
nt|kaapo: North would now like to ask for aces outside of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully landing in a safe 4 @H now |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind, 4@CX lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry was my mistake:(|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 NT DBL|pg||
nt|athene: @HA or @CQ lead both set up marked finesses|pg||
nt|athene: either a normal club finesse or a ruffing heart finesse|pg||
mb|3N|nt|raghavan: Hello, I am Ragavan from chennai of India |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have bid 3N over the 2@S,,, showing my minor cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhtemelen arda ciçek bu konv oynamýyor|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: my partner will never play me for support and 3 aces, maybe he will even pass 2@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the best dession from N. Will cost some IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|capercliff: E will double this|pg||
nt|capercliff: and S might just pull to 5@c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, W is dead, nut not easy to find 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: so better not cash the @d K now, although i find it very difficult|pg||
nt|henryb: took a short break to watch the sprint finish of today's Tour stage|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure about their signals|pg||
nt|henryb: won again by Mark Cavendish|pg||
nt|elbec: meanwhile 11 more mps to italy thanks to 4@h made|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - quite descriptive though|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: srry 4 undo|pg||
nt|waso: now  4h   5c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let see.....|pg||
nt|ronpa: south did his part of the job now all up to north|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I wonder if W thought they were showing a constructive raise of 2@H and E missed|pg||
nt|mariner1: it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (refresh often)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told 2@C is EITHER 16+, or natural|pg||
nt|ritong: if you adopt 2M openings as showing M+@c, you have to give up on natural weak 2 or two suited 2M openings, that is clear|pg||
nt|athene: an amusing symmetrical position in the red suits|pg||
nt|athene: stiff Q, J109 opposite and a ruffing finesse potential|pg||
nt|athene: and findable too on the bidding|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the ruffing finesse in @H should be all he needs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, absolutely no problem coming to eleven tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 4sp?!|pg||
nt|ronpa: bar will play the 8|pg||
nt|othered1: This auction sounds like one you might double|pg||

pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: veya arda elini beðenmedi.  demek arda'ya daha iyi eller geliyormuþ|pg||
nt|eerbil: kuzey'in deklaresini anlamak gerçekten güç, 2.kontr ile zaten gücünü belirtmiþti|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet özgür bakanýn dediði gibi belki de 2@h = iyisi   dir|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|capercliff: note the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|ritong: no fun:)|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's bidding was not very convincing, to say the least|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I think west hand didn't merit action over 3@S.  Before that just tough.|pg||
nt|elbec: lead from the longest suit and 6 tricks arriving for the defence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: passsssssssssssssssssss   south |pg||
nt|sybarra: your hand didnt get any better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, South has a 13-count....but if you pass you will face this "re-open or not" guess every time|pg||
nt|ritong: 2M openings = M+@cs, medium|pg||
nt|capercliff: most would hammer away with 2,3, or even 4@s opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|othered1: But lucky for North, who had no guarantee @S weren't running with one loser, to find @C J in south|pg||
nt|elbec: but di franco need to duck with its king of heart|pg||
nt|mamos: wow Russia on fire in OR 4@S =|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: declarer can draw three rounds of trumps and take the ruffing finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and then south gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|athene: that's one possibility|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: How can he go on without a @S control?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: Tx|pg||
nt|waso: no idea whats 4sp   but im sure   it was the only bid to make east bid 6c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: anyway the Director Mr. Dumitrasciuc is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: called by Chaugny|pg||
nt|syl: maybe sort of answer|pg||
nt|waso: i've been told that 4c is  RKCB|pg||
nt|waso: so 4sp shows 2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep 4 spade was answer for aces:)|pg||
nt|waso: another 12 imps 4 France|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the director is still here|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might escape now|pg||
nt|ronpa: good try but not enough|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphztr: good lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4 hungary:)|pg||
nt|syl: pseudo endplay against N?|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed, and if south CJ were CK, we would miss a cold 6H|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no one (like pard) cued the @S |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: right click my name JOIN|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only one club|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S plays a @s though....|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s / @d defeat the contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: S must know that E has 2@c's|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4NT would not be a great idea, because if partner responds 1 key card, you cannot tell if it's the @SA or the @CK|pg||
nt|ritong: did ushovdt finish well?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: youthful exuberance? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Need to cover |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she's trying to catch something?|pg||
nt|gh1: was a strange x with AQJ in H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|prasenjit1: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: needs ace and spade to beat it |pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphztr: Heya Prasenjit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this works |pg||
nt|rayhaa: only challenge wld been a @s lead and @h 4-1|pg||
nt|mariner1: saving 6 @H for entry back to dummy after eliminating @D I think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|davidb: N do not have an easy bid . 5 can be overboard.|pg||
nt|ozgull: ingilizler de bir önceki maç irlanda yý yendiði için biraz rahatlýk var gibi:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: her 2 masada da ingilizlerin oynayýp batmasý iyi midir sayýn yorumcular?  :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: misspoke - probably 7 more for Germany|pg||
nt|elbec: nice duck|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: Declarer has to give a Spade and a Diamond |pg||
nt|kastan88: 1st push in this match|pg||
nt|othered1: I think declarer's now out for -1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: Welcome  Prasenjit|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did well, and now there's no entry for dummy's @s's|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can hold his losses to 2 @H and a @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when dummy has a singleton the defence usually signal with a suit preference - although its difficult when partner may nit have much length in the suit led|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: OR played 2@d, easier there|pg||
nt|capercliff: im surprised S decided to play 4@h actually|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it|pg||
nt|elbec: only if di franco cashes now ace of spades|pg||
nt|elbec: other wise ace of heart, diamond to the jack and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess if he ducks he can have later exit problems|pg||
nt|ort21: someone have live result?|pg||
nt|athene: now the clubs are blocked for the squeeze on south|pg||
nt|rayhaa: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1   Running scores|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs the ruffing finesse in diamonds for the 11th|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eerbil: 5 imp kadar iyi :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|gulyas: so you rebid 2@C with a wk 54, then bid 2@S over 2@D to show the wk hand type|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c ambiguous is gazzilli, and is the reason i moderately appreciate it, since it is not that easy to handle|pg||
nt|begse: can make by endplaying|pg||
nt|begse: he seems to be on the right way|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ruff 2 spades and diam|pg||
nt|henryb: tailed off; Tyler Farrat, the young American, finished second|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=17&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|ritong: so cav in green again, rite?|pg||
nt|henryb: yep, with I think about a 10 or 15 point margin|pg||
nt|charles_l: but 3x@d allows @s pitch before trum;ps drawn (i think)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome Mike Gold|pg||
pc|sA|nt|raghavan: will be 1 down|pg||
nt|charles_l: hi rag|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i would expect a bit more for 3@D, but that's just me...|pg||
nt|capercliff: south would have liked to play small from dummy there, but there are entry problems|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think S here shod have understand why W let E to be on the lead, big chanse he has void @d. E Dbl @d bid in the bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But if he plays @c now that trick might come back|pg||
pc|s7|nt|spaima: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=18&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|begse: cant now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mistake|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|capercliff: each undertrick doesnt cost that much as it happens, but declarer doesnt know that|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence|pg||
nt|elbec: yes|pg||
nt|elbec: this is what we call a razor stroke :) everything perfect by north|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: I think E expected the K of @S in dummy |pg||
nt|xenya: now W has to cash the high spades, then endplay N with a club for 1 off|pg||
nt|othered1: a lot easier had south found @CJ at trick 1, fairly clear after double, I'd think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphztr: nice play Ekaterina|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a 9er and 3 IMP for Russia|pg||
nt|othered1: but west may play north shorter in @S for the double|pg||

pc|sK|nt|raghavan: Hi Charles How are u?|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Fellus said: "scuza Giuseppe" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: for the 5 of diamond|pg||
nt|elbec: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: more imps to Italy as the Russians played 2N in OR -- as NS|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|nt|Gerben42: its true that @SA @DA makes 3NT, but almost all hands without @DA that would bid 3NT after 3@D make it quite a challenge|pg||

nt|mariner1: well done|pg||

nt|athene: north might have been better-off to play the @DA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS this time|pg||

nt|sybarra: nice club suits being dealt today |pg||
nt|andy_h: Conflicting factors now with N's hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this hand is tricky in 2/1, you have to decide if this is GF or inv. before seeing partners 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Positives: Good 5card suit, QT9 (good) support and a singleton.  Negatives: Singleton King and only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would bid some kind of systematic bid that does not allow my partner to pass before game is reached and try to show my hearts too|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you mean 2@H :)|pg||
nt|henryb: will tell you shortly|pg||
mb|1N!|an|forcing|nt|tomi2: so I start with 2@H and bid 4@S later|pg||
nt|yuval10: costs 2 imps.... +7 instead +9|pg||
nt|elbec: and third live place for Italy|pg||
nt|elbec: manno will show a balanced game forcing hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: do you dbl or 2@c with |pg||
nt|charles_l: N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: looks like some excitement|pg||
nt|raghavan: a slam hand - let us enjoy how they reach slam and make|pg||

nt|yuval10: 4@h is normal here but the breaks are really cruel|pg||

mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 4@S best NS spot|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont think this has been a -30 performance so far but the Russian NS in the oR having a fabulous set  will it last?|pg||

nt|athene: yes, that seems increasingly popular these days|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S must be playing a variable NT - South opened on a poor 11 not vulnerable|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gulyas: well, we know the basics|pg||
nt|mariner1: how does E take that DBL?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@C is Polish @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: only making game for n/s 4s tho 5dims can be let thru|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D probably showed H, and 2H confirmed 4-card support|pg||
nt|gracelin: With half his honors in opponents' suit, south better contend with 3H or a try|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S vuln from West, how many points in @S will put North into partner's hand?|pg||
nt|tomi2: now south solved noth's problem :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: will someone crack this one?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W can make 5@d here double dummy|pg||
nt|elbec: "Whist" bidding for manno|pg||
nt|charles_l: me too. i definitely prefer pd to lead @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: W maybe should bid 3@c over XX?|pg||

nt|ozgull: bu arada girls romanya ya karþý 30 - 5 önde|pg||
nt|rodal f: If N was active now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2NT could be GF also, seems like 4@S kills a lot of space|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, south has a decent hand if partner wants to investigate slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I think 2C may be either natural or a balanced GF|pg||
nt|kastan88: test time now: what is meaning of pass over 2@S doubled|pg||
nt|rayhaa: dont u want opps to pass out 3@h with south hand?|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes i would love them to|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well south having shown his spades first presumably this will be played in spades now|pg||
nt|eerbil: sanýrsam bu elden kaybedeceðiz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elde karo pozisyonu nedeni ile þlem sorunsuz|pg||
nt|begse: sanslý bi slem |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT too much if they open this light|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3NT and 3@D both can be defeated|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@D by S here silences W|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H was brave and the winning action although !nt is down on an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|sten: something strange happened in the declarer play in OR on board 5 ... he went down in 2 spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|begse: gitmemek hatta 5 e cýkmamak lazým|pg||
nt|syl: wrong sided so|pg||
nt|syl: may even fail|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1NT from Aurelie!!!:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Board 6 is at the moment recorded as round pass in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: a director asked to look at my movie and went to check|pg||
nt|kaapo: That shuold be fixed soon, when they actually play the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a diamond lead you can make it on cross-ruff, but it requires that you cash clubs first. So you need clubs to break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you play a second diamond like declarer did in the other room, South will pitch a club and you go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will play trumps after Q@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and then after 2nd @d S can ruff and play trumps again|pg||
nt|yuval10: will it matters?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@Hx was t/o, and the rest is automatic:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant argue with the bidding |pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, also missed the 4@S, tough hand to land right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 5@S can make too though|pg||
nt|lestergold: after 4d it wa surely correct fopr north to give preference to spades he had al reay bid the pips off a 6 card heart suit with poor intermediates|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure that is possible either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity for a swing here unless north 'corrects' to spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe 2 clubs is checkback|pg||
nt|kastan88: and that's it, if partner not having any points in spades, where are his 12 points for opening?, still could ask for aces, IMO|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Lauks and the two aces from his hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and he said: one down will be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should become a flat board by normal defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: and 4@h is very close as well with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually the same 11 tricks are available in both suits|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the problem is that in 4@h you have NO entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room S bid @S twice and they still did not get to 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: a spade lead, club shift and duck, will beat even 3H|pg||
nt|kastan88: here is clear, that NS  have not the same pinion about pass over 2@S doubled from South hand. But such situations need to agree exactly. showing this 1 stopper or half stopper or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: nothin in spades, or just minimum hand whatever, but agreement needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @c artificial game force huub? |pg||
nt|h bertens: yes|pg||
nt|h bertens: 2d any min not 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|charles_l: its pretty much 16+ with @c, what he has|pg||
nt|gracelin: This maximum defense is in fact a reasonable one|pg||
nt|kaapo: On this lead, EW could keep South out of his hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr for mistyping. opinion , not pinion :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps 4-1, he cannot get his @Ds good and enjoy them too|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, Hungarian schoolkids are running riot against France (41-0 so far), and leading the pack! Making me very proud:)|pg||
nt|ritong: are you coaching them, daniel?|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, just rooting for them:)|pg||
nt|ritong: oki:)|pg||
nt|charles_l: E should bid 1@h not XX, just in case it comes back at the 3/4@s level|pg||
nt|mamos: i'd expect this salm to be widely bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3 rds of clubs - then d then 4th club - North ruffs high and declrer pitches spade -|pg||
pc|hA|nt|charles_l: (assuming polish @c)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Not much excitement - only they have not reached a makeable C slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a none @c lead allows a make|pg||
nt|mariner1: non|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Jones ha to find the killing club lead |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s will not fare well\|pg||
nt|kaapo: But @Hs are splitting, too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C looks like conventional stayman|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H shows @S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphztr: interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: play the @dK from hand is a little to much double dummy I think|pg||
nt|athene: Smolen over 2NT is something you lose if you play puppet|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass??|pg||
nt|athene: but it is quite valuable|pg||
nt|pelu: ????|pg||
nt|mariner1: surely S did not pass|pg||
nt|mamos: slam even|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he has|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with that lead not much declarer can do to avoid going 2 off|pg||
nt|poohbear: Best to win in Dummy and play a @c to try to negotiate a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: alternatively if you trust the lead you can draw trumps and if 3-2 play for 4 @d tricks and then lead a @c off dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Brian Senior is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: making pictures|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a jr event!|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a senior moment :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might gain some IMPs again for Russia. @H lead? Seemed normal for me!|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room in 3@H which is also a tough contract|pg||
nt|charles_l: XX to me shows defending interest|pg||
nt|sybarra: finding the @D cards is the difficulty |pg||
nt|h bertens: more chance on a natural auction|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: i guess not, as you take 6@h, 3@c, 1@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Frome half trouble til 9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: well all the other uits have been bid naturally|pg||
nt|lestergold: falase card will not fool ed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 2NT cannot be a "good GF"|pg||
nt|yuval10: S would've done better to let N takes the trick and play Q@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra is thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: take in dummy, @c to J, ruff @s....etc|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: is not easy...|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing is...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: aha :)|pg||
nt|pelu: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so also |pg||
nt|h bertens: 1@S, 2@D is a good start|pg||

nt|mariner1: np :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this got a bit too complicated maybe |pg||
nt|h bertens: France also down by 32 against Norway|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: keycard soran adam, eðer eksik yoksa þlemi söylemeli bence|pg||
nt|syl: @H" can mislead pd|pg||
nt|gracelin: the duck is the more difficult part|pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer is safe|pg||
nt|tomi2: taking the ace and then thinking about the situation is not the best solution|pg||
nt|tomi2: he actually does not need much more then norths hand to have a good @D slam for example|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed. but North has a very lucky hand for South: sixth club, heart help and the @dQJ to help get the ninth trick|pg||
pc|h5|nt|begse: ama nezaman soracagýnýda bilmeli)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet :) cümlenin devamýnda da ..... ya da hiç sormamalý demeliydim herhalde|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: so apush|pg||
nt|syl: *2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Funfact, one of the Dutch girls players is also a member of our U21 team. However, obviously she's not playing now :)|pg||
nt|athene: this will play quite nicely, even though the black-suit breaks look nasty at first|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 - 1 @S are a problem however has play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|waso: so hungary missed a 12 imp chance|pg||
nt|syl: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Wonder why he didn't play @HQ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Kibs saying @HK and then the J shows the Q, but Sikora isn't so sure, he's held the @S2 two times already|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, but in @h you are likely to get a @d lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|davidb: needs a H to defeat it |pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess just in this moment Nawrocki realizes that he made a mistake|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good defence?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 down... I think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gh1: must ruff with a or q no fore -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to the hungarian kids,  I think they have been stars so far |pg||
pc|s5|nt|tomi2: same in Germany|pg||
nt|tomi2: Marie Eggeling will join the Schools team tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: not cleasr how he can make it -- possibly 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: That @S loser is probably the second setting trick|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can come to ten or eleven tricks in various ways i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: why was 2 @D not an option by N? |pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: 3@H should be -1 but might make|pg||
nt|arigun: 3@h is too much to me if 3@d is not forcing|pg||
nt|ronpa: now he has to find the club shift|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is also afraid of thinking before ducking to expose his CA and create tempo problem when partner get in later.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|raghavan: Hello Anita - can u enkighten us as to what system they are playing here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: neyse. giden 13 imp|pg||
nt|ritong: better play a trump now|pg||
nt|capercliff: and N can get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the tournament actually has new leaders|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: @d obv gives it  when a @c allows a cross ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: probably his problem was " a trump, ok, but which one"|pg||
nt|h bertens: i dont know to be honest|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: after 1 @s everything was too much for me|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: I like this boys|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H here is a @S transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: S wondering where all the bidding is coming from|pg||
nt|athene: there are so many transfers used these days i think any regular partnership needs some generic agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: a trump lead here is best vs @H|pg||
nt|eerbil: açanýn karo kontrolü olmadýðýný ve dengeli eli olduðunu bilirken iyi bir þlem deðil bence|pg||
nt|gh1: or spade J|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR i guess natural 1NT opening and all pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: a different story here though|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Less than an IMP per board is little by U26 standards :)|pg||
nt|athene: the basic thing you have to discuss is:-|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6@s is 50%|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: clubs lie badly too many losers in the black s in east's hand to be dealt with bearing in mind a 3/1 rump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am glad to see people can still double for penalty, eapecially by the youth.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt =weak with both minors |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not a very useful convention in my opinion|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some 700 I belive Adrian|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not exactly muiderberg|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H is both majors weak for our pair too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT is probably a maximum with @D as sidesuit|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2@C shows @H and another suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South wants to double, you can feel it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *an IMP|pg||
nt|athene: if you double a transfer is it showing the suit bid, or is it t/o of the promised suit?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mikael Westerlund|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: E  does not like XXX in Spades ..|pg||
nt|lestergold: and over ruff threats in dims|pg||
nt|poohbear: another competitive battle at the game level here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, is South's double for penalty?|pg||
nt|elbec: aggressive bidding by di franco|pg||
nt|mariner1: everyone in auction should be a warning to everyone :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 7+ hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the modern style is 3H on East but maybe I am out of touch|pg||
mb|4C|nt|charles_l: normal to be in 4@h down here|pg||
nt|charles_l: esp at imps|pg||
nt|raghavan: If they do not cash D - 4H makes = 1 Spade loser+1H+1D( 1 Diamond goes in Clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they should be warned about the breaks now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: goodness, 5@c |pg||
nt|ronpa: east wants to X 5@C|pg||
nt|capercliff: do well to stay low here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. is south's double here hearts, or t/o of spades?|pg||
nt|athene: of course, these two meanings overlap to an extent|pg||
nt|athene: but it's important to discuss them i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: now we see if S believes everyone|pg||

nt|kastan88: still correct was to use somewhere blackwood type bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr:   NT = pass or correct|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: only pass possible response... 3NT wont have problems|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to E, 3NT showed a 4-card, however, I could not deduct which|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohoh!|pg||
nt|othered1: north bids 3@H and south passes?|pg||
nt|elbec: after inital pass...|pg||
nt|othered1: That feels like a deep view, even with possible @S duplication|pg||
nt|elbec: he is probabli thinking that they could have mirror like hands|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's right on this hand|pg||
nt|xenya: well he can't quite raise to 4@H after N's initial pass?|pg||
nt|rayhaa: will bid it too|pg||
nt|mamos: yes artificial responses dont seem to have worked well here  - old fogey rule ok |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes can they stop now?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: getting to 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D was natural, most of the time with 5 cards|pg||
nt|kaapo: I like to play that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: has its moments  |pg||
nt|tomi2: If there are any kids (below 18 years) watching this vugraph, I must warn you not to watch open room's auction and play in the next board|pg||
nt|Gerben42: helpful lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: can make 5@H 5@S 3@D now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had 1 chance to beat it, which was pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice table!!!|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h is par|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: the question if 3H shows shape as well or can be x H |pg||
nt|ronpa: he still didnt make it, he has to play very carefully|pg||
nt|hedyg: why double? for 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|ritong: starting with @c A, u never know|pg||
nt|henryb: Hushovd finished 5th|pg||
nt|athene: one school of thought says that you have a convenient cue-bid available as a t/o double, so X should just show the suit bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a good game for Norway- both players werevery conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: Yes, maybe difficult for w to play a @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E not happy with partner's bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open  east bid 5h in front of partner against 5dims partner may have found a different action|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Leaders|pg||
nt|poohbear: once again we see Ruso fail to bid at a cheap level|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear this Dbl will excite partner enuff|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mostly to expose psychs like this 1@S by Arvidsson|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: expose he did. find the right level he didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it with a european pard |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This is going to be bloody|pg||
nt|arigun: possible to make 5@c |pg||
nt|ritong: nice spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Houston we have landed |pg||
nt|xenya: but he can!|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Not much of a hesitation there|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: The final bid optimum and correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the bidding and lead best to set up dims after trumps dawn|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks easy on that route|pg||
nt|MolvaM: deklaran yeri görünce pik vale sorunum var diye düþünecek ama biz biliyoruz ki sorunu yok :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, need to duck the spade opening lead and made some good guessing later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont understand one club opeing for Latvia|pg||
nt|athene: right; but not everyone plays this way |pg||
nt|mariner1: can he make this?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E needs to lead a @H|pg||
nt|athene: for example lauria-versace play (1NT) pass (2@H) X = t/o of spades, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H looks like a law violation to me|pg||
nt|athene: bidding 3 over 3 with only 8-card fits around|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: this should give England  about 11 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: no should have the timing|pg||
nt|mariner1: now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north ducking wont help him|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know why E doesnt bid it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmmmm bu da ilginç|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the quality for Romania have raised well the last years, as Bulgaria. Romania nr. 5 in Beijing open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes and I think we do a great job here at Brasov:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a Flaw violation :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and? - the Law is 50-60% so..|pg||
nt|athene: and south has a pretty defensive hand quite apart from only having five hearts|pg||
nt|athene: stiff diamond, slow black cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Suggestion of Total Tricks? :)|pg||
nt|athene: The Guideline of Total Tricks :)|pg||
nt|pelu: a free 2@H by pd - S dont know that N only have 3 small @Hs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it wld have sold as well with that title|pg||
nt|athene: well, this comes back to the point i was suggesting earlier|pg||
nt|athene: if south's double showed real hearts (i.e. 5+) then north's 2@H is quite likely to be only three|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphztr: 6 clubs with double finn on hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get ugly |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Indeed - no guarantee of a diamond trick|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly needs @s 2/2 or @h Kx, a rather good proposition|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to lukasz brede|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: in comp with concentrated honors her hand is not a sub minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 3H:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe checking to see if W has 6 @ss|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Dummy walked away (wisely)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Henri|pg||
nt|Gerben42: note that on a @C lead, @CAK, south will be squeezed in the red suits to make 11|pg||
nt|ronpa: Other table playing 5@C undbled|pg||
nt|ronpa: he doesnt know that West had only 7 diamonds for his opening, it will take a big effort to make this hand|pg||
nt|lokaty: hello everyone|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|poohbear: but still a victory for Russia since 4@s is touch and go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 15 sene kadar önce bu tür ataklar yapmayý seven bir parterim vardý.... hala var  :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar agresif bir atak için bir sebep göremiyorum bu elde|pg||
nt|kastan88: EW using I aasume polish Club based system, tho 1@C is 11...14 bal or all hands 18+|pg||
nt|kastan88: 'assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to the EW cc, 2@S is indeed a 5+M4+m|pg||
pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: açýktan 3 imp verip ataðý geri almak mümkün olabilmeli bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was forcing with clubs, since he is GF he chose to show clubs instead of hearts to establish the force|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they were in a forcing situation and double by Sikora is a suggestion to play there|pg||
nt|gracelin: I like that|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like -2 here|pg||
nt|capercliff: both tables opened 1N, not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|capercliff: i'm assuming they are playing 12-?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this will work out fine and give 5 IMP back to the swedes, brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: death by aces now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: hiya buddy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi luke :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Lukasz :)|pg||
nt|ritong: c mon, piotr, 4/0 breaks occur:)|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed. thats about the fifth time I have seen that combination misplayed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphztr: signals?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, sikora thought about it in his grand|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is a bit on the greedy side i think|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but it doesn't figure to be redoubled with those trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: switch to clubs...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 14-16|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H now?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: bad return the club|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence are throwing tricks at declarer likethey were growing on terees|pg||
nt|lestergold: trees|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are gona play for the Iasi tean in ure 1. div the comming season. So see u there Adrian|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good 4 you|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Lukasz|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ronpa: now to make he has to play low club and finnesse to ruff last diamond with the @C ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|elbec: queen of diamonds was almost impossible|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the @DQ would have been nice -- for the defence|pg||
nt|elbec: really strange switch|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|nt|vugraphztr: I'd like to bet that W has no clue his partner started with @HAK9xxx|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6/8 @d will enable the contract to make|pg||
nt|ronpa: has to find a way to reduce his trumps in hand for coup|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he must take hi's spades now|pg||
nt|hedyg: still has a @D loser|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think he has to play his @H before to ruff some in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: take spades ruff diam with the ace and 7 of club|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is -1|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes thats the winning line|pg||
nt|ronpa: no thas made|pg||
nt|hedyg: will lose 1@H and 1@c that way|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to ruff both the spade and the Diam in dummy to make|pg||
nt|ronpa: why lose club? he will endplay him with @H for the last 2 tricks in club|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|poohbear: nope|pg||
nt|poohbear: trumps not short enuff|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh true he still has @H to exit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will have a heart exit|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Barry, welcome|pg||
nt|ronpa: true|pg||
nt|poohbear: hi|pg||
nt|ronpa: should play J@H now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer essentially needs to crossruff|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room played very well and went 1 down, didnt guess clubs were 4-0 (wasnt dbled)|pg||
nt|ronpa: so lets see if this will turn to be 2 imps to Israel or 11 to turkey|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double here was a bit greedy|pg||
nt|ronpa: we will discuss that after the hand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is considering all options|pg||
nt|hedyg: that takes a while|pg||
nt|capercliff: oh i've been corrected, EAST opened 1N in the open room|pg||
mc|12|nt|hedyg: 8 cards in @c, only 7 in @s, so playing on @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Grosset is thinking........|pg||
nt|xenya: now it makes easily|pg||
pg||
