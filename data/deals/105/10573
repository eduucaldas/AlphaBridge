nt|karlson: a good game here that n-s stayed out of at the other table. no chance of that after strong @C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|karlson: i think they play this promises 4-5|pg||
nt|othered1: NS use Precisionish methods, but not classic Precision responses|pg||

nt|othered1: South preempts with 1N here, too.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|othered1: south trying to preempt with a strong NT opening?|pg||
nt|othered1: north is going through stayman to raise to 2N, I'd guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|karlson: i would open 1n too i admit|pg||
nt|othered1: 4th best lead (or interior honor) will do nicely here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Mayefl put down his 1 nt card |pg||
nt|othered1: The Lall team certainly tries to bid virtually everything up|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|karlson: immediate 2n would have shown diamonds, so north invites through stayman|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Not that much. Only 2N v 3N.|pg||
nt|karlson: mayefsky wasn't happy about ending up in 2 opposite 15-17|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|keylime: and may gain three imps for it too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kfay: Victor what do you know about the tendency for these two to open 1@d on 2245 shape?  Has it ever happened?  I imagine with the proper range opening 1NT is the least of evils if ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|karlson: he can't know about the last few ridiculous results in other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: actually, 2@D can't be stopped|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: Lee writing a lot, she kept her bid at pass |pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: just bid |pg||
nt|othered1: Pass would be forcing in my partnerships as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|keylime: it would be at least a probe|pg||
mb|p|nt|karlson: seems like a bad time to risk it unless you're absolutely sure it's forcing, since you know you have a spade fit|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|keylime: and I would tend to agree with that, even if 3@d was some sort of NT probe, a double and then raise of 3@s would get the same meaning across.|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N east looks pretty good and 6@H could be damaged by @C lead.  Will south double if they get to 6@H?  and will that make east run?|pg||
nt|karlson: i'm sure that should be forcing, not saying i disagree with it though|pg||
nt|karlson: 5h rather strange. wonder if they have some special agreement|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@H is an interesting call.  I guess their standards for 3@H could include a really garbagy suit and he's giving west an out.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Bittner thinking.....|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: If west accepts, east will have judged correctly, at least in theory.|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: On the ohter hand, as Joey Silver points out, many play this as preemptive.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|othered1: Wonder what west thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|othered1: will south hit?|pg||
