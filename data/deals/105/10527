nt|lestergold: hi UK Mike 2 here |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S from west, i assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi roland Bill Mike1 and David and specs et al|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: you might even do that in first seat, never mind third|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|BARON |nt|athene: 2@H = a good 2@S bid (i.e. a hand Terence Reese would have bid 2@S on)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Double will do from South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H=good raise to 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: direct 2@S = a hand with three spades Terence Reese would have passed on|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: most people would play that west's 2@S over the double is his weakest action|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: passing would be stronger|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2NT scramble now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS can now choose the spot they will go down in.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ophir's second double usually denies four hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|athene: major-suit undertricks are a higher class of undertrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w aggressive bidding here paid off|pg||
nt|jtr: North seems to have taken the double as showing more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it's interesting whether south's double of 2@H is hearts, or responsive X of spades|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why it should|pg||
nt|athene: the more people use aggressive artificial fit-showing bids, the more you are faced with this issue|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: it's his last chance to show hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless he wants to bid them at the three-level|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jtr: The @c9 wont help|pg||
nt|lestergold: without the west opener n/s may have played quietly in a no trump making|pg||
nt|athene: would west lead @c3 from @C1073?|pg||
nt|jtr: Why would declarer duck?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer wld be unlikely to duck with stiff|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: perhaps his best chance is to pretend he has a doubleton|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: but that would only be possible if west lead low from doubleton|pg||

nt|rhelle:  strong @c from West|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jtr: Slammish|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C here if you really want it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7c makes as cards lie but 6c a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|athene: yes 7 with @DK and @SQ onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: A Roland 7@C|pg||
nt|athene: they might very likely power into 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for jolly old Roland|pg||
nt|athene: finding a big club fit and lots of control cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: They haven't found a club fit yet - 1@C was strong club |pg||
nt|jtr: Well, given that 6 might fail, 7 is not so unreasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: y|pg||
nt|athene: now even if west bids 3nt, east is going on|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D = clubs, presumably?|pg||
nt|jtr: What else?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  yes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rhelle:  and GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play Tarzan Precision|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: well done by Wijs :) most people don't consider mere 5-card support for a minor enough to go past 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@S made on board 2, so "only" 3 imps|pg||
nt|jtr: Most specs have noticed a loser on loser play in 6@c by letting North hold the @hK after you lead the Q|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: strip the black suits, ruff @H, then @HQ throwing @D works just fine|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|jtr: And if North doesnt cover?:)  Or doesnt have the k even|pg||
nt|athene: of course, when you play something like that, you really want the @SQ and @DK to be wrong|pg||
nt|athene: as they are in the textbooks :)|pg||
nt|jtr: I prefer to be in 7 where there are no mind games:)|pg||
nt|athene: even if north doesn't cover, it doesn't hurt to throw the @D|pg||
nt|jtr: Loses nothing true|pg||
nt|rhelle:  East still hasn't passed yet ... |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|athene: you still have the 74% chance of @DK or @HK being right|pg||
nt|athene: although you might say that if north plays low on @HQ, he is less likely to have @HK|pg||
nt|rhelle:  it seems the other room in in 7@cs|pg||
nt|athene: but he can surely see elimination staring him in the face|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow!|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but they are still bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4NT must have been some kind of "rolling" bid rather than Blackwood|pg||
nt|jtr: May not lead a @h anyway |pg||
nt|jtr: 1N - 3@H - 6@C! - 7@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Next door|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that would be sick for Holland ... to suffer a grand slam on two fineses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, as David says, there's really only one way to play 7@C |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 4nt is turbo? do they play that?|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case, 7 might still be cold, so west should have continued to explore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: CC says 1430|pg||
nt|jtr: Apparently South bid 6@h|pg||
nt|athene: turbo 4nt = 2 keycards|pg||
nt|jtr: I have just shot my messenger|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think West jumped to 6@c to show a minimum for his 1@c opening|pg||
nt|rhelle:  with good clubs and controls|pg||
nt|athene: sorry yes Turbo 4NT in general shows even number of keycards|pg||
nt|athene: but here it has to be 2 really|pg||
nt|jtr: I think 6@c asks partner to bid 7@c if both finesses are working:)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  still the bidding in the other room is not finished ... they have doubled 7@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then someone had better bid 7@H |pg||
nt|rhelle:  so they may run to 7NT, which only has 12 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they go 7nt|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: afraid of a diamond ruff on the lead or something|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 7@c is slightly better than 2 finesses|pg||
nt|jtr: If South as the @sQ and 5@ds or North has Qx@s|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks specs  7@c has been doubled|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: west will eliminate and throw north in with the q heartsb at some point|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess by South who thinks @c97 is a trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder why - neither the North or South hand looks like a penalty double of 7@C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: I like to hold the ace of trumps to double grand slams|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it's a psychic lightner|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: trying to induce 7NT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: told showed no defensive trick|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: ah right non-penalty doubles|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he can also ruff out @hs and throw North in with the @sQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: Close to one in Klabberjass|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: and I suspect that no defensive tricks is precisely what they will make |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cJ|pc|s4|nt|athene: basically, if you have found a fit and a sacrifice is viable, and opps bid a slam|pg||
nt|jtr: Taking the marked line|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: the idea is you can use double to find out whether to sacrifice|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|rhelle:  well played|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo came up with the idea, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: there are several variations|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: the players here will not expect a swing on that one|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: the person in the direct seat doubles with 2 tricks to stop his pd saccing|pg||
nt|athene: and passes with 0 or 1|pg||
nt|athene: then in passout seat, after pass|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: the defender PASSES with 2 tricks|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: and doubles with exactly one|pg||
nt|athene: then his pd saves with zero and passes with one|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|athene: but of course this only works if you know what a defensive trick is|pg||
nt|athene: which you never do in these auctions|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle:  West will pass this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there are also tempo considerations|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: 2 off is good bridge|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 2NT shows longer @cs?|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle:  hmmmm - in this sequence, East is rated to have longer @cs than @ds|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in the orginal system, 2NT shows exactly 4@c and longer @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: ah|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@D only three cards if 4135|pg||
nt|athene: some might open a strong club with that east hand|pg||
nt|athene: but Muller doesn't think @HQ is worth 2 HCP i suppose|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, but the singleton @hQ is ugly|pg||
nt|jtr: It might be:)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, not trivial for declarer here|pg||
nt|athene: *for north here|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will become pretty if north ducks this|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer has @HQx, you give a trick away to play @HA, maybe|pg||
nt|rhelle:  there is a system bid later after 1@c - 1@d to show 16-18 witht he minors - but he clearly didn't fancy that|pg||
nt|jtr: Assuming declarer has a useful discard and an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Both of which are unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
nt|athene: the only use for @HK would be as a pitch for a spade|pg||
nt|athene: but there's no fast dummy entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north appears to be tanking|pg||
nt|athene: so you can surely win @HA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C-1@D-2@S, 5/5 minors |pg||
nt|athene: and if east follows low, you can switch to a spade anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle:  nope, 3@c actually :)|pg||
nt|athene: he can't win @SAx and get his spade away on the @HK because no entry|pg||
nt|jtr: North is maybe asking about the bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: And it takes a while to translate Hebrew into Dutch|pg||
nt|jtr: They write in different directions for a start|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: well, 7@Cx has made.  |pg||
nt|lestergold: the 6c/7c gesheft levelled it out i expect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS next door will know that that is NOT good|pg||
nt|rhelle:  from a Dutch perspective, this is just incredible ... to lose 14 IMPS on a 25% grand slam, when otherwise you'd win 18 or so|pg||
nt|rhelle:  32 IMP swing ...|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky - you make 6@C on an elegant loser-on-loser elimination and lose 14 to the finesses in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: itis very unlucky for the dutch|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, the double evened up the odds a bit|pg||

nt|jtr: Yes, 1@c pass 1@s maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that makes sense|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west cuing the club for michales i assume|pg||
nt|jtr: Eria?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have excellent save in spades against infrangible 5C|pg||
nt|jtr: Eugino sorry|pg||
nt|jtr: Eugenio|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: north wants to bid 3@C now if it's weak, but he certainly can't otherwise|pg||
nt|lestergold: i will be surprised if par is achieved on this hand|pg||
nt|athene: so 3NT is very understandable there|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we are getting the correct auction now|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@S is very wet|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt won't be a success|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|athene: the modern tendency on opening lead is to try to lead the unexpected suit|pg||
nt|rhelle:  will West find the @h lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is bonkers when west has announced hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you have 4-card support and some shape (and Qxx in pd's other suit)|pg||
mb|2S|an|5S COULD HAV 4H INV HAND|nt|athene: well, he hopes his partner has a heart stop|pg||
nt|athene: not that unreasonable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of messages about the bidding - it is highly likely that North opened 1@C, and 1@s was either diamonds or no major |pg||
nt|lestergold: operator could we please have correct auction confirmed|pg||
nt|jtr: He will lead a @h of course|pg||
nt|rhelle:  whether West leads a low or high @h, this won't make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: south is playing partner for a perfect hand here - and he (as ever) hasn't got it|pg||
nt|lestergold: and u and bill are not likely to suffer from commenattor's curse on this one!|pg||
nt|rhelle:  lol|pg||
nt|athene: one interesting general issue of bidding here is:-|pg||
nt|athene: if opps have shown two suits|pg||
nt|athene: does your cue-bid ASK or SHOW a stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: there are exactly two ways to play it|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you play the same as pd, you are ok|pg||
nt|jtr: With 2 open suits it shows|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is generally a good principle :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i think that's the norm|pg||
nt|athene: but it does bite people on the ankle with monotonous regularity|pg||
nt|athene: because it's the opposite way round from when opps only have ONE suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely the principle is that west has effectively bid hearts and spades so south bidding 3h now should ask for a heart stop|pg||
nt|rhelle:  true|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, most people play that as showing a @h stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not they should have a clear agreement as to howto ask for or show a stop in one of them |pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 3@s would show a @s stop, and ask for a @h|pg||
nt|rhelle:  here of course he wants to right-side the contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: it should be a matter that an experienced partnership has resolved|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hence the 3NT bid, rather than 3@s|pg||
nt|jtr: It is clear enough that with 2 missing suits you show the stop but equally clear the other way i guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: both ways are logical|pg||
nt|lestergold: as long as u have an agrement|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n is not correct are we all agreed on that?|pg||
nt|jtr: I prefer to make partner guess, it is more exciting:)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm with you, dude|pg||
nt|rhelle:  let the basta..rd work for his money|pg||
nt|jtr: John Matheson points out that 3@s may wrongside 3NT|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that's what I said 5 mins ago :)|pg||
nt|athene: true, but if south shows his stop and north bids 3nt, that wrongsides it at least as much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would have thought that 3NT here was a definite statement ...of course it may be East thinking |pg||
nt|jtr: Blame him!|pg||
nt|athene: south has a positional stopper under the 5-card spade suit|pg||
nt|athene: i think that usually, south wants to declarer|pg||
nt|athene: *to declare|pg||
nt|jtr: East may well be thinking of saving|pg||
nt|athene: north might have a non-positional stopper or the suit might block anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East may be thinking of saving|pg||
nt|mdgraham: right vulnerability|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is what may be happening at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jtr: Possibly some doubt about 2@c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree a bit of a barrage needed at these colours|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the thing about first 2@s is that it changes the tempo of the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: now is correct|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty Eugenio|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and so bidding 5@c is not at all obvious to North anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: after all this a push?|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely South can encourage 5@c by passing?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: but he hasnt|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: asking moment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but he hasn't supported clubs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  if East preempts straight away, the momentum of the bidding may carry NS to game|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe that encourages 4NT though|pg||
nt|jtr: East thinking again?:)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so I think that Muller may have doen this very cleverly ...|pg||
nt|athene: with @SAx rather than @SKx i think south would be much more inclined to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has two bullets for defence and no reason to think that game above the level of 4s is makeable now|pg||
nt|jtr: True Bill|pg||
nt|athene: with his major-suit holdings, i don't think he wants to venture the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: although to an extent he is bidding his partner's hand for him by doubling, i wld say|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: or perhaps they play inverted doubles of course in this position?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  that is true ... pass must surely be foring|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I was a young man when this hand started|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: and X invites pd to go on, and pass asks for a X?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: oh, this will be expensive|pg||
