nt|sybarra: may not lead a sp with E bidding them |pg||
nt|sybarra: so @C lead |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'd probably lead a @D, for I don't want to lead into decl's suit, not trumps and not away from Kxxxx|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good play by Rusch here, draw trumps when they have the balance of power|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Good morning Victor|pg||

nt|MolvaM: levent özgül hoþgeldin|pg||

nt|Gerben42: best to just keep at playing @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: E/W are both newcommers to international youth Bridge, I guess they are first time on Vugraph - so let's hope they will do fine... I am sure!|pg||
nt|andy_h: Usually in these types of auctions where 1 person has shown 2 suits and their partner took preference, is to lead trumps.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|davidb: N showed a good raise . |pg||
pc|sT|pg||

pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: and that's that|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andy_h: Sometimes they say, don't bother looking at any of your other cards. Lead a trump no matter what! (Usually will work 85% of the time I assure you)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands as usual medal candidates in this competition, but this match will be a tough one|pg||
nt|sybarra: was hoping for @H's 22 |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kaapo: And don't worry; it's easy to get something wrong at some point when starting a broadcast :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best would have been@SK before @CA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: slight slip in defence there|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bu maça girerken türkiye 23 tk arasýnda 15. durumda|pg||
nt|ozgull: milliler ilk 5 maçý 14 ortalama oynamýþlar umarým bu maç harekete geçme maçýdýr|pg||
nt|MolvaM: milli sporcularýmýzdan yusuf sohtorik romanyadaki takýmýmýzýn kaptaný|pg||
nt|MolvaM: takýmýmýzýn genel klasmanda hedef yeri kaçýncýlýk civarý gibi?|pg||

nt|MolvaM: ilk 10?|pg||
nt|eerbil: bana göre 5-10 arasý çok iyi bir sonuç olacaktýr|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk 15?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk 23?|pg||
nt|ozgull: her takým büyük hedeflerle gider ancak bence ilk 10 iyi olur |pg||
nt|tomi2: but then its most 85% of the time wrong to lead a trump singleton - what a problem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: *2/2 |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphztr: Trump couped by pd, how nice|pg||
nt|andy_h: Then you get your heart tricks in return :) But if partner has some trump intermediates, you have gained :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: now they took the disadvantages from both theories I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so first 2 imps to Netherlands|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: who would Dbl in S?|pg||

mb|3C|nt|kaapo: The Swedish bridge federation has put up a nice presentation, only in Swedish though: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.1917|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT might be 11-13 or so|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D probably a multi style, showing a long major|pg||
nt|tomi2: Max Ellerbeck did :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: I would. Maybe South is worried about @Hxxx but that wouldn't detour me in not doubling. By X-ing you get 3 suits across|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: So for those who missed it, Poland came in first in the girls series, followed by France and the Netherlands|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would consider a pass here, but thats the reason I am not playing there anymore... I am too old|pg||
nt|Gerben42: same here from the 30+ camp|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk4: good afternoon to Hedy Grey|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: we watch 2 experienced pairs -I  believe we will see good bridge|pg||
nt|Jacki: Does someone in here need to be ungagged to comment?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: good one for your system talk: is 2NT natural here or does it show no preference...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The U26 Open category has a day off today, hence they don't have running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: south is now "endplayed" I think he should try some kind of 2NT bid and wait for something good to happen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for me 2NT is not natural in auctions where one opp opened and the other bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, then Nab will bid 3@D and will become declarer, thats the best that can happen to south :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: only one level higher|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: i have here the CC of the Swedish girls. when play slows down i will present a brief description|pg||
nt|rodal f: By normal defence it might was. 3NT are 1 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: Showinga huge minor hand at E now|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: bazý ellerde vugraf operatörleri oynanan kartlarý yanlýþ girebiliyorlar ama sonradan düzeltiyorlar|pg||

nt|sybarra: dbl probably (I can doulbe one of the suits) |pg||
nt|mamos: NS lopk a little high already|pg||
nt|mamos: hi shirley|pg||
nt|mamos: realistically West has little choice but to sell out to this|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that easy to think game with E,,, I wouldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 3H =inv 5-5|pg||
nt|ozgull: açýk odadan anladýðýmýz gibi ingilizler 12-14 NT oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|kastan88: misfit on NS, possible that West will start doubling now|pg||
nt|kastan88: he was faster (West)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Simonsen is thinking|pg||
nt|andy_h: Very nice treatment of the 2NT bid in competition - showing 2 places to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a @H lead might end it anyway|pg||
mb|3N|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d alerted as Walsh i assume|pg||
nt|ronpa: No reason to do something else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here, of course, 3NT may be a club stop and running diamonds, so it is not so clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @C10 and a small spade from dummy?|pg||
nt|mamos: he'sd like to do something  but what ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can imagine S being especially unlucky, given his semi-wasted @S values|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I personally wouldn't have bid with N's hand. All it's going to do is that it may excited partner (when you don't really want to given the void in clubs). Given N has 3spadeds ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: (marking shortage with partner) then S may still re-open|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i wouldnt have doubled in N either... what if pd simply has 12 HCP and good 6-card @C, I dont want to be anywhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl of 3@S = dont lead that pd|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the question here is what happens at the 6 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: Decl can't handle the Jxxx with W|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes they play walsh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead in either major gives a trick|pg||
nt|ronpa: and 3NT from West seat is cold on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: Please let me know if you need to be ungagged|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so the way is free for quite some undertricks|pg||

nt|tomi2: he will lead spades anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: this spot looks just fine|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: it says: 17+ 1@c with nebulous 1@D, 5card M's|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ozgull: ingiltere'de beginnerlara 1NT açýþý 12-14 tür diye gösterildiði için öyle tahmin ettim|pg||
nt|MolvaM: vugrafta daha sýk yer alabilmemiz için takýmýmýzýn klasmanda yükselmesi gerek|pg||
nt|yuval10: N did well to remove the 3NT, but 5@disn't likely to make either|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|Jacki: and florin who is a vugraph operator|pg||
nt|yuval10: question is - does S unlimited in this sequence? i think he's limited , by 3@d|pg||

nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice fit EW but no slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can watch Max Ellerbeck's nice defense to 3@S in the movie, he found the @C ruff in 2nd trick accorcing to their signaling methods and so they defeated 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Leonardo, welcome back :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: It appers that NS could make 7@D|pg||

nt|tomi2: Dutch EW did well to stop in game here|pg||

nt|henryb: cards lie very well for N-S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: the 9 showed the @C switch?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't really blame West for passing 2@C. Maybe East should have opened - his hand sure looked like an opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, time to wake up, jan|pg||
nt|elbec: manno and di franco play weak no trump "Nightmare" style|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N EW has play|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@C looks unlikely to stop EW bidding the game in a major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you are French, of course|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either: 12-14 bal OR natural 12+ OR 18+ any distr.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||

nt|ritong: if you don t , yopu might get caught in a bad spiral|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: My second guess is that NS play polish club|pg||

nt|henryb: to respond or not to respond, that is the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting |pg||
nt|ronpa: nice agreement of 3@H to play, but only 8 trix because of bad @H break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like five rapid losers|pg||
nt|charles_l: what style is that?|pg||
nt|mamos: West has some problem now a very good hand opposite a double at this level|pg||

nt|tomi2: hmm was watching BBO TV and it looked like... sry|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Nab using Sabine's tactic: bid 2@D over 1@C whenever possible :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: West probabbly will do better confirming his spade fit some way|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D from North?|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: we are already at board 3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bir þekilde karo üzerinden keycard sormayý denkleþtirmek iyi fikir olabilir|pg||
nt|ozgull: karo k pik as olsa mesala 13 hcp|pg||
nt|eerbil: Ingiliz takýmý zon durumuna göre deðiþken 1NT açýþý kullanýyor gibiler, uygun zon durumu 10-12 olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: böylece koz dam'ýný da öðrenebilir|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Latvia dont alert the 3-rd dbl:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what would 2NT after 2@S have been? |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2NT does not exist but must be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curiously, the scoring system seems to believe there hasn't been an exchange of IMPs yet in this match|pg||
nt|ronpa: 2@S also goes down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hi Charles1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||

nt|waso: one of each|pg||

nt|kaapo: A kibitzer has read in the bulletin, that NS would play strong club|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hard decision 4 Mr. Lauks|pg||
nt|kastan88: now it is hard to West find good bid another than pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he will bid 4 sp?:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but 4@H only 3 down|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr even 2 down only|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi I'm Frank from Norway, Welcome also to Geir:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi Rodal & ty|pg||

nt|ritong: assuming it is not a super forcing one:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ozgull: Burda 4NT briaz karýþýk gibi|pg||

nt|frusco: sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North tell that South has four-card trump support?|pg||

nt|sybarra: after the support |pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a head start for Sweden I see|pg||

nt|gh1: I think 1 down in 4dia,|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: or more?|pg||
nt|tomi2: and I would think as west that my partner does not have the @D stopped after 3@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so flat board... |pg||
nt|tomi2: they will not be the only ones in that slam... |pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2@S is nonforcing, what hand would West need for slam anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|pelu: and a ruff will deefeat|pg||
pc|s5|nt|charles_l: now S has no entry|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer needs 2 entries to hand to play @Ss twice (he can't cash AK of hearts)|pg||
nt|othered1: @D to 9 won't be a winner|pg||
nt|xenya: but you are right, Charles -- now it's easier|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that is|pg||
nt|charles_l: might just concede 2@s, but very hairy with round suits threatening|pg||
nt|xenya: for example, he can just play @Ss now, but how does he know?|pg||
nt|xenya: echo, sorry|pg||
nt|charles_l: exactly :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2: 3 kings|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the whole world is opening balanced 11 counts- even bad 11s as here|pg||

nt|gh1: good def fore -1|pg||
nt|pelu: wd by East|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphztr: yep good defence|pg||
nt|elbec: considering how cards lay, only the 3@s is the losing card|pg||
nt|charles_l: ed spotted it|pg||
nt|xenya: the only thing he shouldn't do is to finesse @Ds -- oh he has done just that|pg||
nt|charles_l: but with modern science we stay in 5@s off 1kc and trump Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ray Håkonsen|pg||
nt|charles_l: hi!|pg||
nt|rayhaa: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: welcome Ray!|pg||
nt|sybarra: will not make 6 here |pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb: North should have unblocked the @h10|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kastan88: now claim time|pg||
nt|rodal f: But miss the J 26 still:(|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi commentators|pg||
nt|tomi2: I always ask myself why 900 kibs come to OR and only 100 to closed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the name 'closed' is turning them away|pg||
nt|gracelin: normally specs follow the players they know|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, we have the Norwegian Star Lindqvist playing there, but of course our players here are also top players|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this event they dont start with board 18 so you dont get extra results from altrady played hands|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm|pg||
nt|gulyas: so this will be 6 IMPs to Poland|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidb: H& ruff be Dk best|pg||
nt|kaapo: It might be interesting to see, what number of hearts different juniors bid on the East hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the up trick |pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: I understand both Norway and Poland are strong in U26 and did well in the 1st WMSG last Oct.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Sten Bjertnes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|charles_l: was a tricky hand|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like the 3@H call in Open Room looking for game......|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rayhaa: in open east preempted 3@c, so easier to find @sQ, but danger for @s 4-1|pg||
nt|rayhaa: west sry|pg||
nt|charles_l: now @d hoping W can ruff?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tomi2: Norway hat an excellent start in this event, but I remember 2 years ago it was the same and they dropped a bit - but I expect they learned from that and will be more concentrated ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: all through this event|pg||
nt|frusco: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: now he needs a miracle in @S and north's play is irrelevant, since he has 3 more black tricks coming|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S - 2n - 3@H - 4@S|pg||
nt|sten: hi everybody|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East should have signalled for diamonds with his choice of hearts on 3rd round|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Gerben42: so maybe E hand is too weak for 2@S?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davidb: now may make|pg||
nt|charles_l: good try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here we are the running scores for J26: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|kastan88: and 8 IMPs back to Norway, or N testing East in Dias?, no|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he has 7 points and one was useless, I think east's hand is a bit below minimum for his bid but I can understand his bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: the West hand is an 11 count I would open|pg||
nt|othered1: wrong on that -- low @S is right|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we jinxed it, commentator's curse :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, yes, but it's still all rather thin|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
mc|6|nt|tomi2: Poland was 3rd 2 years ago and 2nd last year in World Championships, Norway 4th in Jesolo and 3rd in Beijing|pg||
nt|tomi2: W could maybe (in case he was sure about partner knowing his spade fit) try 4@H instead of 4NT asking partner to sign off with minimum and bid on with maximum?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I don't agree with the @H discard here by S, decl could still have 4 @H, I think|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|poohbear: I kinda like 1H as long as partner doesnt bury you. It might lead the declarer to go astray counting your points|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: right|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will exlution blackwood come for find 7 EW?|pg||
nt|gh1: a Grand slm here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far almost always a swing in this board, 1 table bidding slam the other not|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep srry|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/VGRama/minirama.html  - currrent vugraph|pg||
nt|mariner1: match (rotates)|pg||
nt|mamos: another high level hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW looking for tricks 8 and 9 here I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a nice lead from Lidqvist|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South will be satisfied to emerge with 5 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: EW will need to get @cs going to beat game on this hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be a routine game |pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like a routine 3NT EW, with @Cs and @Ds both being very favorable it will be 11 tricks here as well|pg||
nt|capercliff: just|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: slam on a finesse |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@hs would make if the @d finesse was on|pg||
nt|waso: tell us about them?|pg||
nt|syl: easy PLAY|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS should end up at 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can only imagine Barry Rigal's witty comments on this in the Vugraph theater|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we can get coffee?|pg||
nt|othered1: with north passing, EW may find a losing 3N|pg||
nt|elbec: only 7 tricks in NT for EW... let's see what happen|pg||
nt|charles_l: i thought all junirs open all flat 11s|pg||
nt|pelu: Norway are No 3 in the standing - only 1 VP after Germany - Denmark No 9 - but in the run - 6 wins in a row - average 20-10!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well EW can make 4 here I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes any big win can really help either team|pg||
nt|charles_l: some will open 1@d in N|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Sten :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|MolvaM: 24 puanla 3nt. fena deðil|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might win 2@D, 1@C and 1@S to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: I wonder what 2@S is, I think it's invitational|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h limit + probably|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|gulyas: you can even get lunch if you are fast enough:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: I doubt they can beat 1@H more than 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 @C scores how much?|pg||
nt|henryb: nice catch|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Bill|pg||
nt|sten: hi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Ment Berg|pg||
nt|sten: Not so good start for Norway here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Sten:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same start as u often use to have?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant see anything except 3N T but East is contemplating more|pg||
nt|sten: well not exactly|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4NT will be just a little exciting but safe|pg||
mb|3D|nt|poohbear: not clear they get there|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has a very good cards so i guess he'll bid game|pg||
nt|ronpa: so 2@S went 2 off and first imps to turkey. and now comes a flat 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 580 or 980|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h looks normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: somebody has information about his point range here?|pg||
nt|tomi2: looks like|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I hardly know any U26 players playing non-weak jumps lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer break?|pg||
nt|othered1: with that opening, there's a chance to stay out, but still one high|pg||
nt|elbec: Di franco passed with an 11 HCPs count even with 2 aces (not following Bava's law). They're very serious about 1nt range (12-14)|pg||
nt|othered1: with rounded suit lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with bidding do you expect the k of @C with W?|pg||
nt|mamos: in fact it's a 5/7 hand I think|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: without an early @c play declarer can set up a pitch in the @d suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they get there|pg||
nt|syl: first big event for all4|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or jump|pg||
nt|mamos: so West's 2NT showed a Spade raise and North has cue-bid   - South  won't like his J high suit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N move again?  he really has a monster |pg||
nt|mamos: i think so Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: undo|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=12&qshowflag=1|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphztr: & good bridge|pg||
nt|syl: in OR nonstandard partnership..|pg||
nt|waso: here regular pds|pg||
nt|sybarra: talk about a no brainer hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer must realize there's no chance E would've led Q from AQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: sweden alert Pass from west|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop -- best EW could do|pg||
nt|mariner1: now to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club lead will solve a guess three|pg||
mb|p|nt|waso: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like some 2 way checkbac auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D seems to be a GF chec back or relay|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 2@D is artifical and gameforcing, says nothing about @D's|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well this seems bullet proof for NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT was in fact suggested by a kib|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can refil coffee 's |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, yeah|pg||
nt|poohbear: not exactly a nobrainer 6C could have been bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no brainer in 3 nt  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but you are right Barry |pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps. Should that be East's bid? |pg||
nt|tomi2: I like that range, it gives you room in other auctions because there your bids are either NF or GF, like 1@D - 1@S - 2@C - 3@S... you can set a force here without using 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: was that a joke Bas?|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, E spoiled that, now we have to settle for 660 and coffee|pg||
nt|ritong: bas retranscripts undirect infos|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean in NT|pg||
nt|pelu: only one lead can defeat: lead @H4!!! and u will have a trick on @HJ :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows where all the spots are|pg||
nt|mamos: but South wont be encouraged I think|pg||
nt|mamos: @SA doesnt seem to be a very valuable card (indeed it isnt)|pg||
nt|mariner1: lead helps some|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South goes for the four-carder, which doesn't give declarer anything he can't get anyway |pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 6S on a 4-3?- some relays bbefore 3NT I expect|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: should be a normal board|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the players must've heard him/her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Other room roads splitted at 2@C. There 2@D|pg||
nt|gh1: i think is dificult too bid 7 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep |pg||
nt|ronpa: I think they play 3@H shows min with 4@H's and 2NT shows the better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not many still play 3@h as maxi and 4 card fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe it s with 5 cards:)|pg||
nt|ritong: threatened with a @c ruff, declarer might go for the trumps and claim 9|pg||
nt|othered1: This should go quickly, if NS can run @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to set up K@D for a @S pitch....|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: need a @c lead or a @s lead and a @c shift|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the defense to prevail|pg||
nt|gracelin: usually it's played over a 1NT rebid, but here they extended to any rebid.|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he will support partnesr spades showing 4 card support and 12+hcp whil a direct jump to 4@S would indicate more shape and less high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: could beat it with a low H lead |pg||
nt|tomi2: spade bids below 4@S would have been invitational to slam after 2@D|pg||
nt|gracelin: but really tough under the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: but after south bid strong and his screenmate even thinks now ot go on maybe east should try some agressive lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: Any other lead will see 4S home|pg||
nt|tomi2: "they are thinking of taking more than 10 tricks and I must hold them to 9 - then I need some miracle"|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr. Simonsen does not appear to like passing just yet|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it's always the case when opponent bid to a game|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know if N/S are a long time partnership?|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably " i want @h lead"|pg||
nt|sten: and France is up to a good start|pg||
pc|h9|nt|syl: the pld rebid problem: 1@d-1@S-? 1444|pg||
nt|rodal f: E are asking in 4NT so exlution gone there|pg||
nt|gh1: stop in 6dia in open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think the better bidding is 3diam not 3 clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 6@D|pg||
nt|frusco: eheheh |pg||
nt|ritong: he is not at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: im trying to work out if 6@s can be made|pg||
nt|capercliff: I think it can on a squeeze|pg||
nt|charles_l: as a junior i played 1n=14-16, so i opened all 11s :)|pg||
nt|elbec: nice lead by andrea|pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: kör ataðýna zorlanýr mý?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not that I play it myself, but there's a decent case for playing these 2M jumps as invitational - in that if you have an invitational hand, you don't need to bid 1@S as, if the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: auction gets competitive, you may need to guess whether to still bid 3@S or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@d with the E hand, maxi, 4 card fit, doubleton @d|pg||
nt|frusco: the mouse is alive...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphztr: do U think they know abou diam fit?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: they will|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he reverse the @c play?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe north took 4@S as some splinter bid for either hearts or dias or so? I am just suggesting|pg||
nt|gracelin: As thomas said, south will bid less spades after 2D if he has slam ambition|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'about'|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why don't E show the @D support?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: when?|pg||
nt|gh1: i think he bid 4dia now|pg||
nt|yuval10: that surely made declarer's work even easier|pg||
nt|mamos: North doesn't care|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H? |pg||
pc|d8|nt|waso: u teach bridge at schools?|pg||
nt|syl: *old|pg||
nt|syl: nope|pg||
nt|waso: only clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: do U think 3clubs is diam support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S only shot is for k of @C to be on side |pg||
nt|sybarra: but has to time getting to his hand carefully |pg||
nt|mamos: North has bid slam opposite a negative double right this time but a little adventurous perhaps :)  I'm getting old|pg||
nt|sybarra: what a result in the other room! |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: also k of  @D |pg||
nt|mamos: lol      |pg||
nt|mamos: well looking at North and South (if you were awake and alert) you might as well be in seven as six|pg||
nt|sybarra: and nice 7 since it makes |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not that I really want to be in it) |pg||
nt|h bertens: prefer 6@H, always make without a @D lead, looks good contract to me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|davidb: same bidding same contract in OR|pg||
nt|ozgull: direkt 2NT birþeye tranfer olduðu için böyle yapmak zorunda olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 kör, 2 karo ve 1 trefl lövesi?|pg||
nt|eerbil: kör ataðý gelse de defans trefl lövesine yetiþemiyor|pg||
nt|gracelin: or north treated 4S as kick-back with Heart agreed ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: zatorski chose the safe way of just raising to 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Skjetne is surprised to have the tray returned back empty|pg||
nt|andy_h: One major downside of course, is that you prevent partner from describing the nature of their hand as 2M takes up a lot of room.|pg||
nt|capercliff: N cannot protect both @h and @c, but perhaps he is pitching after dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: sonuç olarak bu borddan kaybýmýz olmayacaðýný görmek iyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: oynayan kör as alýnca yerden karo oynayýp 10'lu empasý yapmasý gerek|pg||
nt|ozgull: en azýndan karoyu bilmesi lazým|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|tomi2: because partner did not reverse and they are plying together just this year because Wiankowskis Partner is too old for this event|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|poohbear: has an awfully good hand opposite a strong JS|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: I prefer 3H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Itake that as color. Might they have an other deel|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|rodal f: deal|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no deal|pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h ruff and claim|pg||
nt|mariner1: with a @H lead he can pull 2 trumps and lead @D..... has time to now pitch @S or @c|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|poohbear: 7 of @cs is a discovery play for the Q. Ruso trusts partner didnt underlead the ace|pg||
nt|begse: slm lar|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sn nafiz zorlu ya hoþgeldiniz diyelim|pg||
nt|MolvaM: selamlar|pg||
nt|eerbil: selam Nafiz abi|pg||
nt|tomi2: this will be of course a huge swing for poland|pg||
nt|gracelin: at least 13 imps|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will blame their coach for this kind of accident.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, but they should work on their system and this is one of the fragment you should have agreed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: which is why you dont play 2@S as GF :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|capercliff: 6@c as it happens has no chance at all|pg||
nt|charles_l: strong def - E cannot reach @hA in time|pg||
nt|mariner1: he might get @c right when he sees @H break though a bit late|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|poohbear: So no need to play the King|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@h for me is mini with 4 cards|pg||

nt|tomi2: yes but you take that space what ever you put into the meaning of 2@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: all on the @D play now|pg||

nt|kaapo: And probably no 1NT by North|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I know I would|pg||
nt|sybarra: guilt??|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and hi cliff|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N was made on 3 in OR -- declarer played @DA, then small to the Q, dropping the Jack|pg||
nt|athene: double from south might turn this into a battle of the major suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: i am not sure what NT range NS are playing|pg||

nt|sybarra: nah  its bridge! |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Who expects to go down 800 and gain 6 IMPs?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess the 2 first-round controls made it 1@S, with 6412 I would go 2@H|pg||
nt|mildredb: some really foul breaking suits |pg||
nt|andy_h: Bad breaks for whoever becomes declarer|pg||
nt|tomi2: wonder if South said "thank you partner" when his dummy came down in OR|pg||
nt|henryb: but lead said no stiff club, unless it was led -- and then he could not help it|pg||
nt|athene: and it's possible things might escalate|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ar5 the other room play 2@S now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At5|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kaapo: I think EW play 10-13 1NT when non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|kastan88: if partner has 2 diamond tricks, then this 2@S is down, if not, even @H ducking not better, just easy to count declarer's distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shitshappening:)|pg||
nt|gh1: Ax in H ig spade lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Near by 3NT but 2 are enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not necessarily a quality|pg||
nt|ronpa: I wonder if NS play transfers now|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh they do|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they do|pg||
nt|ronpa: so X = 4+ @H's while 1@H would show @S suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and also they are good players|pg||
nt|elbec: 3rd position light opening by andrea. 1@d shows 4+@d in an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mamos: it might be easy to bid 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3@c is a " mixed raise " 6-8 points and 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gracelin: now south is stuck with no chance to ask for a club stopper|pg||
nt|tomi2: just bid 3NT and pray :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Brave young man will bid 3NT himself.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they dont know that yet|pg||

nt|sybarra: or over beers later |pg||

mb|p|nt|syl: 4h-nice save|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bogen actually alerted 3@H, Johansen did not...|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to agree with pard whether this bid is asking or telling |pg||
nt|rodal f: A good try also in 3@SNS|pg||

nt|Gerben42: only can E act ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I have been told there has been a revoke in OR|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c means " i have a good hand but no convenient bid"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so whats wrong with 2 @H|pg||
nt|ritong: strength|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a better hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: dinnertime for me - see you later guys|pg||

nt|sybarra: or just forcing |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have not have time ro look ar rhe systems, Do E/W play 12-14 nt ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a sort of phantom save here in 4@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a doubble score for Nor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the weak jump poses a recurring problem for North- bid 3S with a 2S bid or pass and guess what to do when South reopens with a double|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so 4 IMP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well said Victor|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: good lead .needs 10 only to be a good one better than Sp|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is braver and bid the higher contract|pg||
nt|kastan88: now @D shift?|pg||
nt|gh1: now a x and 3H:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: -1 looks very cheap|pg||
nt|tomi2: and after my p bids 3@S I would not say thank you partner as south!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@S was easy to Dbl, maybe a Dbl of 2@H would have been already correct|pg||
nt|ritong: and 3@h tends to show 5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H would not give credit to his 18 count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: allows a jump to 3@H to show 5/5 shape at least|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: And how do you bid a 14 HCP 5-4 @S-@C?|pg||
nt|capercliff: can anyone tell me what E/W are playing?|pg||
nt|capercliff: could be precision|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes, strong @c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3 imps to Russia on 4, for stopping one level lower|pg||
nt|elbec: enjoy your dinner charles.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Charles|pg||
nt|othered1: bye, Charles!|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Game is decent but would go down unless declarer could ferret out the offside singleton King|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both major suits are nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|ort21: tx |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S should deny as many as three hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: S denied 3+ cards in @H i believe|pg||
nt|ritong: personnally i open 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: I wonder whether 4@d shows a void|pg||
nt|ritong: when east is short in @ds with a good hand, all his features necessarily work good, from west s point of view|pg||
nt|athene: you are right this is a part-score hand, but lots of part-score hands are played in 4@H or above, these days :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no dbl so might work|pg||
nt|charles_l: many methods - smolen etc to bid to 4@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the origin of the Curse is unknown, although the most popular explanation is that the orders for the Battle of Culloden were written on the @D9 |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_playing_card_nicknames Nine_higher_card|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not impossible if he finds out about Souths honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: well whatever works in your system |pg||
nt|ritong: but i do not play gazzilli|pg||
nt|ritong: i play "ritong", modestly lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 @H to me does not promise 5 |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Di Franco looking rather agitated|pg||
nt|mdgraham: every convention has a price|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mildredb: i would play X of 3@D as penalty by west|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's a bit unclear whether E should act over (3@D)-P-(P)-   (I wouldn't) but now the 3@S makes it easier!|pg||
nt|yuval10: some may think that the bidding was switched, but it wasn't...|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have to give up something to gain something|pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as you and pard play same system |pg||
nt|ritong: give up on weak two is not such a big deal|pg||
nt|capercliff: it is im informed, with transfers usually|pg||
nt|ritong: it certainly doesn t henry|pg||
nt|henryb: it could, with 3@d showing a stiff|pg||
nt|ritong: good point|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2: I am confident that my former junior partner would have bid 3nt, so I hope he is sitting south in his match :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but even if south declarered 3NT, West might cash CK then shift to HQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same two down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora has his head on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As soon as the @SJ came down Nab thanked :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think I would lead a club in this auction, trying to get "natural" tricks first|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as I said, I would dbl 2@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after that, the party starts :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: as EW play mini-NT |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is comfy - take a club ruff in dummy |pg||
nt|mikael_w: But even whith strong @c E:s hand sure look like a NT-opening |pg||
nt|elbec: nice contract by manno di franco|pg||
nt|h bertens: dbl...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kastan88: yeah, it is easy to say here, if we can see all hands, not easy to find right switch for West|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Good X, 4@S should go off a few|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so |pg||
nt|yuval10: and yet another disaster for Sweden in the OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should make nicely|pg||
nt|henryb: but no; 6@d showed the void|pg||
nt|henryb: I think a @s lead beats 7|pg||
nt|othered1: and not very aggressive bidding by west.|pg||
nt|elbec: EW could make 10 tricks in @h|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gracelin: bidding was wierd in closed room.  North opened 2C and NS stopped in 4D.|pg||
nt|ritong: also, you can have multi 2@d and 2@c for any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is a good treatment to play 1M-1NT-2NT as forcing to game, with 54, or 6+ in your main suit, and jump shifts showing 55 and also GF|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 4 very unlucky for Dutch because even small slam would have gained imps at most matches|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem bu elden 11 kazanacaklarýný düþünmüyordur herhalde.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Don't agree with 4@S btw|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: I meant in ope room|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was for both majors weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: sinche they bid 3 suits and my partner also I think club is the one I can expect to get most|pg||
nt|ritong: o_0?|pg||
nt|henryb: 7@h surely|pg||
nt|henryb: this was well bid|pg||
nt|ritong: not dow<n yet|pg||
nt|henryb: operator; 7@d is a very unlikely bid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: South should try to conceal honors by winning the Ace of ! and returning the Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N bid 1H with 3 cards. Maybe is transfer for spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I lie:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|poohbear: @cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: So there isn't much in the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: just ruff it!|pg||
nt|charles_l: potential loser in each suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: Stafie's pard opened the bidding and he has good hand with K of @S,   and will look for signal for entry |pg||
nt|tomi2: hope W will not play @SA|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes looks like it would qualify for a 14-16|pg||
nt|ritong: but if declarer tries to join his hand via @c J...|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if @H back might not have been more effective.  Now just play @D|pg||
nt|othered1: Take 8 tricks. losing only 3@S (regardless split) and two rounded|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra has left to procure drinks (barefooted)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: i'm not sure what was the 1@h overcall by N in the OR, a psych possible, over 1@c strong when P is passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: white lie. now relatively easy: @d ruff, @s, @d ruff @hQ, @sA, draw trumps and claim|pg||
nt|athene: both north and south are maximum for passing over 4@H, i think|pg||
nt|h bertens: this one also not very lucky, could go down 4|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry She |pg||
nt|rodal f: Home if J@C are to be found|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Gerben42: Tomi he played before :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it backfired big time|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kastan88: now @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: last week I pinned two singleton honors with my partners, I am expert in this :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Tough @HA underlead here|pg||

pc|h8|nt|poohbear: Declarer has seen 12 points in south. If he sees the QJ of @h or if he sees no overuff in @ds then he prob gets it right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: On the previous 2 boards Russia scored 7 then 12|pg||
nt|gh1: and -1|pg||
nt|gulyas: gazilli fills another gap, where you are 16-18(19), and try to figure out what and how high to play (2@D usually shows 8+, and sets a GF)|pg||
nt|henryb: to explain the auction: 4N was "Roman key card blackwood", 5@c showed one or four of the 5 keys, 5@d asked about the @hQ, 6@d said "I've got that and a surprise in @d|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently W couldn't raise 1@H as that would show a strong hand, and he was reluctant to go the three level later |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|phil: but if you google reverse flannery you get an Irish poem :)|pg||

nt|mildredb: wow, no one has a void :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and things starts very well for the 5th seeded team|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am realy glad when I see this realy young players stop and think hard whith only 6 cards left and then do the right thing|pg||
nt|pelu: S could X - but she dont wont pd to bid |pg||
nt|charles_l: but +620?|pg||
nt|charles_l: np|pg||
nt|mamos: a sixth trick salvaged but 5 imps away|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a play and made 6 in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: I think 3@S was an overbid too, for that matter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW looks right here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi all, in from the Open|pg||
nt|waso: 5c  -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam time|pg||
nt|henryb: and only if South has them|pg||
nt|ritong: however, the "bad spiral" we talked about previously seems to get in place|pg||
nt|mariner1: must have been a @c lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: in fact S led Q@S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|davidb: great  grand ! but not easy to reach even 6 .perfect fit. void vs o points|pg||
nt|tomi2: watching the other results on hand 5 you see some could stop in 2@S or 3@D and did not get doubled, only 3@S and upwards got punished|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think nobody was going to double 3@D here too|pg||
nt|hedyg: bergen raise|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@C is 6-9 and 4@S's, and he has to be carefull|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they dont explain|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam is down on A@d and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only alert|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are right, only explain if asked|pg||
nt|ronpa: Bar might try 3@H now and padon will accept with 4@D, this might lead to slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi  wk in one major |pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h would be the best contract normally|pg||
nt|athene: yes, north can show diamonds but east will just bid quite a lot of spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S leads might cause a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H and 3N makes EW with a few correct guesses|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H and Q@S right, along with the Aces|pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: why -1|pg||
nt|waso: 6c|pg||
nt|waso: 6c -1   |pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry Bar is thinking not Cicek|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bar= Tarnovski|pg||
nt|arigun: @d lead will not be too difficult|pg||
nt|athene: and west will raise that to quite a lot more spades|pg||
nt|pelu: no 2@D (or 2@H) here from East = both majors - it a convention from Norway (Ekren)|pg||
mb|2D|an|denies really bad hand|nt|kaapo: 6@D on board 3 has was bid 5 times out of 20|pg||
nt|poohbear: u mean 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think thats ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing same contract previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S thinking of a splinter?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 4@D - reckon that should show the ace|pg||
nt|ronpa: 4@D just says I accept invitation and have a good hand|pg||
nt|ronpa: he will bid 3@S with min and 4@S is medium hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a funky multi |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good defence is to play double as 13-15 approx or any 20+|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hand is really a bunch of junk |pg||
nt|mikael_w: 5@c seems to be a decent contract|pg||
nt|elbec: let's see what happens now? would the bidding finish?|pg||
nt|athene: normally a 5-5 shape is very powerful if you have a known fit|pg||
nt|athene: but here, east goes a little more cautiously|pg||
nt|athene: having the 1@H bid over him is very bad|pg||
nt|athene: it means, not only are the hearts useless as a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: but it will be hard to ruff them in dummy without getting over-ruffs|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess @S leads do not work either as N does not have enough entries to lead more|pg||
nt|mariner1: than 2 times|pg||
nt|mamos: will a club ruff scupper 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: not easy for defenders I think it will make|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on TOOLBAR|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: will see|pg||
nt|waso: i dont believe east will pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4H?|pg||
nt|waso: east will play the hand  5c  or 6c  |pg||
nt|syl: what about 5@C in 1. seat|pg||
nt|kaapo: *was bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: J@C was found? Adrian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: kind of Last Train, then|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ozturk woke up|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no diamond lead now...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit late for that, really|pg||
nt|ronpa: this hand is super maximum, also Q@H looks good after 3@H bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure @d lead still|pg||
nt|xenya: an awkward hand for natural methods|pg||
nt|charles_l: EW must find game here|pg||
nt|rayhaa: makes on @d finesse|pg||
nt|charles_l: @cA in S too|pg||
nt|mariner1: and then OPEN or CLOSED|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: I believe Ruso should bid to define her hand once partner responds. I would bid 2@c'|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she bid 3diam|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not good|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5clubs in 1st seat|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe without the ace of diam|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 pairs collected 1100 defending against 2@HX|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally West @D was 32, so was difficult to East assume, that partner 2 is from doubleton, probably Jxx|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D shows 5+ cards (if bal 12-14) or 4+ unbal in their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then North can get into the act and SOuht won't have this guess as to whether to re-open or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: any gazilli experts in the audience? I was asked what you do with 5@S-4@C wk (my guess was 2@D showing either minor)|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contract have bad breaks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but whith this layout in @c it will be tough offcurse|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||
nt|mildredb: probably 7 back now|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep but ruff?|pg||
nt|ronpa: other table bid the slam and @D was led so chance for another big pickup for Israel|pg||
nt|ritong: poor sikora must be muttering some black polish just now|pg||
nt|henryb: At the other table the Norwegian pair managed to go 3 down in 6@h|pg||
nt|elbec: unusual or natural 2nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder what 2N is -- just natural?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphztr: me too:)|pg||
nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney tahmin ediyorum þu anda çok moralliler|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D for me is an underbid but it works out well here|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N of course is rigid|pg||
nt|henryb: sorry, the dutch pair.|pg||
nt|ritong: we had translated:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe its a mistake or a lie from operator:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no alert for 2nt|pg||
nt|othered1: If east had extras, 3@H would be attractive here, but the double really didn't help EW|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is obviously a splinter raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: but she lead a club|pg||
nt|syl: @d trap may avoided.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hanna gabor thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think she dont like 3sp bid|pg||
nt|syl: 3@H rebid would have been the simplest|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep she have right hand on the head|pg||
nt|yuval10: making 10 tricks in @s is a lot...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h looks like going down|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has to play @d after he wins the first @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: too many conventional bidding for Sweden ... I think...|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, "wk"?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, 12-14, say|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 11-14, I s'pose|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is probably not the first time W has played in his singleton trump suit in hand |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohh my, the result from OR will not be easy to match here|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck a @s and W is dead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N with W seems like it eats up a lot of room here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1 down looks the only result expected|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mariner1: well W must not have realized the 2@S was a game try here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bazý çiftler kontrdan sonraki koz tutuþlarýný göstermek için transferli deklareler oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|eerbil: Arda'nýn kontrdan sonra eðer transfer oynuyorlarsa iyi kör yükseltmesi anlamýnda 2@d demesi daha iyi olurdu|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: aie|pg||
nt|syl: 5@C NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: with those weak spots, I would not be interested to penalize opponents in 2D, so would Cue 3D instead.|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, all tabes should find a slam here|pg||
nt|kaapo: North would now like to ask for aces outside of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully landing in a safe 4 @H now |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind, 4@CX lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry was my mistake:(|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 NT DBL|pg||
nt|athene: @HA or @CQ lead both set up marked finesses|pg||
nt|athene: either a normal club finesse or a ruffing heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Hello, I am Ragavan from chennai of India |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have bid 3N over the 2@S,,, showing my minor cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhtemelen arda ciçek bu konv oynamýyor|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: my partner will never play me for support and 3 aces, maybe he will even pass 2@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the best dession from N. Will cost some IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|capercliff: E will double this|pg||
nt|capercliff: and S might just pull to 5@c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, W is dead, nut not easy to find 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: so better not cash the @d K now, although i find it very difficult|pg||
nt|henryb: took a short break to watch the sprint finish of today's Tour stage|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure about their signals|pg||
nt|henryb: won again by Mark Cavendish|pg||

nt|waso: now  4h   5c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let see.....|pg||
nt|ronpa: south did his part of the job now all up to north|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I wonder if W thought they were showing a constructive raise of 2@H and E missed|pg||
nt|mariner1: it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (refresh often)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told 2@C is EITHER 16+, or natural|pg||
nt|ritong: if you adopt 2M openings as showing M+@c, you have to give up on natural weak 2 or two suited 2M openings, that is clear|pg||
nt|athene: an amusing symmetrical position in the red suits|pg||
nt|athene: stiff Q, J109 opposite and a ruffing finesse potential|pg||
nt|athene: and findable too on the bidding|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the ruffing finesse in @H should be all he needs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, absolutely no problem coming to eleven tricks|pg||

nt|capercliff: note the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|ritong: no fun:)|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's bidding was not very convincing, to say the least|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I think west hand didn't merit action over 3@S.  Before that just tough.|pg||
nt|elbec: lead from the longest suit and 6 tricks arriving for the defence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: passsssssssssssssssssss   south |pg||
nt|sybarra: your hand didnt get any better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, South has a 13-count....but if you pass you will face this "re-open or not" guess every time|pg||
nt|ritong: 2M openings = M+@cs, medium|pg||
nt|capercliff: most would hammer away with 2,3, or even 4@s opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|othered1: But lucky for North, who had no guarantee @S weren't running with one loser, to find @C J in south|pg||
nt|elbec: but di franco need to duck with its king of heart|pg||
nt|mamos: wow Russia on fire in OR 4@S =|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: declarer can draw three rounds of trumps and take the ruffing finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and then south gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|athene: that's one possibility|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphztr: How can he go on without a @S control?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: called by Chaugny|pg||
nt|syl: maybe sort of answer|pg||

nt|yuval10: S must know that E has 2@c's|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kaapo: 4NT would not be a great idea, because if partner responds 1 key card, you cannot tell if it's the @SA or the @CK|pg||

nt|othered1: I think declarer's now out for -1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: Welcome  Prasenjit|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did well, and now there's no entry for dummy's @s's|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can hold his losses to 2 @H and a @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when dummy has a singleton the defence usually signal with a suit preference - although its difficult when partner may nit have much length in the suit led|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: OR played 2@d, easier there|pg||
nt|capercliff: im surprised S decided to play 4@h actually|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it|pg||
nt|elbec: only if di franco cashes now ace of spades|pg||
nt|elbec: other wise ace of heart, diamond to the jack and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess if he ducks he can have later exit problems|pg||
nt|ort21: someone have live result?|pg||
nt|athene: now the clubs are blocked for the squeeze on south|pg||
nt|rayhaa: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1   Running scores|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: so he needs the ruffing finesse in diamonds for the 11th|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eerbil: 5 imp kadar iyi :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|gulyas: so you rebid 2@C with a wk 54, then bid 2@S over 2@D to show the wk hand type|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c ambiguous is gazzilli, and is the reason i moderately appreciate it, since it is not that easy to handle|pg||
nt|begse: can make by endplaying|pg||
nt|begse: he seems to be on the right way|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ruff 2 spades and diam|pg||
nt|henryb: tailed off; Tyler Farrat, the young American, finished second|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=17&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|ritong: so cav in green again, rite?|pg||
nt|henryb: yep, with I think about a 10 or 15 point margin|pg||
nt|charles_l: but 3x@d allows @s pitch before trum;ps drawn (i think)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: Welcome Mike Gold|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|raghavan: will be 1 down|pg||
nt|charles_l: hi rag|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i would expect a bit more for 3@D, but that's just me...|pg||
nt|capercliff: south would have liked to play small from dummy there, but there are entry problems|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think S here shod have understand why W let E to be on the lead, big chanse he has void @d. E Dbl @d bid in the bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But if he plays @c now that trick might come back|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|spaima: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=18&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: hi Rob hi specs hi all|pg||
nt|begse: cant now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mistake|pg||
pc|hT|nt|capercliff: each undertrick doesnt cost that much as it happens, but declarer doesnt know that|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence|pg||
nt|elbec: yes|pg||
nt|elbec: this is what we call a razor stroke :) everything perfect by north|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: I think E expected the K of @S in dummy |pg||
nt|xenya: now W has to cash the high spades, then endplay N with a club for 1 off|pg||
nt|othered1: a lot easier had south found @CJ at trick 1, fairly clear after double, I'd think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphztr: nice play Ekaterina|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Looks like a 9er and 3 IMP for Russia|pg||
nt|othered1: but west may play north shorter in @S for the double|pg||
nt|othered1: initial double|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Charles How are u?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|begse: rua körü neden ceker bizim evlat|pg||
nt|elbec: somebody is telling me that di franco was watching himself while playing... his nickname is supermax and he was between kibitzers|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|elbec: but not anymore...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|babydolldk: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yuval10: going down a couple|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: and the Italian blitz continue|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, S sould've played 9@d for -2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Fellus said: "scuza Giuseppe" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: for the 5 of diamond|pg||
nt|elbec: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: more imps to Italy as the Russians played 2N in OR -- as NS|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Gerben42: its true that @SA @DA makes 3NT, but almost all hands without @DA that would bid 3NT after 3@D make it quite a challenge|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1/2 time scores available at  www.usbf.org|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: big board here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: acbl doesn't seem to post until later rounds :(|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grand slam on  a finesse and a tad extra|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|phil: but which finesse? seems marginally better to try @s AK before the heart hook, after running your clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: Brogeland too strong for 3NT  |pg||
nt|poohbear: thats the tad extra Phil:0|pg||
nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: also have a @d menace|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: declarer would have to read the position|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|phil: right, although dummy will get squoze out of a menace before South will|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|poohbear: so it looks like Lindkvist has shown the @c Q and the @s king but not the @h king|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 5NT asked for anything else and Lindqvist says no. 6@d on the way to 6NT  Do you have the @d Q?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: ( and hopefully 3@ds )|pg||
nt|poohbear: 6@hs @hQ . Does that help?|pg||
nt|phil: Im told NS playing 3@h x'd on board 3 after North opened the 6 bagger with 3@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lindqvist probably also had option to show @SQ over 6@D|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some last train here too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or some bid to show BOTH major Qs|pg||
nt|poohbear: Brogeland might try 6@s now 1 last shot|pg||
nt|phil: caboose of the last train? |pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: of course one has to be slightly worried that 6@s might get passed :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: no shot 6@ds does|pg||
nt|poohbear: So a very intelligient auction to the top spot|pg||
nt|phil: well if Strul were down by 1 Imp they might want to swing bidding the grand, but its too early for that :P|pg||
nt|poohbear: I predict a @c lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Boye take @H finesse when in dummy with stiff @CQ?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: or play the hand out for the overtrick|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: honor-honor-honor ???   i.e. @D9-J-Q|pg||
nt|phil: you don't really want the heart hook to win|pg||
nt|phil: although in a tight match, it might come down to overtricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: With the @d Q know to be on the right. Seems like the @h finesse is the indicated play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all KO matches in the Spingold are 64 boards|pg||
nt|poohbear: known|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or can still take expert line of squeezing North in majors|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the overtrick without the @h finesse need north to have 2 cards|pg||
nt|poohbear: @h k and @s Q|pg||
nt|poohbear: then after running winners the Spade Q will show up|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: so I think brogeland takes the @h finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|h5|nt|poohbear: as usual I am wrong :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: I forgot it's Brogeland. Finesses dont get you into the newspaper :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Expert Creed: if choice between expert play and simple finesse - make expert play for the audience|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|poohbear: he is a crowd pleaser|pg||
pc|hT|nt|poohbear: declarer has to be careful to cash the @H ace before finishing @cs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d8|pc|s2|nt|poohbear: no dbl Squeeze possible if you assume the @d Q is behind the J|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: maybe @H2 is a threat in some form of compound/double squeeze?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: nice play Ari |pg||
nt|poohbear: He can count 12|pg||
nt|poohbear: so it is a very safe play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun hand to watch, but more important result in BAM|pg||
nt|poohbear: now South will get Squeezed if declarer pitches a @h from dummy. As long as he guesses to play @s first|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: Lee got it wrong|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: Clyde Love and Geza Ottlick applauding|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|poohbear: had to pitch a @s not a @H|pg||
mc|13|nt|poohbear: he pitched the suit he was guarding to hold a suit that he wasn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not the prettiest end-position but good card reading|pg||
nt|poohbear: So Brogeland gets to win the last trick with the @h 2:)|pg||
nt|phil: might have lost interest in the hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: one thing it does do|pg||
nt|poohbear: by not taking the finesse you make your opponents work that much harder|pg||
nt|poohbear: and it takes a toll|pg||
nt|poohbear: especially in the later rounds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with all of that -- we're still 3 boards ahead of Open Room|pg||

nt|lestergold: Well of course delighted for an opportunity to comment here young Mr. Jones Beejing meddalist I do believe|pg||
nt|poohbear: it is possible that West might dbl 2@s but knowing partner is balanced that suggest otherwise|pg||
nt|syl: for sure in @D she had a legitimate chance|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N left the table after displaying dummy|pg||
nt|kaapo: This seems a very entertaining set of boards|pg||
nt|kaapo: Glad you could find the file :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: And Sweden took the lead, as the Latvian declarer went down in 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting push |pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, now that we learned gazilli, on to the next board:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not yet in my repotoire|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I was joking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hard to play|pg||
nt|capercliff: 64 imps tossed around in 6 boards, steady stuff|pg||
nt|ritong: huge|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, back to biz|pg||
nt|elbec: eight hundred for Italy...|pg||
nt|athene: the @DK from north on the first round of the suit really pinpointed the @DA though|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
nt|athene: so not too tricky|pg||
nt|athene: north might have been better-off to play the @DA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS this time|pg||
nt|charles_l: picked up an imp|pg||
nt|rayhaa: next round is France - Norway, and just now Norway i 2nd is 14VP behind France|pg||
nt|h bertens: not so easy to bid slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL worked well in S as he knew W had no sources of outside tricks......|pg||
nt|sten: they are playing very fast in CR|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT - p - p - majors fromE?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: Russia had best begin to turn this critical match around soon.|pg||
nt|athene: i see it's a 4major theme match so far :) |pg||

mb|2H|nt|mariner1: interesting cards breaks here|pg||

nt|sybarra: nice club suits being dealt today |pg||
nt|andy_h: Conflicting factors now with N's hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this hand is tricky in 2/1, you have to decide if this is GF or inv. before seeing partners 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Positives: Good 5card suit, QT9 (good) support and a singleton.  Negatives: Singleton King and only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would bid some kind of systematic bid that does not allow my partner to pass before game is reached and try to show my hearts too|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you mean 2@H :)|pg||
nt|henryb: will tell you shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: so I start with 2@H and bid 4@S later|pg||
nt|yuval10: costs 2 imps.... +7 instead +9|pg||
nt|elbec: and third live place for Italy|pg||
nt|elbec: manno will show a balanced game forcing hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: do you dbl or 2@c with |pg||
nt|charles_l: N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: looks like some excitement|pg||
nt|raghavan: a slam hand - let us enjoy how they reach slam and make|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Nice slam with A @H onside|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h is normal here but the breaks are really cruel|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C could be a 18-19 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S best NS spot|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont think this has been a -30 performance so far but the Russian NS in the oR having a fabulous set  will it last?|pg||
nt|mariner1: does seem 3@D has a play though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: bery rare to see a passed out board in youth eent.  They get matured|pg||
nt|gracelin: very|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps NS bid another 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although it might not be that great on a @C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: quiet auction|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has play, to say the least|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that seems increasingly popular these days|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S must be playing a variable NT - South opened on a poor 11 not vulnerable|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gulyas: well, we know the basics|pg||
nt|mariner1: how does E take that DBL?|pg||
nt|rayhaa: i bid 2@c and hope to get a chance to show @s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: 1@C is Polish @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: only making game for n/s 4s tho 5dims can be let thru|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D probably showed H, and 2H confirmed 4-card support|pg||
nt|gracelin: With half his honors in opponents' suit, south better contend with 3H or a try|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S vuln from West, how many points in @S will put North into partner's hand?|pg||
nt|tomi2: now south solved noth's problem :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: will someone crack this one?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W can make 5@d here double dummy|pg||
nt|elbec: "Whist" bidding for manno|pg||
nt|charles_l: me too. i definitely prefer pd to lead @cs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|charles_l: W maybe should bid 3@c over XX?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Unless you lead a @H 6@D is only 1100 v. 1370:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is a forcing Pass by E|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu arada girls romanya ya karþý 30 - 5 önde|pg||
nt|rodal f: If N was active now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2NT could be GF also, seems like 4@S kills a lot of space|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, south has a decent hand if partner wants to investigate slam|pg||
pc|c6|nt|poohbear: I think 2C may be either natural or a balanced GF|pg||
nt|kastan88: test time now: what is meaning of pass over 2@S doubled|pg||
nt|rayhaa: dont u want opps to pass out 3@h with south hand?|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes i would love them to|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well south having shown his spades first presumably this will be played in spades now|pg||
nt|eerbil: sanýrsam bu elden kaybedeceðiz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elde karo pozisyonu nedeni ile þlem sorunsuz|pg||
nt|begse: sanslý bi slem |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT too much if they open this light|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3NT and 3@D both can be defeated|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@D by S here silences W|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H was brave and the winning action although !nt is down on an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|sten: something strange happened in the declarer play in OR on board 5 ... he went down in 2 spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|begse: gitmemek hatta 5 e cýkmamak lazým|pg||
nt|syl: wrong sided so|pg||
nt|syl: may even fail|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1NT from Aurelie!!!:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Board 6 is at the moment recorded as round pass in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: a director asked to look at my movie and went to check|pg||
nt|kaapo: That shuold be fixed soon, when they actually play the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a diamond lead you can make it on cross-ruff, but it requires that you cash clubs first. So you need clubs to break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you play a second diamond like declarer did in the other room, South will pitch a club and you go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will play trumps after Q@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and then after 2nd @d S can ruff and play trumps again|pg||
nt|yuval10: will it matters?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@Hx was t/o, and the rest is automatic:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant argue with the bidding |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, also missed the 4@S, tough hand to land right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 5@S can make too though|pg||
nt|lestergold: after 4d it wa surely correct fopr north to give preference to spades he had al reay bid the pips off a 6 card heart suit with poor intermediates|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure that is possible either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity for a swing here unless north 'corrects' to spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe 2 clubs is checkback|pg||
nt|kastan88: and that's it, if partner not having any points in spades, where are his 12 points for opening?, still could ask for aces, IMO|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Lauks and the two aces from his hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and he said: one down will be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should become a flat board by normal defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: and 4@h is very close as well with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually the same 11 tricks are available in both suits|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the problem is that in 4@h you have NO entry to dummy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: in Open Room S bid @S twice and they still did not get to 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: a spade lead, club shift and duck, will beat even 3H|pg||
nt|kastan88: here is clear, that NS  have not the same pinion about pass over 2@S doubled from South hand. But such situations need to agree exactly. showing this 1 stopper or half stopper or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: nothin in spades, or just minimum hand whatever, but agreement needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @c artificial game force huub? |pg||
nt|h bertens: yes|pg||
nt|h bertens: 2d any min not 4@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|charles_l: its pretty much 16+ with @c, what he has|pg||
nt|gracelin: This maximum defense is in fact a reasonable one|pg||
nt|kaapo: On this lead, EW could keep South out of his hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr for mistyping. opinion , not pinion :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps 4-1, he cannot get his @Ds good and enjoy them too|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, Hungarian schoolkids are running riot against France (41-0 so far), and leading the pack! Making me very proud:)|pg||
nt|ritong: are you coaching them, daniel?|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, just rooting for them:)|pg||
nt|ritong: oki:)|pg||
nt|charles_l: E should bid 1@h not XX, just in case it comes back at the 3/4@s level|pg||
nt|mamos: i'd expect this salm to be widely bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3 rds of clubs - then d then 4th club - North ruffs high and declrer pitches spade -|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|charles_l: (assuming polish @c)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Not much excitement - only they have not reached a makeable C slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a none @c lead allows a make|pg||
nt|mariner1: non|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Jones ha to find the killing club lead |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s will not fare well\|pg||
nt|kaapo: But @Hs are splitting, too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C looks like conventional stayman|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H shows @S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: play the @dK from hand is a little to much double dummy I think|pg||
nt|athene: Smolen over 2NT is something you lose if you play puppet|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass??|pg||
nt|athene: but it is quite valuable|pg||
nt|pelu: ????|pg||
nt|mariner1: surely S did not pass|pg||
nt|mamos: slam even|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: and he has|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with that lead not much declarer can do to avoid going 2 off|pg||
nt|poohbear: Best to win in Dummy and play a @c to try to negotiate a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: alternatively if you trust the lead you can draw trumps and if 3-2 play for 4 @d tricks and then lead a @c off dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Brian Senior is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: making pictures|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a jr event!|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a senior moment :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might gain some IMPs again for Russia. @H lead? Seemed normal for me!|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room in 3@H which is also a tough contract|pg||
nt|charles_l: XX to me shows defending interest|pg||
nt|sybarra: finding the @D cards is the difficulty |pg||
nt|h bertens: more chance on a natural auction|pg||

nt|lestergold: falase card will not fool ed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 2NT cannot be a "good GF"|pg||
nt|yuval10: S would've done better to let N takes the trick and play Q@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra is thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: take in dummy, @c to J, ruff @s....etc|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: is not easy...|pg||

nt|h bertens: 1@S, 2@D is a good start|pg||
nt|h bertens: another 13 out|pg||

nt|mariner1: np :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this got a bit too complicated maybe |pg||
nt|h bertens: France also down by 32 against Norway|pg||
pc|cT|nt|MolvaM: keycard soran adam, eðer eksik yoksa þlemi söylemeli bence|pg||
nt|syl: @H" can mislead pd|pg||
nt|gracelin: the duck is the more difficult part|pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer is safe|pg||
nt|tomi2: taking the ace and then thinking about the situation is not the best solution|pg||
nt|tomi2: he actually does not need much more then norths hand to have a good @D slam for example|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed. but North has a very lucky hand for South: sixth club, heart help and the @dQJ to help get the ninth trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|begse: ama nezaman soracagýnýda bilmeli)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet :) cümlenin devamýnda da ..... ya da hiç sormamalý demeliydim herhalde|pg||

nt|ritong: gling|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: so apush|pg||
nt|syl: *2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Funfact, one of the Dutch girls players is also a member of our U21 team. However, obviously she's not playing now :)|pg||
nt|athene: this will play quite nicely, even though the black-suit breaks look nasty at first|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 - 1 @S are a problem however has play|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|waso: so hungary missed a 12 imp chance|pg||
nt|syl: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Wonder why he didn't play @HQ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Kibs saying @HK and then the J shows the Q, but Sikora isn't so sure, he's held the @S2 two times already|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, but in @h you are likely to get a @d lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|davidb: needs a H to defeat it |pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess just in this moment Nawrocki realizes that he made a mistake|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good defence?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 down... I think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gh1: must ruff with a or q no fore -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to the hungarian kids,  I think they have been stars so far |pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2: same in Germany|pg||
nt|tomi2: Marie Eggeling will join the Schools team tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: not cleasr how he can make it -- possibly 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: That @S loser is probably the second setting trick|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can come to ten or eleven tricks in various ways i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: why was 2 @D not an option by N? |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H should be -1 but might make|pg||
nt|arigun: 3@h is too much to me if 3@d is not forcing|pg||
nt|ronpa: now he has to find the club shift|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gracelin: he is also afraid of thinking before ducking to expose his CA and create tempo problem when partner get in later.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|raghavan: Hello Anita - can u enkighten us as to what system they are playing here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: neyse. giden 13 imp|pg||
nt|ritong: better play a trump now|pg||
nt|capercliff: and N can get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the tournament actually has new leaders|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: @d obv gives it  when a @c allows a cross ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: probably his problem was " a trump, ok, but which one"|pg||
nt|h bertens: i dont know to be honest|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 1 @s everything was too much for me|pg||

nt|mariner1: (Click on ones with NO x)|pg||
nt|elbec: king of club ducked|pg||
nt|athene: leading clubs from dummy means that if west ruffs, he is ruffing a loser with his trump trick|pg||
nt|h bertens: but i dont understand 4@s by south|pg||
nt|sybarra: niek brink suggests,   1sp, 2d, 2sp, 4cl and you are there |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: both 2NT and 3@H|pg||
nt|h bertens: good trumps, 2 kings and have already showed complete minimum|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ozgull: ilginç|pg||
nt|mdgraham: more imps to France - Poland going down at both tables |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphztr: simonsen need only the Ace of H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: good defense   here |pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps was safer to cash K@c before the @s, but it won't matter here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Rather strange @DJ by W|pg||
nt|yuval10: making + 1 looks a bit weird, but ...|pg||

nt|mikael_w: I was talking about the kontract 4 @h|pg||

pc|cA|nt|poohbear: pass 3@h and 3@s all possible choices|pg||

nt|poohbear: at least 500. though 4@hs is making|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess he could bid 4@ds to play game in the right suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room, i think Fantunes start with 1N opening from South |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|poohbear: board 4? They opened 1NT and had a puppet sequence to 3NT  . THat got Uday to lead a @h and 3NT rolled|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think systemic swing potential on THIS hand too - because south starts with 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW may just play @H partscore|pg||
nt|poohbear: Now ace of @h heart ruff . @c Q pitching a @s and I think declarer is in control for 7 tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: curiously, if Brogeland @S had been weaker - swap East x with West quack - then loser-on-loser play not available|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has a count on the hand. He knows @cs 4-3 and @H 6-2  ( no 3@h bid) and spades 3-4 so @ds 4-0. Safe to assume East would never pass 3-3 in the reds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S 3-4 instead of 2-5 because Lindqvist bids 3@S if 5=2=3=3|pg||
nt|poohbear: good declarer's are always trying to get the inferential count through out the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 5@H did not fare well in Open Room, seems that had a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: well somehow managed to go 2 off in 5h in open|pg||

nt|rodal f: Did u know that: Albania are 120 people at there federation, while Turkey are 1.050.000 members?|pg||
nt|gh1: A Roland slm here make with a dia lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Romania: 500-1000 members|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @S+m apparently|pg||
nt|tomi2: let's see if they find their @H fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Muiderberg used against a Dutch pair, the irony :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: a very agressive opening with 7-4 with a major but might work well here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I like this boys|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H here is a @S transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: S wondering where all the bidding is coming from|pg||
nt|athene: there are so many transfers used these days i think any regular partnership needs some generic agreements|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: a trump lead here is best vs @H|pg||
nt|eerbil: açanýn karo kontrolü olmadýðýný ve dengeli eli olduðunu bilirken iyi bir þlem deðil bence|pg||
nt|gh1: or spade J|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR i guess natural 1NT opening and all pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: a different story here though|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Less than an IMP per board is little by U26 standards :)|pg||
nt|athene: the basic thing you have to discuss is:-|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6@s is 50%|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: clubs lie badly too many losers in the black s in east's hand to be dealt with bearing in mind a 3/1 rump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am glad to see people can still double for penalty, eapecially by the youth.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt =weak with both minors |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not a very useful convention in my opinion|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some 700 I belive Adrian|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not exactly muiderberg|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H is both majors weak for our pair too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT is probably a maximum with @D as sidesuit|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2@C shows @H and another suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South wants to double, you can feel it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *an IMP|pg||
nt|athene: if you double a transfer is it showing the suit bid, or is it t/o of the promised suit?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mikael Westerlund|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidb: E  does not like XXX in Spades ..|pg||
nt|lestergold: and over ruff threats in dims|pg||
nt|poohbear: another competitive battle at the game level here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, is South's double for penalty?|pg||
nt|elbec: aggressive bidding by di franco|pg||
nt|mariner1: everyone in auction should be a warning to everyone :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 7+ hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the modern style is 3H on East but maybe I am out of touch|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: normal to be in 4@h down here|pg||
nt|charles_l: esp at imps|pg||
nt|raghavan: If they do not cash D - 4H makes = 1 Spade loser+1H+1D( 1 Diamond goes in Clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they should be warned about the breaks now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: goodness, 5@c |pg||
nt|ronpa: east wants to X 5@C|pg||
nt|capercliff: do well to stay low here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. is south's double here hearts, or t/o of spades?|pg||
nt|athene: of course, these two meanings overlap to an extent|pg||
nt|athene: but it's important to discuss them i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: now we see if S believes everyone|pg||
nt|pelu: the standard are: X of a conventional bid = the suit|pg||

nt|mikael_w: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: bu kontr negatif sanýrým ama tutulsa fena olmaz|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice play by west in the open room for 3nt=|pg||
nt|kastan88: still correct was to use somewhere blackwood type bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr:   NT = pass or correct|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: only pass possible response... 3NT wont have problems|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to E, 3NT showed a 4-card, however, I could not deduct which|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohoh!|pg||
nt|othered1: north bids 3@H and south passes?|pg||
nt|elbec: after inital pass...|pg||
nt|othered1: That feels like a deep view, even with possible @S duplication|pg||
nt|elbec: he is probabli thinking that they could have mirror like hands|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's right on this hand|pg||
nt|xenya: well he can't quite raise to 4@H after N's initial pass?|pg||
nt|rayhaa: will bid it too|pg||
nt|mamos: yes artificial responses dont seem to have worked well here  - old fogey rule ok |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes can they stop now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: getting to 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D was natural, most of the time with 5 cards|pg||
nt|kaapo: I like to play that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: has its moments  |pg||
nt|tomi2: If there are any kids (below 18 years) watching this vugraph, I must warn you not to watch open room's auction and play in the next board|pg||
nt|Gerben42: helpful lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: can make 5@H 5@S 3@D now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had 1 chance to beat it, which was pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice table!!!|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h is par|pg||
mb|3C|nt|davidb: the question if 3H shows shape as well or can be x H |pg||
nt|ronpa: he still didnt make it, he has to play very carefully|pg||
nt|hedyg: why double? for 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|ritong: starting with @c A, u never know|pg||
nt|henryb: Hushovd finished 5th|pg||
nt|athene: one school of thought says that you have a convenient cue-bid available as a t/o double, so X should just show the suit bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a good game for Norway- both players werevery conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: Yes, maybe difficult for w to play a @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E not happy with partner's bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open  east bid 5h in front of partner against 5dims partner may have found a different action|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Leaders|pg||
nt|poohbear: once again we see Ruso fail to bid at a cheap level|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear this Dbl will excite partner enuff|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mostly to expose psychs like this 1@S by Arvidsson|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: expose he did. find the right level he didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it with a european pard |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This is going to be bloody|pg||
nt|arigun: possible to make 5@c |pg||
nt|ritong: nice spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Houston we have landed |pg||
nt|xenya: but he can!|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Not much of a hesitation there|pg||
mb|3D|nt|raghavan: The final bid optimum and correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the bidding and lead best to set up dims after trumps dawn|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks easy on that route|pg||
nt|MolvaM: deklaran yeri görünce pik vale sorunum var diye düþünecek ama biz biliyoruz ki sorunu yok :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, need to duck the spade opening lead and made some good guessing later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont understand one club opeing for Latvia|pg||
nt|athene: right; but not everyone plays this way |pg||
nt|mariner1: can he make this?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E needs to lead a @H|pg||
nt|athene: for example lauria-versace play (1NT) pass (2@H) X = t/o of spades, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H looks like a law violation to me|pg||
nt|athene: bidding 3 over 3 with only 8-card fits around|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this should give England  about 11 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: no should have the timing|pg||
nt|mariner1: now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north ducking wont help him|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know why E doesnt bid it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmmmm bu da ilginç|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the quality for Romania have raised well the last years, as Bulgaria. Romania nr. 5 in Beijing open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes and I think we do a great job here at Brasov:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a Flaw violation :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and? - the Law is 50-60% so..|pg||
nt|athene: and south has a pretty defensive hand quite apart from only having five hearts|pg||
nt|athene: stiff diamond, slow black cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Suggestion of Total Tricks? :)|pg||
nt|athene: The Guideline of Total Tricks :)|pg||
nt|pelu: a free 2@H by pd - S dont know that N only have 3 small @Hs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it wld have sold as well with that title|pg||
nt|athene: well, this comes back to the point i was suggesting earlier|pg||
nt|athene: if south's double showed real hearts (i.e. 5+) then north's 2@H is quite likely to be only three|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphztr: 6 clubs with double finn on hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get ugly |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Indeed - no guarantee of a diamond trick|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly needs @s 2/2 or @h Kx, a rather good proposition|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to lukasz brede|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: in comp with concentrated honors her hand is not a sub minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 3H:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe checking to see if W has 6 @ss|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Dummy walked away (wisely)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Henri|pg||
nt|Gerben42: note that on a @C lead, @CAK, south will be squeezed in the red suits to make 11|pg||
nt|ronpa: Other table playing 5@C undbled|pg||
nt|ronpa: he doesnt know that West had only 7 diamonds for his opening, it will take a big effort to make this hand|pg||
nt|lokaty: hello everyone|pg||
mb|4D|nt|poohbear: but still a victory for Russia since 4@s is touch and go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 15 sene kadar önce bu tür ataklar yapmayý seven bir parterim vardý.... hala var  :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar agresif bir atak için bir sebep göremiyorum bu elde|pg||
nt|kastan88: EW using I aasume polish Club based system, tho 1@C is 11...14 bal or all hands 18+|pg||
nt|kastan88: 'assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to the EW cc, 2@S is indeed a 5+M4+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: açýktan 3 imp verip ataðý geri almak mümkün olabilmeli bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was forcing with clubs, since he is GF he chose to show clubs instead of hearts to establish the force|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they were in a forcing situation and double by Sikora is a suggestion to play there|pg||
nt|gracelin: I like that|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like -2 here|pg||
nt|capercliff: both tables opened 1N, not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|capercliff: i'm assuming they are playing 12-?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this will work out fine and give 5 IMP back to the swedes, brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: death by aces now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: hiya buddy|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: signals?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, sikora thought about it in his grand|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is a bit on the greedy side i think|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but it doesn't figure to be redoubled with those trumps|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphztr: switch to clubs...|pg||

nt|rodal f: Are gona play for the Iasi tean in ure 1. div the comming season. So see u there Adrian|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good 4 you|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Lukasz|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ronpa: now to make he has to play low club and finnesse to ruff last diamond with the @C ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: queen of diamonds was almost impossible|pg||
mb|6D|nt|xenya: yes, the @DQ would have been nice -- for the defence|pg||
nt|elbec: really strange switch|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|vugraphztr: I'd like to bet that W has no clue his partner started with @HAK9xxx|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6/8 @d will enable the contract to make|pg||
nt|ronpa: has to find a way to reduce his trumps in hand for coup|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he must take hi's spades now|pg||
nt|hedyg: still has a @D loser|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think he has to play his @H before to ruff some in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: take spades ruff diam with the ace and 7 of club|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is -1|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes thats the winning line|pg||
nt|ronpa: no thas made|pg||
nt|hedyg: will lose 1@H and 1@c that way|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to ruff both the spade and the Diam in dummy to make|pg||
nt|ronpa: why lose club? he will endplay him with @H for the last 2 tricks in club|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|poohbear: nope|pg||
nt|poohbear: trumps not short enuff|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh true he still has @H to exit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will have a heart exit|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Barry, welcome|pg||
nt|ronpa: true|pg||
nt|poohbear: hi|pg||
nt|ronpa: should play J@H now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer essentially needs to crossruff|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room played very well and went 1 down, didnt guess clubs were 4-0 (wasnt dbled)|pg||
nt|ronpa: so lets see if this will turn to be 2 imps to Israel or 11 to turkey|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double here was a bit greedy|pg||
nt|ronpa: we will discuss that after the hand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is considering all options|pg||
nt|hedyg: that takes a while|pg||
nt|capercliff: oh i've been corrected, EAST opened 1N in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 8 cards in @c, only 7 in @s, so playing on @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Grosset is thinking........|pg||
nt|xenya: now it makes easily|pg||
mb|6S|nt|hedyg: hi Adrian|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they he is in dumming |pg||
nt|athene: it's often hard in defence|pg||
nt|athene: to work out whether to give partner ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: if he has good trumps, it might be the very last thing he wants|pg||
nt|mariner1: sort of a systemic fix, if you open light (and I do) you need to have controls in place|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: so down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: to ask opening quality|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphztr: hi HedyG|pg||
nt|capercliff: adventerous|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi Joe|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well cardplay here is a little sloppy |pg||
nt|yuval10: S shouldn't have cashed A@s|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer is still ok . can set up pirtches|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking...|pg||
nt|gracelin: if West knows to underlead diamond for a club ruff it wuld be -3, let's see if he can find it|pg||
nt|ritong: so the rule of thumb " with 6/4 go ahead" proves right one more time|pg||
nt|sybarra: saying is  6/4 bid one more?|pg||
nt|ritong: sorta:)|pg||
nt|lokaty: but the winner of this board was Sikora with brave decision|pg||
nt|elbec: this looks very strange!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a good board for the Czech.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: deklaran kör vermemeyi becerebilirmiyim diye düþündü bir an ama vazgeçip makul oynadý|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: manno not very happy about partner's small spades order of play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: critical play here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ?|pg||
nt|ronpa: so 2 more imps to Israel|pg||
nt|poohbear: Need to exit @h win the spade return in dummy . ruff a heart  . play spades ruffing the 4th in dummy . Threaten to ruff @h with 8 of @c  and then ruff the last @d in dummy setting ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: up trump coup|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he forget to catch the Q of spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: was too late|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphztr: I wonder why N played @HQ, hardly seems right|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but contract will roll in now|pg||
nt|kaapo: So the 7@C board was a push|pg||
nt|kastan88: so that's long history about latvian and lithuanian bridge, as former Soviet times was nowhere to learn bridge tha from Polish bridge magazines, so lot of Polish Club playres in ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: Latvia lithuania and Russia|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes some kind of polish club they play|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: best is a @d back. as long as declarer withholds the q ok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: karo çakasý ile ele geçip trefl ruaya kör atma senaryosu bu ataktan sonra pek olmaz|pg||
nt|gracelin: or eve a H to partner, so it's likely -3, srry|pg||
nt|tomi2: sure|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: well A@H wins it :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphztr: Hello m8! ;)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think small @s was better in order not to squeeze N|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: nothing criticial he has ten tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: 1 imp alacak gibiyiz|pg||
nt|kastan88: for sure, modified Polish Club, i don't know exactly, still I know these Latvian guys quite well, but they change often partnership, so Bethers-Lauks not so much played together|pg||
nt|yuval10: now A@h, @h to Q and @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: he could have cashed the two trumps in dummy etc|pg||
nt|kastan88: and I surfed in Internet, but can't find their exact CC|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO that is responsibility organizers to put up all CCs into Internet, if such championships :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1 cl = polish standard|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1 diam = 4 cards|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be their is some link on Champs website, but i can't find it out|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2 clubs = precision|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I read on Latvia cc|pg||
nt|poohbear: needed to shorten trumps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|poohbear: i guess it all works out as he can ruff 2 @cs|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can claim now|pg||

nt|tomi2: is there still an extra prize for juniors who gain an IMP swing that is higher than their age?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: who is the youngest on the German team?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Toke I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Michael tried for @D7 (beer card) and Toke just promised him a beer regardless :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: I think Greenberg showed 5 @s and 4@h|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: I would presume 3@h is Smolen|pg||
nt|poohbear: big OOOOPS here|pg||
nt|phil: but they do not appear to be on firm ground|pg||
nt|phil: I would think Ari would transfer to spades and bid hearts, but maybe they play that as some kind of slam try in spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: some play 2nt 3@d -3@h - 3@s  to show a weak 5-5  and transfer to 3@s and then 4@h to show slammish|pg||

nt|mariner1: well played|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it was badly defended im not sure it was well played tho Rob|pg||

nt|kaapo: On 7, the Swedish pair is at 4@S|pg||

nt|yuval10: she could've just finesse @h in the end position|pg||
nt|hedyg: too much excitement for 2 imps, not worth the double|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|capercliff: as it happens the 1N bid forced N/S into a hopeless game|pg||
nt|capercliff: routine 4@s?|pg||
nt|capercliff: not routine to bid it of course|pg||
nt|santyclz: Very limited values, By no means automatic to reach.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hi Mikael|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have just found out N is Cecilia R. I thought it was Cillas yougrt brother|pg||
nt|mikael_w: younger|pg||
nt|henryb: they are too young to believe in bad breaks|pg||
nt|xenya: well we are looking at all four hands -- no doubt S had some reason for the @C switch|pg||
nt|mamos: declare making sure of nine tricks bagged eleven|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days things just go your way |pg||
nt|mariner1: here they could use 2n to ask if above minimum|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last are able at 4 I belive?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|raghavan: 21 vs 19 points should be in a part score|pg||

nt|yuval10: we'll never know what she did, i guess....but anyway well played|pg||
nt|ritong: started with @c J, but boom|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. one of my parenrships uses that. |pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Youths are wonderful - taking up newer bidding ideas|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S sure seems to have a play here|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was laydown|pg||
nt|waso: good result for France from the open room|pg||
nt|kastan88: tx, Adrian|pg||
nt|mamos: well this looks like 3NT NS after Stayman|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the bold 2H bid on last gained 6 imps|pg||
mb|2S|an|3-6|nt|davidb: normal game in H .  |pg||
nt|syl: @D lead beats the @S game here|pg||
nt|tomi2: normaly I would say we are missing an undo|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I know nordic bidding methods :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: wlc|pg||
nt|mikael_w: you have to do the trunph right here to make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: unfortunately,  "style" points dont count on the imp scale |pg||
nt|sybarra: but Poland won big on the bd|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Manno just called the TD|pg||
nt|sybarra: for last bd?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: He was pointing at the lower left of the cc, the TD just took him away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: They were whispering, couldn't hear|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C now from north perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: make sure of the right strain|pg||
mb|4S|nt|waso: they led A H  and heart|pg||
nt|syl: so the @D loser disappeared...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 4 @D asks pard to bid major |pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is really a lot with S hand (imo)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Romania is coming back, but the 1100 will be devastating|pg||
nt|othered1: looking for side suit preference on trump ace lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2d= both majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 2 sp= Muideberg?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite flat boards so fare:( But Russia can gain a IMP. 11 in @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2000 = ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: She's watching now|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h  wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer or? |pg||
nt|ritong: probably pass or double and 3@h by east|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@H probably a rubensohl version, showing 5+@Ss and inv+ values|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt not best idea |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here it looks ok to play 4 @s|pg||
nt|rayhaa: u have to bid it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: whith the @c layout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as there is no point using 2NT as natural once you have located a 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|sten: and Norway is only 4VP ahead of Israel in the fight for the silver|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: And again, bad breaks for whoever the declarer is |pg||
nt|tomi2: Toke Hoffmeister just turned 17 I was told|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: That's double pool right there o.O|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and after that 1 NT it might be tough|pg||
nt|capercliff: depends what defensive tricks they cash|pg||
nt|athene: even with a slightly weaker hand, it's right to overbid a bit to make sure at least you play the right suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so a chance for Greece to pull it back to close|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|gulyas: if NS plays strong @C|pg||
nt|ritong: a good move, though|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @h sort of put sand in the works |pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has low chances, needs to drop @c K|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD examining the notes|pg||
nt|santyclz: On the other hand, it's the type of auction that usually warrents a trump lead.|pg||
nt|capercliff: if E wins a @c with the Q might be easier|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I agree, If N is playing 4@s there is a natural trumpg lead from E|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: this contract depends basically on which hand the hearts are played from|pg||
nt|lestergold: the natural play of a heart up to the KQ loses of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D sets up GF with 5+@D|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: It most definitely is, pd is 6-10 (usually)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This will also be set by a few|pg||
nt|gh1: good 3S not easy fore ØV now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to come online no.|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s and 3N both fairly cold|pg||
nt|othered1: A from AK even in trumps?|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@s shows 0-4 @s|pg||
pc|c7|nt|charles_l: well Ekrens 2@d is not new|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing silence by W|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|eerbil: 26 onör ile 1nt'de kalmalarý ilginç|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiliz takýmýnýn balans ayarý bozuk|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was forcing, either Polish or Precision - we aren't quite sure - and 1@D some negative reply|pg||
nt|gh1: not so good 4s, but maybee not x|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X will cost at the 4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even 3N making is 17 imps|pg||
nt|capercliff: if West can win a trick with the K@c before trumps are tackled, indeed he will get the finesse wrong|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: i mean who is going to play a heart tghe other way then losing the chance of finessing against the tenof hearts if th hearts break 4/1 the other way|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3 nt with lots of chances after the @c lead and the king wins|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S is either a 4 dard suit, or a hand like this missing a @H stopper or strong (18+) with spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: they found their best contract.|pg||
nt|kastan88: NS play some 5-card Majors, better minors, (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and me sleeping:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: this is too fast 4 me:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am told by specs that 1@C is either 15+ with @Cs, or 15-17 BAL, or 24+ any hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D (2@C) X is always tricky because partner doesn't have to have both majors (as here)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no 5 diam or clubs ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they chose to play 4@S, this does not need hearts to break 4-3 but has some other dangers|pg||
nt|kaapo: This lead presents a trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this looks like another potential gain for Czech  team|pg||
pc|dT|nt|babydolldk: On board 7 they bid 6@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: But if 2D is both Majors - the hand must be a real opening hand - or else difficult for respondaseer to judge - as in this c|pg||
nt|davidb: should misgueese all to go down|pg||
nt|elbec: now di franco showed 5+@h 15-17|pg||
nt|xenya: but S has 5!|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@s is asking|pg||
nt|mamos: and the defence are well placed to win 5 tricks |pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: 4@H is cold on any lead|pg||
nt|kaapo: And also an entry to the North hand, unless East playes low, as he did|pg||
nt|yuval10: a slight overbidding by NS here...|pg||
nt|yuval10: N probably thought S has more for his X and 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: but the lucky position in the @c suit might enable it through|pg||
nt|ronpa: a @D lead might make declarer some troubles this lead will make it easy |pg||
nt|poohbear: easy?|pg||
nt|ronpa: (*er) ::)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why N would play for the drop, 4 @S safer|pg||
nt|gulyas: there, they got to the top spot after all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Screen opened and closed again|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, if 1@c can t be garbage, then 3@h is much more justified|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Manno was pointing at the part where it says what EW agreements are over strong artificial openings|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, now they have reatch the 4@s, rhis will be intresting|pg||
nt|elbec: 2nt denies 4 spades|pg||
pc|d9|nt|poohbear: maybe best to win the @c and return a @c immediately|pg||
nt|tomi2: 17 IMPs for Germany if they make and 19 if not, so the whole play is like fighting for overticks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just got confirmation Tomi, just turned 17|pg||
nt|capercliff: not the best lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: W will likely be presumed to have the @ck from no @c honor lead.|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N possible  also|pg||
nt|sten: sure is|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that switch shrieks of ace underlead- otherwise too dangerous to open up clubs|pg||
nt|sten: the opening prepared for the good game contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by carryover they are under bought Israel and Italy if I'm not wrong. But a smaal win against France|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if declarer tries to cross ruff he is doomed- he needs to play West for club ace|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: There the Norwegians where lucky. Decerved? My viue NO|pg||
nt|usla: a dbl cost Norway 5imp, now not dbl cost Russia 9|pg||
nt|capercliff: now its trivial|pg||
nt|elbec: yes i know... maybe he didn't like his spades... i can't understand|pg||
nt|elbec: or he's "tilted" :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is a good contract here -- doomed though|pg||
nt|mikael_w: No hesitation there eather :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 NT looks alot tuogher I think|pg||
nt|h bertens: carefull defence could defeat this contract|pg||
pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: bu elde bizimkilerin 3ntye rahat gitmelerini bekliyoruz|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yuval10: nice leads by W , declarer might need to finesse @c right away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD told Sikora to keep the notes for her, and told the players to resume play|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@D was a definite alternative with that south hand (assuming 1@D shows diamonds)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: fly it!|pg||
nt|frusco: now can take ace|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|elbec: horrible 3nt here|pg||
nt|xenya: absolutely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: manno also explained 1@S as 0-4 @ss|pg||
nt|elbec: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: so it looks like he did it on purpose|pg||
nt|othered1: auction looks alm ost random and certainly doesn't show the methods off well at all.|pg||
nt|elbec: he had a spade in the clubs maybe :)|pg||
nt|elbec: would have you doubled 2@c asking with West hand?|pg||
nt|othered1: Almost looks like south was seeking a way out after misdescribing the hand initially.  As a rule, it works best to play that there's no way  to correct an error, with partner's ...|pg||
nt|othered1: cooperation.  Just make a decision yourself, if you can, and go on to the next hand.|pg||
nt|mamos: West's chance|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: i predict a push|pg||
nt|gracelin: only 5-1 trump or 5-0 diamonds can cause troubles|pg||
nt|poohbear: off to a good start. |pg||
nt|ronpa: other table is in 2NT so a chance for big swing|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer carefully ducks a@h into the safe hand|pg||

nt|gulyas: no overtrick now|pg||
nt|frusco: fear of west ruff|pg||
nt|frusco: after bid 2@h|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N would not occur to me with South. I would want to five partner a chance to show a sixth heart or three spades|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps this is the best chance |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Gerben42: doesnt look like making from here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D are high but stuck in the unreachable south hand|pg||
nt|minnie lee: he needs to finesse to the @c9|pg||
nt|elbec: he was lucky that they can't make 4@s|pg||
nt|othered1: very|pg||
nt|mamos: yes well done|pg||
nt|h bertens: now he will make i think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: he was lucky no 9 or 10@H in S|pg||
nt|ronpa: he still has to guess at the end who has the K@D, can try to endplay south with the clubs and K@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: since N did not play back a @c he has none|pg||
nt|poohbear: so no declarer can cash majors and in the end exit a @s . He will make the hand as long as North has 1 @d honor|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: now the losing heart play|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: will have 2 entries for it with the K@d and the @s ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good defence |pg||
nt|yuval10: he presumably knows that @s's are 4-3 from the bidding|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant believe E underled the A@d here, Is this true?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|athene: you might still be able to back into 4-4 heart fit if partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: sorry, 4-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|pelu: spec to the danes: Nicki Sørensen won to days et6ape in Tour de France!!!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can make 11 by playing flat-out, of course|pg||
nt|athene: @SK, @HA, @SA, heart finesse|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N needs @cHx in W i think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|davidb: now 5 |pg||
nt|sybarra2: but 4 sp cold for e/w?|pg||
nt|yuval10: good def, but declarer can still make|pg||
nt|henryb: give partner|pg||
nt|h bertens: well done|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: zonda olmadýðý için sadece 6 puan ama olsun|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can endplay N in @s and let him play @d and make a guess|pg||
pc|d2|nt|charles_l: 2@d both majors is usually played weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: ...|pg||
nt|ort21: someone have live result|pg||
nt|ort21: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind that Gerben :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: no guess|pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook was simply dangerous, wasn t it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so claim |pg||
nt|frusco: but risk if A@d in Est|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we are resulting,  but seems to me take club ace and draw trump is safer |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The problem appears to be that the cc doesn't show what 2@H meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult position - would look silly if the @CA got ruffed |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm Mike .....that would be yuckky |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NS are offered time now, to agree upon a defense against overcalls not listed on the cc|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: There was a claim btw, but I missed the   of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: game |pg||
nt|sybarra: no OT's |pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, if east churlishly turns up with the @HQ, you go a lot down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: well, they seem to have done ok by the seat of their pants on this one |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Silviu:) Welcome u are.|pg||
mc|9|nt|ritong: well, the problem is you have to bid 3@d in tthat case, and you cannot trust pard s bid, whatever it will be, since he is stuck with no @d stopper|pg||
pg||

nt|ahollan1: board 6   other room 6@C so 3 more for Struhl|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|poohbear: both sides make a lot of tricks here|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|phil: Ari's not done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well somebody was going to bid 4@D :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|poohbear: Good news is declarer cant get @s wrong. Bad news is he lacks 2 entries to get there|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|nt|poohbear: So he might try @s A |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: looks like par to me|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5 of a minor cold for either side but not 5 of a major|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poohbear: 5@h dbled is par|pg||
nt|poohbear: since @ds is higher than @cs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|lestergold: simply unlucky thats all|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H looks right here|pg||
nt|gracelin: In a bidding challenge they will surely get the top mark by choosing 4S|pg||
nt|tomi2: in fact 3nt will make most of the times, because hearts can also split badly but block or ... if you bid 3nt fast they might lead something else, say the leader has Kx in hearts ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and partner AQxxx|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but after heart weakness exposed, I like Sikora's choice|pg||
nt|tomi2: sure|pg||
nt|tomi2: will we ever play board 10? that was an interesting one|pg||
nt|gracelin: a good result for Norway in the closed room|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah... we'll just have to wait then|pg||
nt|kaapo: At the other table, the Latvian West led the singleton @D8 against 4@S on  7|pg||
nt|kaapo: His partner won with @DQ - but the 8 was difficult to read|pg||
nt|kaapo: So instead of taking the ace and giving a ruff, he shifted to hearts and the declarer has a chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: The web site is here http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can find running score by clicking on "RUNNING SCORES: Juniors"|pg||

nt|kaapo: Our operator was needed elsewhere - thus the break|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully we'll soon be able to get back to business|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW are likely to play some number of NT on this board|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 2NT, if West opens a 14-16 1NT and East invites|pg||
nt|kaapo: And it might just about make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Someone with inside information makes a guess, that East would not invite|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rather bid 3NT straight away|pg||
nt|kaapo: That might be possible, with AKK and T9|pg||
nt|kaapo: If EW indeed play 14-16 NT when vulnerable, the East hand may be a little difficult|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi|pg||

mb|2S|nt|poohbear: I guess Osipov is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curious as to who your p was, Thomas :P|pg||
nt|henryb: but if I bid 3@d and then 3N over 3@h it lets partner do a little more. 3N is always so terminal|pg||
nt|athene: someone seems to have been corrupting the danish youth with weak notrumps|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes ty 3N on 9 can be down on @h lead if misguess @dJ|pg||

nt|mdgraham: HI Gerben|pg||
mb|p|nt|ronpa: he has, it might be a bad one but it is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 8 minutes a board|pg||

nt|othered1: could be some ambiguity with the @S spots here, but NS have lots of time|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see where declarer can get 7th trick from|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Nice double by Delle Cave, showing extras without four spades|pg||
nt|ronpa: if south started with KJx @D's with the clubs the only making play is to endplay him in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: with singleton Q@d in his hand he has a choice?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Catalin, Do you know what 1 NT is for E/W ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s do not need "coffee hands"  if they are going to come back |pg||
nt|sten: as predicted Czech Rep bid the game in board 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Charles then here S bidding game is not correct - Since points are equal & both majors with NS, S can pass |pg||
nt|davidb: duck is best |pg||
nt|poohbear: another competitive victory for the Russians|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: W is again with his head on the table |pg||
nt|gracelin: he might try 3H first to solicite a singleton honor raise|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bd 9 3@H NS in closed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This is probably making (possible over)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: note that 2000 is also 5@Hxx+2|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Haha, will do|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Usually with screens|pg||

nt|mikael_w: the opening 1 NT that is|pg||

nt|andy_h: 1@S? These guys playing transfer responses in competition?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S = i have points but no 4 spades|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: TD just made the halftime call, we're half a board late|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c natural|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least, it looks natural :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|charles_l: i think she was expecting to defend @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N taking a long time thinking...|pg||
nt|charles_l: Q and @d to kill the entry|pg||
nt|raghavan: East asked his partner to transfer to Spade. West should do so. He can bid 3Nt with a fit in Spades AXX.|pg||
nt|davidb: now Sp can declarer  problems|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere kaptaný maçtan sonra soyunma odasýnda baðýracak. rua 2liden rua omuzlamak yasak diye|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need a natural raise of the fourth suit as a fit there can easily be lost|pg||
nt|xenya: well this gives declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|mariner1: I use 12 as my cut off VUL, also play transfers VUL|pg||
nt|pelu: I have to tell that I am a chiken - 12-14 non vul - and 15-17 in red :(:(|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with 9 opposite 5-8, really?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|MolvaM: ama vugrafta rua ikiliden atak çok cazip geliyor doðrusu|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ty|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|arigun: @d guess needed to make after @c lead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|davidb: should not throw D !|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT in OR was -3|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead was 4th best @s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: just 1 imp as I have predicted|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphztr: club?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no...|pg||
nt|ritong: manno has a good idea about hands now|pg||
nt|elbec: while they're on this boring contract, can i ask somebody from russia how do girls lastname suffixes work? do they just add an "A"?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c shift probably comes from 4 cards when dummy has 4 of them|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer tries to cater with @sHx anywhere, looks ok|pg||
pc|d4|nt|charles_l: now fairly clear @sA was single|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the trump lead has made things awkward|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: bbosunu yeni açanlar için belirtelim. türk milli tk kaptaný ise milli oyuncularýmýzdan yusuf sohtorik|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kendisi þu an romanyada hem U26 hem de Kýzlar takýmýmýzýn kaptanlýðýný yapýyor|pg||
nt|elbec: i was also curious about that :)|pg||
nt|elbec: just "a" or sometimes also "ova"?|pg||
nt|xenya: -a, normally |pg||
nt|elbec: meanwhile manno di franco wheren't able to switch to clubs and now ew have 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes was excellent choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either that or it's defensive  |pg||
nt|Gerben42: he can continue with trump now, partner still stops @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but if South doesn't bid clubs at the 2-level, will he do so at the three-level?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: so west is very likely to hold 4@ds|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Gerben42: poor choice in @D cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: Poland is also blitzing Romania, boath have +42 or 43 now |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphztr: Decl led from the wrong hand here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Leading @H9 from dummy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: accepted?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yup, @D5 by N|pg||
nt|tomi2: same with France and Hungary, 4 teams leading the provisional ranking with 24 VP|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Hopefully we will get some more exsiting board by the 10 left. To many flat hands|pg||
nt|othered1: There may be more discussion between N and S here.  Second @S play by declarer seemed to clarify defense|pg||
nt|xenya: well the duck was clearly wrong|pg||
nt|sten: 2 down now unless|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: so another 10 imps for Italy is on hand|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: last chance for a @D ruff and overruff for just -3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|davidb: will need a guess now|pg||
nt|ritong: diling|pg||
pc|c7|nt|raghavan: another Spade|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this hand plays nicely |pg||
nt|xenya: as the defence has another suit to open|pg||
nt|othered1: Ping-pong result here.  Final ping by south|pg||
pc|s2|nt|waso: first big swing for Hungary|pg||
nt|waso: 13 imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not getting any easier |pg||
nt|elbec: They don't play "Smith" convention... as my friend bava says it helps a lot!|pg||
nt|elbec: now i'm afraid they'll fire their "lupara" :)|pg||
nt|othered1: simple attitude by north, clarified by east's second @S play, should have helped|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree in IMPS its probably best not to use the lower range RED|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|charles_l: after X, pass with 2 and 3@s with 3 is recommended|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|lokaty: had to play for the endplay, now defeat possibly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: small heart from dummy may have been better|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphztr: ms Hoderova thinking now...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shes picked the K then the 7 several times now|pg||
nt|raghavan: Play A and back a c|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, I would have expected a @H off of dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West does not know the Rabbi's rule- when the king is singleton play the Ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he will lose 2@Hs and the @DJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dJ|nt|Gerben42: well didnt help E|pg||
nt|lokaty: or maybe even 2 diamonds if he miss a heart next trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless E gets greedy and doesn't cash the @DJ:)|pg||

nt|gulyas: 5IMPs to Poland, who are up by 16 now|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm,  and we said "this should make" |pg||
nt|pelu: William - u are british - the weak NT came from GB (Acol)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, people sometimes just avoid the bad 12 counts, but then you are restricting how often you open 1nt which rather defeats the object|pg||
nt|athene: i think if you are going to play it you have to go for it|pg||
nt|mamos: wow prediction correct|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Sikora made (!) 3@H in the other room playing from E|pg||
nt|Gerben42: got a fav. @C leda|pg||
nt|rodal f: I have probs there as themost of us |pg||
mb|p|an|hearts|nt|waso: onlly with  the Ace of club lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S was too much is Open Room here|pg||
nt|poohbear: n the best signal|pg||
nt|poohbear: counting is often the best signal|pg||
nt|poohbear: East should realize she cant beat this without the @c ace|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they play with 5 5 5 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: solid 2NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit too solid for me|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room south upgraded and opened 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: puppet stayman?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i play 2NT as 20-21|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yeah...whadda we know|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d probably|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise you end up like rixi markus - someone once asked her "have you ever played the weak nt?"|pg||
nt|athene: "sort of" she said|pg||
nt|charles_l: both minors - just what N wanted :)|pg||

nt|MolvaM: iþte ingilterenin þleme gitme ihtimali yüksek bir el|pg||
nt|arigun: 6@c/NT is excellent but hard too reach after 2nt|pg||
nt|poohbear: Cicek needs to have a balanced @c slam try available to bid past 3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: 12 tricks is a very n ice result.  |pg||
nt|elbec: almost automatic with a @s lead...|pg||
nt|athene: "i agreed to play it with nico gardener once, but obviously i never opened one"|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 10 - 14 NV 2 way stayman, and 12-15 RED transfers on|pg||
nt|mikael_w: maybe this preemptive can get E/W to hi in @h|pg||
nt|mamos: is that two suited ? or a standard (non-standard) weak Two ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may be played X'd |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5552|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: I dont know|pg||

nt|poohbear: ok I am told they open 1D with that|pg||

nt|ritong: or something doubled|pg||
nt|othered1: On @S lead, which likely would not be made against slam|pg||
nt|elbec: i guess 1nt is forcing :)|pg||
nt|athene: i agree, in england, all club players are fed on weak nt from birth|pg||
nt|rodal f: And end at 4 @H I belive|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it has not been apparent but the 2C bid suggests that N/S are playing a strongclub system|pg||
nt|sten: interesting to watch the difference in bidding on board 8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2Sx looks like final contract but....|pg||
mb|1D|nt|poohbear: so 1D could be 4-4-4-1 |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe|pg||
nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: umudumuz rakibin 4kör oynamasý|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy to make 4@S, not obvious to bid it though|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think N should bid 4@s right away|pg||
nt|athene: but eventually we wean ourselves from it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: England managed to disgrace themselves in the open room|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H actually could make, not that you can bid it|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d on for EW here  or 3NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: durun caným 6@h varken neden 4@h ile yetinelim|pg||

nt|kastan88: upgraded 1@S opening may be not giving to NS find their game, esp after 1NT from East|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3nt?|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'd remove to 2@S here if 2@C is conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk4: agreed|pg||

nt|ronpa: so another 11 imps for Israel |pg||
nt|frusco: no so difficult make 1 nt|pg||
nt|lokaty: there was an amazing 1NT of Franchi on the 2nd room in this board.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: OR in @s :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: close DBL that should work here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South must be contemplting 3H which looks a bit much|pg||
nt|sten: in the match between England and France they were in slam and on their way but stopped in 5h on the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 8 I waited a minisplinter from E, but hard|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as does a t/o double but it must show 4 hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: both N and S were passed hands, unlikely to balance on the 4 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: a wow lead by N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C is conv, yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT as an opening bid can often be a slam-killer|pg||

nt|h bertens: forward goiing with @S cuebid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|babydolldk: this should be down 1|pg||

nt|davidb: 3NT was sp splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: sogreece more ro less get it all back on this deal|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has to guess which black finesse to take in 3nt but both work. Likely takes the one thru the overcaller|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey bu kontru ceza niyetine attý ama güney bunu çözebilecek mi?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe NS raise frequently on 3|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think in netherlands it is popular to raise 1@S on 3 cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, so youre less likely to find fit now|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that NS play weak multi and 2@S/@H a little better|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no, but still a double income foe sweden and some IMP:s back from rhe slam|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes 4@H is too close to be in it if you can get 300 sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Ns have majority of points = South's 1NT +10 points with N normally should go down - |pg||
nt|mariner1: this might be a perfect Roland slam, 12.89 % that makes :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: (that % is a true guesstimate)|pg||
nt|waso: France avoided any trap  and bid 5d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Going for a sign of in 3@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense was on thier toes |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did well to not help S figure out N's suit|pg||

nt|rodal f: Something are stolen from NS now. Not more then 300 down EW|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: Morris in open room at equal vulnerabiklity went for an advance save when he should have downgraded his ten count to seven points with the position of the KH known to be under the ...|pg||

nt|athene: on a spade lead you can just hold up the @SA twice and then not let north in, although you are less happy, certainly|pg||
nt|athene: not a trivial declarer problem |pg||

nt|othered1: Has the "Keller" approach to partnership behavior at the table found its way to Italy yet?|pg||
nt|elbec: what is it?|pg||
nt|othered1: After Helen Keller, partnership is deaf, dumb and blind to each other's actions at the table.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|charles_l: even ruff 3rd @c to @h up doesn't work - trump promo for def|pg||
nt|raghavan: No useful discards from East hand. |pg||
nt|charles_l: @hK seems wrong - where is @c loser going if not 3-3?|pg||
nt|ritong: might have worked finding opener with say @h Jxx and no @s loser, but, as any very marginal shot, this unlikely, so costs on the long run|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Do they play 2-way Stayman?|pg||
nt|elbec: we're too italian for that :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|capercliff: and a pretty skimpy invite opposite 11-13|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: 7c is a good proposition if West has Kxx of clubs instead|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is alerted because they respond 2@C also on balanced hands even with spade fit, so it could be on 2 cards only|pg||
nt|gracelin: so only 4C confirmed the club fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2nt is forcing and 3@C confirms some support|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C confirms the fit, 4@H is a cuebid|pg||
nt|tomi2: and i got a hint from on of their teammembers, that 4@S is blackwood for clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did I see 2@S first?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: and @D (restricted choice says finesse 2nd round)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|poohbear: well not quite both but something extra|pg||

pc|h3|nt|poohbear: which finesse taken?|pg||

nt|poohbear: Israel has been the hottest team over the last 5 matches. They got off to a weak start but are rapidly moving up the standings|pg||
nt|ronpa: declacrer started with low @C from hand to guard against @C's 4-0 on his right but all the ways leads to 12 tricks|pg||

nt|tomi2: 4nt = 1 or 4 keycards in clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: seems right, that 4S didn't like a cue bid :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: so if West could show 2 key-card with a 5D reply, East would bid 7C|pg||

pc|s7|nt|poohbear: Important at this stage to pass as many teams as possible so as to have a clear path at the leaders. Even if the standings bunch up it is hard to overtake many teams. Easier if you ...|pg||

nt|gracelin: a wild hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Great|pg||
nt|kaapo: I won't have to start explaining about different NT ranges then :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ok, so Sweden brought 13 IMPs for making 4@S|pg||

nt|sybarra2: taking small break here folks  not to worry |pg||

nt|tomi2: Rusch could have opened @D's for partner for -2 I think, but thats "only" one non vul undertrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: may be disappointed with that score|pg||
nt|gulyas: mad scramble? I call it the 'greedy algorythm':)|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: they are so closed...|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@h is good here|pg||

nt|gulyas: top of the leaderboard, too|pg||
nt|mamos: ok  so maybe the bit oif luck the Dutch needed top  Club lead certainly helped|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was not expecting them to reach 4S - they got there easily when North bid 2S over oppo's 1NT|pg||
nt|sten: Norway this time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tomi2: this is a very nice board, difficult decisions to make for all players involved|pg||
nt|kaapo: And another 6 for bidding 4@S on  8|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: lol Henri :) @H|pg||

mb|2D|nt|poohbear: You specs arent paying attn . usually 20 people jump on me :P|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess the limits are 4S for NS and 5D for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: but surely they will bid higher than that|pg||
nt|rodal f: U remember from own exsperiens? And ure still hard by ure biddings:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all,   have fun!|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye Sherl|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Marion is thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, naturally|pg||
mb|2N|an|3+ hearts, invite +|nt|charles_l: 3@s cue and RKC?|pg||
nt|h bertens: lead did not matter even simple make on trump lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|davidb: 4spX is par in this board|pg||
nt|poohbear: North should bid 2@c only|pg||
nt|MolvaM: üçüncüden oyun açanda 13 kart bulunmasý yeterlidir konvansiyonu bu|pg||
nt|gracelin: as spec pointed out, even 4S maybe difficult for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess south will not give up yet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, 4@S 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S can have longer @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S is alerted because a) it can have longer @D and b) it can be on 3 cards sometimes|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT with 13 to 9 is never obvious|pg||
nt|ritong: the bid is problematic|pg||
nt|athene: on that auction south might have tried 3@S over 3@H but it's pretty rare you have a 4-4 spade fit after pd bids both red suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N does get it done quick here|pg||
nt|athene: you are supposed to have 4333 and soft values for 3nt and south sure has that|pg||
nt|athene: those cards are so soft you could use them to stuff pillows|pg||
nt|pelu: but what is Ns problem??|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has good count however N would have to have a lot of controls to make above 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: safe|pg||
nt|athene: north is wondering how he can get to play it? dunno|pg||
nt|athene: i wld say north has a pretty good hand for 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: are we waiting for East to bid? 4@D?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H are a good contract for EW - down 1-2|pg||
nt|mariner1: S bid to me shows what he has|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: "whoa" she thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bob bid with his 3 of hearts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think they are friends:)|pg||
nt|rayhaa: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Canbecome an intresting board.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|poohbear: in my opinion|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how they handle this|pg||
nt|poohbear: are they playing a Polish style system Adrian?|pg||
nt|poohbear: that would make 3@c the correct bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: since opener is limited by failure to open 1C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: sporting X by W :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East is not being backward in coming forward here|pg||
nt|ritong: ya sure|pg||
nt|ritong: he really wants to take the cues away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, Mike "the cryptical" Graham :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with all those goodies, West may bid 4@S |pg||
nt|frusco: after 3@s ovest must to bid 4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe Sikora thought it was "go ahead with a 5-4"|pg||
nt|frusco: west sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can West be 3-2 in the majors?|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|capercliff: N needs to do something here|pg||
nt|mamos: yes I was looking back at hand   you have plenty of tricks on cross ruff|pg||
nt|Gerben42: red vs white North has a tricky bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: not my cup of tea |pg||
nt|charles_l: the @hK is a big card|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: sorry, the play had |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: gone on but i missed it. 3@h went down 1|pg||
nt|charles_l: np, ty|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Osipov said: 'nice fit' :)|pg||
nt|ritong: even 2/1 for that matter|pg||
nt|ritong: and the whoa is confirmed with a second cue|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well into the fire as they say|pg||
nt|mariner1: to me N has a clear pass,,,,,,,, learning experience|pg||
nt|pelu: yes her bid was correct and N has some funny ideas - and will pay|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: probably W knows his partners agressive jumps -if not 4sp is ok nv|pg||
nt|davidb: A h & h looks safe vs 3-2 in trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump length suggests 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D seems to understate his hand a bit, i think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|poohbear: and that would also make 3NT an easy bid by South|pg||
nt|ritong: this hand seems to be a matter of undertrick(s)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d a bit enthusiastic|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: holding 3 good spades and 2 bad hearts this system allows you to bid 1@S and partner rightside NT contract - but he can also find out later about your 3 cards if he has a strong ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told NS play 2@c as balanced 18-19|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s is cold obviously|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think both N and S shod do somerhing more here|pg||
nt|mamos: so that was the first board of the second half  will there be a Dutch revival ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Robert wants to ask for a stopper really, but how...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C would seem reasonable|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: Have to go nowm folks and leave u to this exciting encounter between these promising young bloods|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Mike|pg||
nt|ritong: three down looks normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bessis bid a quiet 2@d in the OR and played there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý 1@c açýp bir sürü þlem buluruz diye hazýrlanmýþ ama rahat býrakmýyor rakipler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@c sizce nasýl kontrat?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, I see we lost 2 board :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT was mini|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D looks like a 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which is a gameforcing relay|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT denies 4c majors, and probably also denies 5-card minors|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@S shows 5|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT shows 2 @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C forced 2@D to show a sign off in @D or some stronger hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C forces 2@D, but maybe there is a case for bidding 2@H here, since so many @D fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A great result for Sweden |pg||
nt|yuval10: reasonable bidding, yes still a big swing in favour of Sweden|pg||
nt|yuval10: *yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a nice recovery after 0-48 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|charles_l: rehi. i see i missed some excitement|pg||
nt|elbec: indeed NS are fighting|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now there are 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: Grosset needs to unblock|pg||
nt|kaapo: This shows a draw back in 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Since West hasn't got 4@H nor 5 cards in a minor...|pg||
nt|kaapo: And he has 2@S...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Wow, I wish I could pen X at the 1-level lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: anyway, gotta go|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks all|pg||
nt|andy_h: See you later Gerben|pg||

nt|hedyg: i bet Lorenzini is hurting|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3@H has some entry problems: you need 2 entries to dummy to take  finesses in @D|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@h must deny @c@d cues|pg||
pc|hA|nt|charles_l: find the @cQ for 3N|pg||
nt|raghavan: breather given by defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT shouldnt be too difficult . Declarer prob just unblocks spades and ducks a @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: and falls back on the @d finesse if @cs dont break|pg||
nt|henryb: I would only have bid 2@h; but I am old|pg||
nt|ritong: with north hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: no, with S|pg||
nt|ritong: was an option, yes|pg||
nt|henryb: and the auction might continue 6@h by north|pg||

nt|ritong: that s the way ahan ahan i like it|pg||
nt|pelu: ok "only" down 1 - but 600 looks better :)|pg||

nt|lokaty: I disagree with 4 @S. 3@S doesnt promise anything more then 2@D, his @C values arent impressive and they are not vulnerable.|pg||
nt|gulyas: the lead giving away a trick, but still not enough for declarer probably|pg||
nt|ritong: DID NOT EXPECT MORE|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidb: he is still ok|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|yuval10: 11 tricks now are likely|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 10 imps for Sweden|pg||

nt|mariner1: 5@C is 50% on the hook, which fails|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: well, this is not really hurting|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, 3@s does not promise more than 2@d?|pg||
nt|ritong: are we deprived of green cards?|pg||

pc|d3|nt|poohbear: Boye loves those!  Hideous hog like but no one would ever consider him for that title given his boyish looks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|poohbear: worked out well |pg||
nt|phil: if Boye played the squeeze in 6N for the up, you know he's going to play this one out|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poohbear: Oops gave him the @s suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|poohbear: Again lee holds the one suit he doesnt need to hold|pg||
nt|phil: I just don't like Roger's x, it really hangs partner for making a lite overcall|pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree Phil. Especially without @d coverage and no ace|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: we used to call it "The San Diego Confirmation"|pg||
nt|phil: and I guarantee you he would overcall himself on the North hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where DBL confirms, "yes - i had my 3@D bid"|pg||
nt|phil: lol|pg||
nt|poohbear: Boye doesnt know how many overtricks to go for!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ALL OF THEM :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: He know he has a sure 11 by playing @cs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|poohbear: but @s could have produced 12|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|poohbear: goes for the sure 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: won't be able to take last with deuce this time :(|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Played the wrong slam on 66|pg||
nt|poohbear: 8|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: especially with the director hovering, but from what I can tell its NS at the other table that is the culprit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: played 6@s instead of 6@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: that was the hand NS played 3NT here off the whole @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: safer to overcall 2@d than to double 2@s? |pg||
pc|c5|nt|poohbear: so Greenberg picks up a fortunate 10 imps when they could have lost 15|pg||
nt|poohbear: I never consider overcalling AQxxx as safer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I just dont|pg||
nt|phil: than a 3 level balance? |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you ever consider balancing double with 2 of other major safe? |pg||
nt|poohbear: I might stay fixed|pg||
nt|phil: maybe|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: but hard to pass with xxx in spades|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|poohbear: especially when partner bids 2NT with doubt about suit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: why does xxx make it hard to pass?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@H here almost guarantees 5|pg||

nt|poohbear: cause opps in an 8 card fit Al |pg||
nt|phil: sorry for the broken url - just go to viewsfromthebridgetable.blogspot.com|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont want to let them play 2@s when I have weak @s|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|phil: I hate overcalling with @sxxx, but the @d9 swings it for me|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 1@S-2@S said 8 card fit -- your holding xxx seems irrelevant   i think|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- at this vul, xxx seems good  for defense!|pg||
nt|poohbear: well let me ask you. Would you balance with xx in @ss?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|phil: and with 22(45) you have 2N available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly I either overcall 2@D or take my chances against 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H is transfer showing 4+@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: I am just saying you KNOW partner has xx in @s so does it matter who dbls?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: otherwise its a natural auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C is 2+   but not after 2@D rebid|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think hand with xxx doubles only if reasonable expectation of fit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|poohbear: well we are on board 14. I wonder if the director changed his mind|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or forgot to tell this table?|pg||
nt|phil: other table hasnt picked up speed at all - all the way to board  9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|poohbear: Fantoni not unreasonably went down in 4@s on 9|pg||
nt|poohbear: there was no competition so he played @ss from the top hoping to curtail the @d ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: unfortunately for him @ss were 3-1 with the king on|pg||
nt|phil: that feels like a win with the opps having a vul game on|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|poohbear: interesting hand here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Fantunes system 1 level bids are 14+ HCP and forcing -- i wonder how many times that keeps opponents out of the auction versus normal 10/11+ |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|phil: while we are talking about overcalls, on that board Boye had no problem overcalling on 2@c with AQ9xx fwiw|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|poohbear: what does declarer do now on a @h play?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3-4-1-5 and more playing strength|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: duck?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|phil: better spade holding for sure|pg||
nt|poohbear: that works cause @hs 5-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when does it lose?|pg||
nt|poohbear: @d shift now ?|pg||
