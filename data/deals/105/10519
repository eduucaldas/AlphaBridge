nt|super nova: yes.. I dont understand the Auction myself.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|beauch: me either- they must play double of 4S as penalties|pg||
nt|super nova: 4s X may have been penalty.. but don tknow.. I know that Ron (who played for many years with lilley) plays basically ALL x = t/o|pg||

mc|9|nt|beauch: not a method i would advocate- but maybe thats why im not playing!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I play 4n as take out only because there 'tend' to be too much trouble with x = t.o as we can see it happened here.|pg||
