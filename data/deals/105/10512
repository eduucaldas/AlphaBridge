nt|super nova: yeah I know that it can be tricky to work out the time difference between zones.|pg||
nt|super nova: so when Vugraph says 11:30. |pg||
nt|super nova: I am in the zone so just calculate the mins so everyone else can just look at their watch and know how long.|pg||
nt|caitlin: so let's just say 25 minutes or so:) to keep people like me on time!!!|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: you just bid game|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pbundy: and here - let's see if they can just bid slam|pg||
nt|athene: east has the world facing a hand which can bid 4th suit forcing |pg||
nt|pbundy: yes - but - what to rebid?|pg||
nt|pbundy: no diamond stopper, despite the extra values|pg||
nt|athene: i would just bid 2@H i think and see what pd does|pg||
nt|athene: assuming 2@D is GF of course|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't mind 3@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but it sort of gets in the way of partner who was intending to bid clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: 4@C would my choice with the west hand|pg||
nt|athene: this is one of the typical problems with traditional 4th suit forcing auctions|pg||
nt|pbundy: with 2 bullets and that club suit, cannot do less - i do not think|pg||
nt|athene: it's always assumed that the 4th suit bidder is ASKING for information|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but sometimes you use 4th suit simply to set up a GF so you can support partner's second suit in a forcing way|pg||
nt|pbundy: i merely assume that west was announcing they were in a game forcing auction|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes the players end up treading on each other's toes - as here|pg||
nt|athene: if you don't have lots of agreements|pg||
nt|pbundy: i must take off.  enjoy the rest of the match!|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|athene: but you can get a diamond away on a heart, so 6@C is where you want to be|pg||
