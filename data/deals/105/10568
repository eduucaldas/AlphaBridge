mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|me argent: xx promises 3@Hs a usefull convention playing precesion|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: last set finished on a slam hand that neither side reached. Thus s thinks is this another one?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|me argent: but not crazy about that convention when not playing a forcing @C|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: support X (aand XX) work well regardless of system...  they work well with any strong NT based system|pg||
mc|10|nt|me argent: after opening 1@D playing precesion hard to know what fits what so convenient 2 know that ther is a fit out ther somewhere|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|an|16+|mb|1N!|an|minors|mb|d!|an|6-7|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: now S has a huge hand|pg||
nt|reisig: @d K became ...BIG|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bigtrain: S has upgraded his 15 to a strong club...  which i concur with|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: does meck bid his hand or go 4 the throat?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|me argent: 4 the throat|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't particularly like the X...  with the majors and constructive values, i like to get the hand off my chect|pg||
nt|bigtrain: chest|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: nor does 2@d look clear either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: This should be 5 iMPs back toLynch|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: strange choice to bid 2@C...  with equal length, one would think that XX would be indicated|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: Quite a slam last hand ... sorry I missed it!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Walk faster!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Srry Karen we should have waited for you.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a lot to be said for potting 3N on the S hand. yes, it could go wrong, though only in 50s. but S could hardly have a better hand. and the KEY point is that N will rarely ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: be in a position on a borderline hand to bid 3N himself over any other call by S|pg||
nt|kareno: hahaha|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: this is a 3 way match, with comparisons for only the 2nd part of the match|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|kareno: Richie :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and did i mention protecting the spade tenace? 3N might even make when 3D goes down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|reisig: Hiya K :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: hi karen and richie and valerie :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: and specs!!|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|reisig: I guess nobody would overcall 1@h and end all this chatter :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: some of us might|pg||
nt|kareno: Chunky four card suit - possible overcall.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: will claim in a sec, sorry I lost track|pg||
mc|11|nt|me argent: chiu will be quite disapointed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: He has actually left the room it appears...|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: now put yourself in partner's shoes :)|pg||
nt|me argent: if NS had not stagered into game i doubt chiu doubles|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: The format basically is explained on the website www.usbf.org|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 6@c an interesting contract e/w|pg||
nt|reisig: 6@d in other room...@c seems better|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vdoubleu: Yers|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you can sustain a bad diamond break (or guess) in clubs more easily than in diamonds.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: More chances than just locating the dimaond J.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|me argent: if 3@Ss was forcing then i am wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: you can sustain 4-1 clubs also|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|reisig: They don't seem headed toward @ds :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is going to have an ugly hand to lead from. (though not as ugly as to bid from). the deadly spade seems likely (deadly for the defense)|pg||
nt|kareno: Good raise by Lynch!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|me argent: personally i would never bid a non forcing 3@Ss with norts hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: this was set with a Club lead in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Lall got the chance to double for the lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, key here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only a club gives away nothing.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 4@d=keycard?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd guess yes, Valerie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: H gives away nothing|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: N is lucky that E bid 4S|pg||
nt|kareno: So, no double of spades eliminates that lead for north.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: confirmed 4d= blackwood 4s 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no X of 4S, may avoid that suit on lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: OK., maybe.|pg||
nt|reisig: @c seems pretty safe|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: he will itch to lead a trump, but finally wont i predict|pg||
nt|kareno: Finds a safe lead.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: safe yes, but against small slam will tend to attack. it is not like N is sitting behind declarer's tenaces with high cards|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s8|pc|hQ|nt|kareno: South might have played the jack of hearts to give west some bad options (ruffing out QJ of hearts).|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c6|nt|me argent: keep winners throw losers|pg||
mc|12|nt|Vugraphu8: sorry, my lag here is making it a bit tough :(|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: 4S NS? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kareno: So a possible swing turns into a push board.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: How many NT here? 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|me argent: this looks like a push|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|reisig: depends ..what 2N means|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Most play it as invitational, no?|pg||
nt|reisig: or a relay to 3@c :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Won't make with a heart lead.  Declarer needs an entry to establish diamonds and one to cash them.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kareno: I play it invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope take that back.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it looks cold to me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, it does after diamond finesse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Doesn't need an entry to establish them - they are 3-3 with king onside.|pg||
nt|kareno: I took it back folks :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But, must grab the ace at once.|pg||
nt|reisig: spec are non-forgiving|pg||
nt|kareno: And pray for rain.|pg||
nt|kareno: They are brutal :)  I love it!!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No other play, he will.|pg||
nt|kareno: He is just double checking for any other possibilities.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: with S ace onside, as cards lie S does not need to win the ace|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|kareno: Okay, here comes our line of play :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vdoubleu: (anyone's):)|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, this line of play has its attractions, but it is not as if there are no alternatives. clubs are as likely to be 3-3 as diamonds. this line is best as u dont need to knock out ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade ace, but others ought to be considered before rejecting them :) |pg||
nt|kareno: Good effort for a push board|pg||

nt|kareno: Snapdragon double was employed in the CR to get east as declarer in spades.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|2N|nt|kareno: The auction started 1@c - 1@d - 1@h - double, showing spades with heart tolerance.|pg||

nt|robinswr: i would upgrad the two 10's and the 98 and open 1nt|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, was thinking he would/|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vdoubleu: We all can see the defense has the first 5 tricks, for the taking.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|robinswr: but spade lead is normal|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: Like Goldfein, Lee is now in the tank :)|pg||
nt|me argent: think he owes partner a bid|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: 3@s must be better than 4@H here (if you want to help partner to slam that is)|pg||
nt|me argent: nope|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: starting investigations at the 5level doesnt sound right to me :)|pg||
nt|me argent: west knows that partner doesnt have @CA|pg||
mb|4S|nt|me argent: so 3@Ss almost forces 2 slam|pg||

nt|kareno: I'd consider bidding 3nt with that north hand...|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianwbjones: a limited hand isnt slam forcing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: The strong hand will be hidden and it may take only the lead to give it away.|pg||

nt|robinswr: i play that 2nt shows the top half of the weak notrump and 2diamonds (art or natural) followed by 2nt shows 11-12 balanced|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: if you're gonna bid 4@h, the least you can do is help partner if he wants to look for slam|pg||
