nt|athene: 3@C shape asking, and so on|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: but a shape relay really won't solve north's problem because the key is not south's distribution, but rather his honour location|pg||
nt|athene: that's why, if you play these methods, you try to organise it so that the balanced hand asks and the unbalanced hand describes |pg||
nt|vugraphztw: CR played 5@C +2 by N|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: a spec suggests that south's failure to cue spades might have helped north|pg||
nt|vugraphztw: Good point|pg||
nt|daman: http://tinyurl.com/ncmmqs  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the trouble here is that any spade lead must be ruffed with big diamonds in the North hand - the @D8 may come into play later |pg||
