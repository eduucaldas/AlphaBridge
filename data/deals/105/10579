mb|p|nt|mug: yes, he hasn't been tapped in dummy|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: the trump split will make this interesting for a moment, but should always make at least 4, if not 5@h|pg||

mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: close match now|pg||
nt|mug: no, we meant pitching the heart on @D10, drawing trumps and giving up @CA|pg||
nt|jtr: But the French have a team of 8 today|pg||
nt|mug: anyway we should perhaps move on|pg||
nt|jtr: ah right Tom|pg||

nt|mug: @HAJ and cash the diamonds before drawing the remaining trumps|pg||

nt|jtr: pp16|pg||
nt|mug: Athey probably ought to have doubled to involve partner rather than driving the 5-level himself with only three trumps|pg||
nt|mug: but Owen would have pulled so it came to the same thing|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|jtr: Would Owen expect 3@hs for the double?|pg||
nt|mug: he'll make 5@H no probems with hearts 3-2 onside, draw trumps and concede a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so clear  I think he did well to bid 5@h|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think he wouldn't, so 5@H was reasonable|pg||

nt|mug: a chance for England to take the lead in this match|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@c is a nice spot|pg||

nt|jtr: But he did enter the bidding later|pg||
nt|hedyg: well yes with double over 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Just as well he did|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Double was asking for a @h lead there, although I'm not sure how obvious that was from the bidding|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: well he didnt double 2@s to show an honour in @s so asking for lead in dummies 1st suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: which was @hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|mug: double probably just promised hearts, so Athey couldn't bid over 2@H|pg||

nt|jtr: 16 tricks|pg||
nt|mug: I'm trying to figure out what the CR auction meant|pg||
nt|ritong: i wonder if volcker will jump raise|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Almost everyone in 7@d here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ritong: if so, missa est|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: One pair wound up in 3NT :O|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|jtr: Only 13 tricks in NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ritong: kind of jump raise|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I won't share that auction... it's an auction rated R|pg||
nt|mug: looks like 4@D was RKCB and 5@D presumably the correct response|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can show 2+Q@d now|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|hedyg: hmmm with 5 @ds show Q@d as well|pg||
nt|mug: although I'd have thought 5@C would be the 4-step response to show 2 + queen|pg||
nt|ritong: not a bad idea although 2@d does not promise 5+|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Results at all the other tables on this hand here: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=018.23..732|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he still has 5 card fit|pg||
nt|mug: Bessis doesn't know about the fifth trump opposite|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: How bad can it be to show the Q?|pg||
nt|ritong: you need to be sure of a ten cards fit to do that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think East should show it|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, if you dont show it then you can never bid 7 if partner has 5|pg||
nt|ritong: pard can insist|pg||
nt|jtr: At worst it will be on a @d break|pg||
nt|mug: don't see why he would gamble seven on a 9-card fit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He certainly has 1 trump more than Bessis expects|pg||
nt|hedyg: why should he, you have denied it!|pg||
nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: If he bids 5NT now, Volcker should bid 7@d I think...|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: if you dont bid it you dont have it|pg||
nt|jtr: And, after 3@c, partner is more likely to have 5|pg||
nt|ritong: kewl|pg||
nt|ritong: so as we said, pard can insist|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to try creations, particularly in the vulnerable grand slam zone|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: the only doubt is about the K@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|ritong: vulnerable or not, for that matter|pg||
nt|jtr: Bessis has done amazingly well here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: Cant say the same for Volcker:(|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, sadly it won't pay off it looks like|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: bessis still thinking...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He has tried everything possible to get to 7@d, but Volcker has been quite pessimistic|pg||
nt|hedyg: the kid has great instincts|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, wondering about 4@c with apparently nothing good|pg||
nt|mug: 4@C was a fine bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have AKQ@H|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so, but tom wonders what is going on|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mtvesuvius: WOW|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: well done!|pg||
nt|ritong: and takes charge|pg||
nt|jtr: Incredible|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|mtvesuvius: amazing|pg||
nt|mug: I hope the French don't mind if I say this auction was not entirely convincing|pg||
nt|jtr: Give partner 2 chances to bid 7 then bid it yourself:)|pg||

nt|Walddk3: 5NT was waste of time, wasn't it?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|mtvesuvius: As long as 6@d was not bid out of tempo, Bessis was good, but if it was, then he has a problem|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, if 6@d denied a K then East is maybe marked with 5@ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: it sure didnt look out of tempo here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: exactly|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'm just saying that he would have had trouble if it was|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he thought he could pick the @d after the 3@c bid vulnerable|pg||
nt|hedyg: they would have called the TD by now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It would have been harder to justify the 7@d bid then :)|pg||
