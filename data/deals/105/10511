mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|athene: if 2@C was GF in the other room (as it surely must have been) then east owed his partner another bid over 3NT|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|athene: i'm told 2@C wasn't GF in the closed room on the previous hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it's surprising to supress the 4-card spade suit in that case|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|athene: one discard on the diamond doesn't help so you might as well go for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and play for making or -2 (or -3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either pass or 2@D now from south|pg||
nt|athene: he certainly has some extras|pg||
nt|athene: but game is unlikely when partner doesn't pass the double|pg||

pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||

nt|athene: enabling him to finesse trumps|pg||
nt|athene: but 8 tricks was fine|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: even @CA and run the @C10|pg||
nt|athene: setting up a club pitch|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: that might be ideal as you can later get the fourth spade awya|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pbundy: north does not have a very attractive lead now|pg||
nt|pbundy: he appreciates partner won't have much ...|pg||
nt|athene: well south is on lead|pg||
nt|athene: which helps him out a bit :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: OH :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: that is true...|pg||
mb|5C|nt|pbundy: this would be my choice of leads - although it gives declarer a trick immediately|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to lead a suit in which dummy or declarer has length, you generally underlead three honours|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because you hope partner has something useful and you don't want to block the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: your small card isn't winning the fourth round anyway|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||

nt|caitlin: why?|pg||
nt|super nova: and then back for 10 more.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|super nova: I believe they start with board 9 since they areopen room|pg||
nt|super nova: then board 10|pg||
pc|d3|nt|super nova: then back to 1 for the comparisons|pg||

pc|sT|mc|10|nt|vugrapha1: The next ten board session will commence at 11.30 EST|pg||
nt|super nova: 24 min|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: During the break we will try to fix the comparrisons.|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2 1/2 hours from now?|pg||
nt|super nova: 24 mins|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wondered as I am in Eastern zone but North America:)|pg||
nt|super nova: yeah I know that it can be tricky to work out the time difference between zones.|pg||
nt|super nova: so when Vugraph says 11:30. |pg||
nt|super nova: I am in the zone so just calculate the mins so everyone else can just look at their watch and know how long.|pg||
nt|caitlin: so let's just say 25 minutes or so:) to keep people like me on time!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: then another 90 mins for the start of the 5th and 6th stanza|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Jamie|pg||
nt|super nova: if you say 25 then they will be one minute late ;-)|pg||
nt|caitlin: of course:)|pg||

nt|caitlin: lol:)|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: The comparisions appear to still be incorrect.|pg||
