nt|joest: i'm told Ramer was born in Poland|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: So, a heart game and a potential spade sacrifice.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: I didn't know I needed to know life histories to do this! :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Support Double from North, showing three-card spade support.|pg||
nt|joest: so Balicki kicks off the Polish club, either strong or minimum balanced|pg||
nt|joest: Double = three card spade support|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East could bid 2@S now to show a sound heart raise. Oh, he has preferred 3@C.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Table talk is all in Polish, so may be hard for me to capture the jovial mood...|pg||
nt|joest: which makes you wonder whether 3@c should be natural David|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@S would have been an unambiguous cue-bid.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||

nt|brolucius: You are more popular than me!|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|brolucius: The trump switch has restricted declarer to only one spade ruff.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|joest: so he'll need to decide whether to hook the club or ruff it out|pg||
nt|joest: north known to be 3-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|joest: the answer would also depend on the n-s NT range which I confess I don't know|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Roald Ramer and Michal Kwiecien won a couple of days ago the Von Zedtwitz Life Master Pairs here in Wash. DC |pg||
nt|joest: they did indeed|pg||
nt|brolucius: They will not be averse to adding another big one.|pg||

nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|joest: good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it would be nice to be able to open the west hand, but with what?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Too many flaws for 2@H (four spades AND a side void).|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: this is an interesting treatment.  Usually this is for the two lower: hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: A vulnerable 2NT commands respect and West will probably bid game now.|pg||
nt|joest: but west has a great hand no matter what major east has!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Ramer just asked a director for a scoresheet; director happily complied.  Kwiecen pulled the stop card before playing 2nt, which annoyed south|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|brolucius: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: ... I couldn't possibly say|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h is an odd call (unless fit showing by a passed hand)|pg||
nt|joest: behind screens some players feel the stop card unnecessary|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, I see.|pg||
nt|joest: you can control the tempo of your own preempt|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then they should remove the Stop cards from the box.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: There are no screens here.  They're playing in the main ballroom, with the rest of all the Spingold matches as well as Mini-Spingolds.|pg||
nt|joest: ok if no screens, then I agree with David|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: unless one disagrees with the whole premise of a stop card|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Sorry, this pass was instantaneous.  Ramer is taking the time here.|pg||
nt|joest: I'm told that 2NT was 'clubs and a major' thereby making 4@h pass or correct|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that makes sense. It seems to make less sense that West is thinking about bidding further.|pg||
nt|joest: Ramer obviously content to play 4@h if partner had hearts but maybe more if partner had spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: His void club is not much of an advantage when declarer will probably have to set up the clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: An apparent bidding misunderstanding.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|joest: i don't think Ramer is reading 2NT right|pg||
