nt|joest: I hope you all are looking forward to these final 15 boards as much as we are|pg||

nt|kareno: Roland :)  Mike :)  George :)  Jack :)  Al :)  Dan :)|pg||
nt|joest: hi|pg||
nt|kareno: And hi specs from sunny Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|joest: it has been a long ten days but the road to Brazil is going to end for one of these two teams very shortly|pg||
nt|lestergold: 23 imps the difference 15 boards anytyhing can happen|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: TONs?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: have you seen the boards already?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- it would have been more if we really had meckwell here too|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: are there many 5@h5m hands?|pg||
nt|joest: Granovetter has a big hand but Zia and Hamman have both distribution and the spades|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|an|supp|nt|hedyg: good evening and welcome back to the United States Bridge Championship 2009, White Plains, New York, USA; final, segment 5/6|pg||
nt|kareno: Dick Freeman had to leave the tournament because of illness so they are playing four-handed in the final.  If Nickell wins I am positive that pair will come back in for Sao Paolo!!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: N will remove the trap aspect|pg||
nt|joest: Zia starts low even though I'm sure he has a two suit call available to him.    That's because the two suit calls are not typically employed when it could be your hand|pg||
nt|joest: I guess you close your eyes and bid 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like the practical bid.|pg||
nt|joest: i mean your partner is allowed to have the queen of clubs once in a while|pg||
nt|daman: pressure right away|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: will Rubin sit?|pg||
nt|joest: Zia will take out insurance and bid on|pg||
nt|joest: the question then becomes what does Rubin do over that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: if Zia came with 4@d Rubin would have had a clearer idea.  now he doesn't|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|scotty: Zia doesn't know his whole is facing a void - though he might expect shortness there.  Also Hamman could have @sQ, which might well be enough to make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4N scramble - 2 places to play|pg||
nt|joest: now I ask you: is this natural or 'two places to play' ?|pg||
nt|kareno: 4NT two places to play??  |pg||
nt|daman: 2|pg||
nt|joest: at these colors I guess you would whack them if it were natural|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: he's already shown 0-4|pg||
nt|joest: good point too Dan|pg||
nt|scotty: Meanwhile, Rubin had a problem, and it may result in a dreamlike reult for Zia|pg||
nt|scotty: result|pg||
nt|joest: it now rates to go 5@c - 5@d - 5@h|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, Zia and Hamman definitely had something to do with crafting this result.|pg||
nt|joest: and will Hamman take out the axe to try to get a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|daman: mainly Hamman|pg||
nt|lestergold: Zia as usual puts the pressure on and Rubin who cannot quite envisage the monster hand opposite thinks he had best take insurance|pg||
nt|joest: I was instructed of the error of my ways:  Hamman will be on lead against 5@h :(|pg||
nt|scotty: Strong club often has problems after serious preemption - though usually the vul is the other way round|pg||
nt|joest: i had it right the first time|pg||
nt|joest: Zia is on lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Why, Joe?  East to bid 5@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vul very expensive if West guesses wrong and 4s rolls in|pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe not clear what 4N means - obviously intended as TO|pg||
nt|joest: here, with partner showing 0-4 it probably has to be t/o.  I could see ambiguity in other circumstances|pg||
nt|joest: But I don't think Matt's sure|pg||
nt|kareno: Matt not a speed demon at the best of times will take his time here.|pg||
nt|scotty: If East opened 2@c in standard things would be a little different.  E-W would be in a force, so West could pass to suggest bidding and east could double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: ekta commentator patha|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: our operator is Dan Wolkowitz; hi Dan!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: E in tank now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Zia suggesting penalties now to keep Hamman from bidding further.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: So this is the rematch between Nickell and Fleisher and once again Fleisher is in the lead.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: isn't 5@d a safer rescue?|pg||

nt|daman: Bonsoir Irene|pg||
nt|suketbombi: kushari the vetran who has retired voluntarily from Railways playing with young Laltu |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: W asked N something....secretly|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|joest: this could be 1600 right out of the gate|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh no their wires crossed but how can rubin's redouble be anything other than rescue pick one of the red suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckwell bid to uninterrupted [yes no interference] 4@H|pg||
nt|joest: I think redouble was tempting the Gods|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, folks, it is easy for US to see what the 4nt and redouble meant.  Not at all easy for Matt Granovetter.|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree.  5@d would tell his story fully without this risk.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome to Shirley Ybarra, Karen Allison and Adam Kaplan all from USA!|pg||
nt|kareno: Hedy :)  Adam :)  Dan :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: after rubin has limited hishand by his original pass he cannot possibly have a penalty redouble|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: N clarified|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|kareno: This is a bonanza for the Nickell team.  |pg||
nt|daman: what a catastrophe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   then one window per room let's you try to follow multiple vugraph tables|pg||
nt|scotty: Normally, Rubin would just have bid 5@D to sau he had red suits.  But I think he realized the ambiguous nature of 4N, and was worried his partner would think he just had @d and was ...|pg||
nt|scotty: trying to play 4N.  He just didn't realize his redouble was ambiguous too|pg||

nt|scotty: no|pg||
nt|kareno: In 2/1 no, it would not.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: he was temporizing, look for support|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: No, unless specifically agreed|pg||
nt|kareno: 2NT was 100% forcing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2/1 pairs out there -- make sure you discuss whether your 2M rebid promises 6+ suit -- don't assume and it is not standard|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I don't play it promises 6, just a min. hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Slam is too much of a reach here.  |pg||
nt|suketbombi: this looks like a sparring bout before a boxing match:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: well a tame respite hand after the last blood pressure rising inducing hand |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play "5 card majors, semi-forcing NT, Eastern Scientific style"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not much works for declarer|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: it barely makes 4NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|scotty: in fact 4N can be defeated, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h was making with 98 dropping|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond king makes 3nt just fine.   but 4nt is too high with the spade that will no doubt be led.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|scotty: Even 51h, maybe|pg||
nt|scotty: 5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 hands in a row using 5N Choice of Slam|pg||
nt|kareno: So they have stretched a bit too far here.  West has a pretty hand but east doesn't fill the diamond gaps needed.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Breaking News. The next World Bridge Series will be held from October 116, 2010, at the Marriott Hotel in Philadelphia. This will be the first time this Championship has been held ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: in the United States for 16 years|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Zia wants the extra IMP or 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2010philadelphia/default.asp  for more information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher team has been playing since day 1 - when round robin began|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Wow, fantastic! Thanks Roland :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: except yesterday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell team began in USA1 Semi-Final where they were beaten by .... Fleisher|pg||
nt|scotty: West's 4@d bid looks attractive, but he needs 3 key cards to make 6@d - and partner might have tried 3@d with a hand that suitable|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|scotty: So maybe West should content himself with 4N over 3N|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Zia had to double this also I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rubin-Granovetter  &  Ekeblad-Weichsel both playing Ultimate Canape -- only difference is some carding agreements|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: That's no better! but not doubled.  Hmmm.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell team now playing 4-handed  Freeman went home sick :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: Recurrence of heart problems if you know?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Did they find out what was wrong?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure of ailment|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: they found out|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: what is it?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: but it's not up to me to broadcast ailments|pg||
nt|kareno: West marked with only one heart.|pg||
nt|hedyg: did Fleisher think double was a Lightner?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Probably... that would explain 6NT.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|scotty: West was influenced by their 2M opening style which is very sound - maybe he expected E to open that with this hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 8-12 According to their CC|pg||
nt|kareno: Too much outside of hearts!!|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: that would show a better suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would open that 1@h without thinking :)|pg||
nt|scotty: The slam West was most likely to miss by going low was 6@h, excellent opposite Axx, KJ10xxx, x, Axx and fair opposite @hKJ9xxx|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: 4-card majors, weak NT for N-S I presume|pg||
nt|benjent: 2NT must be artificial - I suggest weak with C or some strong hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT are one but will miss the handle of @C I belive, so a partscore might? Or  NT still|pg||
nt|benjent: 3@c would have been forced, and Koke's passed it out with the uninviting hand with @c's|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: now @S and diescard of 1 @D and so on mAKING EVEN §|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 6@d is good here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: non-double only cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: zia thought hamman would double with diamonds, but he acknowledged that it didn't matter|pg||
nt|daman: was he sandbagging?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman-Zia playing standard 2/1 are odd men out this set|pg||
nt|joest: back on hand 76|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for good hands to wait over big club|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't think Lestergold's comments on the last hand make any sense.  everybody (except east) appears to have a lot of distribution.  What do HCP have to do with a penalty ...|pg||
nt|scotty: redouble?  Maybe W was 0-6-1-6 and everybody was making|pg||
nt|sga1: This is the first Round of seven Round Swiss League.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: as i said that selling out to 3@S was very unlike rana and swarnendu|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|kareno: Yes, 6@d is a lovely contract.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: Who knows?  Often with a good hand it is sensible to stay out of an opponent's strong club auction.  But with that strong two-suiter it could easily be your hand despite the 1@c ...|pg||

nt|suketbombi: sbl negative by swarnendu|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: if this room isn't enough for you --  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   then one window per table|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Although a trump lead gives it problems a little|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about a @d lead? must find Q@H in W then|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a bidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w need to find the infrangible 3N here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: dbl|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3c trial from Kushari or a shut out 3@S?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|daman: Mike   please don't use words more than 2 syllables...they give me a headache|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c showing diamonds.|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: some pairs play that these cuebids here have varying meanings.  I dont know if that is true here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: We all studied 'infrangible' yesterday :)  Means cannot be broken.|pg||
nt|lestergold: George I have a special licence for that word |pg||
nt|daman: not a license?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: another visit from the BBO spelling poleese|pg||
nt|daman: this is not the Commonwealth Mike|pg||
nt|joest: I can't imagine this is Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: Could double be support here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that word caused my router to crash|pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe he's thinking they might play 21c redoubled?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: How about a loser on loser heart finesse :)|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: @c lead would be interesting also :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes @c lead might be more fun|pg||
nt|scotty: On @d lead in 6@d, you are basically cold if @d, 2-2 OR hearts 4-4 OR @hQ with W and hearts 5-3|pg||
nt|kareno: Club a bit tougher but I think declarer has answers for all leads |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 31c but laltu will just bid 3@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|scotty: Club lead looks the hardest by far|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: did RDBL show @S honor -- or something more magical?|pg||

nt|kareno: Well, specs, I didn't read the meaning of the Alert :)  So sue me!|pg||
nt|daman: both|pg||
nt|scotty: Why not?  he knew they weren't playing in 2@c|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: I guess I"d turn that around.  Why would you risk that when you know you can play it in 2@s?|pg||
nt|kareno: And specs, of course, I cannot answer each of your comments!!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|joest: anyway this hand is a great result for east-west|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now 1 dn|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, I think it may be down with a @c lead, since you cannot ruff out the @s or establish the @h in time I think|pg||
nt|joest: well I wouldn't be so quick to bet against Meckwell duplicating this|pg||
nt|kareno: It may yet be duplicated in the OR, folks :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack, GMTA!!|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't think Zia would have bid 3N with the N hand.  He used to advise me "If you think you can make 5m, then investigate slam rather than settling for 3N" |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ahand he should have made tho|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: and true to form, Meckstroth and Rodwell arrived guess where?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smart can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2NT is textbook stuff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bagchi "see red" (the vulnerability) and bids 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't that show 11-12 with a C stopper?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: if you double 2@H please hide  = no more bidding|pg||
nt|april7: now they are overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... tougher if you take a point or two away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's see|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use 11-14 NT openings so this show 15 - 17(18)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: precion at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: precision|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: the 2NT bid was not the best idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he will let this ride to his queen and advance @H10 to the queen|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a spot for 6@S here. Still tough @S are 1-4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: the X was also wrong, because E makes it now and W WAS FORCED  TO CONTINUE BIDDING ANYWAY|pg||
nt|haans: you can not sell precision withn that bidding|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: On either black suit switch, it seems N/S has 5 tricks|pg||

nt|suketbombi: many chances wated by decl|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Apparently it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: well this one will add to their collectoin|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: EW show controls over 2@C but Hamman gets in the way of Kamil saying "nada"|pg||
nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
nt|daman: needs distribution to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: there was a very good write-up in the Bridge World as I recall|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: why? he can bid double to show that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Many people play pass is positive here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzsz: the names have been updated now |pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: you just use the opps bid as a jumping stone|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I guess Kamil was trapping maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: Takeout double.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will compete up to 3@H on 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I play double of 2@h directly shows 'second negative' hand.|pg||

mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: tea?   which part of Las Vegas are you in Karen?|pg||
nt|kareno: Northwest|pg||
nt|joest: would the commentators lead a club or a heart from hamman's hand?|pg||
nt|kareno: Club to be honest.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mtvesuvius: I do also, Karen, it seems to work|pg||
nt|scotty: kamil unwilling to defend at this vul|pg||
nt|hedyg: the first step shows 0-1 control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs agree that DBL shows Double Negative, others say game force with no other call to make|pg||
nt|daman: @C|pg||
nt|joest: im mulling it over to be honest with you|pg||
nt|scotty: Some would probably look at all 4 hands and lead a spade - gives nothing away|pg||
nt|joest: well yeah maybe but that's not in any rational mix|pg||
nt|scotty: In your dreams, when you lead a club, dummy has Q10 doubleton and partner has KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming that is kind of dreams you have|pg||
nt|scotty: With two entries, a club can work in many ways.  And with spades lying poorly for declarer, I see no reson to not to lead a club.  Won't give away much|pg||
nt|joest: you need tons of help inclubs to get them going but it does combine safety with a reasonable amount of aggression|pg||
nt|joest: and then there are always dreams..... :)|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer has many entry problems here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 22.8 - http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=kq+a3+ak96+ajt73|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to convert to penalties at this vul|pg||
nt|scotty: Really tough hand to play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This will be a tough hand for Kamil, since he has extreme entry problems, and has alot of work to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much easier play for Kamil if contract is 2@HX|pg||
nt|scotty: I'd probably take 5 minutes to plan the play - and still not know what to do|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|scotty: Looks like he should attack diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: now @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: then @d to the J|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Hamman had to win that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now this could potentially make...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|scotty: He can lose 2 diamonds and a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not enuf problems to go down!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: he will not be tested other than for overtricks|pg||
nt|scotty: Can N hope declarer has Ax, Kxxx, KQxxx, Ax or the like?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|scotty: 2@h, doubled would have not been so great if if they start !jD lead to !AK and a ruff.  Probably 300|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hamman knew that Zia has no more @hs|pg||
nt|kareno: I think ducking wasn't best here.  Tough hand to play or to defend I guess.|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh he didnt know|pg||
nt|scotty: How did Hamman know that?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He doesn't, but I don't think it can hurt to win?|pg||
nt|kareno: diamond now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial worry if win - Kamil takes 3@H tricks|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|scotty: I guess he did|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mtvesuvius: Zia does best to duck to maintain communications|pg||
nt|scotty: It would hurt to win first heart if declarer knocked out partners club trick, then later your @d trick - since partner would have no hearts to clear them|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not play @d for an entry to hand?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|joest: that was a good construction|pg||

nt|scotty: It's sometimes difficult to think clearly when entries to both hands are a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: we got bounced off the network for a moment, but you didn't miss anything|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: sorry if i missed -- did anybody in panel discuss @HA at trick 1? |pg||

mb|4D|nt|april7: N should pass,S has 6-10 HP|pg||

nt|rodal f: A normal spot but might a bit hard|pg||

nt|gracelin: 6D, bingo.|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: but all south's 11 HCP are in the right place.|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: S actually could bid 6@D, because without @D no slam posible,just to bad!!|pg||

nt|kareno: Um ... we call that a convincing margin :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry|pg||
nt|scotty: I think it was sensible to bid 5@h with East hand.  He only had one chance to guess, and even if 5@h is the "wrong" guess, sometimes opponents do the wrong thing after.|pg||
nt|daman: the fat lady is warming up|pg||
nt|kareno: Match now slipping far away for Fleisher.  |pg||
nt|joest: good bidding in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yes, Ekeblad opened North 2@D=opening hand, 5+@H & 4+@D|pg||
mb|2H|an|!H+minor|nt|kareno: That is not classical notrump shape, but a hard hand to bid without opening 1NT.|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: The Fleisher team took off the last two sets of their final match to get rested for this one but they have been playing throughout this entire event and obviously are weary.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: so are the commentators |pg||
nt|kareno: 5d excellent n/s and found in the OR.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: a straight forward 4@S by e-W but a save in 5@H for 500?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mtvesuvius: If Zia's hand was a little different, 5@h would have potentially had Zia make the incorrect guess, essentially what Hamman's 4@s did to Kamil|pg||
nt|kareno: That will end the auction.|pg||
nt|kareno: No kidding, Al.  And I've also attended a Film Festival here in Las Vegas this past week ... tonight is the last film.|pg||
nt|scotty: I'm not sure if there was any clear route to success.  Even if he starts with a trump, Hamman ducks and still not cold.  As it happens had he played a trump, he might have been ...|pg||
nt|scotty: able to duck a @h to N, or set up a @H winner if S split|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 82 will be removed - one of the players in the open room inadvertently saw a few cards from another player's hand and the director is making a new board 82|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We can't show that I'm afraid|pg||
nt|daman: irregularity; a sub bd82 is being made up because a player saw some cards from another players hand somehow; it prob will not make viewgraph|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@s splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: You always want to force your opponent to make the last guess.|pg||
nt|scotty: i think it's interesting that partner is mathematically more likely to be short in @c than @d, which adds to the attraction of the 5@h bid.  Wouldn't be so surprising to find 4@s ...|pg||
nt|scotty: and 5@h both making if partner has a stiff club|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: South's short @cs will be a bit of a problem on this hand, although the @c spots should make it much easier|pg||
nt|joest: I wonder if 4@c is an 'automatic' cue-bidding situationfor them. I suspect Zia is not bound by many rules like that anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: shouldn't forget - vugraph operators must be exhausted too|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|joest: this is quite a bit of bidding on a hand with KJxx of spades|pg||

nt|kareno: Did south really play the club queen?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, that makes more sense|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|joest: that's possible|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: although bad @S position, still 10 tricks in 4 @S|pg||

nt|gracelin: if north's first club spot showed count, then the 2nd one could be for suit preference|pg||

nt|rodal f: Agree Roland. Normaly 1403 fit the cards better the 0314|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|joest: this is a mildly irregular takeout double|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 90 in the open|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|scotty: Some play lebensohl here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: about the @D ruff|pg||
nt|suketbombi: likely to get to 4@S here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ns wud rest in 2@s here unless rana buys it in 1nT|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Spec comments that if west doesn't overruff, they may do better - generally with trump length, that can gain.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s should make easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: So 3@c = values|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: Dbl was penalty|pg||
nt|joest: (I think)|pg||

nt|suketbombi: not playing Jernalist any more:)|pg||

nt|joest: as I said: not the last...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|mtvesuvius: Not a bad idea to do that.. I haven't seen that treatment at all, but it seems logical|pg||
nt|scotty: With a "bad" 3@c bid, Zia would bid 2N, which shows either that, or a 3-level bid with a @d stopper |pg||
nt|kareno: Good treatment - 2nt almost never needs to be natural in that position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if auction had gone 1@S-2@H  is lebensohl still best or 2N scramble|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: another hand with fleisher on the wrong side of it in both rooms|pg||
nt|daman: I can faintly hear the fat lady in the hallway|pg||
nt|lestergold: u need ur hearing tested in that case george|pg||
nt|daman: is she that loud to you Mike?|pg||
nt|joest: well the bottom line here is that Nickell has outscored Fleisher 76-5 in these last two sets|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|scotty: Hamman's 3@s bid might have been forcing by agreement.  I know Zia had this auction-type playing with Andy Robson once|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer COULD go down if he decided to play West for @sJxxx - but I don't think that it's too likely he will go that way|pg||

nt|roman505:  Everything lay well for declarer on the last hand, but biding 3NT was unlikely on their auction. |pg||
nt|roman505:  SA may reach three here though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: negative = spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: For set the contract down it was needed a @S lead I belive|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: but do they have 8 but not 9???|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 10 or 11 tricks depending on how well he guesses hearts|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|april7: but 5 is ok, Qof @D could be ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clubs a non-issue on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: I wonder if Smolanko had a little try for game, and gave it up after a 2@d minimum response|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS to gain 1 IMP more?|pg||

nt|super nova: Do you remember that one bill?|pg||
nt|benjent: Last board of this set. Thanks to my co-commentator Rodal|pg||

nt|rodal f: And stole the contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: SA V NSW|pg||
nt|super nova: SA winning|pg||
nt|rodal f: 29HP total. Will they bid as the other table?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Is this a good slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|super nova: Clubs or heart slam|pg||
nt|rodal f: Started 1H - 2@C in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is excellent|pg||
nt|super nova: 6c is par.. 7 h or 7c no way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is it a good grand slam?|pg||
nt|super nova: :-S|pg||
nt|super nova: no|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% grand approx|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see the same good bidding here? But by 2-2@C needed|pg||
nt|benjent: This contract drifted 3 off in the Open room - let's see if Khokan can do better....|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will be minimum2 down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugrapha3: this is the last board all results can be ound at http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=09ANCT&header=abf|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at least to The Australian Federation - BBO by all there nice people. ( Wald are at sleep) We was Bjørn and Frank from norway trying to help|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||
nt|super nova: Just thinking about the extra 6% that bill mentioned|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: But you can pick up singleton J or Q with North|pg||
pc|c3|nt|elivero: And thx to Frank that use so mucth of his time for uss here,,thx Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: In the otherroom S bidded 1@S. Gave room for the opps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|april7: now a crossruff is coming|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Losing to doubleton QJ - that's the extra 6%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if you guess it|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would play it that way based on restricted choice if an honour was played from N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you don't, you consign yourself to 40%|pg||
nt|elivero: there we go:)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|benjent: Low @d to the J looks like the best ployt to create tricks, but doesn't work here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can play small !X to A and @D|pg||
nt|benjent: Might still generate a little by playing @c to the A then a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Makes 5|pg||
nt|benjent: Snap, Rodal!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or. Best small @D|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: I take my words back:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D 4rth. Then after 3@H a que on the road?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d5|nt|april7: thats the last hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Their auction was a little mysterious, but I suppose once West 4th-suited, East was bidding a slam|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|vugrapha3: Play has finished and will resume in about 20 minutes time.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: that is, 2100 EST|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Thanks to everybody. See you when play resumes.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Congratulations to SA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roman505:  They came home against an ACT team which had led most of the round robin|pg||
nt|rodal f: And afterthe ques. 5@H = do u like ure quality at @H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to stop at 4|pg||
nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Perhaps as commented elsewhere, it is often unwise to use 4NT with weak trumps.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Thank you all. Bye now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thanks all see u next year :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: thanks all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still their auction lacks conviction.  For example, did anyone see a diamond cue bid from West?|pg||
nt|benjent: Well done Khokan, tightens the match up a little|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will hang at 5 loosers as I see it. Right Bjørn?:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: 6 on?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: mere details|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Thx all|pg||

nt|joest: now if these guys get to 6@c I know things are going their way!|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, could have gone down had north played the diamond jack at the lead to point the way to his hand for a club ruffr.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|joest: btw, in trying to play super safe Granovetter might have gone down had the defense seen all the cards|pg||
nt|joest: I would love to respond to all the kibitzers but trust me, there are so many of you, I can't.  Sorry|pg||
nt|kareno: I'll echo Jack's remark here.  |pg||
nt|kareno: I try, I try.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: For sure... Ugly 11, and 1NT was the max... Same spot in the OR though|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: can salvage an imp on @s lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: Hamman wouldhave loved to have opened his hand 1@s believe me|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no problems here tho|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: too right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mtvesuvius: Well, this will take a lot of work to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can meckwell get to 1N after nebulous @D?  i think so|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, they did|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think he's still 'allowed' in certain circumstances - but nowhere near as usual|pg||
nt|kareno: West doesn't really want a ruff here.  |pg||
nt|joest: as it turns out a diamond would have been better, yes but looking at @h10xxx its hard to know that|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|joest: as against that Edgar Kaplan always used to say: "God dealt me KQJ10 for a reason"|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: Someone is asking which pair played against Zia-Hamman in set 3, boards 31-45.  Anyone know?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @C &@S badly place no chance for decl here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: I'm told it was Ekeblad/Weichsel.|pg||
nt|jtr: The same pair|pg||
nt|hedyg: check BBO bridge library|pg||
nt|jtr: yes right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: find @HJ = good   learn @S split = bad|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, specs :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Lead was helpful but ... |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|mtvesuvius: No, it messed up declarer's entries, it was good for the defense|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: 7@h could have been from AJ97 so he could not play the Q@h|pg||
nt|kareno: The best they could have done is hold this to four.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: Zia will ruff and cross to the club to hook the heart, both b/c the king rates to be onside (no preempt) and because he risks a trump promotion if he plays hearts fromthe top|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, Zia had better not take the unsafety play in hearts now!!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Agreed.  He simply cannot let east on lead.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|kareno: Spec is asking about 'seating rights.'  That has to do with the order in which teams seat themselves.  When you have seating rights, your opponents must sit first and then you can ...|pg||
nt|kareno: choose how to sit around them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had the same number of cards in @d and in @s|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c7|pc|h9|nt|suketbombi: dhampur wud get 2 more imps i yhink|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: Same contract in the OR and I'm sure with the same problems for declarer.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: the advantage in @d was a stiff honour or Hx with 1 opp|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|suketbombi: winning the set by 15 imps so the score would be 19-11 in there favor|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|key1809: 3 imps now|pg||
mc|6|nt|suketbombi: score is 19-11 still :)|pg||
nt|key1809: :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will be converted to VPs :)|pg||
