pc|s7|pg||
nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||

pc|h8|pg||

nt|rodal f: After 4@S all roads was closed to find the slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Yes, Khokan wouldn't have been surprised to find that he was going down in 5@s with 5@c making despite his 3 aces|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would anyone have made an X in N over 2@C?|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|bjacobs: Welcome Rodal - I see you are just 17 years old|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lol:) Those ugly months.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hey, your psychology has worked on me.  Can't be bothered doing the math|pg||
nt|benjent: Lead philosophy test for Andy here - 4th, or try to find partner?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: North just said e/w should be playin rubber|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: there could be a slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6C is not a bad contract either but would fail on the 4-1 off-side trump split|pg||
nt|haans: did 2@H show extra|pg||
nt|april7: @H are 3-3 so 12 tricks are coming in|pg||
nt|gracelin: south has an easy 3D to me.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a nice stop at level 3|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjent: I lead 4th (ie @c) ... and so does Andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: but in @D not in @C|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D may have been forcing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|april7: N should pass,S has 6-10 HP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An accurate looking contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: A normal spot but might a bit hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: NS will probably play in@C and not in @D|pg||
nt|gracelin: ater the reverse, NS will bid at least a game|pg||
nt|april7: why not slam?|pg||
nt|haans: south say NO MORE North looking for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: S has only 5 tricks if defended correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: we all been there|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|april7: now slam for sure but where?|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6D, bingo.|pg||
nt|haans: South not in slam mode|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gracelin: but all south's 11 HCP are in the right place.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|april7: S actually could bid 6@D, because without @D no slam posible,just to bad!!|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H was a make|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|april7: although bad @S position, still 10 tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|haans: needed for ruffi8ng|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north's first club spot showed count, then the 2nd one could be for suit preference|pg||
nt|april7: but then its to late|pg||
nt|roman505:  The rest of our team were all under 30, Nye-Ware and Geromboux-Griffiths|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|april7: e goes all the way|pg||
