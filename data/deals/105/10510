mb|p|nt|kit: of course Lair doesn't know that his partner was kidding, so he will probably bid 3@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: there could be a slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6C is not a bad contract either but would fail on the 4-1 off-side trump split|pg||
nt|haans: did 2@H show extra|pg||
nt|april7: @H are 3-3 so 12 tricks are coming in|pg||
nt|gracelin: south has an easy 3D to me.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: but in @D not in @C|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D may have been forcing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: N should pass,S has 6-10 HP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An accurate looking contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|april7: NS will probably play in@C and not in @D|pg||

pc|hT|nt|gracelin: but all south's 11 HCP are in the right place.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
