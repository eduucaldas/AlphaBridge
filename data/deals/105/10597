nt|sybarra: may not lead a sp with E bidding them |pg||
nt|sybarra: so @C lead |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'd probably lead a @D, for I don't want to lead into decl's suit, not trumps and not away from Kxxxx|pg||

nt|tomi2: E/W are both newcommers to international youth Bridge, I guess they are first time on Vugraph - so let's hope they will do fine... I am sure!|pg||
nt|andy_h: Usually in these types of auctions where 1 person has shown 2 suits and their partner took preference, is to lead trumps.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||

nt|andy_h: Sometimes they say, don't bother looking at any of your other cards. Lead a trump no matter what! (Usually will work 85% of the time I assure you)|pg||
mc|10|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands as usual medal candidates in this competition, but this match will be a tough one|pg||

mc|9|nt|ahollan1: reverse dummy & @S hook?|pg||
nt|phil: the 4-0 break in trump will give Ari a little pause for concern, but it should make without issue|pg||

nt|odysseus69: to win gold Norway needs a big win while France loses - this was not the start Norway wanted|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: who would Dbl in S?|pg||
nt|ritong: a simple duck of the first @ss would have avoided this cruel ending|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2nt =lower unbids |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello MIke |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play EW|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: The Swedish bridge federation has put up a nice presentation, only in Swedish though: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.1917|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT might be 11-13 or so|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D probably a multi style, showing a long major|pg||
nt|tomi2: Max Ellerbeck did :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: I would. Maybe South is worried about @Hxxx but that wouldn't detour me in not doubling. By X-ing you get 3 suits across|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: So for those who missed it, Poland came in first in the girls series, followed by France and the Netherlands|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would consider a pass here, but thats the reason I am not playing there anymore... I am too old|pg||
nt|Gerben42: same here from the 30+ camp|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||

nt|sybarra: theyre hts and club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 3@H looks a bit close at teams|pg||
nt|odysseus69: to convert silver to bronze Norway needs to lose while Israel wins big|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: good afternoon to Hedy Grey|pg||
mb|2S|nt|davidb: we watch 2 experienced pairs -I  believe we will see good bridge|pg||
nt|Jacki: Does someone in here need to be ungagged to comment?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: In my opinion N's @Ds aren't good enough for a 4NT overcall|pg||

nt|Gerben42: good one for your system talk: is 2NT natural here or does it show no preference...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The U26 Open category has a day off today, hence they don't have running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: south is now "endplayed" I think he should try some kind of 2NT bid and wait for something good to happen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for me 2NT is not natural in auctions where one opp opened and the other bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, then Nab will bid 3@D and will become declarer, thats the best that can happen to south :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi :)|pg||
nt|arigun: hi hedy|pg||

nt|mdgraham: useful in these positions to play what you play over 2NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only one level higher|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: i have here the CC of the Swedish girls. when play slows down i will present a brief description|pg||
nt|rodal f: By normal defence it might was. 3NT are 1 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: Showinga huge minor hand at E now|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bazý ellerde vugraf operatörleri oynanan kartlarý yanlýþ girebiliyorlar ama sonradan düzeltiyorlar|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani burada undo oldu diye masada da undo oldu diye düþünmeyiniz lütfen |pg||
nt|ozgull: evet çok güvenmemek lazým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gerçek hayatta undo yok biliyorsunuz|pg||
nt|ozgull: son el pik gelse batýyordu gibi gözüksede belkide öyle olmadý|pg||
nt|MolvaM: vugraf operatörleri de son maça yorgun girdiler :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: pik ataðý normal ama Arda'nýn trefllerine tek antresi maalesef yýkýlacak|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Adrian!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pull out the old blunderbuss and bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: dbl probably (I can doulbe one of the suits) |pg||
nt|mamos: NS lopk a little high already|pg||
nt|mamos: hi shirley|pg||
nt|mamos: realistically West has little choice but to sell out to this|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that easy to think game with E,,, I wouldn't|pg||
mb|2N|nt|davidb: 3H =inv 5-5|pg||
nt|ozgull: açýk odadan anladýðýmýz gibi ingilizler 12-14 NT oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|kastan88: misfit on NS, possible that West will start doubling now|pg||
nt|kastan88: he was faster (West)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Simonsen is thinking|pg||
nt|andy_h: Very nice treatment of the 2NT bid in competition - showing 2 places to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a @H lead might end it anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d alerted as Walsh i assume|pg||
nt|ronpa: No reason to do something else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here, of course, 3NT may be a club stop and running diamonds, so it is not so clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @C10 and a small spade from dummy?|pg||
nt|mamos: he'sd like to do something  but what ?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can imagine S being especially unlucky, given his semi-wasted @S values|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I personally wouldn't have bid with N's hand. All it's going to do is that it may excited partner (when you don't really want to given the void in clubs). Given N has 3spadeds ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: (marking shortage with partner) then S may still re-open|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i wouldnt have doubled in N either... what if pd simply has 12 HCP and good 6-card @C, I dont want to be anywhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl of 3@S = dont lead that pd|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the question here is what happens at the 6 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: Decl can't handle the Jxxx with W|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes they play walsh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead in either major gives a trick|pg||
nt|ronpa: and 3NT from West seat is cold on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: Please let me know if you need to be ungagged|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so the way is free for quite some undertricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: X must be some game invitation|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I was expecting 6D from East|pg||
nt|rodal f: And Jankova are on the line by the other huge hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Sweden is tied on the 4th place and Latvia tied on the 7th|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will lead spades anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: this spot looks just fine|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: it says: 17+ 1@c with nebulous 1@D, 5card M's|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ozgull: ingiltere'de beginnerlara 1NT açýþý 12-14 tür diye gösterildiði için öyle tahmin ettim|pg||
nt|MolvaM: vugrafta daha sýk yer alabilmemiz için takýmýmýzýn klasmanda yükselmesi gerek|pg||
nt|yuval10: N did well to remove the 3NT, but 5@disn't likely to make either|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly ten tricks|pg||

nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice fit EW but no slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can watch Max Ellerbeck's nice defense to 3@S in the movie, he found the @C ruff in 2nd trick accorcing to their signaling methods and so they defeated 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Leonardo, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|frusco: hi bas|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kaapo: It appers that NS could make 7@D|pg||

nt|tomi2: Dutch EW did well to stop in game here|pg||

nt|henryb: cards lie very well for N-S|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42: the 9 showed the @C switch?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't really blame West for passing 2@C. Maybe East should have opened - his hand sure looked like an opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, time to wake up, jan|pg||
nt|elbec: manno and di franco play weak no trump "Nightmare" style|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N EW has play|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@C looks unlikely to stop EW bidding the game in a major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you are French, of course|pg||
mb|r|an|constructive, 2 spades|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either: 12-14 bal OR natural 12+ OR 18+ any distr.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: and the 3@C bid showed the @D suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dutch EW did not stop in game after all...|pg||

nt|yuval10: E did very well here to judge that her cards in the minors worth a game|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I'll bet East thought that his side was in a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|ritong: if you don t , yopu might get caught in a bad spiral|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo: My second guess is that NS play polish club|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ozgull: juniors ta belli olmaz:)|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: You don't, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N actually alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As being @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: pass or correct?|pg||
nt|henryb: to respond or not to respond, that is the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting |pg||
nt|ronpa: nice agreement of 3@H to play, but only 8 trix because of bad @H break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like five rapid losers|pg||
nt|charles_l: what style is that?|pg||
nt|mamos: West has some problem now a very good hand opposite a double at this level|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some more specs have comed. Web page for the turney: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: 1@c is 15+ with 4or+@c or 15-17 balanced or 24+any|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with three trumps..|pg||
nt|mariner1: like a limit in Sayc|pg||
mb|3C|nt|waso: maybe 1nt 16-18|pg||
nt|mamos: should East advance?   I don't think so he has bid his hand alresdy|pg||
nt|mariner1: A@D right, even Q10x @S right, this will make game|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room France is in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: very conservative 2 passes by S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey açýsýndan grandþlemin anahtarý minör renklerdeki yan onörler|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where 1@C could be of several varieties|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here minimum balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@S losing 2@H and a 1C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm was watching BBO TV and it looked like... sry|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Nab using Sabine's tactic: bid 2@D over 1@C whenever possible :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: West probabbly will do better confirming his spade fit some way|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D from North?|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" may be playing at different level here  bets on over/under?|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi all, sory about a few problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: we are already at board 3|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bir þekilde karo üzerinden keycard sormayý denkleþtirmek iyi fikir olabilir|pg||
nt|ozgull: karo k pik as olsa mesala 13 hcp|pg||
nt|eerbil: Ingiliz takýmý zon durumuna göre deðiþken 1NT açýþý kullanýyor gibiler, uygun zon durumu 10-12 olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: böylece koz dam'ýný da öðrenebilir|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Latvia dont alert the 3-rd dbl:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what would 2NT after 2@S have been? |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2NT does not exist but must be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curiously, the scoring system seems to believe there hasn't been an exchange of IMPs yet in this match|pg||
nt|ronpa: 2@S also goes down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hi Charles1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||
nt|waso: yes|pg||
nt|waso: one of each|pg||
nt|wwalter: 3@h was a little optimistic :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: team style|pg||
nt|kaapo: A kibitzer has read in the bulletin, that NS would play strong club|pg||
nt|kastan88: interesting, how now EW will find their spades game, I would bid 2nd round 2@S with E hand, IMO showing 7...20 with 5-card @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hard decision 4 Mr. Lauks|pg||
nt|kastan88: now it is hard to West find good bid another than pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he will bid 4 sp?:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but 4@H only 3 down|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr even 2 down only|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi I'm Frank from Norway, Welcome also to Geir:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi Rodal & ty|pg||
nt|ritong: i think south would have bid if her LHO wasn t a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: like 1@d, then pass any bid|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming it is not a super forcing one:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: Burda 4NT briaz karýþýk gibi|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 5@C now... well, 3@S may even be better news|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H now? or what?|pg||
nt|frusco: sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North tell that South has four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure,  does that sound like @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE communicating in writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it all cues?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@S is cue, but does it SHOW or DENY @S control?:)|pg||
nt|frusco: 4@d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after the support |pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a head start for Sweden I see|pg||
nt|othered1: Reasonable spot and good lead.|pg||
nt|elbec: manno has already an important international experience, while di franco is at his first important junior event, after playing a lot for schools|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so as usual my expected result did not happen - when Czech allowed to play 6Dx|pg||

nt|rodal f: If u like to follow all tables. Open this and bookmark it: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

pc|c9|nt|ozgull: açýk odada þehmus 3h diyip sonra as sormuþ ortak kantitatif anlamasýn diye|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: OR playing 5@D by N|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume 3rd best from 4 is their agreement, or is it always 3rd best?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: so flat board... |pg||
nt|tomi2: they will not be the only ones in that slam... |pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2@S is nonforcing, what hand would West need for slam anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|pelu: and a ruff will deefeat|pg||
pc|h3|nt|charles_l: now S has no entry|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer needs 2 entries to hand to play @Ss twice (he can't cash AK of hearts)|pg||
nt|othered1: @D to 9 won't be a winner|pg||
nt|xenya: but you are right, Charles -- now it's easier|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that is|pg||
nt|charles_l: might just concede 2@s, but very hairy with round suits threatening|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: probably the name 'closed' is turning them away|pg||
nt|gracelin: normally specs follow the players they know|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, we have the Norwegian Star Lindqvist playing there, but of course our players here are also top players|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this event they dont start with board 18 so you dont get extra results from altrady played hands|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm|pg||
nt|gulyas: so this will be 6 IMPs to Poland|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davidb: H& ruff be Dk best|pg||
nt|kaapo: It might be interesting to see, what number of hearts different juniors bid on the East hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the up trick |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: I understand both Norway and Poland are strong in U26 and did well in the 1st WMSG last Oct.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Sten Bjertnes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|charles_l: was a tricky hand|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like the 3@H call in Open Room looking for game......|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rayhaa: in open east preempted 3@c, so easier to find @sQ, but danger for @s 4-1|pg||
nt|rayhaa: west sry|pg||
nt|charles_l: now @d hoping W can ruff?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2: Norway hat an excellent start in this event, but I remember 2 years ago it was the same and they dropped a bit - but I expect they learned from that and will be more concentrated ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: all through this event|pg||
nt|frusco: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: now he needs a miracle in @S and north's play is irrelevant, since he has 3 more black tricks coming|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S - 2n - 3@H - 4@S|pg||
nt|sten: hi everybody|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East should have signalled for diamonds with his choice of hearts on 3rd round|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: so maybe E hand is too weak for 2@S?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
mc|10|nt|davidb: now may make|pg||
nt|charles_l: good try|pg||
