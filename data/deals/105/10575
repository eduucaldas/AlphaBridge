nt|ckv: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: my hunch is we are catching up  |pg||
nt|othered1: This is a replay of pairs from the first set.  Wonder if they can generate near the action of that set.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is new set Ed |pg||
nt|othered1: No, this isn't the same pairings.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just saw this in the other room |pg||
nt|ckv: it looks as if meck is the anchor pair- at least for now|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ckv: i believe 64 baords today to determine usa 2 since Lall won both matches yesterday in the 3-way|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ckv: full carryover|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: now S has a huge hand|pg||
nt|reisig: @d K became ...BIG|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: S has upgraded his 15 to a strong club...  which i concur with|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: does meck bid his hand or go 4 the throat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: for those who have asked.  the Lall team is USA1  |pg||
nt|sybarra: this day  is all about USA2 |pg||
pc|c4|nt|me argent: 4 the throat|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't particularly like the X...  with the majors and constructive values, i like to get the hand off my chect|pg||
nt|bigtrain: chest|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: nor does 2@d look clear either|pg||
nt|sybarra: between these 2 teams |pg||
nt|henryb: Say hello to Dan Goldfein from Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: will do|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a decent contract that might not be all that easy to reach.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "can't make it too easy on you" (Dan)|pg||
nt|othered1: And by not bidding @C, EW got that favorable lead|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|vdoubleu: This should be 5 iMPs back toLynch|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|othered1: Some might have bid 2@C on the east hand, rather than 3@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: strange choice to bid 2@C...  with equal length, one would think that XX would be indicated|pg||
nt|ckv: a two way shot by e-w that turned out well|pg||
nt|henryb: on the other hand 5 or 6@c might be better; and I sharply disapprove of bidding 3@s rather than 2@c|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: Quite a slam last hand ... sorry I missed it!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|reisig: Walk faster!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Srry Karen we should have waited for you.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a lot to be said for potting 3N on the S hand. yes, it could go wrong, though only in 50s. but S could hardly have a better hand. and the KEY point is that N will rarely ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: be in a position on a borderline hand to bid 3N himself over any other call by S|pg||
nt|kareno: hahaha|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphu8: this is a 3 way match, with comparisons for only the 2nd part of the match|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|henryb: sometimes partner's @sK is the @hK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: do they play big @C?  If so, east may have chosen to bid out his values immediately|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|henryb: I doubt it, knowing goldfein|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|reisig: I guess nobody would overcall 1@h and end all this chatter :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|sJ|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: some of us might|pg||
nt|kareno: Chunky four card suit - possible overcall.|pg||
nt|othered1: Then 3@S is really pushy.  But after 2@C and a raise to 3, it would be consistent for east to bid 3@S and west to go to game in one black suit or the other|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphu8: will claim in a sec, sorry I lost track|pg||

nt|henryb: not Mayefsky but Katz bid 2@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet thats east |pg||
nt|henryb: really|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: eric bid 2@S, then alerted and explained.... trying to read over sam's shoulder|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yers|pg||
nt|henryb: taking advantage of the vulnerability to throw dust in the air|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you can sustain a bad diamond break (or guess) in clubs more easily than in diamonds.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: More chances than just locating the dimaond J.|pg||
nt|othered1: @S or minors?|pg||
nt|ckv: this must be spades or minors:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: found the sac suit  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: it is :)|pg||
nt|othered1: pass by west, presumably showing a 2N rebid seems normal|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sam inquired further from eric, who is now scribbling furiously|pg||
nt|henryb: If its @s or minors, S should have bid 4@c not 3|pg||
nt|ckv: perhaps she's seen his bids before|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i caught nothing from their excange except it seemed to end with eric nodding and saying, "yes, 50 a trick."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: so take from that what you will|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: if 3@Ss was forcing then i am wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: eric: "great"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: more writing by eric |pg||
nt|sybarra: and they write in tiny letters |pg||
nt|othered1: That's the 4th bid of north's I've seen in 2 and afraction sessions I'd consider a psych.  But here it's merely very aggressive|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i think it would be more accurate to say that eric writes illegibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: eric: help! ooh!|pg||
nt|ckv: with two passes ahead of north- 4 spades very reasonable action|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: you can sustain 4-1 clubs also|pg||
nt|ckv: as i said:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|othered1: did pass by east promise values?  Some play it that way, with double being a negative.|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: They don't seem headed toward @ds :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: argenta has settled down to think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is going to have an ugly hand to lead from. (though not as ugly as to bid from). the deadly spade seems likely (deadly for the defense)|pg||
nt|kareno: Good raise by Lynch!|pg||
nt|sybarra: best she stick to her guns  wd |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: and has chosen pass :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|me argent: personally i would never bid a non forcing 3@Ss with norts hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: this was set with a Club lead in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Lall got the chance to double for the lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: she has played a few other times with her pard |pg||
pc|c3|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, key here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only a club gives away nothing.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 4@d=keycard?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd guess yes, Valerie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: H gives away nothing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: N is lucky that E bid 4S|pg||
nt|kareno: So, no double of spades eliminates that lead for north.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: confirmed 4d= blackwood 4s 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no X of 4S, may avoid that suit on lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: OK., maybe.|pg||
nt|reisig: @c seems pretty safe|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: he will itch to lead a trump, but finally wont i predict|pg||
nt|kareno: Finds a safe lead.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: safe yes, but against small slam will tend to attack. it is not like N is sitting behind declarer's tenaces with high cards|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|kareno: South might have played the jack of hearts to give west some bad options (ruffing out QJ of hearts).|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c5|nt|me argent: keep winners throw losers|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphu8: sorry, my lag here is making it a bit tough :(|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|kareno: Stella, my cat, sitting on my lap kibitzing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps, but he doesnt want to be endplayed, and anyway it was the five-spot that was led, which is not consistent with ruffing out QJx i think|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sorry overtook the heart on the board|pg||
mc|11|nt|kareno: Declarer's pitches not boding well for this contract unless he plans to float the diamond jack.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "what was your hand?" (to eric"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "i was also not vulnerable, and you were vulnerable, and my partner had passed..."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "seems like you guys did just fine..."|pg||

mb|2H|nt|othered1: how many @S by south.  2, preemptive, might be the choice of some|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: So a possible swing turns into a push board.|pg||

nt|henryb: 1@h|pg||
nt|othered1: For the lead?|pg||
nt|henryb: no, for fear of the spade action; 2@c would be a reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|s6|nt|reisig: depends ..what 2N means|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Most play it as invitational, no?|pg||
nt|reisig: or a relay to 3@c :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Won't make with a heart lead.  Declarer needs an entry to establish diamonds and one to cash them.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kareno: I play it invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope take that back.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it looks cold to me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, it does after diamond finesse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Doesn't need an entry to establish them - they are 3-3 with king onside.|pg||
nt|kareno: I took it back folks :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But, must grab the ace at once.|pg||
nt|reisig: spec are non-forgiving|pg||
nt|kareno: And pray for rain.|pg||
nt|kareno: They are brutal :)  I love it!!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No other play, he will.|pg||
nt|kareno: He is just double checking for any other possibilities.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: with S ace onside, as cards lie S does not need to win the ace|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|ckv: a very interesting and tough hand for precsionists- apparently 2 clubs promises at least nine minor cards- but i think 4 diamonds a little agressive and possibly endangering law of ...|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: Okay, here comes our line of play :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vdoubleu: (anyone's):)|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd like 2@C, constructive but not forcing in my methods.|pg||
nt|henryb: rational, but risks missing 4@h|pg||

pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: well, this line of play has its attractions, but it is not as if there are no alternatives. clubs are as likely to be 3-3 as diamonds. this line is best as u dont need to knock out ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: good news imo :)|pg||
nt|othered1: So far some small swings, unlike the last set where the swings were frequent and large|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ckv: i think 3 spades was destined to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ckv: yes- a little more stability|pg||
nt|henryb: If you play 2/1, do you respond 2@c or 1N with South?|pg||
nt|othered1: not an easy hand for MS to manage.  Possible to get to 2@S|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted |nt|marlowepi: the 8D save goes for too many :)|pg||
nt|kareno: One pusillanimous @h by Schwartz|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT will make on this one|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N, since I can't bid my suits out in natural order after a 2/1, which might excite partner too much|pg||
nt|othered1: would 2@C have been artificial?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: ok argenta's writing is neat but tiny|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: gotta love'em! |pg||

nt|henryb: 3@c, natural and constructive but NF is an interesting idea|pg||

nt|sybarra: 2 nt was just the bid S wanted to hear |pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|scotty: right , but since you think partner needs to know which values are important, it must mean that you deny singleton or void|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: when in doubt, vulnerable, bid game and let them try to beat you. I tought that to meckwell which is why they are winning |pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|scotty: Exactly - so the whole club-diamond-spade value thing is irrelevant|pg||
nt|kareno: Not my idea of a 2nt bid - two card diversity ... you'll end up in a 4-2 fit too often.|pg||
nt|robinswr: just a guess and how is partner supposed to know|pg||
nt|scotty: I play 4th seat preempt shows a 7-trick hand - but not seven solid|pg||
nt|robinswr: makes sense|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: n could have bid 1n to show minors also... but said he wanted to apply max pressure|pg||

nt|scotty: Against 1N-3n, you might find some spade leaders|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: is that on your card?|pg||
