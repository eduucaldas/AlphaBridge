mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: 4S NS? :)|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Most play it as invitational, no?|pg||
nt|reisig: or a relay to 3@c :)|pg||

nt|kareno: Doesn't need an entry to establish them - they are 3-3 with king onside.|pg||

nt|othered1: West's initial pass seems odd to me.  Maybe they play it forcing.|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think he should bid?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that is a very familiar situation. player alert on one side of the table :)|pg||
nt|ckv: he's kind of stuck- will probably now go 1nt- 3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: good question.  I personally would double implying 3@S or 4 bad|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: declarer should not be too stressed here|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I would double as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: revealing trap pass in hearts (says owen)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: West's auction would tend to show a penalty pass over 1@H doubled, which value-wise isn't very descriptive.  But it's likely that's not their agreement.|pg||

pc|c2|nt|othered1: Oh, I guess it was.  Passing 1@HX could be really risky, however -- it could make with game on EW|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Shirley and welcome!|pg||
nt|ckv: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: I operated all yesterday for this group  great group of young folks  |pg||
nt|sybarra: top notch players |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kareno: Penultimate hand now.|pg||
nt|robinswr: thats the rule of 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Argenta Price  is the only female in the group|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kareno: Thanks to Diane Graese for an excellent job Operating for us.|pg||
nt|robinswr: when declarer shows up with KQ of spades ak of dia KJ of hearts, not much left|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to my fellow expert commentators for their wit and wisdom.|pg||
nt|scotty: It would be nice for East if double of 1N is TO here, though at this vul, may not risk it|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to the USBF (especially Jan Martel) for allowing us to report their premier events|pg||
nt|robinswr: i play it as responsive|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to BBO for a fabulous platform for showing these great events every week of the year|pg||
nt|kareno: And thanks to the specs for keeping us awake!!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it should be as a passed hand facing a mere one-level overcall, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i would lead a heart also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better to have a doubleton spade though|pg||
nt|robinswr: but looking at all the hands, i would lead a club|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: woeful underrepresentation |pg||
nt|sybarra: this round is playing for USA2  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: but go argenta!|pg||
nt|sybarra: Lall team is USA1 as decided by yesterday's  scores  |pg||
nt|othered1: Guess there was no need for south to raise @S, as north likely had a check-back available if looking for 3-card support|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: is that on your card?|pg||
nt|scotty: Unlucky lead - a club would have defeated 1N, perhaps by as many as 4 tricks.  But no reason for E to find that|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes he did |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure Argenta is wondering about the "gift" |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: she asked about the carding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: so i'm sure she was :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|kareno: Yet when partner sticks his vulnerable neck out to overcall, one should consider leading his suit, even a singleton.|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|c9|nt|robinswr: but i overcall with 8 points 65432/Ax/Axx/xxx for instance|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: Not for the lead?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a nice card for south to see.  Wonder if she'll think things are too easy here|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe could make another trick but ....imps  just make it!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|scotty: I would guess that overcalling with that hand vulnerable is anti-percentage action|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ckv: actually i have a lot of sympathy for zach's lead- probably still a push|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: eric checks to make sure that 2@H is hearts, as they play transfer overcalls in other sequences|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I love to overcall but I would resist Steve's example.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|sybarra: hello to Henry Bethe |pg||
pc|d9|nt|robinswr: actually the only time i go for numbers is when i had a hand like Passell's |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess east was allowing for a really garbaby overcall.  It was, but the right garbage.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Quick and dirty auction to a fine slam.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|scotty: Going for numbers is only one of the many. many problems with overcalling on that hand|pg||
nt|henryb: Here, Shirley, is a slam that makes, and I cannot believe that a nf 2@h bid can be right with the E hand|pg||
mc|12|nt|ckv: i've always thought that nf const was not the right way to play at imps- i prefer forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes so I see Slam,  but takes @H's 2/2 |pg||
nt|othered1: I don't see how east could have taken stronger action, given the likely @S duplication.|pg||
