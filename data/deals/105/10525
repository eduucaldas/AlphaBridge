nt|vugrapha3: on card it says "FSJ limit+"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: 4-card majors, weak NT for N-S I presume|pg||
nt|benjent: 2NT must be artificial - I suggest weak with C or some strong hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT are one but will miss the handle of @C I belive, so a partscore might? Or  NT still|pg||
nt|benjent: 3@c would have been forced, and Koke's passed it out with the uninviting hand with @c's|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: nt wrong now|pg||
nt|haans: how is that possible|pg||
nt|april7: W shouldplay NT and not E, but he wants to play in a minor, to bad|pg||
mb|3N|nt|april7: 8 tricks only|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smart can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2NT is textbook stuff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bagchi "see red" (the vulnerability) and bids 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't that show 11-12 with a C stopper?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: if you double 2@H please hide  = no more bidding|pg||
nt|april7: now they are overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... tougher if you take a point or two away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's see|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use 11-14 NT openings so this show 15 - 17(18)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: precion at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: precision|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: the 2NT bid was not the best idea|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a spot for 6@S here. Still tough @S are 1-4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: the X was also wrong, because E makes it now and W WAS FORCED  TO CONTINUE BIDDING ANYWAY|pg||
nt|haans: you can not sell precision withn that bidding|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: On either black suit switch, it seems N/S has 5 tricks|pg||

nt|rodal f: Would anyone have made an X in N over 2@C?|pg||

nt|benjent: Lead philosophy test for Andy here - 4th, or try to find partner?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: North just said e/w should be playin rubber|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: there could be a slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6C is not a bad contract either but would fail on the 4-1 off-side trump split|pg||
nt|haans: did 2@H show extra|pg||
nt|april7: @H are 3-3 so 12 tricks are coming in|pg||

pc|s6|nt|april7: but in @D not in @C|pg||

pc|s2|nt|april7: N should pass,S has 6-10 HP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An accurate looking contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: A normal spot but might a bit hard|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: NS will probably play in@C and not in @D|pg||

nt|gracelin: 6D, bingo.|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|gracelin: but all south's 11 HCP are in the right place.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: S actually could bid 6@D, because without @D no slam posible,just to bad!!|pg||

mb|1N|nt|april7: although bad @S position, still 10 tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|haans: needed for ruffi8ng|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north's first club spot showed count, then the 2nd one could be for suit preference|pg||

nt|roman505:  The rest of our team were all under 30, Nye-Ware and Geromboux-Griffiths|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|april7: e goes all the way|pg||

mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: I spent around 30 years "learning" 3014 ... my brain has only a set number of system changes in it, and I am not going to spend one of them on this pointless exercise|pg||

nt|rodal f: Started 1H - 2@C in the other room|pg||

nt|super nova: 6c is par.. 7 h or 7c no way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is it a good grand slam?|pg||
nt|super nova: :-S|pg||
nt|super nova: no|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% grand approx|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see the same good bidding here? But by 2-2@C needed|pg||
nt|benjent: This contract drifted 3 off in the Open room - let's see if Khokan can do better....|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will be minimum2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: this is the last board all results can be ound at http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=09ANCT&header=abf|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at least to The Australian Federation - BBO by all there nice people. ( Wald are at sleep) We was Bjørn and Frank from norway trying to help|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||
nt|super nova: Just thinking about the extra 6% that bill mentioned|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But you can pick up singleton J or Q with North|pg||
pc|c4|nt|elivero: And thx to Frank that use so mucth of his time for uss here,,thx Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: In the otherroom S bidded 1@S. Gave room for the opps|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|april7: now a crossruff is coming|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Losing to doubleton QJ - that's the extra 6%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if you guess it|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would play it that way based on restricted choice if an honour was played from N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you don't, you consign yourself to 40%|pg||
nt|elivero: there we go:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|benjent: Low @d to the J looks like the best ployt to create tricks, but doesn't work here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can play small !X to A and @D|pg||
nt|benjent: Might still generate a little by playing @c to the A then a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Makes 5|pg||
nt|benjent: Snap, Rodal!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or. Best small @D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: I take my words back:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D 4rth. Then after 3@H a que on the road?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: thats the last hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Their auction was a little mysterious, but I suppose once West 4th-suited, East was bidding a slam|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugrapha3: Play has finished and will resume in about 20 minutes time.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: that is, 2100 EST|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Thanks to everybody. See you when play resumes.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Congratulations to SA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roman505:  They came home against an ACT team which had led most of the round robin|pg||
nt|rodal f: And afterthe ques. 5@H = do u like ure quality at @H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to stop at 4|pg||
nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Perhaps as commented elsewhere, it is often unwise to use 4NT with weak trumps.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Thank you all. Bye now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thanks all see u next year :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|april7: thanks all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: Still their auction lacks conviction.  For example, did anyone see a diamond cue bid from West?|pg||
nt|benjent: Well done Khokan, tightens the match up a little|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will hang at 5 loosers as I see it. Right Bjørn?:)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6 on?|pg||
