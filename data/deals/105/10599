mb|5S|nt|jwit: After all from West's point of view, they are not beating the contract unless partner has KJx of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: From East's p;oint of view I should say|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Wasn't easy for East to cash @CA. What if declarer had KJ and was on a guess?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: As some/most of you may know, the other match was rather one-sided, so now the losing team, Lichtenstein, has forfeited|pg||
