nt|vugrapha3: on card it says "FSJ limit+"|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4-card majors, weak NT for N-S I presume|pg||
nt|benjent: 2NT must be artificial - I suggest weak with C or some strong hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT are one but will miss the handle of @C I belive, so a partscore might? Or  NT still|pg||
nt|benjent: 3@c would have been forced, and Koke's passed it out with the uninviting hand with @c's|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can Bachi find extra values?|pg||
mb|d|nt|benjent: Seems like De Luca forgot to use Blackwood on 11 - hence the swing to ACT|pg||
mb|r|nt|haans: any bid from east = game|pg||
nt|april7: are 6 points enough?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Puppet used?|pg||

nt|rodal f: On for a nice slam now:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: for system cards see http://www.abf.com.au/events/anc/2009/systems.html|pg||
mb|2D|nt|april7: 2@S 3@D and then 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: nt wrong now|pg||
nt|haans: how is that possible|pg||
nt|april7: W shouldplay NT and not E, but he wants to play in a minor, to bad|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: 8 tricks only|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smart can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2NT is textbook stuff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bagchi "see red" (the vulnerability) and bids 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't that show 11-12 with a C stopper?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: if you double 2@H please hide  = no more bidding|pg||
nt|april7: now they are overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... tougher if you take a point or two away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's see|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use 11-14 NT openings so this show 15 - 17(18)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: precion at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: precision|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: the 2NT bid was not the best idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he will let this ride to his queen and advance @H10 to the queen|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Was a spot for 6@S here. Still tough @S are 1-4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: the X was also wrong, because E makes it now and W WAS FORCED  TO CONTINUE BIDDING ANYWAY|pg||
nt|haans: you can not sell precision withn that bidding|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: On either black suit switch, it seems N/S has 5 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: By there systemcard. How to get in the key cards?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4d key card|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|benjent: So small opportunity for SA if Lusk-De Luca can bid 6@s in the other room - not clearcut, but De Luca is an ... enthusiastic ... bidder|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: I will take a look|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: its still 1 down|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|april7: 3 of @C to give count|pg||

nt|rodal f: After 4@S all roads was closed to find the slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Yes, Khokan wouldn't have been surprised to find that he was going down in 5@s with 5@c making despite his 3 aces|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would anyone have made an X in N over 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I don't like it. Give E the 2NT free bid. Better to emty the hand by 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: I did not see the last cards at board 6. Should be 1 down normaly. What happend Bjรธrn?|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: why 2 @S and not 3@D???|pg||
nt|haans: but may promise 4|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: First web was TV if u like to follow dif tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2s was alerted and was probably their system bid.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gracelin: ater south cashes two club tricks and shift to a D, north better duck this.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like Khokan is dispensing with science|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not particularly fond of Blackwood without a spade control|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Most would have cue bid 4@D I guess|pg||

mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: Bagchi (West) is a brilliant bridge player ... he plays a very psychological sort of game, and 4NT doesn't surprise me here|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can also go for the vug TV if u like and watch all matches: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=09ANCT&header=abf|pg||
nt|rodal f: the normal 11-14 NT and a nice balance from E|pg||

nt|benjent: Question about where this event leads...|pg||
nt|rodal f: For vug TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|1H|nt|april7: although bad @S position, still 10 tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|haans: needed for ruffi8ng|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north's first club spot showed count, then the 2nd one could be for suit preference|pg||
nt|april7: but then its to late|pg||
nt|roman505:  The rest of our team were all under 30, Nye-Ware and Geromboux-Griffiths|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|april7: e goes all the way|pg||
nt|gracelin: at least let declarer find the double dummy play|pg||
nt|benjent: The Australian system awards Playoff Points for wins and high finishes in national events|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2NT are to hard in S now but would have woorked|pg||
nt|benjent: Afetr a bruising year, we have a playoff for the national team(s) amongst the highest playoff-point-scorers|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: I spent around 30 years "learning" 3014 ... my brain has only a set number of system changes in it, and I am not going to spend one of them on this pointless exercise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Roland. Normaly 1403 fit the cards better the 0314|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be a + for NS anyway I belive:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A practic bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|april7: N is wondering whats going on|pg||
nt|haans: 4NT?|pg||
nt|benjent: The winners of this event get about 3/4 of the points needed for the playoff|pg||
nt|kiddd: ???|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|haans: clubs + shorter diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My wife plays 1430 except in clubs.  My comment is: "what a schemozzle"|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got the spot.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: better :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2 down on @C lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: De Luca trying to put sand in the machine|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|april7: @C switch!!|pg||
nt|haans: what has happened to Blackwood you may ask? finding game more important|pg||
nt|april7: it makes on a non @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And next by 11 I belive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11 o'clock?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: declarer still needs to guess spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Rodal, I reckon you would be great on Twitter|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjent: Good X of 4@s by Smolanko to get his side in the game|pg||
nt|roman505:  Another straightforward hand after the early excitement, but I think we will have more to come|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: low high signal!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Y. But I belive 4 @S are -1 so + already after the bid from W|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: 0230 in Denmark|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 11:30|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nearly as they should have bidded 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|gracelin: because after 3 rounds of trump, he has only one trump left and has two losers to cover|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My watch must be fast ...|pg||

nt|april7: can't duck this and take second, then must also duck second|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|april7: N could bid now a preemtive 3@C,not 2|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nice @H on bad @C of|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S|pg||
nt|roman505:  Everything lay well for declarer on the last hand, but biding 3NT was unlikely on their auction. |pg||
nt|roman505:  SA may reach three here though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: negative = spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: For set the contract down it was needed a @S lead I belive|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: but do they have 8 but not 9???|pg||
nt|gracelin: depending on the range of 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|april7: then S might stop in 4|pg||
nt|roman505:  If they do, it may wrap up the match|pg||
nt|roman505:  No!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|gracelin: West will bid game if 2NT shows 22+|pg||
nt|april7: then its GF, but with 22???|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C easy puppet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 or 11 tricks depending on how well he guesses hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are home now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|april7: but 5 is ok, Qof @D could be ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clubs a non-issue on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: I wonder if Smolanko had a little try for game, and gave it up after a 2@d minimum response|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS to gain 1 IMP more?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think so - looks like 9 tricks are available|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: New @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Kan kill it by a neew @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: not necessary game forcing, just showed some range and West thought his 3 is enough for game.|pg||
nt|haans: sort of agree with you but Mackwell boys never passed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: duck first @H|pg||
