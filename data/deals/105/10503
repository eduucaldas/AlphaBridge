nt|lc: I sure would (the way my partner's lead).|pg||
nt|lc: But Granovetter is indeed sound.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe for that reason, Ekeblad should not have revealed the @CJ here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair checked the clock - we have plenty of time, so he's taking a restroom break and Russ is smoking. Back soon|pg||
nt|lc: Is BBO available in the restroom?|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: Players are not allowed to have any electronic decives, by the way.|pg||
nt|lc: A good rule in today's electronic age.|pg||
nt|chip: maybe if you have an iphone or equivalent (why security on those is tight)|pg||
nt|lc: They actually don't screen or check.  It is on the "honor system."|pg||
nt|chip: But harsh penalties if caught.|pg||
nt|lc: Players wouldn't intentionally have a device, but they often forget to unload them and accidentally walk in with one in pocket.|pg||
nt|lc: Several times, cell phones have gone off and caused big problems.|pg||
nt|lc: Not at this event, as far as I know.|pg||
nt|poohbear: somebody mentioned a cell phone going off|pg||
nt|poohbear: forget who|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can Lair afford to win, and play some @D to get better inferential count?|pg||
nt|kit: not too safely|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think so, since North could ruff a @D|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe opponents would give honest count in @D.  :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lc: Maybe.|pg||
nt|kit: and he still won't know about the clubs -- that jack of clubs doesn't have to be remotely honest|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|lc: As North, you don't like to see that @SK.|pg||
nt|kit: and here we are ladies and gentlemen|pg||
nt|poohbear: Jack of @cs sure looked like someone who wanted to tap dummy|pg||
nt|kit: jack of clubs meaningless -- unless somebody has 4 spades, dummy tap is meaningless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schwartz in similar position but  2 rounds of hearts, Passell overtakes cashes @CA and exits @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: does @C5 lead then @CJ help decide if they're  34 vs 43 ??|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: ouch --|pg||
