nt|vugraphu4: here we are|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|vugraphu4: Hi All, welcome back|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: We missed the beginning of this again<:(|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Not sure I would bother with 3@H with West's cards. It has defence written all over it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: If West had passed, Lee would have had a big problem. Presumably, he would have tried 2@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Martin!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i totally agree with Roland about 3@H|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphu4: ok, we are now steady, and should hopefully be good :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|vdoubleu: He now has to finesse hearts twice, which should not be too difficult.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vdoubleu: Oh, I misspoke.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do you manage that val?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: It is actually, because then the defence can negotiate a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: W/difficulty.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, after South gets in w/spade he can alwaysput North in w/club to get a ciamond ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: This is a 3 way match, so we already have comparisions for all the boards :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: What does everyone think of South;s double here?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4/10|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: ok, we are caught up here|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: We will not have any comparisons until the 2nd part of this match|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vdoubleu: This event is capped (in age) at 26.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it means i slightly disapprove|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|ianwbjones: im vulnerable, i'd hate partner to bid @d, not sure I would even give it 4 :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vdoubleu: Only lsightly, OK.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|vdoubleu: Agree Ian:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ianwbjones: then again im so conservative my partners have to bid my hand for me too :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vdoubleu: Atypical, for a Junior, these days Ian:)|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: So Bittner's "noise" (3@h) cost them 5 IMPs.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: I am actually on my own laptop here, which happens to be painfully slow... so it's my fault :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Ofc, we knew it all along:)))))|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe a check-back sequence now. I believe 3@D is|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|vdoubleu: Some play that they bid their 3-card support first (assuming East held 4 spades) others, the opposite.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: It is by agreement.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: This event is being played with Screens also... sadly there are only 3 teams :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should support first, especially with hearts versus spades|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vdoubleu: But, if you have an agreement, would not matter, if you bid spades first.  Then over 3NT , you would correct to 4@h.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but partner may be intending to offer a choice even after you show 3 card support|pg||

pc|s6|nt|vugraphu4: claiming in a moment :)|pg||
mc|7|nt|fabsayc: i think he would have done better to elope two diamond ruff prior to the spade ruff|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: high|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: more than the down 1= good bridge limit|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: If undoubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vdoubleu: 3@c must be invitational with clubs?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No, Puppet.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: according to their CC|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|!h|nt|ianwbjones: doesnt look like a GF hand to me, but we've been over this before :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: puppet gives you an extra way to overbid :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: So this will be a nice swing to Bittner.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Goldfiein thinking here... slam is making :)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Shakes his head and passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Assuming heart lead..|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: even if they're playing 15-17, they're fighting against the odds here :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Totally agree.|pg||

nt|ianwbjones: you've really gotta be playing the backs off the cards if you keep bidding like that :)|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: or get very lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: almost a slam...|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: wrong minor AK|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|vugraphu4: This is the last board on this 8, then we will be back in about 2 or 3 min after|pg||
mb|r|mb|2C|nt|vugraphu4: Fast and furious :)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: well... I'm furious at my computer at least...|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugraphu4: Justin is autosplintering, and Jeremy will signoff with all the wasted @c values probably|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Justin = Lall, and Jeremy = Fournier for the specs asking :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: should make 5|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not, there is an uppercut|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: After dimaond K lead, still has to play carefully.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Will knock out spade A.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphu4: the play of this should go quick... (famous last words)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vdoubleu: Actually doesn't have to at all.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Can pull trumps & claim:)|pg||

pc|d6|nt|vdoubleu: I think declarer here should have assumed that North had 6 diamonds for his overcal & played accordingly.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Specs are typing me about the uppercut.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Which would not have occurred if he had pulled all the trumps:)|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphu4: ok, thanks all :)|pg||
