nt|othered1: 4@H is a "summary" of the auction.  Would be interesting to see how they got there, with 5@C luckily on NS|pg||

nt|othered1: East opened 1@C and rebid 1N after the 1@H response.  Here east chose not to open the long suit, being prepared in @D instead.  Reasonable, if you can't rebid 1N.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|karlson: i'm not a big fan of the 1d with 4-5 style, but it's certainly popular|pg||
nt|othered1: I hate it, personally.  Had so much difficulty getting it to work for me, I now use it (1@D-2@C rebid) artificially.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Here the inferences are hugely different and 3@D is a very reasonable spot, even vul.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|karlson: yeah, 9 tricks. does seems normal to invite game opposite 17-19, kind of a random swing caused by system differences|pg||

nt|karlson: shirley, can you keep us updated on the third match's result as well?|pg||
nt|othered1: It's been offered that NS might play a 1@H rebid over 11D as any 19+ hand.  If so, looks like south was pushy.|pg||
