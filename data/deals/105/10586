nt|athene: Jones hoping to endplay north|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done push,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems making 5 here is easy enough,|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bence bu maçta özellikle açýk odada oynayan çiftimiz þehmuz ve mehmet güney güzel bir skor kaðýdý getirdiler|pg||
nt|tomi2: well played!|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nice play.  Bye all|pg||
nt|othered1: As shown, wasn't that only 10 tricks (@D, @C and @H off?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next board are 4@S at W|pg||
nt|rodal f: In the other room|pg||
nt|andy_h: Double partscore swing - reducing the deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: On the previous deal, note the nice @SJ discard by N, and then leading a @S to hand. Tough for W now to take the A with KQ in dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: so the technical problems appearently caused some mess|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's somoething that of course is out of hand of everybody involving|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|yuval10: for running scores from this event|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry I have big problems here....|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on Juniors or schools for the event you want to see|pg||
nt|yuval10: np, it happenes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are closer to the truth now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hard to see that this will create a swing|pg||
nt|liviu123: bord 13  |pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, it's the problem , but the result here is correct|pg||
nt|liviu123: board 13 is another score|pg||
nt|yuval10: however, OR made it wrong, as 3@d was actu ally down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT making was the correct score, so we might want to ask the operator of the Open Room for the right result in board 13|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17 already played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 77-35 is the score after 17|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the same reason Tarnovsky shoud not duck the club|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done, W didnt have space for for the A@s in his hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: or not|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: everyone has left the table again|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1imp, 4 boards left|pg||
nt|mamos: the chance of swings seems to hav e receeded|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N NS easy this time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- dont quite understand- would bid 2H for sure over 2C and would probably bid 3D |pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: must be in 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: oh, there are more boards.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1H - 2NT - P - 4@S|pg||
nt|gh1: problem with club lead in 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will kill y|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: how?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: credit to the 2@C overcall, then|pg||
nt|charles_l: take a WC break or something|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 3N looking for 9th trick I think|pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt - 3Nt - but only 8 tricks - from start|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead = 9. trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: running out of boards |pg||
nt|rodal f: But might there systed diconected the re opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 4@s here|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 5@D -3 best defense|pg||
nt|raghavan: Charles - Has S gone to get u Red wine??|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 'defence|pg||
nt|poohbear: ble if you get there|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to play @c instead of A@d when pd asked for @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem ise iniþli çýkýþlý gittiler ama net bilançolarý artý'da bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: yeah Europans are 20 boards each wihle World Championships are 16 boards and also 3 segments|pg||
nt|kaapo: Another nebulour 1@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: *nebulous|pg||
nt|gh1: must play dia too k then|pg||
nt|rodal f: Miss a trow at the 3. @C honor|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||

nt|rodal f: system|pg||
mb|1S|nt|charles_l: :) hope so\|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no, she kept moving her thumb from 1@s to 2|pg||
nt|raghavan: If W does not bid D now, no future D contract|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4major+1 is the most common boring flat board by a long way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: açýk odada birisi kontr demeyi unutmuþ. çok iyi skor|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@S - pass - pass - dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bu 5 kör deklaresine ne buyrulur?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: batarý olmayan kontratý 1 atýþta buldu Erdem|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, West bid 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'm glad I didn't buy a lottery ticket today ;)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is around 11-15 if unbalanced or 13-16 balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: So East is quite maximal and might find a move|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose Bethers isn't thinking, but Arvidsson|pg||
nt|othered1: Game in either pointed suit is possible NS, but may not be easy to handle|pg||
nt|ronpa: the Israeli NS at the other table did very well to let 5@C play and not bid 5@D|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@d 3@d seems normal|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: just needs K@C in pocket (and reasonable @S and other breaks) for slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s is comfortable 5 is not|pg||
nt|poohbear: but it will make|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ben katýlýyorum 4h x bole bi el ifade edemez  ehveni ser cok begendim b|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmm arda kötü þeyler düþünüyor|pg||
nt|eerbil: çok yüksek baþladý konuþma, tehlikeli bizim için|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kontru düþün arda baþka þeyleri boþver|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nop, N was|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps Bech should have thought|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: clearly you shdnt buy that ticket|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D seems to be w2 in one major, and south hopes for more than those jacks in partners hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: which means that this will be flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely to be slam hunting on 10 opposite 16|pg||
nt|athene: south might get interested now|pg||
nt|syl: w may dble this|pg||
nt|hedyg: S might get involved now|pg||
nt|ronpa: sure he's going to bid 4@S :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: game on a finesse . Missed in the other room. no big deal NV|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can it be @H + a minor?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just 2 finesses for laydown 4H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|davidb: W dreaming of KQ spade & A cl for a slam|pg||
nt|athene: but it's a bit pushy facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@c is exclusion RKCB asking for aces but NOT the @c ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c non gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: I prefere 20 boards - we are playing championships, so why play 48 boards a day only...|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@C = 11...14 bal or 441@D4 or 17+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or as Terje Lie say. 10 always. Will get a @H ruff might|pg||
nt|mariner1: now looking for 10th trick :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: def have 2A and 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: E has passed |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: (after consulting CC)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Ok, will stay on. Can't miss this slam hand.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan PO|pg||
nt|po-s: hej|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'd have passed as West?|pg||
nt|gh1: ggod lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's a bold prediction, Roland :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 3|pg||
nt|ritong: so 3NT, @c Q lead|pg||
nt|mamos: this will go off|pg||
nt|h bertens: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: but seems completely normal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphztr: yep but ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: so a misunderstanding and finally I get to say a possible pickup for my friends from Croatia :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe Davor is here:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: & Zvonimir:)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: obur taraftan onunda tedbir etmesi lazim 6h yapamicaklari acik rakibin deklarasyonundan  esit zon durumunda|pg||
nt|tokay1975: x diyebilir teklif gibi  dayanabiliyosan birak dayanamiyosan 6h de |pg||
nt|hedyg: why 4@H?|pg||
nt|henryb: I am afraid I too must leave you, Henri.|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a vous, henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: showing an acol style 2@d opening with the 3@d bid|pg||
nt|ritong: this shouyld not survive|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, not on a @s lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2Diam GF & 2Cl semiforcing|pg||
nt|ritong: unless west tries to have a glance at dummy|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ama pas  demeside kabul edebilir|pg||
nt|rayhaa: and 4imps for France|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it will be on a finesse at best if partner has the perfect @HA @CAJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E might have an important card too, and does here with K@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S should win A@C and pull @S and lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, draw trumps|pg||
nt|poohbear: Who are they?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D confirms the strong variant of polish club and asks partner for further information|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C confirmed 5 hearts and some extras, 3@H sets trumps and starts slam investigation|pg||
nt|po-s: absolutely - East has max 15|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like it's going to be easier than I thought|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice lead here found by hoffmeister although a small club would be nice too ;)|pg||
nt|ronpa: this will have hard time making|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 3@c twice, how many does he need?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly a bidding misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ritong: i tend to like the U26 thing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France back up to 6 VP now|pg||
nt|frusco: lol|pg||
nt|h bertens: he has to take the ace|pg||
nt|Gerben42: straightforward auction, 2@C was inverted|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 500 after heart ace - 800 on unlikely black lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: E showing min - W gave up. flat|pg||
nt|davidb: " new york syndrom "|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might play low on the basis that even @CK, club ruff, diamond isn't beating|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Davor Suker & Zvonimir Boban:):)|pg||
nt|poohbear: OK....................|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6 kör demediði için artýk ne dese mutlu oluruz :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: splinterle  basladi  bidding  goremez  hemen 3love hde almiyolarsa|pg||
nt|tokay1975: normal|pg||
nt|ozgull: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Polish Club in operation|pg||
nt|h bertens: well done|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ty Adrian|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5 is probably exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5@D asks for keycards outside the @D suit, but unfortunatly east has a hand where he could even pass this|pg||
nt|tomi2: I am asked why undos are accepted in this match, I can explain you:|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: when you see an undo it means in 99% of the cases, that the operator made a misclick|pg||
nt|tomi2: and not one of the players|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@H= 7...11 , 3+@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: does 2@d show fit in @c 100%?|pg||
nt|ronpa: Padon couldnt start with 2@H directly over 2@C which is nf|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ???|pg||
nt|ronpa: no 2@D is just forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: and probably declarer will stagger home via @h J hook after discovering the horrible @d break|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: cue-bid at south's second turn, unless a transfer to @D, wouldn't be everyone's choice.|pg||
nt|andy_h: South was obviously hoping for @HKQ-6th with North...but didn't 3@C say weak with hearts, Bas?|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N happens to make as cards lie |pg||
nt|odysseus69: hope N?S get signals right|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: one poor guy is sitting close to the table and tries to record the cardplay for all of us here in BBO|pg||
nt|tomi2: most often players play either very slow or very fast, so in the "fast" case it is hard to follow all cards and bids|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora is now counting on his fingers :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Nawrocki was surely imagining counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5NT shows two but I onkt see 1 key card outside D in East's hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: must've gone wrong somewhere. restarted the count|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes something is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the false 5nt is giving him headache|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would expect 2 keycards and no @HQ from east using my fingers to count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A bit annoying to watch a board that has been played already|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he felt obliged to show his @hs now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this reminds me of bd 7|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes girl Make them pay|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we can do turkish commentary in one room in ALL of the matches of turkey. no problem. just let me know|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorulara cevap ....|pg||
nt|eerbil: peki erdem'in önce 4@h'e kontr atýp rakip 4@s deyince 5@h demesi hakkýndaki fikirleriniz? daha defans içeren bi el göstermez mi sizce?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bugün bu maç son|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýnki maçlar 19.00,   14.00  ve 17.30 da|pg||
nt|sybarra2: nice place to land |pg||
nt|othered1: very well done|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'd just bid 4@D, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I've shown P a very good hand bidding that way|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphztr: and Aliosja Asanovici's dbl:):)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 19 deðil 10 olacak pardon|pg||
nt|othered1: They seem to know what they were doing, however.|pg||
nt|liviu123: 17 is null 4H+1 |pg||
nt|ritong: okay, wipe all that:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: but there is just no way west is underleading the @CK here|pg||
nt|athene: when his partner doubled 4@D|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can certainly ruff @H if E cashes the K@C|pg||
nt|athene: are we still here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff HIGH|pg||
nt|kaapo: A good point yes, you aren't really going anywhere (but trouble perhaps) by bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and where you know the result|pg||
nt|spaima: link for runing scores? |pg||
nt|athene: declarer doesn't know the @HA is right|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ist grad schelcht muss gleich los|pg||
nt|Gerben42: sry - I mean have to go soon|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N also in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Gerben :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just a question of overtricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: E hoping there is a play that is hard to see, there isn't|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3rd step 5NT should show 2 key cards without HQ, so West knows someting is still missing for the grand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did S miss?|pg||
nt|gh1: he sleep home now|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SA - and a new @C.|pg||
nt|yuval10: why? you can make some bet with your friends about it|pg||
nt|yuval10: like i bet the lead will be.....2@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think @S6|pg||
nt|mariner1: has few options though|pg||
nt|athene: true; he will probably have to play for that eventually|pg||
nt|athene: but will fiddle around a bit first|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some tricks and watch the defenders wriggle :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I thought you had a cat :) )|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe he distusts W's bidding 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Ace holding mr. Simonsen is now asking for a recapitulation of the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: this needs some "thorowaway" squeeze|pg||
nt|gracelin: but from east's point of view, if no key-card is missing, he wants to be in seven|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You win|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: lol i had a safety though, according to running scores|pg||
nt|ritong: nice lead, i wouldn t find it, thinking my pard has a positional opening, and thus a good @c suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tomi2: west was probably asking for 3rd round kontrol in clubs and E thought he made no mistake and had this control and running tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: good lead, save everybody time and energy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now mr Simonsen is asking for a recapitulation with his partner :)|pg||
nt|liviu123: it is on live score 2@D :)|pg||
nt|ritong: first move will certainly be cashing a top @d, then it will go faster|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. Berg where pulled a bit of. Tookhis safe.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: türkiyenin maçýnýn verilip verilmeyeceði yarýn sabah belli olacak|pg||
nt|tomi2: would not be the best lead if E had club void|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @H was played defence needed to play @S before a new @C for 1 down. Not easy|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|raghavan: well made 4 - H goes in CA|pg||
nt|ritong: noone tried the zia joke?|pg||
nt|ritong: usually , 3@s shows a solid suit and asks for a @s stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hmmm? What's that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: ve günlül bültene bakarak görebilirsiniz|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tokay1975: oda olabilir ama  rakib icin avantaj o simdi hýzlý ve son karari rakibe birakti bastan x diyip 5h dese eger kontrlu oynamasi  gerekiyosa kontrlu oynar |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I know|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer is not happy to see the dummy, but he will feel better soon|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: türkiye vugrafa çýkarsa da kapalý oda türkçe yoruma açýlacak|pg||

nt|Gerben42: fireworks here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|raghavan: Czech is now leading 42 v 23  > 19 lead|pg||
nt|athene: NS might manage to make 3@H if they bid it over 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 nt for e/w?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think it's: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
mb|d|an|1suited|nt|Walddk4: N-S have 4 tricks against a heart contract if they want them|pg||
nt|othered1: no room for pick-up here for Russia, barring a NS aberration.|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 12 tricks - 2 losers|pg||
nt|gracelin: I only blame him for not doubling.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: time for some more gazing at the ceiling|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Israel and Norway tied in 2nd now|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|tokay1975: splinter yapildiktan sonra  bunu kontrlamak bence mucize |pg||
nt|tokay1975: cok zor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North led a trump next door, hence the overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 3 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: was 2@H specific to the black suits or was the minor ambiguous?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidb: 4 boards  to go -most of the swings -2 slams -normal   in a match between 2 good teams |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 3@H is just too high in fact|pg||
nt|athene: redouble to play from south? :)|pg||
nt|athene: a modern idea is to use the redouble to show a different hand|pg||
nt|athene: you can either play that pass = 2 hearts only|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H = 3 hearts min|pg||
nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts max|pg||
nt|athene: or you can play that 2@H = 3 hearts, positional|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 800 seyirciye ulaþtýk|pg||
nt|ronpa: look how agressive the young players are, both room bidding 1@H with north cards|pg||
nt|ritong: annoying|pg||
nt|ritong: strength is ok, but @s stopper is thin|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 nt by N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as we saw before, Robert is not a reluctant raiser|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have a save here, NS might make 5 (@c lead beats it or @H and @c switch)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts, prefers pd to play it|pg||
nt|athene: typically with something like @Dxxx|pg||
nt|athene: in case pd has a diamond tenace|pg||
nt|mariner1: REDBL must show a real NT and a fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems strange that Emma did not raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=14|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Results this round|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Rob|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Rob :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: or a willingness to play @D I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a problem, the XX must be to play|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D on finding @DQ and this error and the match is close again|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has long support but no strength, shape, nor @C honours|pg||
nt|ritong: hi rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was sending to a kibber :)|pg||
nt|ritong: nice of you|pg||
nt|othered1: When I Michaels with the south hand, I regularly get the minor (especially @C) blown away.|pg||
nt|elbec: it should be @s and @c but i'm not very sure|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice slam here|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to imagine it's actually his partner with the short hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: could be a huge win for poland instead|pg||
nt|andy_h: A chance for Netherlands to pick up here - but it's hard to see where the 7th trick is going to come from|pg||
nt|liviu123: only if play @D on time :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he get back into the bidding?|pg||
nt|mamos: apparently not|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have a save here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|raghavan: If they do not cash Clubs - will make 12. May not lead from CA xxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S worked well in Open Room|pg||
nt|athene: if it showed 3 hearts, north wld bid 2@H like a shot|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: where is this going?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or 4 @S much better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=clubs and diamonds?|pg||
nt|ronpa: I doubt it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good question as to whether 2@C should be a UCB-type bid against Polish club|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 3@s then pass anything|pg||
nt|ritong: but 4@h:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 makes, 7 not|pg||
nt|charles_l: i like 4@d now|pg||
nt|sybarra: so would 1 nt have been sandwich |pg||
nt|odysseus69: grands are often easier to bid than small slams|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: EW has a lucky 6D/6NT here.  But shouldn't be bid.|pg||
nt|kaapo: East is very maximum for his limited opening|pg||
nt|po-s: 4sp by Simon?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Swedes have nothing printed on the ceiling... the thinking is done by staring at the screen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 nt from W might have been better ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c prob starts a get out sequence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or youthful exuberance?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and South Quickly gets out :P|pg||
nt|ronpa: thats nice to see that even they respond that light they have the methods and dicipline to stop|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think North was trying to get out in 3@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: South knew better|pg||
nt|poohbear: Board 16 wasnt scored here. Norway has 5 more imps|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I saw|pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile poles grabbed 10 imps finding a poetic moysian 6@s|pg||
nt|charles_l: wow 5@d|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like 5 @h will make here|pg||
nt|mariner1: forgot S has no @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: so @H lead would not beat 5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|charles_l: i wonder if 2@c is GF @c or bal|pg||
nt|charles_l: it is a common treatment|pg||
nt|davidb: D  guess for the contract |pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to bid over 1NT with that west hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: I hope it's the sreen that divides that table and not your screen ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, yes :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a not very lucky spot.  4@S on the west hand, however, is very pushy.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you do need some sort of UCB in these positions|pg||
nt|elbec: 2 off with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: Unfavorable vul save will cost an imp|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6@s save 150 toward 5@h|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6@d|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: you can't go letting people play in 2@H when you have spades!|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Greece likely to pickup a dual part score swing here|pg||
nt|poohbear: severe comunication problems oin this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: East isnt going anywhere|pg||
nt|eerbil: evet 4 daha|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@c after a short consultation of the system on the ceiling|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe X (but he doesnt have 4 @S)  tough hand |pg||
nt|h bertens: I would not call it sandwich, I call it foolish|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
pc|c6|nt|syl: "You dont comment this bid???"-asks a kib|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont have time to comment|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nuclear war|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This may well roll in|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder if 3@c could have been a strong hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: not an everyday auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW should be the anker at the team this year. They have not been by this session.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr . For orway|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|poohbear: If north leads a @h declarer will happily cash alot of tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: on a @s lead declarer gets endplayed in hand|pg||
nt|othered1: no return looks attractive to north.  East likely hasn't guaranteed 5@S, so trump shift could be costly, too.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, @C is very effective|pg||
nt|othered1: And huge hitch may help east work out where things are.  Just won't be very helpful this time.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: LOl |pg||
nt|sybarra2: Bas are they playing with screens? |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Both above and underneath the table surface|pg||
nt|yuval10: only @d lead, or @c and @d shift, beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not so easy for the defence to cash their tricks in the right order|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and we also know that it makes!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because Sweden have 6 more IMPs on the official scoreboard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: after board 18|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is nothing more than a recorded broadcast. Very annoying|pg||
nt|athene: most pairs have ways to show voids in these sort of auctions|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: he might have bid 2@S over 2@H if east hadn't doubled|pg||
nt|athene: although of course he wouldn't have been in balancing seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s some relay?|pg||
nt|ritong: probably some puppet auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: Rusinow style lead, KQ@H, no J or 10|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...Q = please do not unblock, rather  means suit is not that solid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|ritong: K would impose an unblock if available|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgeguys.com/RGlossary/RusinowLeads.html|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: it,s trandy to lead Q from RQxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 1h xi gordum inanilir gibi diil ya ben anormalim yada gozlerim iyi gormuyor artik|pg||
nt|ritong: does ucb mean unmaterial cue bid?|pg||
nt|lokaty: we play that in Poland, so maybe it still should:)|pg||
nt|capercliff: N and S both pushed a bit here|pg||
nt|santyclz: There's a more direct url, but it's too long to post, someone want to "tinyurl" it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 16 Closed Room they bid the 6@D missing two red aces and lost 13 imps|pg||
nt|charles_l: will be 5imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i would expect almost every pair to bid the grand here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|charles_l: !NEXT :)|pg||
nt|athene: better just to wade in on the first round, if you ask me|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree, and W in Open Room did that|pg||
nt|MolvaM: rakip natürel 1 pik dedikten sonra 2 pike gelip yapana ne denir? bravo? |pg||

nt|rodal f: Norway|pg||
pc|d5|nt|raghavan: I appreciate N not following South's que bid. |pg||
nt|poohbear: cash 2 @cs and take your best shot in @ds?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: wow, almost overkill |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT= long @cs, 16+, 0-2 @hs|pg||
nt|sten: Norway 4th in the U-21 series|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like East rightly showed the dQ treating his 5th as Q |pg||
nt|rodal f: There u are right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|capercliff: the lure of a vulnerable game proved big and N has a "better than 15" hand|pg||

nt|ritong: ok merci|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer didnt take a @d ruff?|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, completely.  Personally, over a major, I prefer to play 4 in other major and 6@C|pg||

nt|mariner1: same auction in Open Room|pg||
mb|2D|nt|babydolldk: well... next:) 4@S|pg||
nt|charles_l: perhaps 4@h shows another handttype|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 over 1 response forcing - 3H is support N does not know about S hand yet. He only says game in H|pg||
nt|tokay1975: bu el x diyebilir  biraz risk alir|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not the best lead I thin|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'think|pg||
nt|poohbear: ahhhh Adrian is just quitting early :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: is that right?|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: no will :-)|pg||
nt|elbec: 2nt should be 44 minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3, 7, 8....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this   East action is unusual|pg||
mb|p|nt|le joker: /°|pg||
nt|le joker: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H is relay|pg||
nt|ritong: hi alex|pg||
nt|hedyg: bonjour Alexandre|pg||
nt|mariner1: this plays well|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there we go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will make the match between Norway and France in 1 hour and 40 minutes even more exciting|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Norway defeated Belgium 20-10|pg||
nt|charles_l: the minor losers are covered... but 2 major losers|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like 13 IMP:s might come back to sweden here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unless ....|pg||
nt|mikael_w: NO @cJ lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No club lead at all :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but whith Qxx in trumph N shod try to get the @s trick IF they have one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In fact, double dummy it makes on anything but a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: yes, you are right, just wondering if s had a @C cue, would they still have played 4@H, how could n know it was rigt to bid 4@H....|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 'right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: still thinking...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Can I surmise the bidding as = 1C strong 1D <8 points, 2D both Majors 2H says Spades S agrees on S Is it OK Charles, Anita?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: yes!|pg||
nt|le joker: bonjour tout le monde :)|pg||
nt|le joker: hi |pg||
nt|gracelin: 1H showed 3-card support, but strength unlimited.|pg||
nt|tomi2: don't know if they have some agreement on the double, it could be @D only or takeout on 1@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: west bid 1@S in case partner has support, he still had @Daxxx in bag in case he finds out partner has only dias and no spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: "MENSTRUATIESTOORNIS"|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: uh?|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: the famous Drijver game yes|pg||
nt|ritong: you guys smoke tough stuff:)|pg||
nt|elbec: should :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: can be 22(45) i guess|pg||
nt|athene: you are much happier bidding 3@D with that west hand if you definitely agreed lebensohl in these positions|pg||
nt|athene: then partner knows you aren't just stretching to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Puuhhh|pg||
nt|rayhaa: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Most of us would have bidded 2NT ar lebensol after 2 @D ( as @H ) I belive|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East has adopted most unusual action here - suppressing 7 cd suit in favour of 4 cds|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: seems he still believes its takeout because he did not lead @D|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see eleven tricks here so maybe another 1 imps to Norway.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to test clubs early.|pg||
nt|xenya: not the best spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can win A@D or duck here.............|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S -50  in Open Room here|pg||
nt|athene: @SAKQ @DA is a bit of a flaw in 4@S|pg||
nt|poohbear: merely overtricks involved|pg||
nt|ritong: no big sweat here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tops|pg||
nt|ritong: just has to play to the end just in case|pg||
nt|hedyg: no extras|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX to The Romanian Bridgefederation and BBO with all there nice helpers for bringing this event to us. Roland Wald at least by his nice woork.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT is trf to 3@c, and 3NT showed stopper in @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe the double of 3H denied 5 spades?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: best lead for the defense|pg||

nt|mariner1: round posted after completion|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT marginal better than 5@D - u only need 3@D-tricks in 3NT - 51D down if S has Kxxx in @d - or a @Hruff|pg||
nt|athene: 13 tricks fall into declarer's lap here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Sry if you specs think I am voting for sweden here, Nut I AM|pg||
nt|mikael_w: BUT|pg||
nt|charles_l: @s8 asks @d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|charles_l: i dont know their methods|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: writing down bidding explanations now|pg||
nt|raghavan: as if I know. I inly guess on seeing their bids|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes proved to be :)|pg||
nt|ritong: have to hit same defender with @s KQ and @h QJ|pg||
nt|kastan88: slam time, 6 clubs here: 4 top tricks in side suits give away 1 @H and then crossruff. But that is not easy to find|pg||
nt|pelu: perfect distribution for NS - but difficult to bid a slam on 25 HCP|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: would  you are very right|pg||
nt|mamos: needed to win that|pg||
nt|h bertens: he did.....|pg||
nt|h bertens: with the queen|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ama 3h  ozellikle belirtim (bnm icin) konu disi|pg||
nt|athene: south gets squeezed in the majors|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphztr: now the other side is doing the same|pg||
nt|raghavan: only|pg||
nt|kastan88: hej, Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Jaak|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe E should've kept the @SJ, for W had only 4@S as well, this way he could've avoided W leading into Aces and a long suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kaapo: Heart to queen would be declarer's 9th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: @D to queen less succesful|pg||
nt|santyclz: Walter Johnson points out the top spot was probably defending 1@hx'd.|pg||
nt|athene: so you don't have to finesse spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Grosset still hopeful|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: everyone shd understand that i cant always follow the exact spot card|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, srill a good kontract|pg||
nt|charles_l: that will change in a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: if the card play is very fast...  i simply press enter to play the lowest card|pg||

nt|tomi2: he will maybe follow Zatorskis line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: if only he knew how small the diff. is...|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1 Imp is actually 1 VP, yes?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Keeping the @HA retains the control of the suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: So if this doesn't succeed, he can still have a shot at diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: now has to find 9th trick|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mug: the Open Room score doesn't appear in the movie, but England were one down in 4@S here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bordu egale etmeye çalýþmak çok güzel bir tanýmlama.  maçtan sonra ortaklarý susturmak için iþe yarar|pg||
nt|poohbear: this defense saves the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: one more broadcast|pg||
nt|poohbear: 10 of @ds will score|pg||
nt|ritong: and anyways, i think marion will hook @hs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|raghavan: how do these players get these leads? helping D -|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: oðlum çýldýrdýn mý diye sorana bordu egale ediyordum dedik mi sorun kalmaz|pg||
nt|po-s: well played, testing hearts first if it fails then the D finesse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphztr: i dont have the scale, sorry|pg||
nt|gracelin: 0-2 is 15-15|pg||

pc|dK|nt|babydolldk: what to lead??|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have cashed the @cs first|pg||
nt|ritong: or not:)|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: the Marion  hook yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: Hedy was saying,  "why didnt they give the assignment to someone involved in vugraph"  |pg||

pc|d2|nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes so if he makes an overtrick and other 2 boards are flat, then they score 15-15|pg||
nt|tomi2: if he makes 10 and other boards are flat, then it's 16-14 for poland|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is in trouble and need to drop CQ now to make|pg||
nt|tomi2: ha can also try to finesse, but that wd be more than one VP...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: claim |pg||
nt|ronpa: now he's lucky A@D onside so he doesnt suffer the @H ruff too|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|hedyg: claim 12 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: We where: Adrian - Silviu (Romania) and Geir - Frank (Norway) trying to do ower best as commentators. J26 are at a freeday tomorrow, but more nice bridge are to come from the Girls ...|pg||

nt|hedyg: thank you Adrian , great job :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess he wull play CK, make also when clubs are 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: he may think that W has some spade honor having K9x|pg||
nt|tomi2: one @D honor|pg||
nt|tomi2: that makes E favorite to hold @CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. J20|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the max 650 etc ?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|davidb: now D . if Declarer misguess down . |pg||
nt|andy_h: So it appears to be another double partscore swing - Does that mean the Dutch are good at getting very small and very big scores? :P|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Shame we're at the last board already, Orange seemed to be on a rally :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davidb: declarer still makes on a crossruff |pg||

nt|athene: and he has no aces and no long suit...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so Poland will win this 16-14.  Thx to both teams for this interesting set|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, tough to find the sacrifice after 4S.  Yes, I agree with specs' comments that both pairs performed very well at their age.  They might be the future of our game.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, thanks Adrian|pg||
nt|charles_l: 17 and 2 10s seems heavy to me|pg||

nt|rodal f: Best|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: double denied 4 spades, i assume, so 2@S is just offering to play the Moysian|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Ty for help|pg||

nt|kaapo: If 2@C was a puppet to 2@D (including the option of passing 2@D), North's not bidding 2@D would show extra strength|pg||

nt|mamos: this is maybe ok   |pg||
nt|sybarra: we shall see |pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 4@S DBL|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo: And there they are|pg||
nt|po-s: and North or South probably forgot what 2C was|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: massive consultations on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: in the OR N is in 3NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, yes, maybe they have to work on their CC a little bit more themselves, too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and made +3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will have to play on hearts before drawing all the trumps|pg||
nt|rodal f: But didnot cost much|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the 1S bid allowed North to make what was still a very conservative 2C bid |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: i havent the VP scale under my eyes, presumably 21 or 22 VPs to frenchies|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm missed the @c switch for -1!|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think he's mistimed it now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: the defence can organize south a heart ruff but that doesn't help them enormously|pg||

nt|mamos: getting the Hearts going will make a lot of difference|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mug: @CK in fear of the heart ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that play worked for S|pg||
nt|athene: pressure play from south!|pg||
nt|mug: but it may have cost him the contract|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't want to lose to @CQ and then @C9 on the overruff and @CA@DA to come|pg||
nt|rayhaa: @d lead was good|pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugraphztr: Thanks all, that was it for this tournament, thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sell out 2@C?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: CZech pair in OR did bid 6D and Norway took the save for damage limitation|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: And then 9 are on|pg||
nt|ritong: trump promo, but sgrouich|pg||
nt|poohbear: So looks like Israel will win this match 21-9 a very important victory over a team that was ahead of them|pg||
nt|poohbear: and France is losing to the Czech republic so the field is tightening a little|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good lead & good defence Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Israel on 5 place|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: close match it is|pg||
nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good teams|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can lose 9@C in ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: if south really did have @CA9x and want a heart over-ruff, it would be more natural for him to try spades and diamonds to find partner's ace|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps lead a diamond simply to try to set up a diamond ruff for partner|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps that small trump was suspicious - but not at all easy for declarer to be fair|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Likely flat and 18-12 to Sweden, meaning that France will be 13 VPs ahead of Norway ahead of their encounter in 1 hour and 25 minutes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tdrijverrr: yes indeed|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: next match i advise you to take Drijver_12  as commentator|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mikael_w: another even board :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: You don't get the reputation as a world-class gift giver without misdefending the occasional game.|pg||
nt|athene: the defence was effectively identical in the other room - at the critical point, instead of playing a trump, west played a third diamond through declarer, trying to promote ...|pg||
nt|athene: something in hearts in his partner's hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps its easy for us when seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thanks all, see you in 1 hour and 15 minutes or so|pg||
