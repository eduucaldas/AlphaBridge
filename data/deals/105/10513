mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Berk explained to Russ that 2@d showed extra diamond length (I think - know he explained something)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: Berk and lair switched seats for this set?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: of course Lair doesn't know that his partner was kidding, so he will probably bid 3@D|pg||

pc|dK|nt|kit: On a better day this would make, but here the pitch on the spade is of no value and declarer will lose 2 diamonds, 1 spade, and 1 club with club hook off.|pg||

nt|kit: not closed room auction -- South opened 2@H, 2@S overcall, and North took creepy-crawlie approach of 3@H (and then 4@h over 3@S)|pg||
nt|lc: Yeah, but if you try to Google Canape to look it up, you will get food info.,|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: More discussion of 4@s ending with agreement that it's down 1|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is NF|pg||

nt|kit: this is a good illustration why negative free bids of a MINOR aren't a good idea|pg||

nt|ahollan1: even if NF   do you expect 2@D to end the auction with that monster?|pg||
nt|kit: This time he lucks out, as slam goes down on the stiff club lead -- but that is just luck IMO|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, a @C lead would beat slam.|pg||
nt|chip: We now see that Russ got pushed into 5D. Maybe figures other side will have a good save.|pg||

nt|kit: two balanced hands, two distributional hands.  Let's see who bids the most.|pg||

nt|lc: 1@S  2@H  2@S,  then South drives to 4@H and E-W ...  we'll see.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|kit: I like my aces to capture their honors|pg||

nt|kit: simple LAW pass, right Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: You guys can all pile on and say that PASS was easy.  Yeah.|pg||
nt|chip: not a good hand for the NS system. No way for S to avoid playing a silly contract (way too high in 3C, but if he passes 2c, could be a 4-2 with a 5-3 spade fit).|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: You gotta believe!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|lc: Esspecially if partner has @D, pass makes sense.  But David's (and my) philosophy is try not to be -670 and win the match on some other board.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: figure  2 opponents guessing but only 1 partner|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|chip: I think Pass was a good decision. Percentage, but could be wrong.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|s5|nt|kit: my philosophy is a plus score is better than a minus score|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|chip: The 2C opening could have had 5S and 4 clubs (not a normal precision 2C).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i'd used Kit's philosophy with stock market|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, but -670 not as good as + 140.|pg||
nt|kit: 2 of clubs a very bad idea here|pg||
nt|kit: if it occurs to declarer to stick in the 7, that extra trick might be the difference here.|pg||
nt|kit: playing the 7 of clubs is saying that Ekeblad made a bad play|pg||

nt|Walddk2: *forgets|pg||
nt|benjent: Question about where this event leads...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: although bad @S position, still 10 tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|haans: needed for ruffi8ng|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north's first club spot showed count, then the 2nd one could be for suit preference|pg||
nt|april7: but then its to late|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|april7: e goes all the way|pg||
nt|gracelin: at least let declarer find the double dummy play|pg||
nt|benjent: The Australian system awards Playoff Points for wins and high finishes in national events|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: 2NT are to hard in S now but would have woorked|pg||
nt|benjent: Afetr a bruising year, we have a playoff for the national team(s) amongst the highest playoff-point-scorers|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I spent around 30 years "learning" 3014 ... my brain has only a set number of system changes in it, and I am not going to spend one of them on this pointless exercise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Roland. Normaly 1403 fit the cards better the 0314|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be a + for NS anyway I belive:)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|april7: N is wondering whats going on|pg||
nt|haans: 4NT?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: clubs + shorter diamond|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Schwartz in 2@D -- may be minus in both rooms|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14-17|pg||
nt|kit: likely 3NT -- and east needs to find brilliant diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: 4-3-3-3 but quite a good 17.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|kit: I would say that is next to impossible|pg||
nt|lc: Berk will surely lead a @H.|pg||
nt|chip: yes, seems impossible on this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, Berk is unlucky he has a 5-card suit of his own.  If he didn't, he could think about leading partner's 5-card suit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chip: plus he has the majority of his side's strength.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lc: The funny thing is that the SOUTH side (with guarded @DK) is actually the best side to play 3NT from -- but would be the unlucky side here.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: would Zia lead @DQ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: no|pg||
nt|chip: No|pg||
nt|lc: Only if he had hand records.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- that was meant to be rhetorical |pg||
nt|kit: interesting declarer play problem, since he doesn't know the ace of diamonds is onside|pg||
nt|poohbear: and even then:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "4th normally?" "yes, second from bad"|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: a very good case could have been made for going up queen of hearts there|pg||
nt|chip: maybe lead D if looking for a swing.|pg||
nt|kit: declarer's problem here is that if he knocks out the heart East will have diamond shift -- that is why I thought queen of hearts at trick 1 might be right, odd though it looks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ went to the bathroom, promising to think while there, now back|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|benjent: All finished in the other room, but 2 left here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gracelin: if spades break 4-1, it's 3 : 2 that west's singleton is a small one rather than an honor.|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: negative = spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but do they have 8 but not 9???|pg||
nt|gracelin: depending on the range of 2NT|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|april7: then S might stop in 4|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: West will bid game if 2NT shows 22+|pg||
nt|april7: then its GF, but with 22???|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C easy puppet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 or 11 tricks depending on how well he guesses hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: but 5 is ok, Qof @D could be ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clubs a non-issue on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: I wonder if Smolanko had a little try for game, and gave it up after a 2@d minimum response|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS to gain 1 IMP more?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think so - looks like 9 tricks are available|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|gracelin: not necessary game forcing, just showed some range and West thought his 3 is enough for game.|pg||
nt|haans: sort of agree with you but Mackwell boys never passed|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: duck first @H|pg||
nt|gracelin: then you lose your own club suit.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|gracelin: decarer will probably play hearts to be 4-4, and guess spade|pg||

nt|super nova: :-S|pg||

nt|super nova: 68% grand approx|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see the same good bidding here? But by 2-2@C needed|pg||
nt|benjent: This contract drifted 3 off in the Open room - let's see if Khokan can do better....|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will be minimum2 down|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||
nt|super nova: Just thinking about the extra 6% that bill mentioned|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: But you can pick up singleton J or Q with North|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|april7: now a crossruff is coming|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Losing to doubleton QJ - that's the extra 6%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if you guess it|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would play it that way based on restricted choice if an honour was played from N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you don't, you consign yourself to 40%|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|benjent: Low @d to the J looks like the best ployt to create tricks, but doesn't work here|pg||

nt|benjent: Might still generate a little by playing @c to the A then a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Makes 5|pg||
