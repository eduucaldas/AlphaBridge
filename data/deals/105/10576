nt|andy_h: Hi all :)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Shirley Ybarra and good afternoon to Mike Amos|pg||
nt|odysseus69: to win gold Norway needs a big win while France loses - this was not the start Norway wanted|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: who would Dbl in S?|pg||
nt|ritong: a simple duck of the first @ss would have avoided this cruel ending|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2nt =lower unbids |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello MIke |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: The Swedish bridge federation has put up a nice presentation, only in Swedish though: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.1917|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT might be 11-13 or so|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D probably a multi style, showing a long major|pg||
nt|tomi2: Max Ellerbeck did :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: I would. Maybe South is worried about @Hxxx but that wouldn't detour me in not doubling. By X-ing you get 3 suits across|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: So for those who missed it, Poland came in first in the girls series, followed by France and the Netherlands|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would consider a pass here, but thats the reason I am not playing there anymore... I am too old|pg||
nt|Gerben42: same here from the 30+ camp|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Good morning, everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: not a very good afternoon weeather wise here in England wet and very dark typical summer weather|pg||
nt|sybarra: theyre hts and club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 3@H looks a bit close at teams|pg||
nt|odysseus69: to convert silver to bronze Norway needs to lose while Israel wins big|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: good afternoon to Hedy Grey|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: we watch 2 experienced pairs -I  believe we will see good bridge|pg||
nt|Jacki: Does someone in here need to be ungagged to comment?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: In my opinion N's @Ds aren't good enough for a 4NT overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm for all results|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=733&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1 for running scores|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good one for your system talk: is 2NT natural here or does it show no preference...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The U26 Open category has a day off today, hence they don't have running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: south is now "endplayed" I think he should try some kind of 2NT bid and wait for something good to happen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for me 2NT is not natural in auctions where one opp opened and the other bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, then Nab will bid 3@D and will become declarer, thats the best that can happen to south :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi :)|pg||
nt|arigun: hi hedy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Ron Pahctmann|pg||

nt|mdgraham: useful in these positions to play what you play over 2NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only one level higher|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: i have here the CC of the Swedish girls. when play slows down i will present a brief description|pg||
nt|rodal f: By normal defence it might was. 3NT are 1 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: Showinga huge minor hand at E now|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bazý ellerde vugraf operatörleri oynanan kartlarý yanlýþ girebiliyorlar ama sonradan düzeltiyorlar|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani burada undo oldu diye masada da undo oldu diye düþünmeyiniz lütfen |pg||
nt|ozgull: evet çok güvenmemek lazým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gerçek hayatta undo yok biliyorsunuz|pg||
nt|ozgull: son el pik gelse batýyordu gibi gözüksede belkide öyle olmadý|pg||
nt|MolvaM: vugraf operatörleri de son maça yorgun girdiler :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: pik ataðý normal ama Arda'nýn trefllerine tek antresi maalesef yýkýlacak|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Adrian!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pull out the old blunderbuss and bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: dbl probably (I can doulbe one of the suits) |pg||
nt|mamos: NS lopk a little high already|pg||
nt|mamos: hi shirley|pg||
nt|mamos: realistically West has little choice but to sell out to this|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that easy to think game with E,,, I wouldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 3H =inv 5-5|pg||
nt|ozgull: açýk odadan anladýðýmýz gibi ingilizler 12-14 NT oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|kastan88: misfit on NS, possible that West will start doubling now|pg||
nt|kastan88: he was faster (West)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Simonsen is thinking|pg||
nt|andy_h: Very nice treatment of the 2NT bid in competition - showing 2 places to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a @H lead might end it anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d alerted as Walsh i assume|pg||
nt|ronpa: No reason to do something else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here, of course, 3NT may be a club stop and running diamonds, so it is not so clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @C10 and a small spade from dummy?|pg||
nt|mamos: he'sd like to do something  but what ?|pg||
mc|8|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can imagine S being especially unlucky, given his semi-wasted @S values|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I personally wouldn't have bid with N's hand. All it's going to do is that it may excited partner (when you don't really want to given the void in clubs). Given N has 3spadeds ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: (marking shortage with partner) then S may still re-open|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i wouldnt have doubled in N either... what if pd simply has 12 HCP and good 6-card @C, I dont want to be anywhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl of 3@S = dont lead that pd|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the question here is what happens at the 6 level|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi all|pg||
nt|waso: hiii|pg||
nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice fit EW but no slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can watch Max Ellerbeck's nice defense to 3@S in the movie, he found the @C ruff in 2nd trick accorcing to their signaling methods and so they defeated 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Leonardo, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|frusco: hi bas|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good mesh NS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i would expect 7DX -4 for 800 - this looks good for Norway but....|pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: ercan-gündoðdu güzelce oynamýþlar þlemi ama sanýrým pek alýþveriþ olmaz bu elde|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: well there's the funny 1nt now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kaapo: It appers that NS could make 7@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: But perhaps they'll stop at 6|pg||
nt|tomi2: Dutch EW did well to stop in game here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey! @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder why East next door doubled 5@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: and mike |pg||
nt|mdgraham: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Daniel @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think we are done:)|pg||
nt|henryb: cards lie very well for N-S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Gerben42: the 9 showed the @C switch?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't really blame West for passing 2@C. Maybe East should have opened - his hand sure looked like an opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, time to wake up, jan|pg||
nt|elbec: manno and di franco play weak no trump "Nightmare" style|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N EW has play|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@C looks unlikely to stop EW bidding the game in a major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you are French, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either: 12-14 bal OR natural 12+ OR 18+ any distr.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: and the 3@C bid showed the @D suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dutch EW did not stop in game after all...|pg||
nt|minnie lee: results: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|yuval10: E did very well here to judge that her cards in the minors worth a game|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet East thought that his side was in a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|ritong: if you don t , yopu might get caught in a bad spiral|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: My second guess is that NS play polish club|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S is nonforicig, W will not believe|pg||
nt|ritong: two booboos in a row is not a good start, even if it costs few|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi all! Welcome to the 22nd European Youth Championships from Poiana, Brasov,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Romania-  http://www.eurobridge.org/index2.html  -  Tournament site|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2N here is a good raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|ozgull: juniors ta belli olmaz:)|pg||

nt|waso: very lucky stayman here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: You don't, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N actually alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As being @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: pass or correct?|pg||
nt|henryb: to respond or not to respond, that is the question|pg||
mb|r|nt|sybarra: interesting |pg||
nt|ronpa: nice agreement of 3@H to play, but only 8 trix because of bad @H break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like five rapid losers|pg||
nt|charles_l: what style is that?|pg||
nt|mamos: West has some problem now a very good hand opposite a double at this level|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some more specs have comed. Web page for the turney: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: 1@c is 15+ with 4or+@c or 15-17 balanced or 24+any|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with three trumps..|pg||
nt|mariner1: like a limit in Sayc|pg||
mb|p|nt|waso: maybe 1nt 16-18|pg||
nt|mamos: should East advance?   I don't think so he has bid his hand alresdy|pg||
nt|mariner1: A@D right, even Q10x @S right, this will make game|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room France is in 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidb: very conservative 2 passes by S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey açýsýndan grandþlemin anahtarý minör renklerdeki yan onörler|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where 1@C could be of several varieties|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here minimum balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@S losing 2@H and a 1C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm was watching BBO TV and it looked like... sry|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Nab using Sabine's tactic: bid 2@D over 1@C whenever possible :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: West probabbly will do better confirming his spade fit some way|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D from North?|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" may be playing at different level here  bets on over/under?|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi all, sory about a few problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: we are already at board 3|pg||
mb|3C|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bir þekilde karo üzerinden keycard sormayý denkleþtirmek iyi fikir olabilir|pg||
nt|ozgull: karo k pik as olsa mesala 13 hcp|pg||
nt|eerbil: Ingiliz takýmý zon durumuna göre deðiþken 1NT açýþý kullanýyor gibiler, uygun zon durumu 10-12 olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: böylece koz dam'ýný da öðrenebilir|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Latvia dont alert the 3-rd dbl:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what would 2NT after 2@S have been? |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2NT does not exist but must be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curiously, the scoring system seems to believe there hasn't been an exchange of IMPs yet in this match|pg||
nt|ronpa: 2@S also goes down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hi Charles1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||
nt|waso: yes|pg||
nt|waso: one of each|pg||
nt|wwalter: 3@h was a little optimistic :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: team style|pg||
nt|kaapo: A kibitzer has read in the bulletin, that NS would play strong club|pg||
nt|kastan88: interesting, how now EW will find their spades game, I would bid 2nd round 2@S with E hand, IMO showing 7...20 with 5-card @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hard decision 4 Mr. Lauks|pg||
nt|kastan88: now it is hard to West find good bid another than pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he will bid 4 sp?:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but 4@H only 3 down|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr even 2 down only|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi I'm Frank from Norway, Welcome also to Geir:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi Rodal & ty|pg||
nt|ritong: i think south would have bid if her LHO wasn t a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: like 1@d, then pass any bid|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming it is not a super forcing one:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: Burda 4NT briaz karýþýk gibi|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 5@C now... well, 3@S may even be better news|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H now? or what?|pg||
nt|frusco: sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North tell that South has four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure,  does that sound like @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE communicating in writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it all cues?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@S is cue, but does it SHOW or DENY @S control?:)|pg||
nt|frusco: 4@d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after the support |pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a head start for Sweden I see|pg||
nt|othered1: Reasonable spot and good lead.|pg||
nt|elbec: manno has already an important international experience, while di franco is at his first important junior event, after playing a lot for schools|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so as usual my expected result did not happen - when Czech allowed to play 6Dx|pg||
mb|p|nt|waso: NV|pg||
nt|wwalter: not in white :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like to follow all tables. Open this and bookmark it: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if it does not exist, natural and forcing then|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'was not'|pg||
nt|capercliff: they bid slam on brd 1|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@s better than some of my slams|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphztr: -2?|pg||
nt|waso: but still EW  must defend well|pg||
nt|syl: GM all|pg||
nt|wwalter: gm Laci|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi|pg||
nt|waso: GM:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Go to http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm for results|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Click the running scores link in bold black at the top of the table to go to running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would think now W has a strong hand with clubs but maybe I am wrong and they have additional agreements|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, S certainly has some nice cards now, obv N was trying for slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: or lets say makeable stop |pg||
mc|9|nt|ozgull: açýk odada þehmus 3h diyip sonra as sormuþ ortak kantitatif anlamasýn diye|pg||
nt|poohbear: The 5@d save was worth 3 imps against game but it got its huge reward when it forced EW into a minus positon|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing 5@D by N|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume 3rd best from 4 is their agreement, or is it always 3rd best?|pg||
nt|elbec: yes 3rd or 5th|pg||
nt|pelu: ok we are with u now|pg||

nt|mariner1: match (rotates)|pg||
nt|mamos: another high level hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW looking for tricks 8 and 9 here I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a nice lead from Lidqvist|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South will be satisfied to emerge with 5 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: EW will need to get @cs going to beat game on this hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be a routine game |pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like a routine 3NT EW, with @Cs and @Ds both being very favorable it will be 11 tricks here as well|pg||
nt|capercliff: just|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: slam on a finesse |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@hs would make if the @d finesse was on|pg||
nt|waso: tell us about them?|pg||
nt|syl: easy PLAY|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS should end up at 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can only imagine Barry Rigal's witty comments on this in the Vugraph theater|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we can get coffee?|pg||
nt|othered1: with north passing, EW may find a losing 3N|pg||
nt|elbec: only 7 tricks in NT for EW... let's see what happen|pg||
nt|charles_l: i thought all junirs open all flat 11s|pg||
nt|pelu: Norway are No 3 in the standing - only 1 VP after Germany - Denmark No 9 - but in the run - 6 wins in a row - average 20-10!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well EW can make 4 here I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes any big win can really help either team|pg||
nt|charles_l: some will open 1@d in N|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Sten :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: 24 puanla 3nt. fena deðil|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might win 2@D, 1@C and 1@S to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: I wonder what 2@S is, I think it's invitational|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h limit + probably|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|gulyas: you can even get lunch if you are fast enough:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: I doubt they can beat 1@H more than 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 @C scores how much?|pg||
nt|henryb: nice catch|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Bill|pg||
nt|sten: hi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Ment Berg|pg||
nt|sten: Not so good start for Norway here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Sten:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same start as u often use to have?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant see anything except 3N T but East is contemplating more|pg||
nt|sten: well not exactly|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4NT will be just a little exciting but safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not clear they get there|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has a very good cards so i guess he'll bid game|pg||
nt|ronpa: so 2@S went 2 off and first imps to turkey. and now comes a flat 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 580 or 980|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h looks normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: somebody has information about his point range here?|pg||
nt|tomi2: looks like|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I hardly know any U26 players playing non-weak jumps lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer break?|pg||
nt|othered1: with that opening, there's a chance to stay out, but still one high|pg||
nt|elbec: Di franco passed with an 11 HCPs count even with 2 aces (not following Bava's law). They're very serious about 1nt range (12-14)|pg||
nt|othered1: with rounded suit lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with bidding do you expect the k of @C with W?|pg||
nt|mamos: in fact it's a 5/7 hand I think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: without an early @c play declarer can set up a pitch in the @d suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they get there|pg||
nt|syl: first big event for all4|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or jump|pg||
nt|mamos: so West's 2NT showed a Spade raise and North has cue-bid   - South  won't like his J high suit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N move again?  he really has a monster |pg||
nt|mamos: i think so Shirley|pg||

nt|poohbear: if partner had Kx of @d and a stiff @s slam would be excellent|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: oldukça iyi bir skor bizim için diðer odadan geldi|pg||
nt|waso: west  will not be happy with  north 1h|pg||
nt|tomi2: most often you dont have these follow-ups in your system script but during the preparation to such an event this sequenze will accure one time and then you agree "direct = shape, ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: direct jup = invit shape, 2@C then spades = inv on hcp and 2@D then spades = GF or slam invit"|pg||
nt|kaapo: No 6-card suits here|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice juniors, Adrian?|pg||

nt|mikael_w: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|eerbil: açýk odada Batý oyuncu as sormaya üþenmiþ anlaþýlan|pg||
nt|gracelin: but I thk 4S must not show any slam interest by consuming so many space.|pg||
nt|tomi2: can you transport those words? I used to be in Poland some time, so I could imagine the polish words that are used, but I don't know any norwegian|pg||
nt|kaapo: And probably no 1NT by North|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I know I would|pg||
nt|sybarra: guilt??|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and hi cliff|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N was made on 3 in OR -- declarer played @DA, then small to the Q, dropping the Jack|pg||
nt|athene: double from south might turn this into a battle of the major suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can actually make 6 @H here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|syl: entertaining 3@c...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she's not in red|pg||
nt|syl: INvul vs vul :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thx|pg||
nt|gh1: 3s can make here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: but I think shes very pretty:) and she likes hearts:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: or just fast?|pg||
nt|ronpa: yeah Padon-Tarnovski were never accused of slow play|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rayhaa: resting 4@s now|pg||
nt|mariner1: its both :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: i am not sure what NT range NS are playing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anadolunun bazý bölgelerinde elde þikan yokken keycard sormadan þlem deklare eden oyuncularý kulübe almýyorlar|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah  its bridge! |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Who expects to go down 800 and gain 6 IMPs?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess the 2 first-round controls made it 1@S, with 6412 I would go 2@H|pg||
nt|mildredb: some really foul breaking suits |pg||
nt|andy_h: Bad breaks for whoever becomes declarer|pg||
nt|tomi2: wonder if South said "thank you partner" when his dummy came down in OR|pg||
nt|henryb: but lead said no stiff club, unless it was led -- and then he could not help it|pg||
nt|athene: and it's possible things might escalate|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ar5 the other room play 2@S now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At5|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kaapo: I think EW play 10-13 1NT when non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|kastan88: if partner has 2 diamond tricks, then this 2@S is down, if not, even @H ducking not better, just easy to count declarer's distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shitshappening:)|pg||
nt|gh1: Ax in H ig spade lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Near by 3NT but 2 are enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not necessarily a quality|pg||
nt|ronpa: I wonder if NS play transfers now|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh they do|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they do|pg||
nt|ronpa: so X = 4+ @H's while 1@H would show @S suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and also they are good players|pg||
nt|elbec: 3rd position light opening by andrea. 1@d shows 4+@d in an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mamos: it might be easy to bid 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3@c is a " mixed raise " 6-8 points and 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gracelin: now south is stuck with no chance to ask for a club stopper|pg||
nt|tomi2: just bid 3NT and pray :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Brave young man will bid 3NT himself.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they dont know that yet|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be laughing in comparison perhaps |pg||
nt|sybarra: or over beers later |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Most likely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Mildred :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: similar here I'm afraid|pg||
nt|ronpa: Rdbl= @D honour|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm  -  Tournament Site|pg||
nt|gulyas: gazilli in action?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be Gazilli|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi Mikael|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure that is the right play though -- after 2 rounds of @Cs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kaapo: They might stop at 3@H|pg||
nt|ort21: someone has the live results ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, NS are playing my system :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: good grand to bid|pg||
nt|henryb: and unlucky to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|syl: 4h-nice save|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bogen actually alerted 3@H, Johansen did not...|pg||

nt|tomi2: I have been told there has been a revoke in OR|pg||

nt|ritong: strength|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a better hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: dinnertime for me - see you later guys|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: 11 daha çok iyi baþladýk|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or 4 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just forcing |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have not have time ro look ar rhe systems, Do E/W play 12-14 nt ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a sort of phantom save here in 4@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a doubble score for Nor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the weak jump poses a recurring problem for North- bid 3S with a 2S bid or pass and guess what to do when South reopens with a double|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so 4 IMP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well said Victor|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: good lead .needs 10 only to be a good one better than Sp|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is braver and bid the higher contract|pg||
nt|kastan88: now @D shift?|pg||
nt|gh1: now a x and 3H:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: -1 looks very cheap|pg||
nt|tomi2: and after my p bids 3@S I would not say thank you partner as south!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@S was easy to Dbl, maybe a Dbl of 2@H would have been already correct|pg||
nt|ritong: and 3@h tends to show 5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H would not give credit to his 18 count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: allows a jump to 3@H to show 5/5 shape at least|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: And how do you bid a 14 HCP 5-4 @S-@C?|pg||
nt|capercliff: can anyone tell me what E/W are playing?|pg||
nt|capercliff: could be precision|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes, strong @c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3 imps to Russia on 4, for stopping one level lower|pg||
nt|elbec: enjoy your dinner charles.|pg||

nt|othered1: bye, Charles!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|poohbear: Game is decent but would go down unless declarer could ferret out the offside singleton King|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both major suits are nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|ort21: tx |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S should deny as many as three hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: S denied 3+ cards in @H i believe|pg||
nt|ritong: personnally i open 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: I wonder whether 4@d shows a void|pg||
nt|ritong: when east is short in @ds with a good hand, all his features necessarily work good, from west s point of view|pg||
nt|athene: you are right this is a part-score hand, but lots of part-score hands are played in 4@H or above, these days :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no dbl so might work|pg||
nt|charles_l: many methods - smolen etc to bid to 4@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the origin of the Curse is unknown, although the most popular explanation is that the orders for the Battle of Culloden were written on the @D9 |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_playing_card_nicknames Nine_higher_card|pg||
mc|8|nt|poohbear: not impossible if he finds out about Souths honors|pg||

nt|ritong: but i do not play gazzilli|pg||
nt|ritong: i play "ritong", modestly lol|pg||
