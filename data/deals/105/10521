nt|super nova: yes.. I dont understand the Auction myself.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|?|mb|p|nt|beauch: me either- they must play double of 4S as penalties|pg||
nt|super nova: 4s X may have been penalty.. but don tknow.. I know that Ron (who played for many years with lilley) plays basically ALL x = t/o|pg||
nt|super nova: in these situations.|pg||
nt|super nova: 5c x  = take out.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|beauch: lusk- deluca in other room - i suspect play 4nt as takeout |pg||
nt|super nova: I wish the players at the other table played board 20 next. Since we know that the scores are a little bit wild. with that slam being bid going down.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|beauch: not a method i would advocate- but maybe thats why im not playing!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I play 4n as take out only because there 'tend' to be too much trouble with x = t.o as we can see it happened here.|pg||
