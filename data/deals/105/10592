nt|vugraphztx: network error over here, sorry for that|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're starting to play the boards that were already played in the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h + 3 was the score for Masd.|pg||

nt|yuval10: Yellow rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: 10 imps, perhaps on their way to the finals|pg||

mc|11|nt|yuval10: if he makes 11, then it's 10 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: he played @H to the 10 first time so made 11 tricks (missed that because of network error)|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt  and his assistants |pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Haha, I'll relay that to them :) Thank you!|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: Our appreciation to the sponsor, Mats Qviberg, and the Swedish Bridge Federation for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Carl Ragnarsson, Tomas Brenning and Carina Westlin who have ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: After all from West's point of view, they are not beating the contract unless partner has KJx of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: From East's p;oint of view I should say|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Wasn't easy for East to cash @CA. What if declarer had KJ and was on a guess?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: As some/most of you may know, the other match was rather one-sided, so now the losing team, Lichtenstein, has forfeited|pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|nt|vugraphztx: It was W thinking, but there are screens in play|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's not just a question of beating the contract. This is matchpoint scoring|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jwit: If declarer has the KJ, you are not beating the contract Roland|pg||
nt|jcwla: WD not to give away a trick with the lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Jon, but you don't necessarily have to beat the contract with this format|pg||
nt|Walddk2: MP is a cruel game|pg||
nt|sybarra: with lead and looking at dummy,  N is optimstic |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Opening and rebidding @C's with the E hand may be "normal" but still feels blech.|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice bid by EW here|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree Jordan.  There are some people, myself included, who might open 1D and rebid 2C with those cards|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or perhaps rebid 1NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Sharyn Reus|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Sharyn.|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Sharyn |pg||
nt|jwit: I don't like rebidding 1NT with a stiff unless it's an honor|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jwit: When you rebid 1NT, there is always the chance partner may rebid 2 of their major with a weak hand and 5 of the major|pg||
nt|sybarra: betting the house on @D on sire |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lars Blakset - Jacob Røn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have already seen 3 members of the Danish Junior World Champions from Hamilton, Canada, in 1998. Jacob Røn is a fourth|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Andy Vinock- We have a full staff now|pg||

nt|yuval10: last board of the semifinals|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bruun has a tough choice here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharynr: 2@S seems  like the choice|pg||
nt|jwit: I would bid 2S, just in case partner has the hand they have.  Now 3H would get you 4H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S to the rescue?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: Wow!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Blakset walking the dog on his first turn, oping that NT would be the final destination for E-W. He liked the colours|pg||
nt|jcwla: "It c-it c-it can't be."|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though we have no official score, it looks likely that the Yellow team has won|pg||
nt|yuval10: and will play Berrik in the finals of this prestigous event|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphztx: 3 min overtime already|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|andyv:  this is probably better than 5@c:)|pg||
