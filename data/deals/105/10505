nt|Walddk2: 2nd against 1st ... France 13 VPs ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The two leading pairs at this table. Rates to be excellent bridge|pg||
nt|jtr: Round 22 France has Poland; Norway has Croatia|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Espen Lindqvist is now the regular partner of Boye Brogeland in the Norwegian open team|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|yuval10: running scores for schools and Juniors|pg||
nt|yuval10: cluck on schools/juniors to get the running scores u want|pg||
nt|jtr: Round 23 France vs England; Norway Czech Republic|pg||
nt|jtr: So Norway has, in theory, a slightly easier last 2 matches|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they might be able to prevail even if they are behind after this match|pg||
nt|mamos: ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: a great battle between probably the 2 best individuals in the event - Bessis and Lindqvist|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're probably having a delay so we can get the scores compared from the CR|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 of a major looks the limit here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 20-20's usually don't produce games or slams|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h likely contract though|pg||
nt|jtr: !@h 1@s  3@d fit jump?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Harald Skjæran|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Hi all!|pg||
nt|jtr: Hey Harald:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: do you all open from E ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Harald|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure he will|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do, but I am stupid|pg||
nt|skjaeran: It's an opening for me.|pg||
nt|skjaeran: But it might depend upon who I'm partnering.|pg||
nt|jtr: 8 losers so should pass (in theory)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: France leading by 13 VPs from Norway|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 2 more matches to go after this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: one in the evening and one tomorrow|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Norway need a big victory here close the French gap in the standings.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: 22-8 or better will see the Norwegians overtake France|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3D!|nt|yuval10: indeed some fit-jump by EW|pg||
nt|skjaeran: 3@d looks like some sort of fit jump.|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes 32 IMPs to reach 22 VPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello Jon|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: i don't think Norway needs to built its strategy around a blowout here|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|jtr: @cs can go away but still much too much to do|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jtr: With all that defence should Linqvist have bid 3@s?|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Need to switch now, to anything but the @s3.|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows that E must have something in @c for his bid|pg||
nt|jtr: No rush for the @ds really|pg||
nt|skjaeran: Thomas Bessis will work this out, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|skjaeran: -2 in CR|pg||
