mb|2C|nt|vdoubleu: Yers|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Yes, key here.|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: confirmed 4d= blackwood 4s 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no X of 4S, may avoid that suit on lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: OK., maybe.|pg||
nt|reisig: @c seems pretty safe|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he will itch to lead a trump, but finally wont i predict|pg||
nt|kareno: Finds a safe lead.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: safe yes, but against small slam will tend to attack. it is not like N is sitting behind declarer's tenaces with high cards|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: South might have played the jack of hearts to give west some bad options (ruffing out QJ of hearts).|pg||

nt|kareno: Stella, my cat, sitting on my lap kibitzing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps, but he doesnt want to be endplayed, and anyway it was the five-spot that was led, which is not consistent with ruffing out QJx i think|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|d6|nt|kareno: Declarer's pitches not boding well for this contract unless he plans to float the diamond jack.|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
mc|8|nt|marlowepi: both the play and the defense puzzle me. discrading Ds from dummy compromises declarer's options in that suit. and why would S pitch a D???|pg||
