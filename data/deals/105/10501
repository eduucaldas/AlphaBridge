nt|kit: two balanced hands, two distributional hands.  Let's see who bids the most.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe E-W "save" is a make?  Lots of handling in 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We're still waiting for Russ to get back from his smoke break - now he's here|pg||
nt|lc: 1@S  2@H  2@S,  then South drives to 4@H and E-W ...  we'll see.|pg||
nt|kit: West hand is good example of:  When you are void in their suit, bid one more than you think you should.|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when in doubt bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|lc: Although 4@H is down, so ...|pg||
nt|kit: and when you have spades, there is never doubt :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lc: So, 3@H blows E-W out.  Must be intermediate.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Sutherlin also overcalls 3@H|pg||
nt|lc: Is there any chance of this making?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lc: Not now, anyway.|pg||
nt|chip: certainly not now.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: East very luck that the lead didn't cost a trick.  Just because partner bid the suit, doesn't mean he has the king.|pg||
nt|lc: You wouldn't lead a spade, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: well, I would lead a spade before I would lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "you play upside down?" Berk: "we play first discard is odd/even"|pg||
nt|kit: so I guess that makes it my third choice|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: I like my aces to capture their honors|pg||
nt|lc: I'd lead a @S before I'd guess a minor and watch declarer throw @S and have partner look at me with his @SKQJ10x and ask why I didn't lead one.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|lc: And Berk, would have a sly, sarcastic way of making the point.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|lc: "If I bid DIAMONDS, would you have led a @S????"|pg||
nt|chip: I'd lead a spade from this hand. Then if right to lead a minor will more likely know which one.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|d2|nt|kit: partner can just as easily have minor-suit strength -- he did open the bidding.  |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lc: On this hand, a @D was nearly fatal (allowing @S pitches).|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some specs asking what you think of 1@S-4@H |pg||

nt|ahollan1: how about if swap @SK with @Cx|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe then.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "I had sort of an intermediate jump overcall; I liked the lead; it was on the heart finesse; or a club onside"|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, decent defense and lots of losers.|pg||
mb|2H|an|8-11 (5 hearts)|nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||

mb|d|mb|4N|an|RKCB|nt|lc: Important to know now if X=@D or a good hand. Hope they discussed it.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|poohbear: 4@h with a chance to make in the closed room on 52 ( no @c shift)|pg||
nt|kit: now how does South know whether to choose clubs or spades on his hand?|pg||
nt|lc: West has both cases covered.|pg||
nt|chip: At least he has both.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision   this 2@D bid does NOT show any values|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair sort of alerted the DBL, but no questions|pg||
mb|p!|an|assume DOP1?|nt|ahollan1: Pass denies 5+@S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: another good example of partnership agreements -- you have to have a general rule on doubles of artificial calls like this, and stick to it|pg||
nt|chip: Ours is it shows the suit, right?|pg||
nt|lc: We play it shows @D.|pg||
nt|kit: yep|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kit: And now another double, this one takeout|pg||
nt|chip: Showing the suit is my default with Lew also.|pg||
nt|lc: What will Berk do if Lair doubles again?|pg||
nt|kit: And if East passes it, they just might take him out|pg||
nt|kit: well, 5 tricks are easier than 9, so .......|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair asks about 2@d. Granovetter won't write because it's now after sundown, so they get up and go away from the table and he explains, not quite loudly enough for me to hear|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: effectively  all hands without significant @C support  bid 2@D|pg||
nt|lc: Pass would get 500, it seems.|pg||
nt|kit: now that seems wrong -- means the other side knows that a bid is alerted and asked about|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ asks Berk if they have an agreement about the DBL of 2@d and he says not clear|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|lc: Easier to pass 3@C in a bidding contest than at the table where -670 is painful.|pg||
nt|kit: East's decision a big swing there|pg||
nt|lc: At least that's my defense of my partner.|pg||
nt|kit: simple LAW pass, right Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: You guys can all pile on and say that PASS was easy.  Yeah.|pg||
nt|chip: not a good hand for the NS system. No way for S to avoid playing a silly contract (way too high in 3C, but if he passes 2c, could be a 4-2 with a 5-3 spade fit).|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|kit: You gotta believe!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lc: Esspecially if partner has @D, pass makes sense.  But David's (and my) philosophy is try not to be -670 and win the match on some other board.|pg||

nt|lc: Berk will surely lead a @H.|pg||
nt|chip: yes, seems impossible on this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, Berk is unlucky he has a 5-card suit of his own.  If he didn't, he could think about leading partner's 5-card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chip: plus he has the majority of his side's strength.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: The funny thing is that the SOUTH side (with guarded @DK) is actually the best side to play 3NT from -- but would be the unlucky side here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would Zia lead @DQ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: no|pg||
nt|chip: No|pg||
nt|lc: Only if he had hand records.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- that was meant to be rhetorical |pg||
nt|kit: interesting declarer play problem, since he doesn't know the ace of diamonds is onside|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|kit: a very good case could have been made for going up queen of hearts there|pg||
nt|chip: maybe lead D if looking for a swing.|pg||
nt|kit: declarer's problem here is that if he knocks out the heart East will have diamond shift -- that is why I thought queen of hearts at trick 1 might be right, odd though it looks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ went to the bathroom, promising to think while there, now back|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|chip: But then we have to wait till after the hand (usually).|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: most players would play this 3@H bid is looking for a heart stopper, as it is.|pg||

nt|lc: Strange leade, but will survive.|pg||

pc|d3|nt|kit: so it comes down to spade guess -- he knows South has longer hearts, so will play king of spades first.  And then ......|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: now Granovetter known to be on minimum overcall - especially for him -- maybe infer singleton @S?|pg||
nt|lc: Would Granovetter overcall with @HKJxxx  @CA and a flat hand VUL?|pg||
nt|lc: I sure would (the way my partner's lead).|pg||
nt|lc: But Granovetter is indeed sound.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe for that reason, Ekeblad should not have revealed the @CJ here.|pg||

nt|lc: A good rule in today's electronic age.|pg||
nt|chip: maybe if you have an iphone or equivalent (why security on those is tight)|pg||
nt|lc: They actually don't screen or check.  It is on the "honor system."|pg||
nt|chip: But harsh penalties if caught.|pg||
nt|lc: Players wouldn't intentionally have a device, but they often forget to unload them and accidentally walk in with one in pocket.|pg||
nt|lc: Several times, cell phones have gone off and caused big problems.|pg||

nt|poohbear: somebody mentioned a cell phone going off|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can Lair afford to win, and play some @D to get better inferential count?|pg||
nt|kit: not too safely|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think so, since North could ruff a @D|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe opponents would give honest count in @D.  :)|pg||
