nt|sybarra: my hunch is we are catching up  |pg||
nt|othered1: This is a replay of pairs from the first set.  Wonder if they can generate near the action of that set.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is new set Ed |pg||
nt|othered1: No, this isn't the same pairings.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just saw this in the other room |pg||
nt|ckv: it looks as if meck is the anchor pair- at least for now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or Dana will I should say |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ckv: i believe 64 baords today to determine usa 2 since Lall won both matches yesterday in the 3-way|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|joest: I'm thinking that the Meckstroth team is e-w here|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Jack|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: 6@c an interesting contract e/w|pg||
nt|reisig: 6@d in other room...@c seems better|pg||
nt|othered1: Really 2@S?  |pg||
nt|henryb: not Mayefsky but Katz bid 2@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet thats east |pg||
nt|henryb: really|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: eric bid 2@S, then alerted and explained.... trying to read over sam's shoulder|pg||
nt|joest: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yers|pg||
nt|henryb: taking advantage of the vulnerability to throw dust in the air|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you can sustain a bad diamond break (or guess) in clubs more easily than in diamonds.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: More chances than just locating the dimaond J.|pg||
nt|othered1: @S or minors?|pg||
nt|ckv: this must be spades or minors:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: found the sac suit  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: it is :)|pg||
nt|othered1: pass by west, presumably showing a 2N rebid seems normal|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sam inquired further from eric, who is now scribbling furiously|pg||
nt|henryb: If its @s or minors, S should have bid 4@c not 3|pg||
nt|ckv: perhaps she's seen his bids before|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i caught nothing from their excange except it seemed to end with eric nodding and saying, "yes, 50 a trick."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: so take from that what you will|pg||
mb|d|nt|me argent: if 3@Ss was forcing then i am wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: eric: "great"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: more writing by eric |pg||
nt|sybarra: and they write in tiny letters |pg||
nt|othered1: That's the 4th bid of north's I've seen in 2 and afraction sessions I'd consider a psych.  But here it's merely very aggressive|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i think it would be more accurate to say that eric writes illegibly|pg||
nt|ckv: yes- this will be an interesting challenge to guess the players|pg||
mb|r|nt|Vugraphu8: eric: help! ooh!|pg||
nt|ckv: with two passes ahead of north- 4 spades very reasonable action|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you can sustain 4-1 clubs also|pg||
nt|ckv: as i said:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: did pass by east promise values?  Some play it that way, with double being a negative.|pg||
mb|d|nt|reisig: They don't seem headed toward @ds :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphu8: argenta has settled down to think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is going to have an ugly hand to lead from. (though not as ugly as to bid from). the deadly spade seems likely (deadly for the defense)|pg||
nt|kareno: Good raise by Lynch!|pg||
nt|sybarra: best she stick to her guns  wd |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: and has chosen pass :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: personally i would never bid a non forcing 3@Ss with norts hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: this was set with a Club lead in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Lall got the chance to double for the lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: she has played a few other times with her pard |pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, key here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only a club gives away nothing.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 4@d=keycard?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd guess yes, Valerie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: H gives away nothing|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: "I'm pretty sure the sign on the door says junior trials, not senior trials"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Sam: "not senior trials.  or bridge."|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ckv: an unfortunate normal aggressive lead by owen|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: 4S NS? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: how many @S by south.  2, preemptive, might be the choice of some|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: So a possible swing turns into a push board.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: How many NT here? 3NT?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: we start having auctions and play after this board :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: on this board* sorry :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: good news imo :)|pg||
nt|othered1: So far some small swings, unlike the last set where the swings were frequent and large|pg||
nt|sybarra: is ok,   catching up is a good thing |pg||
nt|sybarra: Price will be south |pg||
nt|joest: Goldfein west|pg||
nt|sybarra: Goldfein is Jack's student so.....|pg||
nt|joest: this is a vul game with no play that I predict they will storm into|pg||
nt|joest: so play well! :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H a reasonable spot here, just does not make today|pg||
mb|p|nt|ckv: i think 3 spades was destined to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ckv: yes- a little more stability|pg||
nt|henryb: If you play 2/1, do you respond 2@c or 1N with South?|pg||
nt|othered1: not an easy hand for MS to manage.  Possible to get to 2@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: the 8D save goes for too many :)|pg||
nt|kareno: One pusillanimous @h by Schwartz|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT will make on this one|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N, since I can't bid my suits out in natural order after a 2/1, which might excite partner too much|pg||
nt|othered1: would 2@C have been artificial?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: ok argenta's writing is neat but tiny|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: gotta love'em! |pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: I'd just launch into old Black here.|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c, natural and constructive but NF is an interesting idea|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sam asks eric for an explanation|pg||
nt|ckv: 1nt- awkward to be sure-- 3 clubs must be inv jump|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Vugraphu8: alert on one side of table|pg||
mb|p|nt|ckv: and danny has stepped in where no one belongs|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: west|pg||
nt|othered1: West's initial pass seems odd to me.  Maybe they play it forcing.|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think he should bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: on a low @d lead this will still be going down tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: eric aso explained double to sam|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: that is a very familiar situation. player alert on one side of the table :)|pg||
nt|ckv: he's kind of stuck- will probably now go 1nt- 3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: good question.  I personally would double implying 3@S or 4 bad|pg||

nt|kareno: Snapdragon double was employed in the CR to get east as declarer in spades.|pg||
nt|othered1: only six imps.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: dan: "jesus, i didn't realize you had the A of diamonds"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: apologies from all sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: What's your action with south's hand?  Mine would be pass, but that's not very modern|pg||
nt|daman: looks as if he will open a veek 2 |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: will he try 3 nt or 3 @S?|pg||
nt|joest: feels like we might be in real time by now|pg||
nt|mariner1: might get too high EW this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: if not we are close anyway |pg||
nt|ckv: are there any seeding consideratons here since this is the same lineup that finished the second quarter?|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might not help and they can stay low|pg||
nt|joest: Katz is borderline between a straight out raise to 2@s and slowing things down with 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Argenta Price (south) is only female in this event |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: The auction started 1@c - 1@d - 1@h - double, showing spades with heart tolerance.|pg||
nt|kareno: I won't fault Lynch for not overcalling with that east hand that's full of holes.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphu8: "she" :)|pg||
nt|ckv: perhaps a modern polish weak two- 5+-5+|pg||
nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|othered1: what do you do with north hand opposite an undisciplined preempt at these colors?|pg||
nt|ckv: 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he|pg||
mb|3C|nt|me argent: i wonder where south learned that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: "I liked my 2 jacks, my 9 and my 8"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Says Meckstroth :)|pg||
nt|joest: not bidding 4@s is great restraint for juniors I"ve learned!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: thanks everyone for your patience :) i think we're all caught up now|pg||
nt|joest: thx dana|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: Argenta  is not a name I recognize other than it might mean money|pg||
nt|othered1: duplicating the open room's auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: dan asks argenta if 3 spades is forcing, she responds with a shrug|pg||
nt|joest: north either leads a heart against 4@s or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That should end the auction.|pg||
nt|othered1: favorable lead for declarer, but certainly reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And I suspect Schwartz will go minus in both rooms.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 9s plural I suppose :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: everything turns on that probably|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphu8: "it's contagious! the overbidding is contagious" -eric|pg||
nt|joest: I predict Goldfein will win and lead a low heart toward dummy: forcing the defense to cash out in a difficult position early on|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: dan: "thanks for the faith partner"|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they didn't even need help getting high|pg||
nt|joest: no juniors need help getting high|pg||
nt|joest: no pun intended|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|mariner1: and mirrored @c is part of the reason no play|pg||

nt|joest: north will survive even with a club shift though|pg||

pc|dA|nt|othered1: actually not all that favorable|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|me argent: good slam here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: eric: "stiff A of diamods.  i'm not sure what i was going to do if she didn't raise spades, but i had to give it a try."|pg||
nt|sybarra: even as passed hand I play 2 @S slightly better than that previous hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: but its all in what partnership agreement is |pg||
nt|mariner1: pushes see movie|pg||
nt|joest: i doubt north south will find a save but it's always possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: problem at the table|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has good play here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: argenta was dealt 14 cards; dan 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|joest: as in ice cold |pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 4@S doea as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: director is using our vugraph screen to correct :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: does|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: and we're good to go|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: did Dan draw one randomly?|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: This could be tricky for NS, since north might try 2@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: Dana is Sol the director? |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: no, sorry, i don't now the director|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a save however tough to find now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: in fairness, the director who came over also did not know what event this was|pg||
nt|joest: Mayefsky would double I wouldl guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|vdoubleu: Will they get to 3NT here, and, if so, will they make it?|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would upgrad the two 10's and the 98 and open 1nt|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, was thinking he would/|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: We all can see the defense has the first 5 tricks, for the taking.|pg||
nt|othered1: Ok, only one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|othered1: south has a very sound mixed raise or a minimal limit|pg||
nt|joest: 990|pg||
pc|c7|nt|robinswr: but spade lead is normal|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could well end this aucton |pg||
nt|othered1: wonder how she meant it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|me argent: 5@Cs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Like Goldfein, Lee is now in the tank :)|pg||
nt|me argent: think he owes partner a bid|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: 3@s must be better than 4@H here (if you want to help partner to slam that is)|pg||
nt|me argent: nope|pg||
nt|ianwbjones: starting investigations at the 5level doesnt sound right to me :)|pg||
nt|me argent: west knows that partner doesnt have @CA|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: no questions asked or explanations offered at the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think preemptive raise |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|me argent: so 3@Ss almost forces 2 slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess 1@H is right, if it precipitates a 1N overcall.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vdoubleu: Swing here to Lynch.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|robinswr: its hard to beat 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd consider bidding 3nt with that north hand...|pg||
nt|othered1: isn't preemptive alertable?|pg||
nt|ckv: if pre-empt- should e double back in|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is a passed hand so....|pg||
nt|othered1: some of us pass hands even stronger than this shapely 6-count|pg||
nt|sybarra: had 2 @S for the good hand |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sam: "we're only in three, right?" eric: "three hearts is the contract"|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: This could be tricky, perhaps depending on opening lead.  @S looks OK for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: this event is played in the corners of this huge room where they are playing the grand nat's teams |pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|pc|d5|nt|ianwbjones: a limited hand isnt slam forcing|pg||
nt|ckv: this may very well make|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kareno: The strong hand will be hidden and it may take only the lead to give it away.|pg||
nt|robinswr: 14 opposite an inverted long club suit probably has a play|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not so sure double was automatic there|pg||
nt|rgdruru: .|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW the spot here|pg||
nt|idblu: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|ckv: normal upgrade|pg||
nt|othered1: Bittner is making a bit of a run here.  And this could be a significant pick-up if north in open room tries 2 and goes for tons.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: Wonder if west's 1@C is an upgrade.|pg||
nt|mariner1: w only has 8 however its a decent 8 in support for NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sam is wondering whether owen would redouble with his hand :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|me argent: i like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: (yawn) ... this hand gives us a chance for a cup of tea (_)?... and some cookies (Sorry Roland) ... OOO|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: pass was alerted, but the writing is quite small and far away :)|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|me argent: passing that north hand is too tricky 4 me|pg||
nt|othered1: likely just a negative|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: It'll be all about overtricks in a likely 2nt contract|pg||
nt|me argent: now what does he do to catch up?|pg||
nt|ckv: pass is less than 6-7 or heart trap|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: at what level does west get his long suit into the auction?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C probably positive if they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c = natural and constructive (2NT = art and poor hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: VOILA|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: this is one of the more intereting auctions we will see|pg||
nt|othered1: Hard for south to sellout here|pg||
nt|joest: with slow values I'm guessing 3NT but 4@s is tempting|pg||
nt|ckv: now 3nt ?|pg||
nt|joest: after you've shown values 3@s is 100% forcing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianwbjones: think he's bitten off more than he can chiu here|pg||
nt|ckv: now|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: margin 65|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|scotty: right , but since you think partner needs to know which values are important, it must mean that you deny singleton or void|pg||

nt|marlowepi: sounds logical|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: potential for 2 imps? |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|scotty: Exactly - so the whole club-diamond-spade value thing is irrelevant|pg||
nt|kareno: Not my idea of a 2nt bid - two card diversity ... you'll end up in a 4-2 fit too often.|pg||
nt|robinswr: just a guess and how is partner supposed to know|pg||
nt|scotty: I play 4th seat preempt shows a 7-trick hand - but not seven solid|pg||

nt|poohbear: at the other table the defense took one round of @H and switched to a @c. Now declarer played AK of @ds but neglected to cash the @s ace before exiting a @h so north had a safe ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: exit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "it's all the same unless she returns a club, in which case i go down another"|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats wrong|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@S here EW|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|robinswr: when there is a singleton in dummy, the normal signal is suit preferance |pg||
nt|poohbear: yes dear Ill keep that in mind :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kareno: Middle encourages, no, Steve?  High and low suit pref.|pg||
nt|poohbear: careful they dont shoot you :P|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: terrified here.|pg||
nt|joest: true enough but it willhave to be solo I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That is how most play it.|pg||
nt|scotty: I think most experts would lead a heart from the S hand - combining thought of major and not giving away trick or tempo|pg||
nt|kareno: Needs less from partner to help also.|pg||
nt|scotty: Against 1N-3n, you might find some spade leaders|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and most would bid with the S hand if nonvul i think|pg||
nt|robinswr: or some diamond leaders|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead problem for 1nt 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: that is a lot of defense for a unilateral dive|pg||
mb|5H|nt|scotty: But if partner has nothing in the suit you lead, a spade might well turn out better, if E has both honors or W has Hx.  But I would lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "sorry, i'm not quite as good as argenta is at putting down dummies."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "but i do have a few hearts.  good luck."|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: trump shift best|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: argenta looks unhappy, dan had his double card out it jest before the tray came back under the screen|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Two more boards now & then, for the last 2 sessions, the Lynch lineup will change.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: good partner has the at least the jack|pg||
nt|joest: argenta should be happy! :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|sybarra: she is not one who smiles a lot (so concentrated) |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|scotty: Another attraction of H2 lead is that declarer should misguess @d with, say, A9xxx facing K10xx|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|poohbear: crossruff now|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@H -100 means no protection on the save either|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|joest: nice switch|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|poohbear: Defense can score 5 trump tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: i agree that a heart looks normal, but it might be instructive to run a simulation. one of the downsides of the heart lead is that you have so much stuff pd will have one big card ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at most. If it is a heart card you may end up endplayed. |pg||

nt|sybarra: top notch players |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 bds left in this set before dinner break |pg||
nt|poohbear: dont see how he makes it. even if he wins spade ace and hooks the @h thats 4 @d losers and 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|joest: thx to whomever filled in the results from the other room -- presumably you dana :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "so we reached par" -dan "there's a first time for everything" -eric|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably adam |pg||

mb|1D|nt|sybarra: he is up and running  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Penultimate hand now.|pg||
nt|robinswr: thats the rule of 15-17|pg||
nt|poohbear: he would be correct if trumps were 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: so he is|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: Argenta Price  is the only female in the group|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sybarra: I wonder if we will have a last 16 |pg||
nt|joest: i've played an interesting conventino here|pg||
nt|joest: a double by Goldfein's hand is either 1-4 clubs with extra values|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: after this start EW should breeze into slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they play 2 @H as weaker than 2 @D|pg||
nt|joest: this way Goldfein is probably going to have to act in front of his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Thanks to Diane Graese for an excellent job Operating for us.|pg||
nt|robinswr: when declarer shows up with KQ of spades ak of dia KJ of hearts, not much left|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to my fellow expert commentators for their wit and wisdom.|pg||
nt|scotty: It would be nice for East if double of 1N is TO here, though at this vul, may not risk it|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to the USBF (especially Jan Martel) for allowing us to report their premier events|pg||
nt|robinswr: i play it as responsive|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to BBO for a fabulous platform for showing these great events every week of the year|pg||
nt|kareno: And thanks to the specs for keeping us awake!!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it should be as a passed hand facing a mere one-level overcall, i think|pg||
nt|ckv: i'm betting on slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i would lead a heart also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better to have a doubleton spade though|pg||
nt|robinswr: but looking at all the hands, i would lead a club|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes this e/w may get there |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: "how many doubled contracts?" "this is the fifth."|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Vugraphu8: woeful underrepresentation |pg||
nt|sybarra: this round is playing for USA2  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: but go argenta!|pg||
nt|sybarra: Lall team is USA1 as decided by yesterday's  scores  |pg||
nt|othered1: Guess there was no need for south to raise @S, as north likely had a check-back available if looking for 3-card support|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2H was either nat or 24-25 balanced and 2@s was forced to find out which|pg||
nt|joest: the standard lead vs a doubled partscore: a trump|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: is that on your card?|pg||
nt|scotty: Unlucky lead - a club would have defeated 1N, perhaps by as many as 4 tricks.  But no reason for E to find that|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes he did |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|poohbear: Once opener bids anything other than 2nt he has @hs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: I am sure Argenta is wondering about the "gift" |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: she asked about the carding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: so i'm sure she was :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h9|nt|kareno: Yet when partner sticks his vulnerable neck out to overcall, one should consider leading his suit, even a singleton.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|poohbear: 6nt is a tad better but this will do|pg||
nt|mariner1: only off 2 I think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: and btw  hi Dana :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe could make another trick but ....imps  just make it!|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the other room East opened 1H and rebid 4H   . I consider that a misbid since you might just go down on trump tricks when another game is cold|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: bidding 3@H immediately there would have shown a solid heart suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: PLUS it takes up so much space hard to know whether to act with the West hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: (they are just confirming that sam bid this correctly, the two were on ths same wavelength)|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what it takes for other room to open 2 clubs on that hand |pg||
nt|mariner1: so off only 1|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: having opened 1H i would fake a 3@c jump shift|pg||
mb|1S|nt|scotty: I would guess that overcalling with that hand vulnerable is anti-percentage action|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: NS in a part score here seems right|pg||
mb|d|an|3-card support|nt|ckv: actually i have a lot of sympathy for zach's lead- probably still a push|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: eric checks to make sure that 2@H is hearts, as they play transfer overcalls in other sequences|pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e.  lovejoy |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kareno: I love to overcall but I would resist Steve's example.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: explained as nonforcing constructive (2@H that is)|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is a game that makes   |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello to Henry Bethe |pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: actually the only time i go for numbers is when i had a hand like Passell's |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess east was allowing for a really garbaby overcall.  It was, but the right garbage.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: agree with S on bidding on this one,  I dont like the 2245 shape for opening 1 nt |pg||
nt|poohbear: they play 12-14?/|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: "ok i'm going to tank for 30 seconds when dummy tables.  take no inference, other than that i do not want to do something incredibly stupid again" -eric|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: dan places his watch on the table: "your time starts now"|pg||
nt|poohbear: tell him we all promise to close our eyes Dana:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL probably support showing 3 @S|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Quick and dirty auction to a fine slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: They might need to do more than simple avoid stupidity to earn 57 imps back.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|scotty: Going for numbers is only one of the many. many problems with overcalling on that hand|pg||
nt|henryb: Here, Shirley, is a slam that makes, and I cannot believe that a nf 2@h bid can be right with the E hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ckv: i've always thought that nf const was not the right way to play at imps- i prefer forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes so I see Slam,  but takes @H's 2/2 |pg||
