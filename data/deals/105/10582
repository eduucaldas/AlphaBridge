nt|Walddk2: The ranges are too wide imo. 1@S 8-16. This is a very good 11 count but he can't bid more than 2@S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|an|*|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think Kvick should have passed 2@S. Why would you go to the 3-level if partner has 8-9?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S-2@h is a three-card spade raise, 13+hcp. 1@s-2@D is 5+@H, but 13+hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I  know that 4@S is a good contract here, but that is beside the point|pg||

nt|Walddk2: OK, then 2@S shows 10-12 I assume. That makes Kvick's approach more reasonable|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h7|pc|c6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wide ranges for limited hands can cause trouble. Pard and I used to play 2@D as @D+major, 4-10 hcp. Holding a strong NT opposite, you had no idea what to do. So we gave it up. |pg||
