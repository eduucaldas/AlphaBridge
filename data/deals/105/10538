mb|3C|nt|vdoubleu: Yers|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you can sustain a bad diamond break (or guess) in clubs more easily than in diamonds.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N is going to have an ugly hand to lead from. (though not as ugly as to bid from). the deadly spade seems likely (deadly for the defense)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: confirmed 4d= blackwood 4s 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no X of 4S, may avoid that suit on lead|pg||

nt|kareno: Finds a safe lead.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: safe yes, but against small slam will tend to attack. it is not like N is sitting behind declarer's tenaces with high cards|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
