mb|p|nt|april7: S might open 1@D because of rebidproblems and then bid @C|pg||

pc|s2|nt|rodal f: WD EW|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: on card it says "FSJ limit+"|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: 4-card majors, weak NT for N-S I presume|pg||
nt|benjent: 2NT must be artificial - I suggest weak with C or some strong hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT are one but will miss the handle of @C I belive, so a partscore might? Or  NT still|pg||
nt|benjent: 3@c would have been forced, and Koke's passed it out with the uninviting hand with @c's|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: now @S and diescard of 1 @D and so on mAKING EVEN ยง|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think this match might go down to the wire.  On paper, ACT is a little stronger|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And yes, I think NS play an Acol style|pg||

nt|kareno: North perhaps should have with diamonds locked up.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@d is good here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: non-double only cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: zia thought hamman would double with diamonds, but he acknowledged that it didn't matter|pg||
nt|daman: was he sandbagging?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman-Zia playing standard 2/1 are odd men out this set|pg||
nt|joest: back on hand 76|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for good hands to wait over big club|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't think Lestergold's comments on the last hand make any sense.  everybody (except east) appears to have a lot of distribution.  What do HCP have to do with a penalty ...|pg||
nt|scotty: redouble?  Maybe W was 0-6-1-6 and everybody was making|pg||
nt|sga1: This is the first Round of seven Round Swiss League.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes, 6@d is a lovely contract.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Who knows?  Often with a good hand it is sensible to stay out of an opponent's strong club auction.  But with that strong two-suiter it could easily be your hand despite the 1@c ...|pg||
nt|kareno: bid.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: if this room isn't enough for you --  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   then one window per table|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Although a trump lead gives it problems a little|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about a @d lead? must find Q@H in W then|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a bidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w need to find the infrangible 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Mike   please don't use words more than 2 syllables...they give me a headache|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c showing diamonds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: some pairs play that these cuebids here have varying meanings.  I dont know if that is true here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: We all studied 'infrangible' yesterday :)  Means cannot be broken.|pg||
nt|lestergold: George I have a special licence for that word |pg||
nt|daman: not a license?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: another visit from the BBO spelling poleese|pg||
nt|daman: this is not the Commonwealth Mike|pg||
nt|joest: I can't imagine this is Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: Could double be support here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that word caused my router to crash|pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe he's thinking they might play 21c redoubled?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|kareno: How about a loser on loser heart finesse :)|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@c|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mtvesuvius: @c lead would be interesting also :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes @c lead might be more fun|pg||
nt|scotty: On @d lead in 6@d, you are basically cold if @d, 2-2 OR hearts 4-4 OR @hQ with W and hearts 5-3|pg||
nt|kareno: Club a bit tougher but I think declarer has answers for all leads |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|scotty: Club lead looks the hardest by far|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: did RDBL show @S honor -- or something more magical?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|daman: not out of the question :)|pg||
nt|joest: did he really pass?|pg||
nt|joest: I doubt it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hey George are u commentating on the bridge or on my locutions?(only 3 syllables|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, specs, I didn't read the meaning of the Alert :)  So sue me!|pg||
nt|daman: both|pg||
nt|scotty: Why not?  he knew they weren't playing in 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not guaranteed to reach 3N so chance for a pick up here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|c2|nt|joest: I guess I"d turn that around.  Why would you risk that when you know you can play it in 2@s?|pg||
nt|kareno: And specs, of course, I cannot answer each of your comments!!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|nt|joest: anyway this hand is a great result for east-west|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, I think it may be down with a @c lead, since you cannot ruff out the @s or establish the @h in time I think|pg||
nt|joest: well I wouldn't be so quick to bet against Meckwell duplicating this|pg||
nt|kareno: It may yet be duplicated in the OR, folks :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack, GMTA!!|pg||
nt|scotty: I'm surprised hamman didn't cover second @d to block suit and force declarer to use his entry|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can Bachi find extra values?|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Seems like De Luca forgot to use Blackwood on 11 - hence the swing to ACT|pg||

nt|april7: are 6 points enough?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Puppet used?|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: nt wrong now|pg||

nt|april7: W shouldplay NT and not E, but he wants to play in a minor, to bad|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: 8 tricks only|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: Smart can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2NT is textbook stuff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bagchi "see red" (the vulnerability) and bids 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't that show 11-12 with a C stopper?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: if you double 2@H please hide  = no more bidding|pg||
nt|april7: now they are overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... tougher if you take a point or two away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's see|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use 11-14 NT openings so this show 15 - 17(18)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: precion at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: precision|pg||
pc|s5|nt|april7: the 2NT bid was not the best idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he will let this ride to his queen and advance @H10 to the queen|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a spot for 6@S here. Still tough @S are 1-4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: the X was also wrong, because E makes it now and W WAS FORCED  TO CONTINUE BIDDING ANYWAY|pg||
nt|haans: you can not sell precision withn that bidding|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: On either black suit switch, it seems N/S has 5 tricks|pg||

nt|rodal f: By there systemcard. How to get in the key cards?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4d key card|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|benjent: So small opportunity for SA if Lusk-De Luca can bid 6@s in the other room - not clearcut, but De Luca is an ... enthusiastic ... bidder|pg||

nt|vugraphu4: there was a very good write-up in the Bridge World as I recall|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: why? he can bid double to show that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Many people play pass is positive here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsz: the names have been updated now |pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: you just use the opps bid as a jumping stone|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I guess Kamil was trapping maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: Takeout double.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kareno: I play double of 2@h directly shows 'second negative' hand.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: but they play steps|pg||
nt|kareno: I propose some tea ... (_)?  and some cookies ... OOOO ... while we see how many NT are made here.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: tea?   which part of Las Vegas are you in Karen?|pg||
nt|kareno: Northwest|pg||
nt|joest: would the commentators lead a club or a heart from hamman's hand?|pg||
nt|kareno: Club to be honest.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mtvesuvius: I do also, Karen, it seems to work|pg||
nt|scotty: kamil unwilling to defend at this vul|pg||
nt|hedyg: the first step shows 0-1 control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs agree that DBL shows Double Negative, others say game force with no other call to make|pg||
nt|daman: @C|pg||
nt|joest: im mulling it over to be honest with you|pg||
nt|scotty: Some would probably look at all 4 hands and lead a spade - gives nothing away|pg||
nt|joest: well yeah maybe but that's not in any rational mix|pg||
nt|scotty: In your dreams, when you lead a club, dummy has Q10 doubleton and partner has KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming that is kind of dreams you have|pg||
nt|scotty: With two entries, a club can work in many ways.  And with spades lying poorly for declarer, I see no reson to not to lead a club.  Won't give away much|pg||
nt|joest: you need tons of help inclubs to get them going but it does combine safety with a reasonable amount of aggression|pg||
nt|joest: and then there are always dreams..... :)|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer has many entry problems here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 22.8 - http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=kq+a3+ak96+ajt73|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to convert to penalties at this vul|pg||
nt|scotty: Really tough hand to play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This will be a tough hand for Kamil, since he has extreme entry problems, and has alot of work to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much easier play for Kamil if contract is 2@HX|pg||
nt|scotty: I'd probably take 5 minutes to plan the play - and still not know what to do|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|scotty: Looks like he should attack diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: now @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: then @d to the J|pg||
nt|kareno: Now a club |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hamman had to win that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now this could potentially make...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|scotty: He can lose 2 diamonds and a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not enuf problems to go down!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: he will not be tested other than for overtricks|pg||
nt|scotty: Can N hope declarer has Ax, Kxxx, KQxxx, Ax or the like?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|scotty: 2@h, doubled would have not been so great if if they start !jD lead to !AK and a ruff.  Probably 300|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hamman knew that Zia has no more @hs|pg||
nt|kareno: I think ducking wasn't best here.  Tough hand to play or to defend I guess.|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh he didnt know|pg||
nt|scotty: How did Hamman know that?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He doesn't, but I don't think it can hurt to win?|pg||
nt|kareno: diamond now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial worry if win - Kamil takes 3@H tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|nt|scotty: I guess he did|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mtvesuvius: Zia does best to duck to maintain communications|pg||
nt|scotty: It would hurt to win first heart if declarer knocked out partners club trick, then later your @d trick - since partner would have no hearts to clear them|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not play @d for an entry to hand?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d7|nt|barnets: no im in europe for 3 weeks|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry private|pg||
pc|s6|nt|scotty: Defense also has difficulties here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|joest: that was a good construction|pg||
nt|scotty: I thought declarer should stay with @d attack - play the hand like he has @sAx|pg||
nt|scotty: It's sometimes difficult to think clearly when entries to both hands are a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: we got bounced off the network for a moment, but you didn't miss anything|pg||
nt|joest: the network timed us out|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: sorry if i missed -- did anybody in panel discuss @HA at trick 1? |pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d3|pc|hJ|nt|scotty: Hamman has a dilemma now|pg||

nt|kareno: Um ... we call that a convincing margin :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry|pg||
nt|scotty: I think it was sensible to bid 5@h with East hand.  He only had one chance to guess, and even if 5@h is the "wrong" guess, sometimes opponents do the wrong thing after.|pg||
nt|daman: the fat lady is warming up|pg||
nt|kareno: Match now slipping far away for Fleisher.  |pg||
nt|joest: good bidding in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yes, Ekeblad opened North 2@D=opening hand, 5+@H & 4+@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kareno: That is not classical notrump shape, but a hard hand to bid without opening 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: The Fleisher team took off the last two sets of their final match to get rested for this one but they have been playing throughout this entire event and obviously are weary.|pg||
mb|1N|an|forcing|nt|ahollan1: so are the commentators |pg||
nt|kareno: 5d excellent n/s and found in the OR.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|can be 3 cards|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: If Zia's hand was a little different, 5@h would have potentially had Zia make the incorrect guess, essentially what Hamman's 4@s did to Kamil|pg||
nt|kareno: That will end the auction.|pg||
nt|kareno: No kidding, Al.  And I've also attended a Film Festival here in Las Vegas this past week ... tonight is the last film.|pg||
nt|scotty: I'm not sure if there was any clear route to success.  Even if he starts with a trump, Hamman ducks and still not cold.  As it happens had he played a trump, he might have been ...|pg||
nt|scotty: able to duck a @h to N, or set up a @H winner if S split|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 82 will be removed - one of the players in the open room inadvertently saw a few cards from another player's hand and the director is making a new board 82|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We can't show that I'm afraid|pg||
nt|daman: irregularity; a sub bd82 is being made up because a player saw some cards from another players hand somehow; it prob will not make viewgraph|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: 3@s splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: You always want to force your opponent to make the last guess.|pg||
nt|scotty: i think it's interesting that partner is mathematically more likely to be short in @c than @d, which adds to the attraction of the 5@h bid.  Wouldn't be so surprising to find 4@s ...|pg||
nt|scotty: and 5@h both making if partner has a stiff club|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: South's short @cs will be a bit of a problem on this hand, although the @c spots should make it much easier|pg||
nt|joest: I wonder if 4@c is an 'automatic' cue-bidding situationfor them. I suspect Zia is not bound by many rules like that anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: shouldn't forget - vugraph operators must be exhausted too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|joest: this is quite a bit of bidding on a hand with KJxx of spades|pg||

nt|kareno: Did south really play the club queen?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, that makes more sense|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't like south's proceeding to cuebid after 4@s ruined his hand.|pg||
nt|daman: is 4@D  RKC?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|joest: that's possible|pg||

pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: Bagchi (West) is a brilliant bridge player ... he plays a very psychological sort of game, and 4NT doesn't surprise me here|pg||

nt|benjent: Question about where this event leads...|pg||
nt|rodal f: For vug TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|1D|nt|april7: although bad @S position, still 10 tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|haans: needed for ruffi8ng|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north's first club spot showed count, then the 2nd one could be for suit preference|pg||
nt|april7: but then its to late|pg||
nt|roman505:  The rest of our team were all under 30, Nye-Ware and Geromboux-Griffiths|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|april7: e goes all the way|pg||
nt|gracelin: at least let declarer find the double dummy play|pg||
nt|benjent: The Australian system awards Playoff Points for wins and high finishes in national events|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2NT are to hard in S now but would have woorked|pg||
nt|benjent: Afetr a bruising year, we have a playoff for the national team(s) amongst the highest playoff-point-scorers|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: I spent around 30 years "learning" 3014 ... my brain has only a set number of system changes in it, and I am not going to spend one of them on this pointless exercise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Roland. Normaly 1403 fit the cards better the 0314|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be a + for NS anyway I belive:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A practic bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|april7: N is wondering whats going on|pg||
nt|haans: 4NT?|pg||
nt|benjent: The winners of this event get about 3/4 of the points needed for the playoff|pg||
nt|kiddd: ???|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|haans: clubs + shorter diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My wife plays 1430 except in clubs.  My comment is: "what a schemozzle"|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got the spot.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: better :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2 down on @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: De Luca trying to put sand in the machine|pg||

nt|haans: what has happened to Blackwood you may ask? finding game more important|pg||
nt|april7: it makes on a non @C lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: And next by 11 I belive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11 o'clock?|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Rodal, I reckon you would be great on Twitter|pg||
pc|h3|nt|benjent: Good X of 4@s by Smolanko to get his side in the game|pg||

pc|hA|nt|april7: low high signal!|pg||

pc|s5|nt|rodal f: 0230 in Denmark|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 11:30|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nearly as they should have bidded 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gracelin: because after 3 rounds of trump, he has only one trump left and has two losers to cover|pg||

nt|daman: 82 is toast|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a big applause for our vugraf operator :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: a heated conversion between EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kareno: 5@d expensive e/w.|pg||
nt|joest: that's one way to do it!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|joest: this is a mildly irregular takeout double|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 90 in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and inserted|pg||

nt|Walddk4: done I notice, thx|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|scotty: Some play lebensohl here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: about the @D ruff|pg||
nt|suketbombi: likely to get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: Spec comments that if west doesn't overruff, they may do better - generally with trump length, that can gain.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s should make easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: So 3@c = values|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Dbl was penalty|pg||
nt|joest: (I think)|pg||
nt|daman: now the 4-3 @H fit?|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|suketbombi: oops safe & sound:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: good lead by Vijay the hand would make T tricks on Cross ruff w/o the lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|joest: no Rubin is guessing about Granovetter's black suit lengths and guessed well|pg||
nt|joest: as I said: not the last...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mtvesuvius: Not a bad idea to do that.. I haven't seen that treatment at all, but it seems logical|pg||
nt|scotty: With a "bad" 3@c bid, Zia would bid 2N, which shows either that, or a 3-level bid with a @d stopper |pg||
nt|kareno: Good treatment - 2nt almost never needs to be natural in that position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if auction had gone 1@S-2@H  is lebensohl still best or 2N scramble|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: another hand with fleisher on the wrong side of it in both rooms|pg||
nt|daman: I can faintly hear the fat lady in the hallway|pg||
nt|lestergold: u need ur hearing tested in that case george|pg||
nt|daman: is she that loud to you Mike?|pg||
nt|joest: well the bottom line here is that Nickell has outscored Fleisher 76-5 in these last two sets|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|scotty: Hamman's 3@s bid might have been forcing by agreement.  I know Zia had this auction-type playing with Andy Robson once|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer COULD go down if he decided to play West for @sJxxx - but I don't think that it's too likely he will go that way|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mtvesuvius: It's doubtful, but won't he still always make?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: now definitely not going to play for @S41|pg||

pc|c4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: we may see a few from the Fleisher team trialing again for Seniors|pg||
nt|joest: now Granovetter gets tapped out.  Another very unpleasant hand to declare....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Fleisher-Kamil meet minimum age requirement|pg||

nt|joest: they may cross pathes in Sao Paolo|pg||
mb|1N|mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzsz: You can see the Round 1 score 1 in the following link .. click on Preliminary round show Round Scores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsz: http://indianbridgetourneys.appspot.com/hindusthanclub/2009/results.html|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 800 in open room on doubtful game for e-w?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsx: E asks about 3@s & is told nat,weak|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1N=7-10  so Fleisher downgrading for 4333 and unsupported honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NAT, F1, 4+@H  (a) 4@H & 6@C/@D, min  (b) 4@H, BAL, inappropriate for NT (c) 4@H(441)|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Fleisher devaluing his hand slightly, I think.  Lack of spots and aces suggest going "low"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my notes stop there|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|daman: another 3NT by Meckwell in the OR   they live off that contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice Meckstroth treated West hand as GAME FORCE over Weichsel's 1@S overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Rubin may be comtemplating hearts instead of NT; not sure|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|mtvesuvius: Surrounding play of the Q@C perhaps now... a bit tough to find though|pg||
nt|suketbombi: what does sukamal want ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: not @H lead i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsz: The next session will start from 1:15 PM IST instead of 1:30 PM ( after 1 hours 15 mins)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: if Zia doesn't lead a diamond honor, I'll be mighty surprised|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: with the 1600 and defeating 4@s, he may lead a trump just to see the look on hamman's face (j/k)|pg||
nt|joest: I don't know if 2@s showed a spade stopper or not|pg||
nt|kareno: It will be a glower!|pg||
nt|joest: I also don't know whether a direct rasie to 3@h would be forcing.  all that is relevant|pg||
nt|joest: but since both games make it doesn't make much diff|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|scotty: Zia finds the best defense|pg||
pc|hK|nt|suketbombi: declerer will duck this and probabably get a contnution eben a miss guee in@c with an ot|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: Yes, nice.  Not exactly a surround play, though.|pg||
nt|joest: a better spot than 3NT on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|scotty: but will not defeat 1N|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kareno: I had one of those a couple of weeks ago in Bournemouth, England :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|scotty: If declarer leads a heart off the board later, Zia will play 8 to prevent a duck to N|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|nt|suketbombi: strange double by bete sukamal|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: instead of gaining 5 will loose 4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: tool time commercial   K&R [kaplan rubens] Hand Evaluator says West hand worth 10.00  |pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sJ|mc|10|nt|Vugraphzsx: again a discussion about the double between NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: N is saying he wanted his p to lead @S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: vijay must be saying if you want a @s lead dont double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsx: actually S is saying u dont have a good enough hand for dbl|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even a spade lead will lead to atleast 9 tricks|pg||

nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|rodal f: Draw so fare by the set. 8 - 8|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes sorry I am in that room|pg||
nt|super nova: I am hoping to see a repeat of the 2002 ANC|pg||
nt|caitlin: bye|pg||
nt|super nova: Do you remember that one bill?|pg||
nt|benjent: Last board of this set. Thanks to my co-commentator Rodal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, I believe that final was one by an overtrick imp on the final board|pg||
mb|2C|nt|april7: 4NT? and then 5@H  1down|pg||
nt|elivero: is it possible to stop in 4 here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 11-14 NT again|pg||

nt|rodal f: A SPECIAL ON for the great vug operator. Nice woork|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ta, and thanks for watching|pg||

mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: won|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. it was crazy|pg||
nt|rodal f: And stole the contract|pg||
nt|benjent: Thanks also to Jane on the keys and of course the players for putting on the show|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|super nova: SA V NSW|pg||
nt|super nova: SA winning|pg||
nt|rodal f: 29HP total. Will they bid as the other table?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Is this a good slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|super nova: Clubs or heart slam|pg||
nt|rodal f: Started 1H - 2@C in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is excellent|pg||
nt|super nova: 6c is par.. 7 h or 7c no way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is it a good grand slam?|pg||
nt|super nova: :-S|pg||
nt|super nova: no|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% grand approx|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see the same good bidding here? But by 2-2@C needed|pg||
nt|benjent: This contract drifted 3 off in the Open room - let's see if Khokan can do better....|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will be minimum2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: this is the last board all results can be ound at http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=09ANCT&header=abf|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at least to The Australian Federation - BBO by all there nice people. ( Wald are at sleep) We was Bjรธrn and Frank from norway trying to help|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||
nt|super nova: Just thinking about the extra 6% that bill mentioned|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: But you can pick up singleton J or Q with North|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|elivero: And thx to Frank that use so mucth of his time for uss here,,thx Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: In the otherroom S bidded 1@S. Gave room for the opps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: now a crossruff is coming|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Losing to doubleton QJ - that's the extra 6%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if you guess it|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would play it that way based on restricted choice if an honour was played from N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you don't, you consign yourself to 40%|pg||
nt|elivero: there we go:)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|benjent: Low @d to the J looks like the best ployt to create tricks, but doesn't work here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can play small !X to A and @D|pg||
nt|benjent: Might still generate a little by playing @c to the A then a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Makes 5|pg||
nt|benjent: Snap, Rodal!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or. Best small @D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: I take my words back:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D 4rth. Then after 3@H a que on the road?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|april7: thats the last hand|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: Their auction was a little mysterious, but I suppose once West 4th-suited, East was bidding a slam|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Play has finished and will resume in about 20 minutes time.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: that is, 2100 EST|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Thanks to everybody. See you when play resumes.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Congratulations to SA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roman505:  They came home against an ACT team which had led most of the round robin|pg||
nt|rodal f: And afterthe ques. 5@H = do u like ure quality at @H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to stop at 4|pg||
nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Perhaps as commented elsewhere, it is often unwise to use 4NT with weak trumps.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Thank you all. Bye now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thanks all see u next year :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|april7: thanks all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Still their auction lacks conviction.  For example, did anyone see a diamond cue bid from West?|pg||
nt|benjent: Well done Khokan, tightens the match up a little|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will hang at 5 loosers as I see it. Right Bjรธrn?:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: 6 on?|pg||

nt|joest: now if these guys get to 6@c I know things are going their way!|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, could have gone down had north played the diamond jack at the lead to point the way to his hand for a club ruffr.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|joest: btw, in trying to play super safe Granovetter might have gone down had the defense seen all the cards|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|an|at least one Major confirmed|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: For sure... Ugly 11, and 1NT was the max... Same spot in the OR though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: can salvage an imp on @s lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|joest: Hamman wouldhave loved to have opened his hand 1@s believe me|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no problems here tho|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: too right|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well, this will take a lot of work to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can meckwell get to 1N after nebulous @D?  i think so|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, they did|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i think he's still 'allowed' in certain circumstances - but nowhere near as usual|pg||
nt|kareno: West doesn't really want a ruff here.  |pg||
nt|joest: as it turns out a diamond would have been better, yes but looking at @h10xxx its hard to know that|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|joest: as against that Edgar Kaplan always used to say: "God dealt me KQJ10 for a reason"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Someone is asking which pair played against Zia-Hamman in set 3, boards 31-45.  Anyone know?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|kareno: I'm told it was Ekeblad/Weichsel.|pg||
nt|jtr: The same pair|pg||
nt|hedyg: check BBO bridge library|pg||
nt|jtr: yes right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: find @HJ = good   learn @S split = bad|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, specs :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Lead was helpful but ... |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mtvesuvius: No, it messed up declarer's entries, it was good for the defense|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|hedyg: 7@h could have been from AJ97 so he could not play the Q@h|pg||
nt|kareno: The best they could have done is hold this to four.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s6|pc|c5|nt|joest: Zia will ruff and cross to the club to hook the heart, both b/c the king rates to be onside (no preempt) and because he risks a trump promotion if he plays hearts fromthe top|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, Zia had better not take the unsafety play in hearts now!!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: Agreed.  He simply cannot let east on lead.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kareno: Spec is asking about 'seating rights.'  That has to do with the order in which teams seat themselves.  When you have seating rights, your opponents must sit first and then you can ...|pg||
nt|kareno: choose how to sit around them.|pg||
