nt|haans: Hi all welcome you kibitzers|pg||
nt|afulton: East may / may not invite, but if North is on lead against NT and pulls out that @h J, thing may get interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Transfe response - 1@H showed spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: 1NT showing 15-17??|pg||
nt|haans: more common soon than natural bidding|pg||
nt|kurtove: 9 tricks in spade will be normal, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: @HK and @CQ right - so 'only' down 1|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H did show minimum opening but better than weak 2 promise only 5|pg||

nt|sybarra: but pard bid @S so may lead it |pg||
nt|lesrays: well I believe in NOT leading pards suit with such a nice one of my own|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but that @s card is now known to be sure entry|pg||
nt|werge: Still a long way|pg||
nt|afulton: and East never asked whether partner had a major suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think E expects to be putting 5 tricks on the table |pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@C is being played in the open room but the indians so a chance for pickup for them|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like we go off with a good 3nt NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Paul and Massimiliano|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Just about any lead OK here, but the contract should come home on power.|pg||

nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even a spade lead probably won't be sufficient|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume 1@C was strong and artificial, hence the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|jeanhari: both teams need points to get in the upper half|pg||
nt|jeanhari: al long as dummy covers there are no 5 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|werge: Problem is a @C-lead/shift - you will not know, how @S´s are behaving|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|afulton: the problem with North hand:  not only one but 2 honors in @s... so suit might block on lead of 3spot|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: all pairs for Chinese Taipei play Precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except  for one|pg||

nt|mariner1: Participants then click Flag under event to see convention cards)|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,where the prec system come from (CC Wei)...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 1NT rebid 18-19|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like N/S are going to steal it in 3H |pg||
nt|allanr44: how forcing is 3@D?  Anyone know?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Their card says 10-12 4 card support|pg||
nt|allanr44: then I imagine south can pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL probably any 5-8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that makes 14 top tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Clubs 3+D5+ H3+S2 = 13|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: since transfer response to 1@C -- i believe EW are Chen-Furuta|pg||
nt|westjava: and looks like standard system from Japan pair|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5C may make on the layout but I doubt they'll bid that high|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its a pretty good hand |pg||
nt|westjava: yup, and x is 5-7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|westjava: hard to bid:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: leaping to 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: (I think)|pg||
nt|allanr44: well done them!|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting rebid decision...3C, 3NT or something else|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W have a good chance of making 3S at least but missed out when West didn't double|pg||
nt|sybarra2: liliek :)  @H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzre: W wrote 1@C+1NT=18-20|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No good lead except a spade which is unlikely :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I feel 3 Nt is makeable - Which suit E will try C or S to be seen|pg||
pc|hK|nt|westjava: right contract but not easy to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wasted values in @S's |pg||
nt|sybarra: got to love it |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Normal lead but unfortunately resolves the diamond suit for declarer so should make 9 tricks now without much trouble|pg||
nt|sybarra2: think E is saying I had @C!!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary then you must have had a feast I envy you|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: each has now cued the suit the other one has :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it could be a close thing|pg||
pc|c7|nt|westjava: wow,fly too high|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another nice stopping point for Australia.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: well 4@S is too much best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D rebid doesn't fit any of the descriptions in the convention card :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: win in hand, lead @c and its about done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can he convert to the top spot|pg||
pc|cT|nt|westjava: yeah,EW fly too high|pg||
nt|woozle: East might have considered 3NT on the third round (having already shown his 5/4) but 4S is definitely the best game|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so grand is reached but could still be a loss of imps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|westjava: more and more @C..:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|westjava: no way to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West is Dawei Chen   East is Kazuo Furuta|pg||
nt|sybarra: club up |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they find @S after the 2nd @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: doest matter now |pg||
nt|jcwla: K & R Hand Evaluator calls the W hand 20.3 pts|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|westjava: all lead advantage to decl:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: without knowing what the cues mean we can't determine their reasons|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: anyway as the cards are it has good chance|pg||
nt|woozle: Tough hand to plan...drawing trumps may disappoint when he discovers the club layout|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm guessing down 1|pg||
nt|woozle: club shift now provides a line to make - J,Q,A...finish trumps, club to the eight|pg||
nt|woozle: If South splits, concede a club|pg||
nt|raghavan: Divided honour principle is ok but here ??|pg||
nt|raghavan: If OR bid 7Nt some 2 IMP will be lost|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|westjava: 500 miles...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|westjava: hi Rashed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 10 via 4@S, 4@H, 2@D ruffs|pg||
nt|mariner1: don't see it has any chance really|pg||
nt|westjava: S has to cover@D and @C return|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi all |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes no cover and @c back was not best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes 2nd trick was the key|pg||
nt|westjava: first @D cover by K|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Needed to play low there.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has to find low @S|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now N will play D - only 8 tricks are there|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  Depends on methods but I would be content with an immediate 3H on the South hand|pg||
nt|westjava: the right name of EW are Irne Karongkeng and Conny Sumampouw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if these hands any indication -- black trump suits not splitting today|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mariner1: good info Liliek|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary - N heard you |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cA|nt|westjava: with @H 3-3,decl will go home now|pg||
nt|mariner1: now can ruff another @D, pull trumps and pitch a @c on @H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  More passive defence was required|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we may need to remind them |pg||
nt|woozle: Not clear what East should do on the heart shift, but rising with the king provides the simplest path to make|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c6|nt|nigel_k:  Make declarer choose what to do with her 9H entry to dummy|pg||
nt|woozle: Playing low may still lead to down one anyway|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|westjava: might be a swing board to Japan|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,much better|pg||
nt|westjava: in Ina National Liga,I was NPC of this team:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: playing @H is unnecessary danger |pg||
pc|h6|nt|nigel_k:  From North's point of view he does have extra and his partner cue bid and then raised|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  KC not worth much though|pg||
nt|westjava: could be -1|pg||
pc|c8|nt|westjava: vwd Dawei|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|fann4: Declarer didn't overuff.|pg||
nt|panja: we didnt catch the play right here I guess...|pg||
nt|haans: now a slam that is not|pg||
nt|panja: another hand whee a Moyesian fit might work..|pg||
nt|lestergold: a crash landing maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ok we start now |pg||

nt|sybarra: 1 nt|pg||

nt|bobholl: first blood to welland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to see where the Open found 2 more tricks|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 4@S for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D lead and continuation after @S a|pg||

nt|haans: but heading to 3nt|pg||

nt|haans: Swiss A|pg||

nt|raghavan: will there be a X|pg||
nt|mariner1: no game though someone could end up too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: massimiliano the players names are wrong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On play of @CA the hand had good potential for 6@C|pg||
nt|april7: E might stay in 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and a raise by N is a must|pg||
nt|charles_l: might consider 3N|pg||
nt|wwalter: could be a manly bid :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: "me man, me play NT" :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: y :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i've got a messaage saying E's name is NEVE? not NAVE, can you correct that, operator? |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Sorry.............:) miskclick|pg||
nt|xenya: now for something more exciting|pg||
nt|kurtove: e-w have to take the two diamond-tricks in 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H x???|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@S the limit here but reasonable game|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@H will be good spade raise|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S should be cold, or even 4@H, but not 3Nt on a @D lead by E|pg||
nt|werge: What is North worth here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: oover shot the runway as it were|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now just what outh wanted to hear|pg||
nt|haans: but the swedish use both|pg||
nt|panja: still....N would not have been able to continue even with a couple of HCP more...and it seemed like a precipitate leap to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|dcbutler: action now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi and bonjour|pg||
nt|ritong: hola R|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Henri, David and Dave|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi Henri|pg||
nt|davidstern: The other table went -1 in 3NT which led to 4IMPS for Liguria|pg||
nt|raghavan: N will bid now 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wwalter: this was not good|pg||
nt|panja: She is not sure of South's strength....|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all |pg||
nt|lestergold: can north sound find their nice safe spot in diamonds?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 to Neve.|pg||
nt|raghavan: 23 points with EW - good bid by W |pg||
nt|ralfwil: As I play is D that I can take care of at least one of the shown suits|pg||
nt|haans: but cannot lead @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: south|pg||
nt|werge: 10 tricks look easy|pg||
nt|haans: i do strongly agree thats a weak 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: next pl no fireworks:)|pg||
nt|don paulus: N might have done some balancing if not vuln i guess|pg||
pc|c2|nt|charles_l: he does not trust her 2nd seat red preempts|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead awkward here|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 board matches are cut throat - can't afford many bad boards|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry 3@S -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Fingers doing the walking|pg||
nt|kurtove: normal 4 h or 3 nt here|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3NT looks like a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC oliver|pg||
nt|oliverc: Hi|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ lead = stopper|pg||
nt|haans: leap = no more info to opps|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: hello Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Vladimir |pg||
nt|don paulus: friendly lead :)|pg||
nt|ritong: par is reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks, Roland :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Hans :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so did east want to hear it|pg||
nt|sharkey: S has faith in pd's preempts|pg||
nt|werge: A week two is NEVER a 7-card, pls|pg||
nt|haans: agree but ...|pg||
nt|panja: oh, I forgot partner is counted as opp|pg||
nt|haans: sometimes :)|pg||
nt|haans: :( you are never sure :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think it was Mike Lawrence who coined the term " middle hand opponent"|pg||
nt|haans: swedes use Big Club|pg||
nt|sybarra: with this spade lay out, 4 @S is making |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|haans: will decl find @DQ??????|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H can be set w AC lead|pg||
nt|pelu: and in OR S - after a @H kead to K - took a finess to the @HJ = -1 in 3@H|pg||
nt|haans: har ingen aning|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes looks 3Nt |pg||
nt|mariner1: well they need defense to tangle up their tricks to make|pg||
nt|fann4: Other room in 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: * is not |pg||
nt|afulton: wow|pg||
nt|ronpa: 4@S and 3NT both make as cards are|pg||
nt|ronpa: tak @H lead and duck to beat 4@S\|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they make 4 @S?|pg||
nt|afulton: no checkback?|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @S !?! - are @H-ruffs not allowed any longer?|pg||
nt|april7: if N would have balanced then W could also end up in a @D part making3 and now E makes 2 @H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wwalter: @s now to be sure about makeing|pg||
nt|panja: the correct play now is a @S|pg||
nt|panja: to guarantee 3@H..|pg||
nt|panja: S must be hoping @H finesse is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not this lead!|pg||
nt|milton_se: AH and JS|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity W that he has to be on lead every time his team wins a trick - E ast no entry|pg||
nt|haans: decl can live long on @D|pg||
nt|werge: Interesting slam - defence can only get 1 @C-trick...|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't bid it iguess :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: spade lead best|pg||
nt|jeanhari: close call for west, non vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: may not want to hear it as much as he hopes tho!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid with 2@C losers|pg||
nt|mcarroll: pretty impossible to bid|pg||
nt|werge: Per definition, ther is only ONE @c-loser...|pg||
nt|haans: a zia bid?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some looks like tartan or muiderberg |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe you said that already) |pg||
nt|xenya: a 2-suiter, yes|pg||
nt|xenya:  does he have an ace, S is thinking|pg||
nt|kurtove: hard to find the 5 club now|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the match between 3rd and 4th ranking team in final A|pg||
nt|panja: RKC perhaps, 4@C was|pg||
nt|haans: perhaps|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@H is 4+H and 4+@S|pg||
nt|werge: Must be a triple-squeeze, whuch I have´nt seen|pg||
nt|werge: which|pg||
nt|ronpa: very tough to make 4@S, 3NT is much easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt looks a lot better to me also |pg||
nt|werge: Not very tough - impossible - East ist screaming for a @H-ruff|pg||
nt|afulton: so is "ruff" hand to make in suit contract :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kurtove: think so|pg||
nt|haans: think they play 3nt|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not much chance, no reason Gromov to go up with a trump|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 S would have been suffiecient - 9 cards in trumpSpades and equal strength|pg||
nt|mariner1: defense not likely to make a slips as entry to dummy early causes a @D issue later|pg||
nt|jeanhari: with open cards one would play three rounds of clubs now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|daman: EW got overboard but NS really couldn't double|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|werge: What was 4 @C supposed to show?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oliverc: no great interest in the play. Just needs to knock out the A@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: 10 tricks  normally to be made = 4S+3H+2D+1C=10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Ralf let us hope to have interesting deals|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sure we do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Curious - best lead is in fact @hQ|pg||
nt|haans: other room did bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rnc: 2NT is an option on S|pg||
nt|rnc: and we will have difficulties handling alias (as well)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Poor;ly fitting hand - would make slam a nice contract on other days - liks a third club in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems straight forward here unless he ducks this @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: just a moment|pg||
nt|werge: Fast and flat board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|werge: - and West will know from the bidding, that East has no singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: better part of valor with that 7 count |pg||
nt|ronpa: did souh really pass??|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|lesrays: have they really passed it out?|pg||
nt|werge: I prefer to bid 5 @S than only 3...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt made in other room,  but only in 1 |pg||
nt|afulton: this could be yet another pickup by NS |pg||
nt|april7: 2 entries for playing @H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: good move by north, the 6@h bid suggests 4or5 @hs and out|pg||
nt|kurtove: wow|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks so but how long?|pg||
nt|afulton: ah|pg||
nt|werge: East goes for a @C-ruff instead...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wwalter: she is greedy :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as noted red vs white sacrifice but declarer hasnt found the @DQ yet but the double may steer him right|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well read by North|pg||
nt|haans: is 5@C good bridge??|pg||
nt|davidstern: Aand no double|pg||
nt|davidstern: Dont know about good bridge but -100 against possible +200 or more likely -790|pg||
nt|kurtove: is 1 club 3+ clubs|pg||
nt|kurtove: he knows that pd is short in spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is it clear that the third double is penalties|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S relay 3@H 3-4-3-3|pg||
nt|milton_se: wise w two 4333|pg||
nt|haans: yep :)|pg||
nt|haans: but they could fist ask then  bid nt|pg||
nt|fann4: @D lead in the OR|pg||
nt|haans: popos say nothing |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly decides to stop in 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly safer than 3 nt  |pg||
nt|lestergold: on a spade lead it probably goes off|pg||
nt|kurtove: but its wery red|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|milton_se: getting in trouble if double finesse in Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|haans: hi hedy|pg||
nt|jeanhari: game over...|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Weinstein had 2 reasons to bid game   1. it might make    2. he might stampede the opps into bidding 5@H|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Rob|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: can get tangled up on the hand in 3 nt (imo) |pg||
nt|xenya: not really, Shirley -- 6 @Cs, 2@Ds and @HA -- at least|pg||
nt|pelu: S know that there are 'mirrow'distribution - so 3Nt sh be as good as 4@H - nice bidding|pg||
nt|jeanhari: as most players in the east seat did|pg||
nt|lestergold: epsecially on tye lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partner I have @C losers if you have singleton @C we are in business|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|panja: hypothesis rejected, 4Nt was the RKC|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yet another 5 level contract|pg||
nt|haans: or 4nt king ask|pg||
nt|mcarroll: undo I suggest|pg||
nt|haans: king + Q|pg||
pc|s7|nt|panja: if 4@C ace ask...P on 4@H was in order|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: and might sneak a @S also |pg||
nt|star6ija: nice defense|pg||
nt|xenya: S was facing a tough decision i think -- do we agree with 3@C?|pg||
nt|panja: on this bidding, @D small lead seems attractive|pg||
nt|april7: undo|pg||
nt|don paulus: in OR board 1 went down after @h start - 11 for Herbst to start with !|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best chance for declarer is that he is sure where the honours are|pg||
nt|jeanhari: both could have happened indeed, not this time|pg||
nt|raghavan: If declarer tried to play S from dummy N may split and lose a Spade trick - I know at this level of top players, it may not come thru. But trial costs nothing|pg||
nt|davidstern: And he doesnt of course|pg||
nt|haans: spade are RIGHT|pg||
nt|haans: 450 to SWEDEN|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Dr Paranjapee and Hans GE|pg||
nt|ronpa: operator did south really pass 3@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: YES|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: 2 spades 4 clubs and dim ace |pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, 6 hearts would make with the diamond break|pg||
nt|daman: they would never split thir honors|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed but |pg||
nt|jeanhari: could cost however with spades 2-2 and clubs 5-1|pg||
nt|haans: sort of agree|pg||
nt|werge: Board only flat - not FAST|pg||
nt|werge: Call a doctor|pg||
nt|ronpa: lol|pg||
nt|werge: For ronpa...|pg||
nt|ronpa: I already called a taxi for hospital :)|pg||
nt|lesrays: or for Massi:)|pg||
nt|werge: I would prefer passing 2 NT - but never 3 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no no i'm feel very good :)|pg||
nt|werge: Not much work for doctors nowadays|pg||
pc|c6|nt|milton_se: why cover w Kxx?|pg||
nt|rnc: agree, and so did Balicki|pg||
nt|haans: easier to agree seeing all cards :)|pg||
nt|werge: That helped...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: Nice to have u here - I was alone with 2x Sweden, so...:):):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC : http://tinyurl.com/mgwd8y|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|milton_se: and now a D|pg||
nt|hedyg: the CC is from last year so might have made some changes|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: not obvious to read the 8@c, W could have ducked|pg||
nt|haans: AJ right in clubs so soon happy decl|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does not know that Hans|pg||
nt|milton_se: but he can't go wrong|pg||
nt|haans: to swedish champions at other table Mårten Gustawsson and Sylvan|pg||
nt|raghavan: Declarer has to lose 2D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) on Monday. Five more rounds of Swiss tomorrow|pg||
nt|star6ija: after round 7 tomorrow first 27 teams from group A and 5 from group B will progress to the knockout phase|pg||
nt|haans: yes two 10|pg||
nt|werge: I would bid 2 NT|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am guessing it is penalties but what can North sseriously believe they can do to 4@S|pg||
nt|oliverc: Did Declarer really play the Q@D on a small one at trick 1, I wonder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry for being late.Hi all |pg||
nt|Walddk5: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought maybe he would pitch the @D |pg||
nt|haans: 2 x 14 boards|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: maybe Lofgren led from xxx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like playing diamonds is best|pg||
nt|haans: so Im said|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|milton_se: anyhow he needs a D trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: Good play be the expert devalopping Clubs while in E|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|daman: he would have to use his @D K to do that and that would put him at more risk|pg||
nt|jeanhari: open room in 4@S too|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal contract|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: 5@C is also quite safe|pg||
nt|ritong: the small danger is to see opponents bid seven @ss, but who does that in the dark|pg||
nt|raghavan: how could he expect 16 points - all missing high honours with W - For a over call need have this strength. some with E and give trick to WSo Declarer may expect |pg||
nt|haans: @H10 may be a trick|pg||
nt|fann4: People have been known to lead a low @C on auctions like this.|pg||
nt|werge: Is 2 x 14 total for the match - and knock-out?|pg||
nt|haans: hi Doctor|pg||
nt|raghavan: Glad to say Hi again\|pg||
nt|raghavan: Namaste Dr|pg||
nt|haans: same |pg||
nt|panja: hi|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|raghavan: Declarer won first D with Q though could have by 10|pg||
nt|werge: Intermediates are good also|pg||
nt|raghavan: ??|pg||
nt|panja: the bidding after 1Nt was daisypicking..a straight 3nt might have worked|pg||
pc|c9|nt|raghavan: whatever North's idea for covering, it is made easy for W|pg||
nt|oliverc: This seems very improbable :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: declarer would have to make inspired guess to put up Ks to make|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 1/2 NT for me|pg||
nt|xenya: even if he ducks, Rob, it makes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|milton_se: any line i succesful now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in 6 vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 10, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: most don't. Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: lucky clubs 4-3|pg||
nt|rnc: You have a point there undeniably, Hans :)|pg||
nt|haans: ty very kind of you :)))|pg||
nt|werge: Very soon we write 140 - and we all agree with Souths final decision|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: Claiming time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W is caught and must play @d back for a @c discard|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the ruff is with a good trump anyway|pg||
nt|davidstern: ruffing with nat trump trick but he doesnt know who has two hearts and the club ace|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: now also -1 here - strange that Nunes didnt realice that he need to "steal" a @D-trick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kurtove: q of hearts seems like a nice card against 4 sp|pg||
nt|davidstern: So a flat board|pg||
nt|milton_se: surprising|pg||

nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East was endplayed and had to establish 10S or KC|pg||
nt|westjava: so,wd Ru|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well played |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Henri @H@H!|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good result for N/S there|pg||
nt|sybarra2: reds suits not breaking either |pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 1@C or will Shih try 2@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary This deal no problem for 3NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: easy 3N ew here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we'll know in alittle while|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary My Indian team is playing QF - 4 players are my close friends|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent, that also in seniors?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|woozle: I'd open 1S as South barring nice system bids, but that isn't the Japanese Seniors' style|pg||
nt|woozle: 2D looks like some kind of Multi...perhaps awkward for EW to deal with|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: @h shirl & all|pg||
nt|patricck: a good board there for Australia, not only making an extra trick, but EW never found their club fit where they could take 10 tricks themselves|pg||
nt|allanr44: as predicted Nigel.  Hopefully some more challenging situato\ions ,,,Ah, here's one|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kiwibridge: expected 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: NS play 4cM - could be Canape|pg||
nt|westjava: 4 Cards on 3rd hand|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh,ty Lau for info|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no! always 4cM w/Canape|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: That may inure to E/W's benefit.|pg||
nt|raghavan: No in main OPEN|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=11-15, 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C,11-15 min 5 cards may have major|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+ and another transfer response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some can rebid 1N to show 18-19|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i might go to the other room, there is my preferred whipable guy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Patrick, you like a t/o double by Zhuang there?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like 3S for N/S and 3C for E/W|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: that's a benefit of transfer responses|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes can be canape and 2C denies a major|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently Hughes can double with this ordinaire 13-count, so EW shouldn't be robbed|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@S is normal contract for EW|pg||
nt|westjava: might be EW reach to 6@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4C splinter will not encourage East|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Brave reopening double from West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shen will be surprised to see that dummy - and will worry about missing game|pg||
nt|westjava: how about 3nt here??|pg||
nt|raghavan: Since Declarer has 2 checks in other 3 suits, he will try to develop a Club|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I dont like that raise|pg||
mb|3D|nt|westjava: on the way...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: raising with 3 frisky then|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary any Major lead is ok for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi again Henri|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, no other way to get into the auction|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: 4@H has an issue this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: until yet another bad trump split|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: undo pls...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that treatment accept transfer = 2/3 support|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, 1NT would have found clubs but also lets opponents in|pg||
nt|westjava: EW with 23 hcp can do nothing...|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure @H's not friendly |pg||
nt|mariner1: we are not whipable? need remedial training?|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S, 2@H loser|pg||
nt|allanr44: must duck one round|pg||
nt|woozle: But they may bid the wrong game...pretty much everything except a weird spade lead leads to down one, with 3NT impregnable|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yamada made an overtrick on 17, so 1 to Japan.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I have friend here also in all divisions except U21|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: Ru could have upgraded to 1N|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|nigel_k:  This is probably asking for trump queen|pg||
nt|westjava: hard to lead @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we just have to find the spades cash  |pg||
nt|jcwla: For sure W's @H holding would preclude any possibility of being misconstrued as penalty.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: any thing|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: but 4333 in E hand  np|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's hard to see this hand troubling the scorer|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 H tricks + a ruff + 2 Aces +  a possible Club let us see |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: that is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like EW using accept=exactly 3  so 1N rebid=bal with 2 in responder's major|pg||
nt|patricck: who would have pushed who how far after that would have been interesting|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
mb|4H|nt|westjava: and 2NT rebid show 18-19|pg||
nt|mariner1: careful play makes this|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, very hard |pg||
nt|westjava: may be @D lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W a bit lucky that JD is the twelfth trick|pg||
nt|woozle: Neill doubtless wanted to protect his spade holding, but that won't be enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: without a @H lead,yes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@D=ask @SQ+side K, 5@S=@SQ, no side K|pg||
nt|westjava: agree Gary|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: the more i see it, the more i like the treatment where 1N is used to show the "jump 2N" strength|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: uh uh to ruff|pg||

nt|lestergold: too many major suit losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c mandatory at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 3c at green|pg||

nt|newmoon: hello Roland, Hi all   :)|pg||
nt|haans: but east will bid 4@S he can count @H|pg||
nt|haans: but who is prempting|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and that´s why i don´t like D inn this sequence|pg||
nt|werge: This 2 @H is not my cup of coffee|pg||
nt|xenya: well not so hard :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south would love to hearanother double i doubt it tho|pg||
nt|haans: then for sure we play final 14 boards|pg||
nt|lestergold: Levin in tank?|pg||
nt|ronpa: nice lead from bareket but unfortunate for him declarer has no other line then @D finnesse|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: do u know that the X was? - some play that X = 4 card @S and 1@S = 5 card - but X as 5 card @S I have never seen before|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 4@S is criminal|pg||
nt|star6ija: but is very close|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could end here|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure is not a normal RDBL showing count|pg||
nt|daman: nah|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3-6 point less than 4 @d|pg||
nt|panja: either way, if there is no double dummy bias that is evident....we assume it makes single dummy sense|pg||
nt|haans: but it needs to be said sometimes|pg||
nt|rnc: true|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|panja: I guess this well need a trump lead to restrict to 11 tricks...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|haans: trumps lead not popular today do you agree?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he knows something is going on knows pard probably has weak hand with clubs|pg||
nt|werge: Easy - and fast - on that lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: o course can bid 3n gambling if they play it to show this sort of preempt|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will try to find a CC for them|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4NT nat now?|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Sid|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N by South? strange call|pg||
nt|haans: yes all options BUT 2@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 13 tricks here, another 3 imps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|sommer: I would bid 2@H too|pg||
nt|werge: Which confirms my opinion|pg||
nt|mariner1: least not the 10+ .. maybe a neg count|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly, but he has an entry for a @H finesse...|pg||
nt|sybarra: mercifully undoubled |pg||
nt|sharkey: N a little weak in HCP for the second Dbl|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 13 points he could not justify a unilateral further bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north probably lead a diamond|pg||
nt|henryb: I think N-S are relaying|pg||
nt|daman: W might bid 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you get an error by clicking on that link, it's because there are too many hits at the moment. Try again later|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Massimilano so it is neg count|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has exactly one entry to dummy and nothing he does works|pg||
nt|panja: with only once Ace and a void, Balicki is not likely to bid more|pg||
nt|werge: North did´nt want a @S-lead (double...) so now only 100 for 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: they made one on 1|pg||
nt|milton_se: probably their way w GF hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Henry! I only can see it as forcing  for N to show his distribution|pg||
nt|henryb: South|pg||
nt|fann4: Isn't 4@S as 'shut out'ish as can be|pg||
nt|panja: a void in partner's suit...that is|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead and a @H...|pg||
nt|april7: N thinks about how many @H to bid or showing max with the cuebid. At first sight S will be unhappy, but.......|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: Yes N shall show his...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but for me it´s the reversed way|pg||
nt|henryb: presumably N now knows S is 5=5=0=3 with a minimum and 4 controls|pg||
nt|henryb: which makes his hand much less good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bud in my opinnion N has to downgrade his hand with @dAQxx|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would like to see their convention card - How can South proceed on cue bids without much information from N except game force.|pg||
nt|henryb: actually, once S showed 5-5 in the majors at least one of North's queens became wasted|pg||
nt|henryb: not cue bids; North is asking and South is telling|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: found their best spot|pg||
nt|haans: Hi all Welcome all kibitzers|pg||
nt|sharkey: Expect W to have a better @C fit for his 2@D cue bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: his suit is the same one his righty opened|pg||
nt|werge: First step...|pg||
nt|werge: North MUST play the Jack - otherwise West KNOWS, who has the @S Queen!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: First three in each group will qualify for Swiss A after 5 rounds Rest will play in Swiss B |pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: X = 4+ @ss - 1@S = max 3 card @S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sid :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h is in fact better than 4@s on S.|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure about N's 4@H though|pg||
nt|xenya: so probably down anyway |pg||
nt|xenya: but we shall see|pg||
nt|mariner1: W would have been better off ducking that @D to let E in|pg||
nt|mariner1: now W has Zugzwang'd himself a bit|pg||
nt|rnc: ...for a @S-shift|pg||
nt|xenya: a @S now beats it for certain|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead difficult on @H not|pg||
nt|werge: With East as declarer, the lead of @H 3 would bring some trouble, I think|pg||
nt|werge: But for sure a @C-lead also|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 16 Vito got 11 IMP as here 5H-1 and OR 4H+1|pg||
nt|haans: yep costly|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about that for taking a deep breath and praying |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sommer: agree|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 overtricks it seems|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|wwalter: this was a sweet lead 4 declar :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Information.htm   only website I have |pg||
nt|xenya: is there a sure line for 10 tricks here? |pg||
nt|henryb: sure? I don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean without seeing NS's cards of course|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil NS going as you feared to 6C - The X oD will not discourage|pg||
nt|werge: 11 IMP|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho maybe not third in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: depend on style|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like claim will follow quickly|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to play transfers after overcall so X= @s transfer|pg||
nt|henryb: He said: spades, spades and hearts, hearts at least 5, 5=5=0=3|pg||
nt|werge: Take a look at the bidding in OR - and you get one MORE reason NOT to bid 2 @H|pg||
nt|xenya: not much to the play here it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: N had to remain silent..then, E might not go for game|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably end up with 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dcbutler: 9 tricks for declarer on any lead with this layout|pg||
nt|haans: that has been mpore and more popular|pg||
nt|raghavan: X of D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The slam is roughly 50% and bid at many tables|pg||
nt|haans: what do you think about that lead?|pg||
nt|rnc: This works also, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: so does the @D, as it happens |pg||
nt|mariner1: now W has a real problem|pg||
nt|davidstern: North profile (assuming it is Godefroy) http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=6234 Fantun http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=20158|pg||
nt|rnc: East's @D7 is a good card|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers calling for W to chuck Q@H under AKh|pg||
nt|xenya: one pf the best, yes|pg||
nt|werge: Hi - a @C-lead would be a good start on this monday|pg||
nt|werge: Seems to end up with uninteresting 450|pg||
nt|haans: but would have still be a make|pg||
nt|werge: Dummy is shouting: HEART-SHIFT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As they say - the only way is the best way - finesse only option|pg||
pc|h3|nt|charles_l: helpful|pg||
nt|ritong: although he knows south has a @s top|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is not a good hand for those who subscribe to "always lead an ace against a slam"|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Sid|pg||
nt|haans: yes need clubs support to bid on|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Bakker did not open |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: S did not seem to have any doubt|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower has certainly seen Apteker's preempts before...  I am surprised here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|newmoon: hi fellow commentators  :)|pg||
nt|henryb: this contract needs the @cK on, the hearts 3-2 and a spade guess. about 20% and it will not make|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf  What is ur opinion of fulfilling the cotract? |pg||
nt|ralfwil: No chace with that lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and makable with a @d lead, if he finds @sQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can ruff the 3rd @s and cash @cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: S should realize why @S have not been led yet|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk5: @SA would be the only card to let it through|pg||
nt|milton_se: about 48 (stiff S lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: you need 3-2 @S to make, so...|pg||
nt|april7: I.H. is now loughing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: In OR Reess opened the S hand 3@D, then 4@C by N -- E/W have been pushed to 5@S, a bridge too far.|pg||
nt|ady: west really has the hand for a suit contract  evedn if 2 tricks higher  good controls   but only 1 spade stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: since she clearly has a light opening|pg||
nt|rnc: With no bad breaks, this will bring a 10 home for O'Rourke levelling the match|pg||
nt|xenya: or perhpas you can also cope with 4 spades with N|pg||
nt|haans: dummy has nothing to shout about |pg||
nt|werge: But time enough, I think|pg||
nt|werge: Oh-yes - because East has the @C-entry, it´s over for the defence|pg||
nt|don paulus: on board 2 E opened 2 nt - and 3 nt by W with long @d - made !|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|raghavan: run Hearts |pg||
nt|raghavan: needs some Diamond discards from Opp|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: key moment|pg||
nt|rnc: Must hold on to his hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: likely 2 off now|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club throw in|pg||
nt|mariner1: E does not need @S|pg||
nt|haans: we have to few que asking bid an other suit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb: surely best to strip minors before playing a heart in case someone (particularly South) has a stiff @hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess you take a deep breath and try the spade hook  |pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Will still make with @HA @HK and low heart|pg||
nt|nubmaster: but difficult with 44 M's, what to bid?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jeanhari: ruffing diamonds in dummy reating some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|haans: would it not be better to play @SK first???|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|werge: But many of us play, that this lead might be from Q-10-9-8|pg||
nt|haans: opps missed it is @H|pg||
mc|11|nt|don paulus: that's what i expected NS to do here - bid 5|pg||

nt|jcwla: N/S seem to have an aggressive style and so far it seems to have inured to their benefit.|pg||
nt|allanr44: best line for north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- but the auction wasn't impressive at all|pg||
nt|woozle: South will get to open a strong notrump in fourth seat|pg||
nt|raghavan: EW getting good hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard for W to double I suppose....|pg||
nt|raghavan: But N claim up with HA ruff diamond for 1 down - EW make 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14-17|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@S NS|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes -50 is very good for N/S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Another 8 card suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe there will be more bidding than yesterday's one :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores only here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard for east because he won't place partner with a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|allanr44: many tricks for EW here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: big @C - then how may @S from Bojoh?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|westjava: perhaps the same other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 41H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 41h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@h|pg||
nt|patricck: that was another 20 point game, but much more difficult to bid than board 1, and needed a little more luck to make as well|pg||
nt|allanr44: that is true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going slow with 1@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H just makes mybr 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may land in 3NT |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 3N yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: E migth saw this one off|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=1-suit  @H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: Thai leads the way now|pg||
nt|westjava: and 4@S N..!:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in a couple of @D I think|pg||
nt|patricck: aah, the first board, which was board 17 of course|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will work to be in 4 @S |pg||
nt|westjava: much better with opening point|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe trying to get X's|pg||
nt|woozle: If Hughes bids over that, EW may reach a dire contract unless they can sort out their diamond firt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hate that double! VUL|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: A VIEW i wouldn't favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H/@S overcall would be 4M & 5+minor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North does have a good hand but slam is a long way off and the diamonds are a worry|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @S bid keeps S from balancing|pg||
nt|jcwla: The Duplimate has split the points between the pairs very evenly.|pg||
nt|westjava: now 4@H on the way|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes stays quiet with a tempting hand. At least he probably has a plan for his lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not the right hand to interfere.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|westjava: if not Capp or DONT,what's the name of 2@D by N..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I assume she was considering a heart slam not a spade game|pg||
nt|sybarra: rightly so |pg||
pc|h4|nt|westjava: all VUL and 1@S pass out|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead makes this easier|pg||
nt|westjava: a lovely lady of @H|pg||
nt|allanr44: hard to miss, with a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S means 5@H then a decision|pg||
pc|h8|nt|raghavan: Spade 8 and 9 are very valuable cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all suits favour declarer even @S|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Patrick, would 3@D over 1@D be your choice with Nunn's hand?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's been a while since I saw someone not open a balanced 11|pg||
nt|woozle: Both majors makes it very tempting, but the thin suit quality could work very badly|pg||
nt|raghavan: But has gained now -makes 3 with spade ruff|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: as the card lie 2 and even 3@H has play NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 3 or 4 now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: win Q@H and lead @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|westjava: also not Brozel's|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|patricck: it depends what it means in Tony's system|pg||
nt|patricck: I like to bounce the opponents around too, so if playing solid intermediate jumps, would make the bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Wow|pg||
nt|allanr44: 7 is on the hook.  depends on the trailing team|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: @H and a minor:)|pg||
nt|westjava: may be:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it looks a bit like Woolsey where 2@D="multi" but Kit's version DBL covers the 4M & 5+minor so 2M overcall = 5M+@C/@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: there are several NT defenses that use transfers|pg||
nt|bebechira: on 18..EW bid to 7 NT in the open room...so 2 IMPS to China HK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|woozle: 1NT will make two, losing a spade and four diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|allanr44: strange|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mmm helpful|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|westjava: different plan|pg||
pc|sK|nt|westjava: I am using Brozel's with my pd, 2@D = @D and @H|pg||
nt|westjava: @D,end of def|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|patricck: their system card just says intermediate jumps when vul....certainly was a good one, but needed to be with the hand partner had|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nigel_k:  Looking for a fourth trick I guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: needed to lead @c at trick 2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as we sort of expected, still no great loss|pg||
pc|s4|nt|westjava: sure,why not..?:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: too late shift to Trump|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|allanr44: It did not occur to me that the contract would be 4@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West should expect to take 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bojoh would have been better off passing at first turn then he would know needed to 'save'|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: for max result|pg||
pc|dA|nt|westjava: loser on loser|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good line and should be able to make three trump tricks now|pg||

nt|nubmaster: And Meckstroth-Rodwell got to 3NT last deal with K single to Axxxxx in @c...|pg||
nt|sharkey: they usually don't underbid|pg||
nt|afulton: i knew i woke up too early... this is either dream or nightmare! |pg||
nt|sybarra: (from the xxx hand)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ady: 4@S  too high at the vulnerability for n/s   even if guessing the minor suits well|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont happen much on this deal either|pg||
nt|haans: no boring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 8 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|daman: Garner will get frisky here|pg||
nt|haans: board 4|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|sybarra: X pls|pg||
nt|werge: o children at this table now, pls|pg||
nt|werge: No|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is pass forcing |pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe north might have passed with a stiff in his pard suit and a 3 count|pg||
nt|panja: 4@h will be interesting on B18|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 @c asking for 5crd major ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@c by S = ??????|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It is not this board|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome to misfit corner|pg||
nt|jcwla: Leslie likes this auction so far.|pg||
nt|ritong: won t happen|pg||
nt|aupillon: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play X= strength vs weak NT|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces now nowdays :)))|pg||
nt|rnc: And with spades 4-1 North would probably have tried to tap declarer by continuing hearts|pg||
nt|daman: with his @C void|pg||
nt|jeanhari: thats looks forcing to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: or @H lead and win 2@H with no @c shirt|pg||
nt|rnc: Will be hard to stay out from 3NT|pg||
nt|werge: 3 X @S - ouf|pg||
nt|werge: I think we are waiting for West, nor South!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|charles_l: 2@c must be drury|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: in cl|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H my bid|pg||
nt|kurtove: 7 cl|pg||
nt|hedyg: vs strong double would be 5m+4M|pg||
nt|milton_se: easy now|pg||
nt|kurtove: and now its easy|pg||
nt|haans: none nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: if so they get too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: shift|pg||
nt|haans: sure fast|pg||
nt|werge: Now E/W look more dutch to me...|pg||
nt|werge: A fair 6 @H|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt has been on the agenda for 80 years but strong nt still more popular|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt or 5@C|pg||
nt|haans: no spade lead in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: no spade from South|pg||
nt|ronpa: so the indian team has started this set very well|pg||
nt|ronpa: not missing 9876|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm they may well miss their heart fit|pg||
nt|newmoon: took 4@S as a cue?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they yook wrong way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c for me|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s seems very conservative, but driving to 3@s seems like a lot|pg||
nt|raghavan: Will HQ be the lead?|pg||
nt|rnc: For sure - they are Polish :)|pg||
nt|werge: not South|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well brave effort by west with 7 count|pg||
nt|dcbutler: not at this vul|pg||
nt|ritong: now west has a serious problem|pg||
nt|ritong: his part showed a good limit raise |pg||
nt|dcbutler: wonder how much 2NT showed?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   looked enough with that collection|pg||
nt|ritong: agreed|pg||
nt|dcbutler: looks like a mixed raise (at best) to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oliver can you explain the bidding - I could not understand what is 2Club by S?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead in any case|pg||
nt|haans: we do not have their cc|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think they will make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes @H lead and it looks good|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: IT IS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I'll say, both aces on side, the qj of @H flopping |pg||
nt|xenya: VERY well, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: would this bid not show a stronger hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ady: east hoping for the best here  QJ spades look poor values on the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: was 4@H fast arrival (negative bid) ?|pg||
nt|haans: why not start with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: trouble:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pre empts creat problem - that is what is intended|pg||
nt|newmoon: makes sense, Hans  :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is matter of style, but...|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|davidstern: As long as declarer doesnt try a spade to then|pg||
nt|davidstern: ten|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S 2@H 4@D and it makes in no @c shift|pg||
nt|davidstern: But if declarer plays hearts straigh back there will be a smell in the air|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but it will not be clear to N what it is from|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer's best play @HK and low club to hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think win @H and play one back is it|pg||
nt|davidstern: That will certainly get a club ace shift I suspect|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bet not :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table finessed @S10 I am told|pg||
nt|mariner1: i n@@o 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: if declarer plays @Ds now, it shouldn't be difficult for N to work things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|rnc: If win and continue hearts, doesn't it looks like you have fast tricks? Just need a second @H-trick. Then the @C-shift is more likely to come|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Guess there will be some talk here|pg||
nt|sybarra: the tap will start on trick one, I thought |pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 @d = 1 4crd major - no 5crd|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: tre other 3 hand = the bidding, but S??|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe South's 2@C shows both majors, but West doesn't care|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|pelu: or dont know? - if opp alert 2@C u dont exp both majors .)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: We had a problem at the begin, they switched Open and Closed Room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in the Open. This match is from the women's event although the banner reads Open Teams|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT you should always bid - and beat. 5 @C is easy - without the @S-lead, which Easts 1 @S-bid has avoided|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
nt|ritong: danger zone entered|pg||
nt|ady: yes    too high now|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@c is not possible because it is forcing to game (artificial in their methods)|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in trouble now|pg||
nt|werge: Less than 1100 seems to deserve the commentaire: WELL played |pg||
nt|panja: establishment bias....|pg||
nt|haans: perhaps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: and he will make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I was away a minute|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it a weak opening in a Major?  and 2H by N is pass or correct?|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sounds like it|pg||
nt|xenya: i could make this contract|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now will he pas this dbl?|pg||
nt|daman: the 3@S bid was uncalled for|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must be|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: how about a @C?|pg||
nt|mariner1: thinking too long also gives them a signal|pg||
nt|fann4: Ew in 3NT in the CR, making on a @S lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E is going to hate this|pg||
nt|werge: But 3 NT by East OK|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|haans: 13 hcp for opps|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by S - also 5D makes but this 4H is a trial on way to 5D|pg||
nt|haans: but will it make?|pg||
nt|werge: Problem in 6 @H is, that you have "some" possibilities in the @S-suit, in 6 NT it´s easy play = double finesse|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Morning Hans x 2 and Martin|pg||
nt|haans: morning Roland|pg||
nt|werge: - and you go down in 6 NT, I think 6 @H makes easiily|pg||
nt|werge: Morning Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
nt|haans: yeah need only 1 ruff|pg||
nt|panja: there are a lot of trade barriers etc. in bridge, too|pg||
nt|werge: West|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: But all in all, the auction could have been considerably worse.  This spot is reasonable if perhaps not ideal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he didnt know he would find partner with 100 honours in dims|pg||
nt|haans: may be 10-12 nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: W not happy about the pull here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must know his partner has stretched|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may pass 4D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if E tries to reason out the cards it should show him W has a @c stack,,,,,,|pg||
nt|werge: I take every bet, that this board will be a swing - and I have NOT seen it played in OR!|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe a talk about making inappropriate noises with a pile of festering garbage|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has good coverage of other 3 suits - prefers 3 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H in Open |pg||
nt|haans: and its a make|pg||
nt|afulton: everything works on this... next hand? |pg||
pc|c5|nt|raghavan: a good lead 1H+3Spades + atleast 1 minor K|pg||
nt|rnc: Me too...|pg||
nt|sommer: like a walk in the park:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but normaly south should have some fit for bidding 3@S in second round|pg||
nt|daman: if you live by the sword you should be prepared to die by the sword and pass 4@C doubled|pg||
nt|haans: i do not bet against you here :)))|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt and support x do not mix|pg||
nt|werge: One down is good bridge|pg||
nt|haans: when S gets in trouble|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am getting loads of private messages and can't respond to them all. BBO does *not* decide which matches we get, so approach the EBL if you are unhappy about no match from the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Open in this set|pg||
nt|ronpa: did declarer really played @H?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: this should be a useful swing to Neve|pg||
nt|kurtove: do they play 2 club as gf?|pg||
nt|mariner1: same play here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still need club now though|pg||
nt|davidstern: North can divine that declarer is looking for ninth trick and might get aggressive|pg||
nt|xenya: can postpone that|pg||
nt|mariner1: now N knows W has the @H's|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think North will get this right|pg||
nt|davidstern: He knows declarer likely has 3 spades and four diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N in fact made on 3 so 7 imps to Herbst|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will give north due credit if he does it but I wouldnt think it is defence of the year material|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @S finesse looks a reasonable play|pg||
nt|mariner1: the other problem is if N plays A@C what are S's signals?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am betting @CA next|pg||
nt|xenya: at least it's the only legitimate chance to make -- or nearly so|pg||
nt|rnc: and this seems to go one off|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither|pg||
nt|sharkey: I don't know why Hamson didn't just bid 3@C Vul - which should show a fairly big hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: YES|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: S doesn't know that, of course -- from her perspectibe, contract mau be in real danger |pg||
nt|henryb: this is not worth a 15-17 1N (I do not know their range) and Jx is not a holding you particularly want to have as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5422 pattern  (yuck) |pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has already his 2 suiter hand If W still doubles, E must respect w decision|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Zia bidding immediatly as south|pg||
nt|sharkey: especially if the have Good/Bad 2 NT available|pg||
nt|werge: Not best defence this - but who cares...?|pg||
nt|haans: had Qx in ps suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: he thought his qx of spade was working bwecause his partner had bid spades VULNERABLE agaibnst not to boot|pg||
nt|sharkey: still - 5 level?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: the spot is ok its just the layout which is savage of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|ritong: hello G|pg||
nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: looks like I missed some action already|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, first boards swinged|pg||
nt|daman: this will swing too    doomed|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not neutral either, rite|pg||
nt|daman: aggressive bidding by West opposite a passed hand   will pay the price|pg||
nt|rnc: And it's not the Jurassic one this time|pg||
nt|werge: Better @D back - and uppercut with @C 9|pg||
nt|haans: x men 15-19 hcp bid something|pg||
nt|haans: balanced hand|pg||
nt|haans: how many understand me?|pg||
nt|panja: this 3Nt might not be all that simple...|pg||
nt|lesrays: surely not?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk5: The most notable fact is that Team Lavazza did not qualify for Swiss A and that they won't qualify for the knockout phase either. They are currently 28th in Swiss B|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: a classical way to only loose 1 @s trick. a small from the table to 7 and next @sQ pinning the @sJ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well I was half right but -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done Godefory|pg||
nt|davidstern: Godefroy|pg||
nt|mariner1: small @c works too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's good enough - 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree too far but his pard was bonkers on this occasion|pg||
nt|haans: yes not  best defense|pg||
nt|nubmaster: always difficult play in def with a lot of high cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are still a number of diamond pips which will have something to say shortly|pg||
nt|werge: My guess: We are waiting for SOUTH now...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|xenya: sigh of relief from S|pg||
nt|xenya: now she will be quick to grab 11 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: W in 3N in Open Room here|pg||
nt|fann4: E must play 3 rounds of @H to promote West's @SK|pg||
nt|afulton: south could have trusted luck and made 6... may STILL make 6|pg||
nt|lesrays: sorry, :)|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 aces for defense|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcwla: In the OR W passed the 2@C rebid and Hinden went -2 for -200.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Leslie knows that preventing spade ruffs more important than worrying about trump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: in most natral systems the ability to show heart suit in  a weak hand would not exist|pg||
nt|ampelman: my version is from july 2008|pg||
nt|hedyg: the players all had give in their CCs before play started, shame we have no access to them|pg||
pc|s3|nt|raghavan: 4 Spades, 5D making but did not stop|pg||
nt|sommer: but no overtrick with @Sshift|pg||
nt|panja: I don't....|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: I think we were waiting for W |pg||
nt|werge: Sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: notice they have not tapped declarer yet |pg||
nt|haans: u really think??????????????|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: We dont know, but asume that West didnt know :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised to see they play 2@c as weak both majors as they are not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||
nt|haans: fantunes then did they make it?|pg||
nt|don paulus: it's going really fast for Herbst ) they bid slam on previous board - 1 off|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|april7: N might steel a @D playing toward Q|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: Apparently, NS play Dwururka - the Little major like system developed by Pazur|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's going on?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: renonce by west director on table|pg||
nt|jeanhari: such dull board, operator must com into action !:)|pg||
nt|haans: i think Heller say 1 trick for @HK|pg||
nt|sybarra: but now may be the time |pg||
pc|d3|nt|kurtove: 2 cl not GF|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: can claim that now|pg||
nt|lestergold: good defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Mu sequence had been 1@s - 2@c 2@d - 2@s - P. 2@s had promised a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes nice swing here|pg||
nt|rnc: I have not read the conditions of contest, but if it's the same procedure as in the Mixed Teams there is an advantage in finishing on top since you have some choosing possibilities ...|pg||
nt|rnc: for the KO-match.|pg||
nt|panja: this might turn out to be a good sac against 3Nt|pg||
nt|haans: squeeze?|pg||
nt|haans: may be best play in 4nt|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes W squeezed in @D and @Ss|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 off?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1400 any takers?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: now the trump trick is still there!! and all the spades too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi yer  Bill|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of rebidding 1NT with the E hand.  Certainly reasonable to rebid 2@C (as both did) with nine cards in two suits, but 1NT would have worked like a charm here to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: allow E/W to drop dead in 2@H.|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill.|pg||
nt|milton_se: killing lead though|pg||
nt|ronpa: giving up overtricks in a close match might be something u'll be sorry for doing at the end|pg||
nt|lesrays: obviously playing to get ruff and sluff - but E was up to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: now the pitch could potentially be in wrong hand |pg||
nt|ronpa: and this indian team knows it well, they won 2 matches in overtime already|pg||

nt|westjava: the new leader with 1 imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost a BAM game |pg||
nt|westjava: again, battle of part score|pg||
nt|allanr44: a serious loss, vul|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Possibly East denied both minor aces but looking at the West hand that is unrealistic|pg||
nt|allanr44: Give me AK A, and partners 2@C, there is no way short of slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we have potential for double game swing|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,4@S was a very good save|pg||
nt|westjava: and make..!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Assume partner's better holding is a not-great holding in your worse suit and if the contract might be ridiculous, don't suggest it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here @H's would be ridiculous - if could suggest @D's and @S's at the 2 level (DONT or some such), maybe, but even then I don't think it computes to an interfering hand.|pg||
nt|woozle: quite often, 2 of your best fit will make, as will 1NT...it's just a question of whether you;ll find your best fit|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 2 a push = both 3NT made 3|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be a part score deal |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW in 4@S here I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who I vote for hee|pg||
nt|sybarra: *hrere|pg||
nt|sybarra: *here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  partscore swing to China on the second board - they made 2C at the other table and 2S here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: doesnt it make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=0-10, 5+@S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcwla: A flat looking 3NT here.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: 6@S is too much with @c ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: 6@S down by @C lead:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to hope they do not WIN it|pg||
nt|allanr44: Maybe it is a home ground advantage?|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@S loose only 1@H and 2@C, is'nt it??|pg||
nt|woozle: Hirata with a very fine hand, but 3NT may still be a bit of work|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 18, where E/W here played 4@S down 2, they stopped in all of 3@C - which had the virtue of making - 5 more to Japan.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: true that contract is also there|pg||
nt|sybarra: fingers should not do the walking  obviously |pg||
mb|2C|nt|nigel_k:  Are they playing uphill and into the wind in the first half?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not a fan of overcalling 2C on that sort of hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor me |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: here is same, never overcall this w/5332 and poor @C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: 3@D a nice nuetral spot for all|pg||
nt|westjava: for -1, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra2: someone has to have a @H stop |pg||
nt|westjava: first blood to Indonesia from   1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very nice bid from Bojoh|pg||
mb|3C|nt|westjava: Thai gain 8 imps from   2, play only 3@H|pg||
nt|westjava: @D lead..??|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but probably a frustrating start for the chinese pair, they have already defended 4 making contracts in 4 boards, this is going to be the 5th|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: a good stop|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT not my choice to show this hand but nothing much matters here.|pg||
nt|patricck: what would you like Jordan?|pg||
nt|allanr44: In Wellington?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Into the wind in Wellington you'd be worried about game going down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 tricks the limit here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: You're right Patrick, defense is "a trick harder on every hand" and even if the boards are flat, it just doesn't "feel" great to defend making contract after making contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|allanr44: you'd be worrying about survival!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Fred welcome |pg||
nt|idblu: ge all :)|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C might be defeated, and 4S had excellent play...I know which way I'd rather go|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agreed.|pg||
nt|woozle: Anyway, back to the current hand...apparently Hughes leads third best from this holding|pg||
nt|jcwla: W is not going to have fun discarding here|pg||
nt|woozle: Declarer has eight easy tricks (two clubs, four diamonds, two hearts) and may or may not find a ninth|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2NT.|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS gets a game board - 3NT makes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|westjava: but enough tricks for decl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway 2NT here looks ok, concede a heart and make three hearts, three clubs, a spade and a diamond|pg||
pc|d7|nt|raghavan: Yes Gary |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: I was thinking small @c back hoping S has A@D and will cash and lead one|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Fred:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sets up the 1 trumptrick :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: For the specs:  Wellington NZ is known for its breezes   :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|woozle: two discards (small spades) are easy...the third discard is harder; heart is best - declarer might not pick it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: One overtrick IMP to China in 4@S on 17.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Can she find KH now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: if trust E @ST, always @HK|pg||
nt|patricck: close I guess, must be worth somewhere between 2 and 3 and it is a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh pd wants to be there as much as I do.  When we aren't there is the rare time we definitely don't want to be there.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, vwd|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: nice|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, easy nine tricks. Should be flat.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4H E/W has some chances but is very thin|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|d3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: next pl |pg||
nt|mariner1: 8@C asked for the @H switch which was also reasonable|pg||
pc|c5|nt|westjava: @S for @H loser now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|patricck: So you believe in conservative invitations because partner is an aggressive accepter?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|woozle: Declarer hasn't given himself any chance here...down one|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nigel_k:  Actually East will be squeezed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|westjava: yup:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well this line has the virtue of saving time.|pg||
nt|woozle: If the diamonds are played out, West does well to pitch a heart early, not as the last pitch...but here he was untested|pg||
nt|woozle: Australia's first good board|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary I have a question - In New Zealand do u always use Pre dealt computer hands - I ask always? |pg||
nt|raghavan: I see the cards and say makes 11|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nigel_k:  His best hope is partner with 9D|pg||
nt|westjava: making is enough,decl claim:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
nt|allanr44: this is very ordinary ...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  he does have a guess as North could have six spades and clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|allanr44: -3?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pretty well always at both club and tournament level|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: I'd say always yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: an awful bid reaps its reward|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately East didn't play another spade so they'll have to settle for +300|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then continuing clubs would be correct and fall back on the heart finesse if clubs don't break|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: 3 down sorry :)|pg||
nt|daman: easy @S game now   a breather|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 3 - again IMP to Welland - OPEN room bid 3NT made 5 |pg||
nt|oliverc: if one has say 4 + spades is suppose to bid 1 D - 2 below actual call :) So 1C = 4 +|pg||
nt|oliverc: H. So presumably 2@C was a weak 2 in Hearts|pg||
nt|werge: Solid game - bad slam, but both can make|pg||
nt|raghavan: deal 24 5 IMP to Welland - 2h made here, 1NT made by team mates|pg||
nt|mariner1: another misfit here|pg||
nt|davidstern: I bet not|pg||
nt|mariner1: sometimes thinking just alerts the opponents|pg||
nt|davidstern: Defence always wary when declarer plays to establish tricks in your suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would take your money David :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: BRB|pg||
nt|rnc: Did|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The 5 teams from the Swiss will be numbered 28-32|pg||
nt|mcarroll: For Squeeze needed to cash @Cs first|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see 3nt making here|pg||
nt|sharkey: possibly Hans|pg||
nt|werge: No 1400 here, maybe 400|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i thing the swing will be bigger than  the hangman's rope|pg||
nt|werge: Ups - no slam|pg||
nt|haans: bye|pg||
nt|haans: :( it was that close :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and now............toilette break....................|pg||
nt|werge: A shaky 6 @S here|pg||
nt|haans: 2 finesses = 25% |pg||
nt|werge: It´s slightly better, 37,5 or so|pg||
nt|haans: always  a little below|pg||
nt|werge: One finesse is a "double" one|pg||
nt|haans: tell me sometimes what is 'double' on (not now)|pg||
nt|haans: one|pg||
nt|ronpa: so lengy scores his first 2 imps of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Buddy Shah|pg||
nt|april7: E should haqve known that W has no point|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if east bids 6@S, Sabine had better lead the right ace!|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6C for EW|pg||
nt|aupillon: stop before 4 spades ? :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: sort of|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Swiss B that is|pg||
nt|haans: sweden closing |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: the push to 5@H on the last cost 10 big ones|pg||
nt|werge: In OR, they were caught by their RKC-1430 or so|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi buddy wlc|pg||
nt|buddyshah: great start by Herbst|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brgpro: looks like 12 tricks in @s for E. why? well, you tend to lead from your short AK....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so Badger's on the board with 3.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 down how come i missed something obviously|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@C/@D by EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: but not a good slam|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt good prempt|pg||
nt|aupillon: now minor slam in progress ...|pg||
nt|kurtove: 5 club|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely changed their system, last year this was 20-21|pg||
nt|aupillon: try 4 spades, a Splinter bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 23 here NS 3NT-2, in OR 4D made so welland gets 8 IMP|pg||
nt|newmoon: they should get to 6@H here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@D must show the majors here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: really he alerts pass ...............|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S a novel biddding|pg||
nt|buddyshah: hi Avram|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but not when west has shown hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: the vulnerability should deter EW from sacrificing|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Bergen now?|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d would a tad pushy|pg||
nt|milton_se: doesn't look like that :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: only H lead sets 6C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that means that after  - alt least - 1@s opening it´s impossible to play 1nt|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to stop in 1N|pg||
nt|werge: Board 18 was perfect for playing behind screens|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S as a weak bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: as he now surely will|pg||
nt|ritong: be*|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in fact north pass :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S best contract|pg||
nt|haans: or 21D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For E/W anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@H looks the limit on good defense|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, 12 tricks in 4@S with a good view|pg||
nt|raghavan: D bid showing both majors |pg||
nt|mariner1: problem is N might think they need to guard over tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: very true, Rob, but N shouldn't be caught sleeping here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well as I said, thinking that long alerts the opponent that there is an issue|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - found out too late 2 Keycards missing|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: ok - maybe he won't get the chance|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I raise,  wonder if 2 @S or 3 H! is better |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H |pg||
nt|don paulus: ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The club layout might see this one home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here game to be bid but both 3n and 4h look precarious on thelayout|pg||
nt|pelu: 11-14 5-5 in m|pg||
nt|haans: not an easy make  4-1 in @H|pg||
nt|newmoon: Zia's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|haans: only @CK right|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h possible here, even though the trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bd 2 hot wines get 12   and Bd 3 - Zeleski get 10 IMP |pg||
nt|henryb: that is correct. its not my choice but it would be the most common over here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Running scores are back|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass might be 5-7 count|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will make on B15, but 4@H in 43 fit, yet again, might be a better spot a priori|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, W made an immediate 2@S wjo|pg||
nt|lesrays: it was a donation, not a score|pg||
nt|ronpa: will north dbl for lead?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
nt|oliverc: Apparently 2@C was 4+5+ in the Majors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will bid 3 I presume|pg||
nt|jeanhari: too late for predictions :)|pg||
nt|haans: yes prepared to stretch|pg||
nt|werge: NOW Wests hand nis very BIG...|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So Bessis on the board|pg||
nt|haans: icedlandic pecision perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men då kan jag påpeka att typ ägg typ inte är helt rätt...|pg||
nt|werge: or 2 of them...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Some play X as 5-7 and pass is <4|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might bid 2@S here..... and play in a Moysian a level lower|pg||
nt|panja: did they end up in 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: even less now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: trtue|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|werge: 480 - flat|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|milton_se: the reasonable contract|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|aupillon: sure,clubs 2/2, diamonds 2/2....|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some|pg||
nt|werge: Because of @H Queen|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR they bid and made 4H in deal 18 so Sweeden got 10 IMP It is 35 against 36 - tough fight|pg||
nt|rnmalik: after DBL 1@S could be only 4+|pg||
nt|april7: S took away W's bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I am getting some tea|pg||
nt|ritong: showing @ds and @ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: very fat 2C -- may be hard to communicate|pg||
nt|jeanhari: should help enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: with limited access to dummy this helps solve one issue|pg||
nt|rnc: Zimmerman 16 VPs ahead of Apteker going into this round, 13 VPs ahead of 2nd (Jacob), so it's odds on for Zimmerman winning the Swiss A|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes, Helness jumped straight to 3NT|pg||
nt|werge: Better take your 300 against 2 @S X|pg||
nt|haans: adrenaline high now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levin/Hamson need to forget the last and regroup|pg||
nt|sybarra: W transfering back to @H's|pg||
nt|ronpa: missed his chance|pg||
mb|3D|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s would be an egregious overbid|pg||
nt|ritong: bergen style not popular in france|pg||
nt|daman: merci|pg||
nt|daman: quatre piques fait cing ici|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|daman: cinq*|pg||
nt|ritong: joli , G|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table North playing 3@D on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Precision is SO much easier to understand LOL|pg||
nt|newmoon: swop @H8 and @H7, and it gets difficult    :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: missed... 1@s overcall slightly misleaded them|pg||
nt|lestergold: but w wont forget it in a hurry|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer shouldn't be given a chance to get a spade away from either hand on a long minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt must be lebesohl|pg||
nt|haans: leben|pg||
nt|raghavan: good lead |pg||
nt|milton_se: only +1 now|pg||
nt|raghavan: there are 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|newmoon: panel - response to 1@C?   1@D or 1@H ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: not to be|pg||
nt|werge: Has´nt West not just a 4 @H over 2 @H - 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another imp available here|pg||
nt|afulton: the double would have gained them an imp! |pg||
nt|april7: best is if S passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3@H for me too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's one (of many) reasons why Meckwell usually play so fast|pg||
nt|mariner1: the VUL position makes this tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow saly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hans you havent seen commentators manual Page 4 Paragraph 7 - we save bandwidth and do not correct minor typos|pg||
nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: May lose 1-2-2-1|pg||
nt|davidstern: For -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H not played could have developped 1 more in D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks quite normal though -- and makeable|pg||
nt|panja: @ST or small lead?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But the temptation of the Vulnerable game is hard to resist|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - even 500 is easy to get|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if south didnt find a spade lead there is no way he wouldnt find the switch when in with Kc|pg||
nt|kurtove: if he entres the table|pg||
nt|davidstern: That lead looks helpful but if he puts up @CJ and finesses heart will prove a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D down in other room|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: common now  1@D transfer :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 9 top tricks - 1S + 4H +3D + 1c  more may come by CK finesse etc|pg||
nt|newmoon: Kib says "guess this is a good example for walsh even on a good hand."|pg||
nt|haans: i would show my hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sure west should show Hearts  |pg||
nt|newmoon: well... whatever, this match is based on "winning on the opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@d,3@s and jump (which King will be chosen?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s|pg||
nt|haans: specs have that nowt so far?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get dicey |pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: salam|pg||
nt|haans: may be sad when he finds out no extra @H-trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|charles_l: no takers :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: making 12 now|pg||
nt|haans: standard is to bid @D only with longer @D|pg||
nt|nubmaster: make now...|pg||
nt|sharkey: not anymore Shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the old days we led fourth best from north's holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: now we block the suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: life just got better for sure|pg||
nt|buddyshah: looks like -1 on 8@C lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|star6ija: @s Jack could be ducked now and black squeeze after that for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: nooo|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3@H does seem on|pg||
nt|mariner1: making is worth an imp|pg||
nt|werge: But here, the "right" hand is asking|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: un autre pique|pg||
nt|daman: un carreau est faible|pg||
nt|daman: that's my frendh for today|pg||
nt|daman: French*|pg||
nt|haans: weak jump increase @CA in east|pg||
nt|haans: good double|pg||
nt|haans: yes but old days never morre|pg||
nt|sybarra: but declarer doesnt know that |pg||
nt|april7: trump is best now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: or dim if thats the way declarer plays it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H by E would have been relay|pg||
nt|milton_se: in fact 2 (J dropping)|pg||
nt|haans: ame squeeze|pg||
nt|haans: sme|pg||
nt|haans: same|pg||
nt|star6ija: still possible, yup|pg||
nt|lestergold: new days that old guys like me dont understan that well|pg||
nt|haans: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer did well to grab it|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt need a spade switch of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the good old black will save another slam before it sinks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@H problem solved now EW will play 5@H|pg||
nt|werge: - which will bring 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|aupillon: aha|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: yes ruff 3x@c disc @D - ruff @D ruff @h and u will have 12 tricks in the end|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: with the @SJ in the S hand, this is foolproof |pg||
nt|rnc: And Herbst needs them badly for qualifying|pg||

nt|werge: Yes - 500 in instead of out looks reasonable|pg||
nt|werge: Declarers 1st trick - come on...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Meckwell in 4@hx EW last deal...|pg||
nt|raghavan: No problem for 1 NT = 5C+ HA+SA |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=16  for running scores|pg||
nt|brgpro: one spec. asked me if the ladies have sit S or E in this event, i guess yes|pg||
nt|athene: -450 can't surely be bad for NS|pg||
nt|brgpro: but i dont know for sure|pg||
nt|wwalter: @d than @h|pg||
nt|ritong: "my grand gin card" allix thinks|pg||
nt|kurtove: and 2 imps to bessis|pg||
nt|davidstern: and there you go|pg||
nt|davidstern: As do both teams - running 31st with 2 qualifying|pg||
nt|rnc: So, we have the same contract - on a longer auction though|pg||
nt|lestergold: betterunclock hearts and duck a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: unvlock|pg||
nt|lestergold: unblock sorry|pg||
nt|buddyshah: -3  gib says|pg||
pc|cT|nt|newmoon: kib says:  "looks quite normal to bid 2@h 5+@C and 4+@H "   I agree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: club now for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: we get it|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to be doing the club first |pg||
nt|lestergold: im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: id have done hearts first|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications slightly awkwar on this han|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - some communications problems now|pg||
nt|haans: @D blocked|pg||
nt|sybarra: but "unclock" may work also on N |pg||
nt|MolvaM: in real life 5 lavel contracts fail quite frequently. not here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: real life = my life|pg||
nt|werge: A french player tells me, that East could just have passed to 5 @S!!!|pg||
nt|werge: That is 2 down, but would often make|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @H is NOT making very often|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: -650 sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: still 6 tricks for the declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead and diamond underlead to get a ruff would be interesting|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but not today|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now he can make 6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: 13-11 to Lavazza after 4 bords |pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes ladies ALWAYS sit south or east in a mixed event|pg||
nt|henryb: -200 is habit forming for N-S|pg||

nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||

nt|davidstern: For this swiss http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=6|pg||
nt|davidstern: Herbst 39th with current score|pg||
nt|haans: rare to pass and not transfer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wwalter: can play a @s also|pg||
nt|davidstern: Perhaps 100 = 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have been worried about where all the @ss were|pg||
nt|rnmalik: likely|pg||
nt|don paulus: so 1st imps to Texan Aces ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense by E|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb: it is a bad habit|pg||
nt|raghavan: a costly 1NT - If S passed they will be playing in a part score.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C now|pg||
nt|lestergold: one way or the other cant be broken now|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you declarer can go wrong|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jeanhari: maybe south shouldnt have played diamond ace|pg||
nt|sharkey: may have to guess @S now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now i bet he wished hed unblocked the pesky hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|haans: im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: frankly a surprising error for cardplay at thislevel|pg||
nt|haans: @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looked autonatic to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: and should have been Mike |pg||
nt|sybarra: (imo )|pg||
nt|haans: may b because last board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as Haans mentioned the adrenaline may be running high for EW which may explain some|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its a verylong tourney i suppose hard for them all to play at the top of their form|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brgpro: why shd I know....or what do I know...I am not a director...|pg||
nt|daman: c'est tout|pg||
nt|kurtove: maybe zone|pg||
nt|jeanhari: on the first two rounds|pg||
nt|sommer: 12..|pg||
nt|xenya: making 6 now|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match  Denmark 15  Harangozo 1  5 to score|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|charles_l: @s also ok - can force a reentry|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|kurtove: sry|pg||
nt|henryb: not that costly. West would have balanced with 1N and east west tould play 1N or 2H|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 4 they also played in 3S-2 = Push|pg||
nt|haans: @D is called giving up|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|sA|nt|charles_l: now a bold @h|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps and play three rounds of diamonds now|pg||
nt|haans: precision 2@C opening in other table paid this time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 14 imp swing possible on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably quite hot in san remo in mid june|pg||
nt|werge: This overtrick only is good for your health - still 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: Can you tell me as which countries these 2 pairs belong to?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D around sure looked right there,,,,,,|pg||
nt|raghavan: may play SA|pg||
nt|lestergold: wish i was there|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: hope someone has to lead away from @CK|pg||
nt|sommer: @H to 10 now...no:)|pg||
nt|werge: Not only possible, please|pg||
nt|haans: much has happened at bridge table|pg||
nt|werge: You very often can judge the "quality" of a contract, when you follow the speed, declarer plays in...  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes but now we see the Open result|pg||
nt|haans: only - 7 imps|pg||
nt|werge: A brave man would have paid the 500 long time ago - CLAIM|pg||
nt|haans: most of us do not do that|pg||
nt|werge: No comment...|pg||
nt|haans: QJ dubble in @H = only 200|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still hoping for less than 500 - if QJ @H doubleton it would be very interesting|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding the @S-suit known, you cannot even put the other cards in a way, which make 3 NT, best would be @H Q-J doubleton for 200|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk5: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|nubmaster: a @s guess now|pg||
nt|lestergold: not playig bridge  i mean on beach|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: too fast |pg||
nt|afulton: sorry, i not following this defense or line... they give up 1 trick on opening but east gives it back but south says NONO you take it and east insists!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|davidstern: If he can manage -160 would be 2|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks now - well done|pg||
nt|afulton: from first hand experience, I can tell you... when the players start to go in lightening mode, it is very dificult to follow! |pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@S|pg||
nt|april7: now only 2 down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: what|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levin missed it....|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh, 9th trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they (defense) are not helping him |pg||
nt|haans: really|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: time to unblock that @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: ah of course it doesn't help :)|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|davidstern: Duck to get club through|pg||
nt|xenya: strange -- how could a @H to the 10 be worse?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkey: Levin had to return @S to test declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: unbelieveable what we are seeing a ping pong of errors of a type we might see in some remote location second rate tourney not in this sort of match|pg||
nt|haans: lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll|pg||
nt|nubmaster: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heat and the 1400 a fatal cocktail for levin maybe|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: always? that depend on country - not in denmark! - no discrimination - free sitting !|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well to me 2NT is just this hand (or if you value it above that range then open it 2NT).  But as to invitations, yes, I don't like to play a level higher than I have to, so I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: prefer invitations to be one last chance to avoid game when we really don't want to be there; otherwise, we go.|pg||
nt|westjava: wd Bojoh|pg||
nt|idblu: was a great call|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 2@S opener too?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably another push board there|pg||
nt|raghavan: I agree rhey are Random - But in comparison to hand dealt, there more hands with voids and singletons|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: mirrored hands NS make any game tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes because hand dealt are not properly shuffled|pg||
nt|raghavan: This W hand is from book - bid stayman and pass any bid ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly|pg||
nt|raghavan: So Those players who practise with computer hands have better experience than the have nots  |pg||
mb|1N|nt|idblu: not in Canada|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 1@C = 15+|pg||
nt|westjava: Conny Sumampouw (W), won 4 Gold Medal on Indonesia Multi Event 2008|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate that opening |pg||
nt|woozle: NS will reach some game here...both 4H and 3NT are cold|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@H heading down in OR on 19 also - so a push there.|pg||
nt|raghavan: This X is penalty - I hopw that is their understanding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now fit is found|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|an|:|nt|westjava: some times,over call with 4 cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a corollary of playing 1@C=2+ for balanced hands is that 1@D can be 4+ and always unbal, but EW 1@D=3+ :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I like the overcall here|pg||
nt|mariner1: good cards and NV vs VUL position|pg||
nt|westjava: back to   3, also 6@S in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 1@H = 5+@H & 10+hcp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes apparently South has 15+ and North 10+|pg||
nt|sybarra: but probably a "must do" |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N NS has good play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 2@S - 3@S and pass out..?:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perhaps she can't count|pg||
nt|mariner1: if N uses disciplined 1N then S should bid 3N|pg||
nt|westjava: ladies team,woman pair,mixed pair and mixed team|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is a good call too|pg||
nt|westjava: Taipe take over by 5 imps from   3|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2H is H and a minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ahh|pg||
nt|raghavan: If the minor is not C, S will bid Diamond - also agreeable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the hand I'd be coming in on|pg||
nt|raghavan: W must pass I suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these days it seems almost mandatory to bid over 1NT on anything|pg||
mb|2D|an|.|nt|nigel_k:  The singleton honours don't count extra|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred, their card says  2M=0-10, 5+suit  so anything seemed possible|pg||
nt|woozle: A missed opportunity for Japan, but they still lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: wow, 3nt..??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North and South will need to discuss the strength of 3D after this|pg||
nt|westjava: agree Nigel:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: N explain weak 3@D while S took as 8-11 from written explaination|pg||
nt|mariner1: stayman without out  a stopper Lebensohl|pg||
mb|2S|nt|westjava: yeah...|pg||
nt|westjava: ahaa...|pg||
nt|jcwla: I prefer 3@H over 2@C here to show this suit.|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe he needs a better hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: good pass |pg||
nt|mariner1: no easy entry to W might allow this|pg||
nt|patricck: this finally looks like a contract that EW can beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Yes Gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: if thats systemic,,,,then he violated system :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: I don't like the 4H bid much - this is a great dummy for 3NT - but he'll make it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  4S is not too bad though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so you lower opening by 1 and raise response the both still lie? seems silly to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: If ruff is tried H loser will go|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: some specs not happy with Berman opening pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S 3 3 and K @H and K@C on side assure the game|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|afulton: isnt this a similar theme to last hand? |pg||
pc|s9|nt|westjava: to return a @H...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2 imps to Ina from   2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1st big swing to China with 3N bid and made board 5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: will lose 2 @S now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: what would cc wei think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2NT shd be 1 top honor in @S, explained by S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They do both have good playings strength, the problems will come when you have a misfit but are already committed to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s seemed to have arrived in best spot |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the @C leads are cutting the ruffs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it is the last hand :)|pg||
nt|afulton: don't they bother to reshuffle? ;)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A possible 4H here for E/W. Unfortunately they sold out to 1S by South.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|westjava: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S can't beat 3H so no harm done as long as they get to play undoubled ...|pg||
nt|idblu: unless they don't do it on 5-5 hands|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|patricck: I know there are 16 points in the North hand, but the flat shape and poor pips would have kept me quiet against two bidding opponents|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20 also a push at 1NT/S making 2.|pg||
nt|raghavan: QMay enter in CQ and discard 2 clubs on H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: and now @c are only 1 loser|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nigel_k:  Small point but South should play 8H not 3H|pg||
nt|westjava: very nice @H return|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S thru for another @C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: operator, we just had this one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 3N rolled in for 11 to China|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or vul vs not means 6, or, or, or|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nigel_k:  If W is thrown in he should give a ruff/discard not open clubs|pg||

nt|charles_l: 7@s open cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry it is not easy to play with leslie that don't show cards :)|pg||
nt|daman: in North America   the @C Queen would be called an "elbow card"  you push it between the AKJ10 with your elbow and smile|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT    n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a typical points-shmoints hand|pg||
nt|aupillon: and this non 6 hearts ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: another makeable 6D|pg||
nt|pelu: so after 5 board only 1 swing - Angelini was close to lose 5 IMP, but had a gift: +10 |pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni will not pass|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak opening|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 4 a push - both 4H-1|pg||
nt|haans: apteker must try harder now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: That's the spirit!|pg||
nt|star6ija: chance to apteker to strike back - they strongly need it|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Try harder and you will succeed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t find any bid on S(!)|pg||
nt|raghavan: S must pass|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 9 tricks made|pg||
nt|haans: nor me|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s take a silent 3 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 segments of 16 in the final|pg||
nt|werge: I agree with the unlikely Q-J position in @H, but both of you had faound out long time ago - NEW BOARD|pg||
nt|nubmaster: And Meckwell in 3NT, @s lead from south|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S get it|pg||
nt|nubmaster: last deal|pg||
nt|werge: By some luck, the opponent with @D Ace waould NOT be on lead|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: israel|pg||
nt|haans: to weak for 3nt |pg||
nt|werge: In Open, East and West did´nt play the same system here. East opened a weak 2 - and West drove on to 3 NT...|pg||
nt|afulton: and they don't make a point of allowing the VG operator to see|pg||
nt|lesrays: On board 18 where declarer here made 10 of the 12 tricks, Welland raised Zia's 1NT to 3 and they led a heart...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Jos and discussed this earlier. We think it's against the EU rules if you took it that far|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H soon|pg||
nt|aupillon: After Ace @s lead and @s , no more 6 @d|pg||
nt|oliverc: I Suspect the NS pair are Polish|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx and EW ?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: another dull 3NT?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|davidstern: 5@HX in OR|pg||
nt|aupillon: weak but positive ...:)|pg||
nt|haans: can they find @D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here as in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: same in Sweden - I am told - so only the South-country discriminate .) - In Germany lady S and W!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That's not good enough, Murat. It's sexist|pg||
nt|wwalter: how 7?|pg||
nt|charles_l: sitff @hJ and dummy reverse|pg||
nt|wwalter: any play would lose 1@h|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H P 1@S 2@D P P now west has a bit of a decision|pg||
nt|davidstern: Over E/W 4@S|pg||
nt|aupillon: can one say 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|pelu: so the 5-level is max for both sides - will they fight on 6-level? :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW Turkish, apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk5: However, this is not about winning according to Pierre de Coubertin|pg||
nt|raghavan: a X bid is good for S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I must bid on S now i prefer D|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: easier if played in S but still makes|pg||
nt|davidstern: Cash 3 spades and a diamond and gain an IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on TOOLBAR|pg||
nt|mariner1: and then OPEN or CLOSED|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S lead on the auction in Open Room might be called for|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm |pg||
nt|werge: West has the fastest pass, I have seen for years!!!|pg||
nt|haans: well done passs more often :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: that the screen partners on one side should be one lady and one gentleman|pg||
nt|athene: i know Sabine Auken doesn't like it - she complained about it in her book :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: interesting hand -- 5D makeable (but a bit double dummy)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil, Diamond bid is due from E |pg||
nt|raghavan: is N thinking of a penalty?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer seems to have 6 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: in a heart contract|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh..silent?:)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|charles_l: N has single J|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder we've got a football (soccer) score in this set so far -- 2-1 -- the hands have been fairly routine |pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@D in both rooms|pg||
nt|kurtove: Not a good result for bessis in open|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 4NT|pg||
nt|aupillon: enfin. In fine...|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 6+@c +4@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: If E misses this chance, may not get again|pg||
nt|newmoon: 1@C alerted - Polish style?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: "The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well"|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|newmoon: previous hand Zia opened with unbalanced 17|pg||
nt|haans: zia has never bid polish|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a @h lead from S I vote for -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: a natural D lead is there - may shorten Declarer's trump holding|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: well E bids the @S here, so auction will be different|pg||
nt|mariner1: S may end up playing 3N now|pg||
nt|haans: and now an easy 1nt  (thats all)|pg||
nt|werge: In OR, thay mus have an agreement NOT to lead a @S against NT|pg||
nt|werge: they must|pg||
nt|werge: North is wondering about the game here|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: well I was talking about the general EBL rules :)|pg||

nt|milton_se: not happy w spades bid by LHO...|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid now 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: although he will be disappointed to find the @sK offside|pg||
nt|raghavan: He will try to enter Dummy thru SK or CJ|pg||
nt|henryb: I am not sure that a @d is right. I was taught to lead trump when partner passes a 1 level double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|haans: but very close :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no it isnt... maybe it is after the lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After a club lead, it will certainly make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: small club?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On a spade lead, i wouldn't like to predict the outcome|pg||
nt|haans: easier for N to enter now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nicely bid in Open|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans - what do u think - 1D-1NT will S try 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jim Hay|pg||
nt|haans: now they may bid 3nt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: might  beat 1nt   lead a spade    and switgch to clubs|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|haans: 8 trick for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, another dull 3NT|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 9 now :)|pg||
nt|sommer: can't it be set?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play NS, not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may keep n/s out of the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be a kind of multi?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has done them a favour as they cant make ZIP|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 or 3 @D maybe |pg||
nt|MolvaM: interesting that the other room east did not reopen after 1nt came to him|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|werge: Very passive indeed|pg||
nt|haans: i open 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Spain : Lady N and E :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: sorry for the word Easy...nothing is easy in this game|pg||
nt|aupillon: but slam no way cause 2@c opening bid|pg||
nt|haans: 4 diamonds????????|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S by W now might make it pretty hard for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H shows a huge hand here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: could it be the Zia factor?|pg||
nt|ahh: hi all |pg||
nt|afulton: vg should be = "Very good" |pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk3: Say a woman wants to sit West and you tell her that she can't. Isn't that sexist? I am just asking|pg||
nt|xenya: but not this one?|pg||
nt|star6ija: one problem decided|pg||
nt|newmoon: tough for Gower to find a @H-lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: ok, if the result is correct, np|pg||
nt|fann4: Pretty pushy 3@D|pg||
nt|werge: Change the minor kings - and it´s an easy 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: But he was right. 2 @S is NOT a winner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leading yr longest suit on vugraf is a bit old fashioned|pg||
nt|werge: So put the 200 into your pocket|pg||
nt|werge: Problem is: 3 @C is a good contract - BUT: South will not pass|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Peter Eidt|pg||
nt|petere: good morning together|pg||
nt|werge: As West, I would lead a @D|pg||
nt|haans: 5 down still + score|pg||
nt|rnmalik: What EW are playing as defense to 1NT-DBL single suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: I see playing rederse summy, ruffing 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s looks making as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: if south had raised to 4@D i am sure west wld have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed not|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find who should play 4@H|pg||
nt|kurtove: must be worth trying 4 h with that hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: problem for Gromov heren, choose the right bid as the cards lie|pg||
nt|raghavan: that is the 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must take it though|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only 2 |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d maybe not 3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well they will certainly lead @S here|pg||
nt|werge: It´s not the LONGESTR - @d just as long...|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play 3 nt here |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: this hand is not trivial if N-s play more @h|pg||
nt|kurtove: in North|pg||
nt|haans: play 1 @D get it claim|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprising|pg||
nt|fann4: If played constructively, even facing 6 of them.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: when everyone bids at the table people get suspicious and tend to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D or 3@H|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Jim|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|haans: very close|pg||
nt|haans: nyström has nothing in @H or @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: huge dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 rounds of @d a @c shift and a @c discard on next @d|pg||
nt|sommer: small @S lead..and?|pg||
nt|werge: Down on the nnaturral @S-lead|pg||
nt|rnc: as predicted, 3NT from the South seat|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows S has a @S stopper so.............|pg||
nt|buddyshah: m+M  m longer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: but south was + score|pg||
nt|sommer: then "noisy":)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: alsways down on 6-2 as defenders will switch to a spade|pg||
nt|xenya: well done, though i'm not sure how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
nt|werge: 550 out through is no PLUS-score, Haansf|pg||
nt|haans: yes they play togther RIGHT|pg||
nt|werge: through the window, I meant|pg||
nt|petere: but 550 in is one :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
nt|haans: but that is pairs thinking|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 top losers without the option|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Perhaps it should stand 2@d there... just an error...|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes sense - 2@S showing @H fit|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Usually 2@s is for play against a 2@d opening showing weak major and you have to 3@h if opener had @hs|pg||
nt|werge: I am told, that they led a @S in Open - then they must have covered the @D Queen - or?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|mariner1: migth see the @D switch now|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@s from north and 3nt?|pg||
nt|raghavan: good |pg||
nt|haans: and well done|pg||
nt|ahh: will be easy on @S lead |pg||
nt|mcarroll: should be no problem in the play|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless a @H lead is found|pg||
nt|ahh: @H lead  makes it more difficult|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
nt|aupillon: and slowly, but surely, thry drew their plans agains us ( War of The Worlds)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland has to find @S Jack now|pg||
nt|werge: You have seen to many crimi´s in TV, when you think a @D-lead is good. North MUSThave been misinformed about the 3 @S-bid|pg||
nt|sommer: so it became (maybe) a great and lucky gain for the Americans|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S+2@H+2@C=?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but top @c ducked and then east is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: as it  turn o ut 2 hearts  or even 2@D  works better for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: luxemburg has done well this far|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match both in 3N, making 3 and 4|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ALL results on the board already recorded http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.06..795|pg||
nt|rnc: Prospect looks bad from West's point of view|pg||
nt|davidstern: Change that 006 for any other board number|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows E has to have something, and the only thing he can have is A@D or K@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: 6D+1C+2S and 1H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: at most|pg||
nt|sybarra: now on to 4 @S |pg||
pc|s8|nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
nt|star6ija: now twelve tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 12|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: and would have passed with K@D|pg||
nt|rnc: West bought the contract, uncontested, in 1NT in the OR. North never mentioning the @Ds.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: y, sorry Carl... repeat here :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: took the short cut|pg||
nt|ronpa: only @H lead will beat this|pg||
nt|afulton: this might not fare well on @H lead|pg||
nt|werge: But we saw earlier, that double-leads are not popular|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
nt|raghavan: Should play D and continue to shorten S in trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@H is not an error. Shows 5-6 spades and 3-10 hcp|pg||
nt|MolvaM: to a minus score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but you never know|pg||
nt|werge: What´s this game called?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S has already shown a @S stop so straight to the NT game|pg||
nt|haans: @C was not a winner|pg||
nt|raghavan: He should immediately play S|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|afulton: they decided to go for it|pg||
nt|ronpa: wow|pg||
nt|lesrays: well done, @d Q must have been tempting|pg||
nt|afulton: So, 2@H's, ruff and the ace of @s |pg||
nt|sybarra: played from the other side at the OR |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now to see if it can be made|pg||
nt|MolvaM: name of the game is "bid 3nt and see what happens"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought 3@D was a good pass but trouble:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Was not but became a winner|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: defence will hav e to do the right thing though|pg||
nt|henryb: really? Is N trying to let this make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Defence is not on top|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: So on that board which required a club switch to beat 3NT http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=004.06..795|pg||
nt|mariner1: there goes the beer card|pg||
nt|davidstern: And you will see about half the field is beating it|pg||
nt|haans: a board to talk about|pg||
nt|ronpa: thats a viugraph error|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Netherlands/bakkeren-bertens.pdf|pg||
nt|haans: nortway has invented 2@H meaning werak 2 in either M|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ok, then this is settled :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H multii do not think that is allowed here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Sure it is if it shows both majors|pg||
pc|d2|nt|afulton: >>|pg||
nt|afulton: ??|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
nt|newmoon: Will exit a @H after next trump|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|henryb: I take that back, but North's plays to tricks one and 2 seem strange|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Many play that|pg||
nt|petere: at the (milk-) bar|pg||
nt|april7: very good lead, it kills the @C suit|pg||
nt|buddyshah: was supposed to be puppeting to 2@C but JM willing to play in 4-3 spades  for a shot at Game|pg||
nt|don paulus: J@c favourable|pg||
nt|april7: but this doesn't help E|pg||
nt|don paulus: not enough - comm probl|pg||
pc|d8|nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: or 3rd|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes could be better|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: of course|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: dont think can make now|pg||
nt|haans: killer|pg||
nt|werge: I know another game - one pair at the table can always make 3 NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was an interesting lead :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: duck |pg||
nt|mariner1: E pitching @H conveys A@C is probably right|pg||
nt|jeanhari: reliefed to see two hearts go|pg||
nt|ahh: play in other room strange if   record is right |pg||
nt|raghavan: there also 10 tricks so may be a push|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||
nt|newmoon: partial elimination|pg||
nt|star6ija: guess avoided|pg||
nt|newmoon: well played yes   :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: What a nice throw in|pg||
nt|newmoon: case for apteker to continue with a small @H second time|pg||
nt|newmoon: he could have got in with 3rd @H to punch @D8|pg||
nt|star6ija: Apteker's mistake... had to play @c after 1st ducking in @h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C 2 was a very safe exit |pg||
nt|rnc: Since N and E are on the same side of the screen, it seems odd if he got misinformed about the @S-bid|pg||
nt|fann4: Once again, EW are playing a contract in the other room - 1NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @C to the K@C and Q@D|pg||
nt|buddyshah: really?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought so:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: dummy reversal is an attractive line, ruff 3 @D in Dummy|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes and lose a @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: in hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead on the go, might have done but who would do that?|pg||
nt|henryb: If she ducks, declarer can just ram @d down her throat|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in trumps are too good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now N is caught to play from @sA|pg||
nt|werge: De må have følt sig hjemme, jeg kender personalet|pg||
pc|c3|nt|don paulus: that would be 10 for badger|pg||
nt|haans: and next|pg||
nt|haans: not both any|pg||
nt|werge: Which means, that the 150 from OR was not enough|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jeanhari: club now ans then 3 rounds of spades to get another trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 5@D here,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club K now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|panja: @DA, @SQA..|pg||
nt|wwalter: the dummy has 1 @h losre, if the @h is not found|pg||
nt|wwalter: now should ruff some @d|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer has to worry about 4-1 trumps too|pg||
nt|werge: Sry, privat...!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb: a heart continuation would create enormous problems|pg||
nt|werge: For me, that was half a joke|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: i have to go now folks bye for now thx all|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lucky the loss is less than it could have been 7 instead of 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: As long as at least one suit is known, it's permitted|pg||
nt|haans: norway have invented many things|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The Multi is an exception to that rule, by the way|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's allowed anywhere in Europe|pg||
nt|sharkey: I haven't seen this one in Norway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: but here's no one known...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Unlike North America|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi = either M not allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Of course there is, it shows spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Isn't it "any" of the M's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: USA no multi except in "big" events|pg||
nt|haans: spade or hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and sometimes not even there|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But this shows spades only|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ok, then it was easy...|pg||
nt|haans: norway has it showing either M|pg||
nt|nubmaster: let's comment the play now :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: @H finesse now?|pg||
nt|haans: do they still play :))|pg||
nt|werge: The safe way to 100|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is the best line to play|pg||
nt|don paulus: ty mike cu|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW won the Under 28 Pairs at Beijing in the Mind Sport Games|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N leads a small @S to K..and W let it hold, S MUST shift to a small @D!..to set it|pg||
nt|buddyshah: this defense is relly thinking good :) |pg||
nt|don paulus: best def @d now ?|pg||
nt|werge: @H is OK also|pg||
pc|d9|nt|werge: No sprint-prize for this board|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: north played for some blocking @c position|pg||
nt|ady: but discarding a heart and a diamond made the contract unmakeable|pg||
nt|ritong: unless @d 10 drops|pg||
nt|ritong: if a defender has a @c less, he has a @d more and then @d 10 can be short|pg||
nt|ritong: he/she, btw|pg||
nt|daman: should be a push then|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in all Open matches|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb: at trick 2. declarer plays a club and South wins and plays a third heart|pg||
nt|xenya: would be much better, yes -- still declarer can prevail i think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@D oke to|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie cant go of|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the closed room, the defence established their spades but failed to cash them|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|star6ija: A is correct line of play if N was with 5 clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H shows weak 2@S, FG three suiter or strong NT|pg||
nt|werge: Claim|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb: but declarer did not read the position|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have said this many times on vugraph,  I played in NL at many clubs etc,  everyone (including the grannies) had defense to multi |pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi??????????????????|pg||
nt|don paulus: made 2 @s in OR|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think the @h count is later known|pg||
nt|fann4: A plus is that the 3@D raise may shut the opponents out, but if pard bids on it may be a disappointing dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: how come|pg||
nt|sharkey: on their CC|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: ok ok open room  :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we have alert kibitzers thanks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: but you were finally right, even with good news this defense beats it|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|panja: not taking out trump at all thus far, is certainly a little risky|pg||
nt|raghavan: one more trick WD|pg||
nt|mariner1: Bessis stops the schneid|pg||
mc|6|nt|ralfwil: so evident! play @c and watch on N|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry misclick|pg||
nt|april7: but 2 down here|pg||
nt|werge: We can never be sure, if they MADE it - often defence gives it away, and VERY GOOD defence here|pg||

nt|patricck: a good vulnerability there for Australia, but the Moysian @S fit doesn't play as well as @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: ah:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 2NT = Grand @H, no 3c@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only over 4 @c or 4 @c |pg||
nt|jcwla: If 1NT is natural there, I'm delighted to bid it.  (I wouldn't play it that way but that's beside the point.)  As you say it's flat, but it's got some intermediates. |pg||
nt|patricck: Wang just LOVED having to bid 1@S, but you gotta do what you gotta do|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe says "get me out of here"|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you,Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfers over opponent takeout double is very useful|pg||
pc|h7|nt|westjava: 4@C, cue or asking bid?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C agrees which suit is N's issue|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: here, North only interested in 4 card major, so 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H ok but he has 4 keys and Q@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: no cue by S?|pg||
nt|westjava: has change...|pg||
nt|idblu: with the E hand, i would rather the opps played the hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in big club context - they probably have a bid that shows both minors|pg||
pc|h9|nt|westjava: whay N not to use 2@D..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South must be tempted to double|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: those H will be a disappointment|pg||
nt|westjava: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: missed opportunity |pg||
nt|jcwla: So 3@S went down only one, 3 to Australia on 18.|pg||
nt|idblu: @D's play very well for W|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even 4@H -- but 4@S it is. |pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes' rebid is a style thing...apparently 2S is acceptable with this shape...and Neill wastes no time in bidding game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like the 2@S?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: acey hand in S,  and pard transfers to your 4 card suit |pg||
pc|cT|nt|nigel_k:  Thin game here missed by E/W|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@H ask the stopper|pg||
nt|afulton: for a sleepy auction, this started to get going|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont get being so pasive  |pg||
nt|westjava: I am sure that other room, Fera Damayanti - Riantini will reach to six|pg||
nt|idblu: nice lowball hand|pg||
nt|westjava: will down on @D lead|pg||
nt|idblu: 34567|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will W find it?|pg||
nt|idblu: will have time to switch after @CA|pg||
nt|westjava: has to check first by A lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it required?   doesn't @HJ work|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: declarer only seems to have 8 tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: thats true as well Al :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: deserves about -3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: when not looking for slam or starting to force in his own suit -- 2@D gives away extra information to opponents|pg||
nt|sybarra: (and I am criticized for "sitting on my hands")|pg||
nt|mariner1: needed to make a move over the transfer to 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nigel_k:  Should be a straightforward 4H, losing a spade, club and trump|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|afulton: if west leads another @H and east ruffs with Q, would have been a good play.. how do you tell you partner to do this? |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  2H by West a bit heavy but not unreasonable|pg||
nt|afulton: and should they figure this out?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: boy on mans errand sgould play Q@C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: upside down count|pg||
nt|westjava:   3, 4@H other room and 10 imps|pg||
nt|sybarra2: needs to cash soon |pg||
nt|afulton: this is ladies championship.... should have sent in the Queen! |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|westjava: from N,yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  Now it will be damage control mode|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  China made 4S on the last hand so now has a decent lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed 4@S did make and China race to a good lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S has to make the move somewhere|pg||
nt|westjava: hands up|pg||
nt|idblu: I give|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: such as opener holding 5 card @C/@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: I was advised a dictum  - when you ruff - ruff high and when you gollow the suit play low Here CQ ruff is needed|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|raghavan: folloe|pg||
pc|hT|nt|raghavan: follow|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nigel_k:  This will be one or two down depending on whether South can get a club trick set up|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nigel_k:  New Zealand made 2H on this board so is headed for a pickup|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nigel_k:  Glenis Palmer rebid just 2H with West which is conservative but reasonable|pg||
pc|d9|nt|patricck: throwing clubs on diamonds and ruffing a club with the 6@S|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|westjava: claim and next board|pg||
pc|s2|nt|woozle: I'm told that on board 21 the other room opened 2NT and played there..winning imps with a 28-point partscore|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N gets away with a gross bid :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: well makes with cross ruffs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzre: don't understood W line....|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think W shd take more blame|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H showed a strong slam try and demanded control-bid then 3@S didn't promise any extras|pg||
nt|brgpro: his 2@h rebid might not have shown 6|pg||
nt|athene: in which case maybe west should do more|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right.  Pressure at all times.|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons to come|pg||
nt|aupillon: nice hands !|pg||
nt|pelu: in Op 1@C - 1@H - 2@D .. here NS has found the @D-suit|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat Anter|pg||
nt|murat: hello all..|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: okay|pg||
nt|raghavan: Massi what is the correct result |pg||
nt|haans: this look more fun|pg||
nt|jeanhari: open room stopped in time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bessis gets 1 IMP |pg||
nt|mariner1: J@D from W would be interesting if S is in 3N|pg||
nt|werge: A very flat 4 §S here|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @s...|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer had 6 tricks and had to come to the two spades sitting over the q??|pg||
nt|werge: Another 6 to Welland|pg||
nt|raghavan: Jim what was played?|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looks playable|pg||
nt|ahh:  given play is unlikely      i think  dec played on @S in other room and @C never played |pg||
nt|ahh: started well wiith 2 rounds of @H |pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Jim|pg||
nt|haans: picked you clean|pg||
nt|petere: mmmh what about @H6 ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|petere: hi Martin :)|pg||
nt|haans: hi Martin|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wwalter: is not so easy @@ the table, this is made by the great masters :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 3), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|jeanhari: saw dutch junior pair double 4NT, hoping for soma bad agreements... could have been costly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ended in 5@H|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like a @S-lead in OR - @h-lead works better|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely contract was made|pg||
nt|april7: with this hand 1 NT, thats really odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: well, count of not, the only play available is to drop @HJ or Q stiff in 7@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: OR 4@H by SOuth|pg||
nt|milton_se: also 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: wild board|pg||
nt|raghavan: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1down |pg||
nt|mariner1: how to lead that I have no idea though|pg||
nt|haans: 2 @H ruffs|pg||
nt|raghavan: wether to pre empt 4S - N must be thinking |pg||
nt|werge: Has a difficult bid after 1 H - 1 S|pg||
nt|werge: But 2 @C should be ocay|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|brgpro: and 3@s was sort of "on the way" cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: but if 3@H was only a mild slam try, then 3@S was showing west had a decent hand|pg||
nt|haans: 40 minutes late but still many specs|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 5 E made +2 in 3NT so Mc Leish gets 2 IMP |pg||
nt|milton_se: how do you respond to 2C with a solid 6-card major?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bid 3 of the major|pg||
nt|oliverc: expect 1 1@D Opening from North, showing Spades|pg||
nt|murat: E is Civginer actually|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||
nt|murat: was E aware of North's heart ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Looks like Flannery reversed > 4H and 5S |pg||
nt|murat: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: swing board|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4@c|pg||
nt|ahh: 4@S looks normal opener 1st in hand |pg||
nt|haans: 4nt soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i only can when i am commentating, not at table :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: double|pg||
nt|raghavan: ultimately end in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: wellands do well her|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks 3@H would not hve been forcing...?|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score heree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ew open in 3NT..|pg||
nt|mcarroll: An opportunity for gain here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by W - reach 5D|pg||
nt|haans: both minors or @D+@H|pg||
nt|afulton: this could be semi-painful|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: Massi,   didnt he make that?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no 1 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play for 4@H|pg||
nt|petere: in the OR West miscounted (?) and passed in 2nd seat but EW found 3 SA|pg||
nt|haans: a miracle?|pg||
nt|haans: a he did not pass 2nt sorry|pg||
nt|petere: the good (?) news is, they didn't managed to fullfill|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in the Open. This match is from the women's event although it reads Open Teams on the banner|pg||
nt|werge: To open - as in OR - the East hand after 3 x pass - deserves a doping-control|pg||
nt|haans: lets try Ms for all|pg||
nt|afulton: with @H fit, but suit breaking badly|pg||
nt|sybarra: think they get to same place |pg||
nt|sybarra: however we have seen S pass before |pg||
nt|lesrays: not this time|pg||
nt|afulton: Ron, how is the weather there in Sanremo? |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: oh no|pg||
nt|hedyg: not over 1@d|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showing Diamonds, perhaps? :)|pg||
nt|haans: double to follow|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s = 5+@s and a minor, less than an opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N takes his 2@d tricks and plays a @c there is -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: how?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe a 3@h response to the transfer would work?|pg||
nt|ronpa: today weather is nice, yesterday was raining like hell :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably gorgeous!|pg||
nt|ronpa: but I sure prefer the rain and the israeli teams winning like yesterday!|pg||
nt|afulton: For more information click http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 7@c is a good contract and cold on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt likely to come home here|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play strong @c, thus the 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: now S in 6@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Dael6 1NT -3 here, 1NT-1 in OR. so 5 IMP|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the open room I mean|pg||
nt|haans: witgh u there|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now!|pg||
nt|pelu: over 5@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: he must X now|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauria 8East) in box - 6@D making on @H-lead|pg||
nt|murat: Sen has enough values to balance the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Zia may come to life|pg||
nt|newmoon: belated x by Zia may lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: action begins|pg||
nt|ahh: will be pleased when p bids @D not @C |pg||
nt|haans: or strong @H+@C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wwalter: most of us :)|pg||
nt|ritong: this will go fast|pg||
nt|oliverc: With a void in Partner's Hearts, though?|pg||
nt|haans: prempt from slam thinking|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont get to high this way|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid 3S |pg||
nt|panja: misfit will lead them overboard here..cards lying badly too|pg||
nt|werge: But 5 @C is a good sacrifica - which often puses N/S higher|pg||
nt|haans: best is @D 3-0 against|pg||
nt|ahh: 6 @D makes on the lie |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: west said 4NT three suites |pg||
nt|ahh: well he has a void so it is accurate |pg||
nt|raghavan: usually 2 suit - still more likely lower 2 unbid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he said 2 sometimes 3 :)|pg||
nt|haans: ok with u|pg||
nt|buddyshah: will JM find a Spade lead?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: 4@H  looks the best shot|pg||
nt|raghavan: N will pass I think - May bid D if what charles said is correct - that 1S shows Diamonds by S|pg||
nt|murat: misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead a small @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is new minor I suspect or a forced relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: New leader after this board|pg||
pc|sT|nt|raghavan: D J is natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: strong nt why 3nt?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks!|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S no make |pg||
nt|werge: No - but the bid it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: East "stole" it in 4@C in Open|pg||
nt|werge: Flat for one down, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: claim declared 1 down |pg||
nt|lestergold: piano hand fo a change 11 tricks next case please|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi see http://www.geocities.com/gerben47/bridge/|pg||
nt|lestergold: claimed one off??|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|raghavan: or a low D|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh sorry N on lead|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wise pas from mr Welland|pg||
nt|werge: In Turkey: 23 HCP = game|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be too high -- or...?|pg||
nt|sommer: MA lead for 6 imps one or the other way|pg||
nt|haans: and rightly so|pg||
nt|petere: find one minor J ... that's the task here|pg||
nt|afulton: WOW! Lengy let them off the hook|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That certainly came out of the blue|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: 3@C super-accept|pg||
nt|panja: the bad break in @H will defeat this|pg||
nt|athene: there won't be much to go on regardigg @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: regarding|pg||
nt|raghavan: If that understanding is not there, he should pass - N has told his story - South must decide|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower did good, else 3@S gets whacked|pg||
nt|werge: Not with this lead...|pg||
nt|xenya: it may not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4th suit also possible|pg||
nt|ronpa: he felt bad after last hand and thought good chance for fit when partner is known for @H shortness|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: they will do well to bid 6 i think|pg||
nt|xenya: ah!|pg||
nt|henryb: a big chance for Hansen|pg||
nt|haans: @C and can go down|pg||
nt|haans: even with spades down possible|pg||
nt|oliverc: It seems to me as if all 4 players are bidding their hands without considering what|pg||
nt|april7: if 1@S shows @D then why didn't N bid @D, but now S did|pg||
nt|oliverc: opps and partner have bid|pg||
nt|henryb: here N-S missed a decent @s slam; an excellent one if played by North|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@c is a little bit agressive (politely said) in the OR|pg||
nt|star6ija: running scores at http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes it needs a superaccept to get S to move again after 1NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible massive fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes several kibitzers tell me that 2NT response would have been even better|pg||
nt|MolvaM: because it seems many people bit 3H even with a minimum opening if they hold 4card support for pd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anyway 2@h seems a bit too conservative|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dcbutler: good idea by south - can she make it?|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   showed I believe showed 5 hearts and 4 spades and forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: mrs hinden has a tough switch to make|pg||
nt|ritong: @d jack could slip |pg||
nt|murat: they are still ok|pg||
nt|april7: S will start a crocss ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s lead makes the things difficult for declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 10 imp loss for this board must be billed to welland apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does declarer have a problem?|pg||
nt|werge: Dream-position in @D|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|star6ija: @h also|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|werge: East stays to his @S-leads|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C better bid than 4th suit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
nt|werge: Easy to play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
nt|davidstern: This could get ugly|pg||
nt|haans: does east  havbe @HK?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf - we were talking about a better defense by NS In Open room same 1HX -1 Push!!!|pg||
nt|haans: yes he had already overbid a little :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing very important here|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might think S has @D cards on this auction,,,,,, the lead is not easy to find|pg||
nt|xenya: actually you just need to lead any @D here to beat it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but a @D lead is tough is it not?|pg||
nt|xenya: just lead the only unbid suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kurtove: thats a nice turn|pg||
nt|davidstern: Duck and a club ruff and another heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry club ruff and spade for -1|pg||
nt|haans: safer to play @HA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even if he wins this he can play a high spade honour they get a club ruff and then perhaps black suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|kurtove: its a problem to take the ace if east have the rest of the hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: So Heart Ace and seconbd trump then @SK win diamond ruff spade and ruff diamond and trump will nail West|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@D is a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can get C ruff|pg||
nt|newmoon: a very strange @HQ, if u count the points...|pg||
nt|haans: i assume 2nt was lebensohl so that was no option|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland know all the points, but the shape is also unfavourable|pg||
nt|star6ija: Slam reached at the Open Room|pg||
nt|star6ija: distance shortenned|pg||
nt|rnc: He did!|pg||
nt|mariner1: there it is,,,,, well done|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room the lead was a small @S|pg||
nt|panja: 6 tricks might be the limit for EW...but a couple of tricks in suspense|pg||
nt|haans: 1st try|pg||
nt|petere: ... not @D|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|mariner1: the defense helps with the @D play|pg||
nt|ronpa: he will not like the K@H in dummy for sure|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
nt|davidstern: oops|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: soade switch is awkward after cashing clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 13 precious IMPS back|pg||
nt|rnc: If taking care of this good start, it will bring Herbst back in business|pg||
nt|rnc: Other room stopped queitly in 2@S|pg||
nt|rnc: *quietly that is|pg||
nt|haans: may not have been an option for them many play 2@S as forcing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
nt|rnc: I must admit I would have passed 1NT without a thought|pg||
nt|xenya: me too|pg||
nt|sommer: gtg.. tnx and cu|pg||
nt|werge: But I do´nt like the blocking play, declarer has made in the @C-suit|pg||
nt|werge: West must play the @D Queen, when South plays the suit|pg||
nt|don paulus: 9 @s important card|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: defense needs to play spades|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|haans: never steel the contract when you  can steel suits|pg||
nt|april7: S has still to guess|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
nt|raghavan: a D to KQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: SAK|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best set of board, in the other BBO-match the score is 7-0 after 8|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club goes on SK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
nt|ritong: well played by east, a @d and it was over, since west would certainly play a @d back|pg||
nt|ritong: now on the surface, west has to duck the @d K|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal defense at this level|pg||
nt|dcbutler: that doesn't help, does it?|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that will not help|pg||
nt|ady: should make now   with diamond position favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: she might play a @d from hand right now|pg||
nt|kurtove: he was thinking that east never would have turned hearts without the king|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so much more to see here :)|pg||
nt|haans: :( may get better soon :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3N Open Room here,,, EW like to bid'em up in Open Room|pg||
nt|daman: not always the best sdtrategy but it worls like a charm on occasion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare does not know that @DS are so good and wondering about the @C losers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: should have discarded a club earlier|pg||
nt|april7: dummy is somehow squeezed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: after the 2@D bid, 3@C, if NF is quite ok, isn't it?|pg||
nt|haans: many treat 6-4-hand as GF what you have to pay|pg||
nt|rnc: In OR West elected to bid 2@S (NF in their sys) after 1@S-21C;2@D. |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
nt|kurtove: And I agree|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will be forced to take 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|werge: That should be 100 + 100 for US = 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|haans: second one easier|pg||
nt|petere: ahh, 'squeeze' it out :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice defence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|milton_se: +2|pg||
nt|raghavan: H9|pg||
nt|haans: now WH may miss playing @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would not bet on that|pg||
pc|h7|nt|werge: Sorry for NL|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now will be nervous of @sQ getting ruffed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: they need 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs to Neth White House|pg||
nt|haans: still 10|pg||
nt|star6ija: possibly|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - not even vulnerable, I would try for game|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|rnc: *2@C|pg||
nt|panja: after the 2@D bid..the 4-length @H is not likely to be useful|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed|pg||
nt|afulton: this could have been much worse|pg||
nt|ronpa: its bad enough|pg||
nt|april7: 3 of @S, but faster|pg||
nt|werge: Exactly|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: cash two clubs and then @HK and @H10 - even if you lose to east's @HQx, she may be endplayed anyway with @SA|pg||
nt|raghavan: loser on loser|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 25|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after this round. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: H thrown anyway|pg||
nt|star6ija: and small @h back|pg||
nt|raghavan: Welland is fortunate that North does not have better than C3|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|afulton: looks like -1|pg||
nt|afulton: sorry|pg||
nt|afulton: i cannot count|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: as far as inviting goes - conventional wisdom is that you don't want to play in the invitation very often, so you want partner to accept more often, i think?|pg||
nt|daman: nice|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will a long break before the Swiss begins. Restart at 17.30 Paris, 4:30 pm London, 8:30 am Los Angeles, 11:30 am New York|pg||
nt|haans: ohh how funny it is|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: still lot od hearts|pg||
nt|lesrays: I refuse to ask if he really ducked...|pg||
nt|afulton: those of you who have listened to me comment before should know that!|pg||
nt|werge: Fast enough?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's how I feel.  I prefer the invitation to be one last chance to decline game with the absolute pits; otherwise, we go.|pg||
nt|daman: still going to make|pg||
nt|april7: no|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well played|pg||
nt|werge: Now East will be even slower|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i wonna die.....................:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|raghavan: Hi Massi - |pg||
pc|c7|nt|raghavan: why not DQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|murat: Ace ?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|milton_se: sorry, +1|pg||
nt|werge: This is an 8% game|pg||
nt|raghavan: play C |pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: excellent board for the french team|pg||
nt|raghavan: first time ruffed with 10, now 6?|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @c 3 is enough to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|werge: Maybe 8½...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good play, make the opps do the waork for you|pg||
nt|mcarroll: work|pg||
pc|c5|nt|MolvaM: making exactly will mean 9 imps only|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petere: but now guess right|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: strong card :)))|pg||
nt|rnc: Not such a big deal, since both contracts will fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not 10|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he really pitch a @D?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: and a new leader by 1|pg||
nt|afulton: down 3|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think operator lost some of the play but still 12 imps for the indians to take a very hard lead to close|pg||
pc|h8|nt|star6ija: 4 down|pg||
pc|d8|nt|murat: i guess it was Ace over Q |pg||
nt|buddyshah: S in on the right path here nicely worked out |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|werge: CLAIM - we are wasting our time because of West|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahh: so  safe 11 more imps to Vito|pg||
nt|werge: Even overtrick - what a play|pg||
pg||

nt|nigel_k:  This should be interesting|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  6D for E/W and a possible spade sacrifice for N/S|pg||
nt|allanr44: Indeed Nigel|pg||
nt|westjava: ty:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: With a worthless doubleton, three to the ace, and a min hand, it seems eminently reasonable to me.  Some prefer only with a stiff.  Some of it may have to do with how much ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: integrity 1@S has over 1@H.|pg||
nt|jcwla: If it could be four to the five, there may be more of a case for something other than 2@S.|pg||
nt|woozle: I rebid 1NT, but I don't claim that I'm definitely right|pg||
nt|afulton: well, if they made 144, it would be gross... in this case was a bit more shy |pg||
nt|raghavan: China leading 16 vs 2|pg||
nt|bebechira: TEXAN ACES doing well ....33-26 after 17|pg||
mb|2D|an|.|nt|mariner1: NS in a @S partial likely here..............|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a welcome 11 to NZ there|pg||
nt|afulton: i have something i would say to that... but it might get deleted by BBO (or get me banned)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS this time.. not much to it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Different strategies possible with West|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|.|nt|westjava: Japan, leads the way 1 imp from   19|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @C lead make 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what Dawei's plan was with 1@C opener if partner responded 1@H showing @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: just no real play for 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bid 1N ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: agree aholl view|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1NT is 14-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and fortunate cards 3N can't be beat|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: After @CQ @CJ @CA @C4, W suddenly called small @C from dummy, S claimed all tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: sry|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 1@D bid.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is a good spot that can be beaten with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He would enjoy the 3C response from East if there was one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room stopped in 4@H on  4 :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
nt|idblu: P appears right|pg||
nt|woozle: We get an insight into style as Hughes declines to open a moderate 11-count, but Neill is there, upgrading a decent 14 to a strong notrump|pg||
nt|woozle: South will probably bid something and EW will get to 3NT quickly|pg||
nt|afulton: 2@s?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S and a minor 5-5 weak|pg||
nt|afulton: opens door for perfect takeout x|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@H or 3NT EW is ok now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hardly perfect|pg||
mb|4H|an|!s|nt|ahollan1: but has strength for 1N opener so can't be that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not for interrupt but for interested persons: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
nt|allanr44: If west bid 7NT north may lead H   :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East could still try 6 now but it's a gamble|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@D DONT?|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D, @D and M..?|pg||
nt|jcwla: game values, no @S stopper, and no 4 @H's I'd guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 3@D = Good Trump Bad Point explained by W|pg||
mb|4S|nt|westjava: 4@S on the way...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice treatment  Assume 2N is @S raise so DBL for takeout|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's a pretty good 3NT with the overcall though 5C is a bit better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2N puppet to 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: Arline, my guess is she meant to be talking to me |pg||
nt|afulton: they make 4|pg||
nt|raghavan: EW have found a fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: ok ladies, claim and next hand :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how did W "guess" the minor :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Clubs don't break so 7NT is out :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: true|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North must bid 6S now|pg||
nt|idblu: @D and @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: August,I think|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 3S is just a stopper-ask rather than a lebensohlish thing failing to deliver a fourth heart|pg||
nt|jcwla: Probably right, in any case all roads have led to 3NT.|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT is easy on a black suit lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: because S bid 3C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|westjava: so,I dont like ur 3@C pd,S said...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or West's 1@C opening :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: good judgement|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,S will bid 4@S if his hand @CAxxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think i'd try @D3 lead - but don't really like any choices|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been hard by the 12 if S runned one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or if North had short @H then try 4@S|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Rodal:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yup it's Ogust, named after Harold Ogust|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from convention card, i think 2@D= 1-suit  @H/@S|pg||
nt|woozle: or maybe not...spade to Q, diamond up, South winning the king, another spade to kill East's hand|pg||
nt|woozle: diamonds still blocked...likely to go down|pg||
nt|afulton: because it was as you said... showed weak opener with @S + minor |pg||
nt|raghavan: SK |pg||
pc|c9|nt|afulton: when South bid 3@c, west assumed the minor was @d|pg||
nt|afulton: since @d ARE a girl's best friend!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Play trump |pg||
pc|cK|nt|patricck: the 3NT tells Nunn there is stuff wasted in @H, but he has such a nice hard it is difficult to give up there|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|westjava: sry,Ogust:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Par contract achieved - well done|pg||
nt|idblu: but E bypassed his S!'s|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: Just behinde Lillik:)|pg||
nt|patricck: oops....nice hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: In case we were wondering whether N would ever show his long suit. :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|raghavan: N to play Trump|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idblu: @H's|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Operation successful...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who hates leads away from Jack so much -- he complains even when it is right!!|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D isn't as good as 6@C, because the @D losers could have been discarded on AKQ@S, probably both were doomed tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because likes hands if partner has @H   i.e. 2@S=pass/correct|pg||
nt|raghavan: reduce the ruffing |pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: can either set up @c or use cross ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: previous board : 3@H was not so bad, super accepting can actually make slam bidding harder, since you dont hear partners natural bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, that 27-point 2NT making 3 was worth 6 to Australia and we're tied through five comparisons.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No problem for declarer here. Certainly easier than 3NT so good judgment by East|pg||
pc|d8|nt|westjava: ahaaa...so do I Al|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Martin:)|pg||
nt|idblu: OK...some specs sugg that|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can ruff 2 Spades and twice finesse Clubs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't play that :(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|westjava: 1 imp gain to Japan   20|pg||
nt|mariner1: I too do not like those, especially low from a J if p did not bid or imply the suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence from East because her spade spots mean the suit can't be run if she switches and partner has an entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have used 4@C cue to show slam interest over 3@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: A much more competitive (sense a theme?) OR auction on 19 ended in the same place, 3@H making for a push.|pg||
nt|raghavan: He should have played immediately after SA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  Best play is probably to start with KS as West is more likely than East to be void|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would lead and also play trumps|pg||
nt|afulton: i visited Macau back in 1989... beautiful country!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately it gives away the 12th trick here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just anoter flat board :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|nigel_k:  Doesn't matter if they're 2-1 of course|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|westjava: agree Rob|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: West did imply @H with DBL|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|westjava: good trump means 4@H :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Now diamond, overtaken, diamond jack, spade exit for down one|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: if you bid 4@H over 3@D you also cause an issue to N since S has 4 keys and Q@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: when p bids transfer to @H your hand is game level automatically|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|westjava: but at a minimum 5@H over 3@S, again from M...meesage, I have everything to cue|pg||

nt|werge: Lucky @C-slam|pg||

nt|werge: Should be an easy job, these 450|pg||
nt|haans: yes see no problem|pg||
nt|april7: E should have taken Q of @C and @C|pg||
nt|buddyshah:  E could have defeated this by discarding a D earlier & a club later?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brgpro: coffee board coming up|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt would need a careful @C play..small to J first time|pg||

nt|milton_se: 6H by South making but not by North (D lead)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and what did you find out? -2?|pg||
nt|henryb: not the dummy you want opposite a 2N opener|pg||

mb|d|nt|athene: yes, boring 3nt|pg||

nt|henryb: some danger of getting too high now, I would think|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes massi VuGr operator - your work is difficult - esp when they claim and close the hands|pg||
nt|henryb: except N got there first!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf there also 1HX -1 = 200|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N = both minors weak|pg||
nt|raghavan: S 10 is a stopper in Spade|pg||
nt|xenya: a srewd observation by a kibitzer -- perhaps NS were trying to match Meckwell's style|pg||

nt|raghavan: May reach slam in H|pg||
nt|panja: 6@H 6@C for NS, but in 6@S...EW might not do badly...3 down for 500 instead of -1430?|pg||

nt|raghavan: will S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|murat: or Dbl maybe|pg||
nt|april7: if S bids 2NT then N will give him ofcourse the 3d|pg||
nt|murat: dbl would be no sense actually|pg||
nt|april7: the question also is whether N can have a 4card @S suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They are in 4@H in Open|pg||
nt|werge: Not any longer...|pg||
nt|haans: thay have  5@C  profitable|pg||
nt|werge: How many boards the full distance?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 14 this segment|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 14 later on|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: N must XX?|pg||
nt|panja: W is not very tolerant though, he wants to have his say in the matter|pg||
nt|athene: pretty boring 3nt here with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be unlikely to sell out to 2@S sitting East|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D now perhaps all end|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D looks negative one except you are forced to play the @DA|pg||
nt|haans: singel K again :)|pg||
nt|haans: more likely 4@S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the losers will be eliminated tonight|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the winners move on to the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|petere: North thinking of slam ... or ordering a coffee ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: but will Henner resist the spades?|pg||
nt|april7: now we hav e it|pg||
nt|werge: A BIG 2 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3N makes with @S 4 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may mean @D + 1 more|pg||
nt|mcarroll: He just bid 5@D not redbl|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and flat boards are not what they need|pg||
nt|werge: Prefer coffee|pg||
nt|haans: clubs 3-1 do not like that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: To get 40 imps in 6 boards is a very tough ask|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb: even so, I think two aces is too mich opposite 2@c not to be trying for if not driving to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: again, W's pass looks timid|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||
nt|ady: likely tgo end 3NT   or 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT shows 22/23 balanced|pg||
nt|raghavan: I feel VUL overcall of 2C should be good suit go for 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: not a really hilarious match |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@H can be beaten with a spade ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to late to bid @H now|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Welland Welland wont play there|pg||
nt|ahh: nothing much in this 1 for Sweden to cheer |pg||
nt|werge: 3 x @D´s is bad for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wwalter: payback time :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
nt|milton_se: now she should|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 2@d shows some values, they play 2@H as a double negative. Not that anything matters on this hand.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I assume E is thinking, not N|pg||
nt|werge: Match might get closer...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry my eyes did deceive me they were one board ahead of this table|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c is not so easy to defeat|pg||
nt|raghavan: Talf - I agree it should be more down Both rooms defense was noy perfecr|pg||
nt|rnc: It looks like the previous match, where down 3 was more or less an average result :)|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @S is sold for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=796&qphase=32&qroundno=1|pg||
nt|don paulus: trump promotion :)|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Not a single Flat board so far , however unidirectional , good going herbst :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: that would be law going too far|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR declarer played a spade towards the queen to create the entry to take the losing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c seems to be a transfer to @d|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h is down a lot, and with partner opening, South may double|pg||
nt|xenya: being pretty certain NS will bid game in OR|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  -  Swiss A Round 6 running scores|pg||
nt|mariner1: Denmark 17  Harangozo 2  3 boards to score in other match|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some here|pg||
nt|xenya: can't see how it can be made -- but quite a few variations here|pg||
nt|fann4: it seems clear to ask for aces.|pg||
nt|haans: i had expected EW to bid|pg||
nt|panja: South will have to take a shot, too much science might be counterproductive|pg||
nt|werge: So 130 for Nederland|pg||
nt|haans: yes i found a couple of aces |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@C a popular contract this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: will need some ood views and maybe some pressure play for this one to roll in|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 5@C is hardly profitable when it costs 500|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt slaminvite no singel?|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT is the second-last bid, I would make with the North-hand, only pass is worse|pg||
nt|sybarra: may be a slim chance here if n/s do not get to slam |pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||
nt|wwalter: after this board will come a friendly chat on EW :)|pg||
nt|april7: 10 easy tricks ready for claim|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2NT wont make either...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: therefore trying 3NT :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S + 3@H + 2@D + 3@C = 9|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@D + 3aces = 6|pg||
nt|haans: you may seee it that way 2 :))|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh very favourable lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: E really doesnt have a good lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: J of @H maybe |pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|s9|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Hauge now leads the other semifinal 60-50 with (i think) 5 boards to compare|pg||
nt|ritong: 3Nt = i do not like @ss|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|daman: A @C will|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am going to back Michel to make this one|pg||
nt|kurtove: he may try to get entry on qsp, but will go -1 then|pg||
nt|haans: looks natural|pg||
nt|henryb: everything|pg||
nt|star6ija: interesting case of misreading at page 20 of http://eurobridge.org/bulletin/09_1%20Sanremo/pdf/Bul_08.pdf|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so we need 15 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|werge: They WILL not - they allready did it...|pg||
nt|mariner1: transportation and a lack of winners is the issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: duck @c lead @c lead small @D helps, double dummy though it is|pg||
nt|rnc: South must be delighted (and surprised) seeing partner bid @Hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: east had difficult choice of leads but i would have unimaginatively advanced my fourth best spade|pg||
nt|ahh: so this will be a dot board   or 1 imp at most |pg||
nt|raghavan: How did OR manage to make 10 tricks -Martin / Hanns|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
nt|ady: lay down A@H    and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now no cue bid of Clubs so stopped probably|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a better contract than 4@c|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||
nt|charles_l: lots down here|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is cold, but uptricks are heavy at that point  so she considers the best way to gather a max of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: but who would lead that?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Full resault service from the Open Europeian Championship. Bookmark it: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: note that North's @CQ, @DK are useful, but hard to find in bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S should be the "big" bid |pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this can be made|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is nice judgement... option for 6 IMPs back|pg||
nt|rnc: The @H-discard and the @H8 is telling bad news|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the 8@H does not warm E's heart much|pg||
nt|rnc: :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: not winning that @c in dummy also cost a trick in tempo|pg||
nt|xenya: it does look like a complex hand?|pg||
nt|fann4: There is talk that in the OR they may be playing control responses to 2@C - hence the leap to 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  off they go |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead?|pg||
nt|pelu: they play a lot of tranfers after takeout X - so it looklike trandfer here also|pg||
nt|newmoon: good tenaces in dummy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same in Open|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamond lead looks very dangerous to me|pg||
nt|werge: Even without the promotion only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|buddyshah: @D 2 anyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|april7: everycard except K of @D is ok|pg||
nt|don paulus: if you know for sure your p had 2 @d to start with|pg||
nt|don paulus: signal low - high = 2 ( 4 ?)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: she might try leading @H9|pg||
nt|athene: or leading small to @H10|pg||
nt|athene: that still gives time to lead to @HK later|pg||
nt|wwalter: I hope the chairs will not fly :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment if you play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|milton_se: this needs some help -- doubt that he'll get it|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has nothing to discard on the 9@d when it becomes good|pg||
nt|hedyg: should lose 1@d, 1@c and 2@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how he can avoid it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What does E expect from his partner? the X over 3@c is silly with so bad majors|pg||
nt|henryb: he expects partner to have half the missing points|pg||
nt|werge: I would have "unblocked" the @D K from dummy, can´t hurt|pg||
nt|panja: well. N could have @SKQ |pg||
nt|rnc: There will be a quick claim soon|pg||
nt|sharkey: Behrens didn't fancy leading from @SJ - may players share his view in leading from Jxxx|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@s +1 last board so 6 imps to U'Rourke|pg||
nt|lestergold: leading from an unbid four card major seems normal to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: leading ronm a three card minor to the ace much less attractive to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but the lead is from Jxxx  which most of us hate|pg||
nt|lestergold: usually gives declarer a tempo if not a trick because hes likely to be wanting to srt up tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you know N is prepared for a @S lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: we all hate it shirley but sometimes that is the lead you are dealt|pg||
nt|haans: many of us do not like p to lead from Jxxx (not us) :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Yes me to but I think Bertens listened to Levins 3NT and think he has good @ss|pg||
nt|raghavan: Good AN Shirley and Hans - sorry for late - I was held up in Macau tourney|pg||
nt|haans: did u win?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not being a results merchant but it happens to be the best lead on the hand in pfractice|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rag |pg||
nt|sharkey: Declare has his work cut out here as it appears @D lead actually may set up W's @D8|pg||
nt|haans: bridge has been fun here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I don't like this line at all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Why if they ruff you down in 4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt bid of value if slaminvite|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You have 10 certain tricks if hearts break no worse than 3-1|pg||
nt|werge: Was 3 NT alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|Walddk5: spade ruff, D to the ace, spade ruff|pg||
nt|haans: no alert we heard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Don't you deserve that when you don't draw one round of trumps at IMPs?|pg||
nt|petere: yessssssss but in another board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Arline I just joined the cant count club, lots pointing out to me - correctly - we have 7 boards left not 6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|don paulus: 1 @c strong - then ok|pg||
nt|henryb: which would be about 6 of them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only card from E is now @sQ |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now it´s expensive if N finds the @h shift|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in same spot here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Haans|pg||
nt|ahh: hoping either red suit splits 3 3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: thats ok Martin,  I have been member for sometime |pg||
nt|werge: In OR same contract, but very fast 3 x @D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb: Allix amazingly passive. I wonder what Neve would have done with the @dQ in addition|pg||
nt|athene: they probably play that you complete the transfer with any weak NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I hope they do not play odd even discards|pg||
nt|panja: and less @H's|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: hmm|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not this way but???|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: I win|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N might have made it easier for S by doubling 4@S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||
nt|athene: it gives up the legitimate play in the suit of @HQx / @HJx with east|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: this might give west time to get his long spade set up|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence take @CA, @S, three hearts|pg||
nt|haans: u sure do|pg||
nt|milton_se: if 1NT is 12-14, North is certainly worth 4C|pg||
nt|april7: preparing a squeeze which doesn't exist|pg||
nt|newmoon: who said a 10 counts for no points?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but Welland leading a spade|pg||
nt|afulton: >expresso to Martin|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: the defence can actually stop declarer ducking a club into east's hand with certainty|pg||
nt|athene: west goes in with @CJ if declarer leads low from hand and east plays @C10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: but of course everything works for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: she may have a nasty moment but she can't go down :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she's thinking about discard|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauri-Versace bid and maded 5@Cs on board 17 = +6IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: With this lead makes 6|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|jeanhari: oeps|pg||
nt|haans: i am right :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it|pg||
nt|haans: still long way|pg||
nt|haans: boring|pg||
nt|ahh: if they switched to @C  has to depend on @D 3 3 |pg||
nt|afulton: But stop and think... how many imps swap hands in average match? |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|werge: Stiff @C King by North was tried - no lucky decision this time|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you mean wellan gets closer to 50 imps?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: almost all routes go to 500|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that woulod mean 12 to welland|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: im saying its not bad in theory because your long spade figures to be a trick |pg||
nt|sharkey: nice duck!|pg||
nt|raghavan: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sharkey: N actually played @D&??|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: It was obvious that E held the ace so it doesn't cost anything playing the 6... just an extra chance, E doesn't have any entrance anyway|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans why there is no movement in the screen?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they think |pg||
nt|haans: usually claiming time|pg||
nt|sybarra: Levin thinking |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|raghavan: He has not come to claim time - He has to get 3 H tricks, 2S+DK+CA|pg||
nt|haans: hard thinking|pg||
nt|haans: @C10?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course Levin doesn't know @S finesse is working|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|nubmaster: He sees only 8 trick at this moment|pg||
nt|afulton: while the end result may be close, it is often 50-80 or more|pg||
nt|joemanjo: per deal?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jeanhari: south could know there was not much chance for north to have 3 spades, which he needs if switching to a spade|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but easy to see from the sidelines|pg||
nt|haans: south did not know they had 4-4 in hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: pity why N does not continue - declarer does it now |pg||
pc|c9|nt|star6ija: no difference between 150 and 130|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|davidstern: With a spade through he would again have to cash the @DA|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d to cut the communications|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davidstern: Claim -1?|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprise may be corrected|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so another 2 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can make it now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|xenya: i think "strong but not forcing to game" means something lice Acol 2, Shirley -- in this case |pg||
nt|raghavan: He may A Heart |pg||
nt|xenya: is he about to make it now?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|milton_se: over now -- down|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace was actually on his way to slam but Lauria pulled the emergency brakes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To beat 4@d W has to lead a @d to duck|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @H pitch cost|pg||
nt|xenya: once he got a @D trick?|pg||
nt|afulton: not per deal, per match... we win 12, we lose 12... that =24 imps on table|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oliverc: not likely to either, given the 1@S bid from West. Even if on slim values, West likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: have either the J or Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: He rectified the count trying for 11 tricks instead of 10|pg||
nt|henryb: cash the @sA and exit the third club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still I think your analysis is correct - South should return a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: note the careful play of @SJ..caters to AT9x with West|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: W might keep the @D Q10|pg||
nt|werge: That might cost 5 IMPs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: and as always better to play AFTER :))|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but west being balanced, not bidding @H (with 2@S/3@H)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pelu: would u X on the Westhand or bid 2@S - D + 2@S gave East hope of game|pg||
nt|hedyg: now can go -2 with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for 2@S bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: as predicted|pg||
nt|athene: of course objectively this wasn't best because east "should" cover with @HJxx|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1100 and blood all over the carpet|pg||
nt|wwalter: Massimo pls tell us how is @@ the table now? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: @d now for 'only' 800, ty specs|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: E is like a fish out of water .............O look for a miracle :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ultimately he will|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree that Easts D over 3@d was not so good|pg||
nt|werge: We must admit, that for several minutes, West has been able to take 8 tricks...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb: I think it is very hard to pass that hand over 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: also good|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: pitching @S from hand on the third diamond has committed her|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry no she only needs one spade|pg||
nt|athene: she can still take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if scared that west has the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: @D2 (if honest) would indicate that|pg||
nt|athene: but i am sure west is good enough to falsecard there with @SK and NOT @CQJx|pg||
nt|haans: jean was correct yes was|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
mc|9|nt|haans: or not|pg||

mb|1C|nt|nigel_k:  This should be a routine game - it needs AC onside but there are ample values to bid it|pg||

nt|westjava: again part score hand now|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't know if W can bid 3H as a raise here...maybe he doesn't know either|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: yes, 20 vs 20|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt a bid other than 4 @H a super accept,  such as 3 @S?|pg||
nt|westjava: nice to discuss...|pg||
nt|afulton: well, i think playing against the toughest competition and studying where you went astray helps to make one better|pg||
nt|raghavan: After alond time NS getting a good deal|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 could be void @D|pg||

nt|jcwla: uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I would play it that way Shirley|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sneak attack time.|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT is an odd choice...now the spotlight is on North|pg||
nt|woozle: If I were to bid 3NT, I'd rather show a spade raise first|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 2@H is reasonable too|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@C rebid 1nt = 18-19,but he has 17 only..?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  This one should be an uneventful 4S|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: 2nt=inv 3@D=suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Presumably 2NT is because West had thoughts of slam|pg||
nt|afulton: with my partners, i like an agreement where bid of 3@s = I have very positive accept + useful doubleton (in this case, probably ace) |pg||
nt|sybarra: not the "loviest" 5/5 |pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who said 18-19?|pg||
nt|idblu: 5th @C = 1point|pg||
nt|afulton: is the 1@c bid strong opener?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|patricck: The 2@H opening is too rich even for my blood, but it must be what South expected otherwise it would have been impossible to stop. A shame since game does make|pg||
nt|woozle: North aims straight for the newspaper columns and ends up on the cutting room floor|pg||
nt|jcwla: trying to pin stiff @HQ in dummy - matchpoint top there for e/w|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't much like the HK lead, partly because catching a bare queen might not be enough to hurt the contract anyway|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@H now trf to 2@S oppss...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer just needs to take care to ruff high on the third diamond|pg||
nt|afulton: if so, I am surprised with 15 count in south, she didn't stop to consider slam |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|jcwla: Include me out.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when you open without opening values you wind up in theses contracts which seldom make|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is a no chance game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|westjava: the older suit win:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess not :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and E is very RED|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N open = 14-16, so Shen shows 17-18|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 2 unsupported Kings and an Ace, WHY would you open?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lung will loose the first 4 tricks...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|westjava: ok|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 3@S punishing partner for balancing|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|mariner1: very RED = they are VUL and Opponents are NV|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: especially with 4@H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence playing hearts|pg||
nt|afulton: which btw, will make |pg||
pc|d7|nt|westjava: again,3@H trf to 3@S opps:)|pg||
nt|afulton: 6@c looks odds on here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary u said slam - they made 6|pg||
nt|afulton: 6N works, but is a bit riskier|pg||
nt|raghavan: He said open chat " Here is a slam for NS|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|westjava: 2 imps gain to Indonesia from   6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HJ as lavental?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This is going to get them all the matchpoints|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  Not only South can ruff but declarer will be cut off from dummy's hearts after drawing trumps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has underbid is my opinion - It does not show 11 points -1A+2K and 3 cd support|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  That's better|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Was a free signal from N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difficult decision at trick 1 -- especially since declarer is supposed to hold 5@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Aint with u there Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think driving force should have been -- it looks like @C running |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i actually agree with call for @HJ|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,and what decl thinking about?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South should be curious about North overtake to return trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if singleton - why not try to promote partner's length, if doubleton, then must have control of @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer also thinks @C finesse not working??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|patricck: down here at the bottom of the world the blood rushes to our heads Jordan :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The nine was an unnecessary risk but still high enough as West has the 10|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@H is one thing, 3 is another.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: ? hardly underbid, he opened on nothing for a statr|pg||
nt|raghavan: and on 3H South should pass having minimum|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: You're just THAT sure that this hand is producing 9 and 9 only tricks, that the "chance" (I'd say expectation) of 300 extra points is not worth risking 50 for an undertrick?|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome to Rodal from Norway|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|h3|pg||

nt|mariner1: well S could have had K@S though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hi all delayed at tournament sorry @H|pg||

pc|s8|pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: hi Liliek|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|nt|nigel_k:  Now three spade losers as declarer can't reach the hearts and has to play spades himself|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  Yes they have all gone :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: i don't see how south's trump holding should affect north's play|pg||

nt|wwalter: W should say vwdp :), as declar :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: He still slepping since 10 o'clock:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like it Vlad |pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand could be trouble  |pg||

nt|kurtove: cu|pg||

nt|oliverc: true. nothing lost, anyway|pg||
nt|newmoon: as the cards lie, 6-level in a red suit makeable|pg||
nt|haans: slam? they need it|pg||
nt|raghavan: What for this 1400> As E I would pass 2NT bid and see what S bids|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good reward for his enterprise|pg||
nt|haans: yes and fun bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session|pg||
nt|xenya: and another good score for Herbst from OR|pg||
nt|rnc: Two boards to go|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|rnc: Another slam, this time for EW|pg||
nt|haans: once again + zone|pg||
nt|panja: this is often a dilemma for bidding with fits..if you bid too slowly, opps come in, if you bid too fast, you lose the scientific base|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - same result = no swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or ready for lunch |pg||
nt|haans: or both|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: heres another 5 level contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: He made only 9 How in other room +1?|pg||
nt|ahh: ok  to score in 1s if 14 boards left |pg||
nt|petere: trump now brings 1 IMP ... (?)|pg||
nt|petere: could have, should have, did not :(|pg||
nt|haans: i think they were claiming|pg||
nt|werge: Claiming is a good tactic|pg||
nt|haans: sure is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Early and often|pg||
nt|petere: why? could can't manage revokes on BBO !!|pg||
nt|petere: you can'|pg||
nt|haans: never with only three cards continue is quicker|pg||
nt|werge: Now 9|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 1st Flat board|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lucky:)|pg||
nt|werge: For psychological reasons, Texan Aces need 1½-2 swing in the last five boards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb: Neve closing in on win|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 14+ f1|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deals 16, 17, 18 1ll push - same in OR too|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Let us see how S bids and N responds|pg||
nt|april7: E might bid @S over @H from N,but as I see S bids @S|pg||
nt|jeanhari: another chance here for some points|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|rnc: both tables open 1@D, the slight differens Rodwell did it as North|pg||
nt|xenya: i think EW may well get to 4@H now |pg||
nt|werge: The US-team opens 1 @D at both tables!!!|pg||
nt|xenya: and if they do, they are likely to make it|pg||
nt|rnc: Both teams were tied for 31th before the previous board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that didnot go down|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: slam but 2 finesses|pg||
nt|raghavan: 16 IMPs lost|pg||

nt|jeanhari: 10 to be precise|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Zia is also on the Welland team, but he is not a morning person. Roy (West) playing with his wife, Christal Henner-Welland, in this match. She is also a strong player|pg||

nt|fann4: OR  1@C (3@S) 6@H (6@S); dbl all pass|pg||
nt|haans: 6@S what does bid mean now|pg||
nt|fann4: This 4NT looks like ordinary Blackwood perhaps. Many would play it as quantitive.|pg||
nt|haans: not on the net i assure you|pg||
nt|fann4: 6@s dbled going for 1100|pg||
nt|panja: good idea, but there has to be something for Aces...also...E hasn't checked about Spade values....W could come up with !Kxx..and there would be no slam|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm sure that this EW pair know exactly what 4NT means in this sequence.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: If he played so nice by ducking @d and then failed like this...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Have Levin/Hamson played together previously Shirley?|pg||
nt|werge: Duty calling... hi|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C gf relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 3Nt should be played from S hand here..to protect the @HK|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam on 21 in OR either|pg||
nt|sybarra: that double game swing will haunt then |pg||
nt|davidstern: Results can be found at http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm|pg||
nt|davidstern: And you Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: @HKx favourably placed, and @D's 3-3.   But will he... ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 14 top tricks on the @d finesse|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3NT by S makes|pg||
nt|ahh: east might double for the lead  if he can |pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: B22: lead @HQ = 9 toptricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: *them|pg||
nt|xenya: they got to 5N there though|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.2 sekund faster :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are fast!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Murat|pg||
nt|murat: i wish i knew.. :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: wonderful hand - Grand slam in H with 1 finesse . So atleast 6 H must be bid let us see|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will bid 4 now|pg||
nt|aupillon: French open doesn't|pg||
nt|haans: they have slam but no trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: good news for allix|pg||
nt|ritong: he sweated just two seconds|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|milton_se: will probably make after some battle|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is nice to have a known person by our side|pg||
nt|oliverc: It's like watching Klingons bidding :)|pg||
nt|murat: i got an answer from the audince "diams. +4 +11 hcp"|pg||
nt|april7: if 2@C is not forcing, why doesn't S pass|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|haans: diamond???|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like only red aces for E/W|pg||
nt|MolvaM: slam would have been good if @cQ would be inside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score may be another flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u win 9 out of 10 .)|pg||
nt|april7: very odd bidding|pg||
nt|murat: i guess NS is a Polish pair which i know nothing about them|pg||
nt|henryb: it is a 5 or 7 hand on a club lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if not vulnerable, I had bid 1@d as W, but now - no|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H still a make|pg||
nt|star6ija: no, correct defense will defeat it|pg||
nt|raghavan: well that settles - S may pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C being Puppet for 5 card Major I assume|pg||
nt|haans: double relays are not proper|pg||
nt|buddyshah: other table 3N -1 |pg||
nt|don paulus: pass ?|pg||
nt|werge: Luck for E/W, that they can play in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: would you raise?|pg||
nt|ritong: or try no trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets guess ( nothing in CC) that 2NT asks for force|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Hedy / when 2@H ) GF / then 2NT forcing >(>(|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tobias - is this team in a chance for reaching SF > If u feel so, send me the file  Editor@@BridgeIndia.com  |pg||
nt|april7: a nice @C contract going down the drain|pg||
nt|jeanhari: and miss vuln game|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@C keeps them low but not in best spot|pg||
nt|fann4: Anyone know what 5@D means.|pg||
nt|fann4: Shows you what know:)|pg||
nt|haans: if 4nt quant 5@D natural|pg||
nt|panja: 4-card suit..|pg||
nt|panja: the pause suggests there is some gap in understanding|pg||
nt|haans: i have suggestions 4NT = nat or minor|pg||
nt|haans: did 3@C show 4@H only?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and by north|pg||
nt|haans: yes some play puppet |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 11 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but not today|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3NT by N beauty other 3 suits J and 10 are there to support|pg||
nt|haans: i was one double in 4@H relay play 4@H xx +2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: strong club and negative - now is 1@H any 20+?|pg||
nt|panja: S made it very easy, ok if 1@S is limited|pg||
nt|charles_l: S shows she can psyche 1@d too|pg||
nt|panja: if 1@S could be stronger, NS could easily lose a 6@C slam|pg||
nt|athene: now Allerton gets a chance to make his second rebid :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Three bids on the 11 count?  No.|pg||
nt|athene: but he declines it|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't think 2@D shows extras in that position|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt sort of limited your hand?|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like a flat board|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d relay again|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play low|pg||
nt|milton_se: AD and D -- let them play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Develop a D trick may play A and small D|pg||
nt|haans: slam here is desperado bridge|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 27 - 4C down here OR 3S-2  gain of 5 IMP to Apteker|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5 or 7! with a @c lead  there is no slam|pg||
nt|aupillon: oui|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead agin helps declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andrei Varlan|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead = expensive|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: or perhaps 4+ hearts, forcing, á la Meckwell|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10 fast, but could be 11 :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 11 on this lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't like N's sequence here. |pg||
nt|ady: thats the winning bid by west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: 3NT is possible, don't think you have a raise|pg||
nt|ritong: well it is a matter of @d length with east, i think|pg||
nt|ritong: suppose east has two @ds, it probably will be better in @s|pg||
nt|ady: needs an accurate defence to beat 4 spades if leading clubs   msut not play 3rd club   or will later be end played  after trumps drawn and a diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming south does not hold six|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT is the logical contract|pg||
nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|haans: And I would also like to thank Dr. Raghavan, Momchil Aleksandrov and Sid Ismail my  co-commentator |pg||
nt|haans: And of course all you KIBITZERS  for watching We trust you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @d finess fails|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The failure to bid 4@H (on the same auction) at the other table is very surprising|pg||
nt|jeanhari: stronge comeback from Welland|pg||
nt|haans: looks well for game|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, the layout is friendly, but the bidding tells you that - the spade finesse will work, as will the clubs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding and lead in Open|pg||
nt|haans: this is a boring board|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello all |pg||
nt|MolvaM: safe stop by garner-henner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi andrei|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S is in 4@H in Open|pg||
nt|haans: no slam now|pg||
nt|sybarra: same lead as in the OR|pg||
nt|afulton: couple of ways to make 10 tricks... after you find that @s are friendly (J is marked finesse), duck @c and that breaks nicely|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: lots of tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showed Diamonds|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C? - who knows|pg||
nt|star6ija: no... this @h 8 with e is an obstacle|pg||
nt|daman: the pain of missing a vul game will not go away too quickly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Andreai|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|haans: @S @H squeeze?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and into the soup we go  |pg||
nt|henryb: Only one of the four pairs on vg managed to reach even 6@c|pg||
nt|dcbutler: but doesn't E rate to be short in diamonds?|pg||
nt|raghavan: we both thought the same|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 7 with the @d finesse working, 5 otherwise unless the clubs are 6-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: They  are heading for slam|pg||
nt|daman: N was almost worth a xx|pg||
nt|rnc: I think North is halfway to a heart attack now|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C puppet is Bergen style|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello Murat :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|charles_l: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|wwalter: a fast claim now :)|pg||
nt|ady: good result for Badger|pg||
nt|haans: board 10 will decide :)))|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks  possible, but normally 11 |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans one more deal is there apart from this |pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx all, and hope the kibs enjoyed this session.   Motto: "Capitalize on opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: with S*|pg||
nt|haans: yes good trumps :)|pg||
nt|haans: youi never never know what relayer have|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans can u tell me why S should not bid 2S (showing 6cds and minimum opening instead 2H)|pg||
nt|ahh: this contract ok  |pg||
nt|petere: 4@H against 6-0 ... what a nice story ;-)|pg||
nt|werge: Too hot in Copenhagen|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: ok 1@H natural F1 by the look of it|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light opener, ok.  1NT rebid, the misdescription starts.  Passing 2@C carries the connotation you're fine defending that, again, not my cup of tea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 4 imps for Neve|pg||
nt|athene: should make this even if he tries to drop @CKx with north|pg||
nt|star6ija: let us see anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: yes indeed passing 3@H deserves a loss|pg||
nt|jeanhari: play still interesting...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: north think a lot on this turn of 10|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H 1 suiter of hearts as second suit|pg||
nt|raghavan: There is no 2nd suit|pg||
nt|haans: not this time|pg||
nt|haans: 21D may have a minor|pg||
nt|haans: what an error|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Quite an achievement|pg||
nt|petere: @Hs wrong sided opened|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|murat: i'm having some informations.. Polish pair was a part of Polish Bermuda Bowl team last year..|pg||
nt|raghavan: which finess to take|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, South leapt straight to 6@S, but that was after his pard bid 3@S over 1@C, not a strong NT.|pg||
nt|haans: do u think all do u know?|pg||
nt|sharkey: showing?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you agree with 3@s?|pg||
nt|buddyshah: this will make or 1 OT|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: then everything else natural|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brgpro: sorry, was away|pg||
nt|raghavan: same by declarer too!!!|pg||
nt|milton_se: As did South|pg||
nt|raghavan: W has to play Spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is so 6-1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: what finesse to take after being in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: well another swing to Herbst, they are on a roll|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - such boards schould be cancelled|pg||
nt|haans: talk about that very long ago|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They certainly played it fast in Open|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, looks like 14|pg||
nt|afulton: boards, that is|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|pelu: they have all cards / but missing 2 Aces / so they will stop|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s was Blackwood, 5@d is two key cards without the @hQ|pg||
nt|daman: unless 3@C shows this hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|brgpro: she went down...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spades I would think|pg||
nt|rnc: The only good thing for NS is that 4@C is making while 3NT wasn't. |pg||
nt|sybarra: asking 5 card major |pg||
pc|dK|nt|dcbutler: fortunate the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|milton_se: y and E has to play 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Going good till now for S - should start on trumps now|pg||
nt|daman: if so, I would have ventured 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: game force |pg||
pc|d2|nt|milton_se: hasn't this relay sequence made clear that 2 aces are missing??|pg||
nt|raghavan: Knowing their system will help in good commenting by us|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now N can see 5 or 7|pg||
nt|jeanhari: to much soft valuas, like redbl more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: north said 4@c is forcing and south ........pass :)|pg||
nt|haans: asking for 5 card or strong four carder|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - I wud have bid Stayman I guess...|pg||
nt|sybarra: on N?? |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, She ran @h9...that needs @h8 on side and one of the @hQJ, less chance than playing @h to the K i think|pg||
nt|athene: well, given time declarer can come to three hearts, three clubs, @SK, @DAK|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they know, they play turbo and Fantoni has shown 1 keycard|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that most of the relays are distribution and HCP / not Aces|pg||
nt|haans: you really know a lot hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT over 4@s would have shown an even nr of keycards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would have gone 4@s myself at these colors|pg||
nt|haans: happy soon|pg||
nt|april7: I think that E is too weak for this bid, beca,use it asks for @H lead and should have a better suit and more points,its a penalty X|pg||
nt|werge: YES!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: better use for controls than hcp, I'd say|pg||
nt|star6ija: all was gone|pg||
nt|haans: once i did open 2@D 3rd with 4 carder only way for them to go down |pg||
nt|petere: @Ds will squeeze dummy first|pg||
nt|haans: @C to A |pg||
nt|haans: endplaying W|pg||
nt|petere: 11 tricks, 1 IMP|pg||
nt|werge: Match even closer then|pg||
pc|d6|nt|april7: defence should make at least 6 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If that finesse loses, you should hopefully be able to ruff a spade to try the heart finesse next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West will be very unhappy about that trick|pg||
nt|daman: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @S holding brings this one home with the up trick |pg||
nt|afulton: yes, the showout by East makes it a marked finesse|pg||
nt|afulton: as long as south doesnt pitch incorrectly! |pg||
nt|afulton: (from dummy)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: going for the immediate spade pitch|pg||
nt|hedyg: any 5 level bid shows an odd number|pg||
nt|haans: knowlege at this ttable|pg||
nt|sybarra: you only have xxx, aqx, in majors |pg||
nt|aupillon: Sorry , only arriving, i'll tell you|pg||
nt|haans: trying endplay is wrong|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pelu: perfect shift by Bocchi|pg||
nt|athene: now|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna can t give an entry to a declarer with singleton @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes count me in too|pg||
nt|xenya: i like the auction in the other room (3@S instead of DBL) much better|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am a Fantunes fan :)|pg||
nt|lesrays: it's hard to imagine a guy who is 40 up going wrong.....|pg||
nt|afulton: I really don't understand this line...|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why he ducked |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it is real ......|pg||
nt|lesrays: he's going to take the rest|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oliverc: Well I have their CC up on screen now, but I suspect we'll not be hugely wiser|pg||
nt|oliverc: except where opening bids are concerned|pg||
nt|newmoon: well played  :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|afulton: why weren't @s tested before cashing @cK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: now the defence are poised to take three spades and two clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: even with the @S switch (looks odd), this is down 1|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't put diamonds 6-2 on this auction!|pg||
nt|ritong: so my guess is a @h comes|pg||
nt|haans: i have their full system Will read it some day :))|pg||
nt|hedyg: by then they will have changed it|pg||
nt|milton_se: so not even bad bidding makes you doubt? :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubt in Fantunes???? never!|pg||
nt|haans: give me you mail adress|pg||
nt|hedyg: having already shown a @c control earlier Fantoni with the 5@d bid showed an odd nr of keycards and @d control|pg||
nt|haans: have it now|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5 rounds and not knowing that before...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if no @d ruff now he can claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: you know nr of keycards before Bertil?|pg||
nt|milton_se: with a relay system, certainly|pg||
nt|hedyg: a different relay system|pg||
nt|hedyg: their system seems to work fine for them|pg||
nt|haans: but few have decided to play it|pg||
nt|milton_se: I wouldn't like to be in 5 on that...|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West will be very happy about THAT trick|pg||
nt|haans: and then 3@C further asking 3nt show 4333 then|pg||
nt|haans: sober?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: next match in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|haans: by p overruff 4 @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am with Vlad|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps this is not available in NS's system here?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: 12|pg||
nt|henryb: showing off|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: now the trump promo on the spade|pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|haans: right :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: @D ruff|pg||
nt|petere: a lot of bets in the audience ...|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: could declarer have squeezed Bocchi in hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: exit with a spade at that poit|pg||
nt|athene: point|pg||
nt|athene: now if Sabine cashes, she kills her partner|pg||
nt|raghavan: All EW trumps can win tricks now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|milton_se: or S|pg||
nt|haans: we agree with u|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so last board coming up|pg||
nt|mcarroll: so an imp saved|pg||
nt|werge: No change - still close|pg||
nt|petere: I lost ... as did all the other :)|pg||
nt|haans: cry for u :)|pg||
nt|haans: break?|pg||
nt|petere: another coffee|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good idea|pg||
pc|h4|nt|raghavan: OR - they bid and made 6D +1|pg||
nt|sybarra: this way you find your 5/3 fit if you have one |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 5@h in Open room|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - I'm getting this mixed up|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|nt|murat: so some new imps of No Name|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: well, no chance now for sure|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: thought N had 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C stayman + 3@C next asking rebid you M if 5 carder|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hans, that is not standard |pg||
nt|werge: Now a show-up @C-finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|xenya: if the card in trick 1 were shown correctly, W should now E had a singleton @H|pg||
nt|xenya: *cards|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|don paulus: it all looked so promising :(|pg||
nt|milton_se: costly mistake|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: from kibs: Why didn't Sabine take the @CQ and play @SQ??? - help partner!|pg||
nt|raghavan: In other room 3C bid and made|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats one way to play it |pg||
pc|c3|pc|hT|nt|afulton: yes, he will take the rest but not the easy way|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: yes the lead gave away the overtrick, double-dummy|pg||
nt|werge: But no use|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|raghavan: Yes costly - |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pg||

nt|jcwla: Hi Rodal.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very tough job for the operator when they play fast so well done to undo and give us the correct play|pg||
nt|idblu: I'm glad Al does his homework :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 6@C of course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 100% blame to North dear Ragha|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary South did not show much values - It is all South's fault|pg||
nt|raghavan: Soory N did not show much values|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 8 deals played both rooms - China 27 and Indonesia 4 IMP|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NO, south had a full opening hand and his pard had opened|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: what do you open with West??|pg||
nt|idblu: Pass 4 me|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Interesting on board 8, at this table they invited game after a 2H opening and the other table passed a 3H opening|pg||
nt|westjava: Thai get 6 imps from   8,3@H only there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this 3@D going to get them to 4@S?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Given my record I won't predict another routine 4S|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case there was thought behind it but likely no swing as that contract will probably (hopefully?) not be duplicated in the OR.|pg||
nt|woozle: 13 top tricks for NS, if they care to bid it|pg||
nt|jcwla: Up to N - S will not accept an invite.|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura might just give up and bid seven if he doesn't have the machinery to avoid it intelligently|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: well if cards sat better EW then NS would have 12|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: go on it looks sane|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S all make sense|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: AND he had a 5 card suit so..100% North who should never open|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12-14NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: interesting Neg DBL holding 5@S also|pg||
nt|afulton: another interesting east west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=8-13 or 16+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C asks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S doing well here to compete in spades|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not sure how Stayman helps...maybe I'll find out|pg||
nt|jcwla: 23 a push at 4@S making 5.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: next|pg||
nt|bebechira: E will bring this home on D lead... |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@S & 8-10|pg||
nt|westjava: I think so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and e/w might never find the @C suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd vote for 1@H or 1@S -- just not sure which is better|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nigel_k:  Ha|pg||
nt|bebechira: he has 3h+2c+2d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at least i think should be 8-10|pg||
nt|mariner1: S should bid game now....... dual fit and short @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt know about clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H a little timid I think|pg||
nt|afulton: played carefully, NS can make 5@H, losing only @d + @c|pg||
nt|afulton: oh good, just what you want to hear when you bid stayman... partner answering you in your stiff |pg||
nt|raghavan: This lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|afulton: yes|pg||
nt|afulton: it will allow Hsien to hold the @c losers to 1 while establishing the suit|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: another guess coming -- 3@H shows 2 top honors in @S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh the double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Ok the double was just to test us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prompted by?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Sorry no dbl, just tht all pass and press DK = dbl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H transfer after the DBL|pg||
nt|sybarra2: again the @H is transfer?|pg||
nt|idblu: if I had to...1@S for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I think East was looking for slam there actually :)|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@C best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there enough tricks if @D discard?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|nigel_k:  just a club guess for the overtrick|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,K of @C on side...|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick in the same 3@D contract earned China 1 IMP on 20.|pg||
nt|patricck: their cc does say 2@H can be 0-8, so maybe Nunn was scared it was even worse than that|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not enough from West unfortunately|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: had us excited operator|pg||
nt|westjava: not too late...|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does a good job|pg||
mb|4H|nt|nigel_k:  After QC wins declarer has to guess whether N has doubleton 10 or South has doubleton King|pg||
nt|idblu: lots of handling charges|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think declarer wins the race here - but not positive|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think can handle it|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra2: draw trump and ruffing ......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may come down to the fortunate lie of NS @D|pg||
nt|idblu: can't play on @D's w/o 2 rds of trump|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't argue with success.|pg||
nt|woozle: Some spectators are admiring North's auction, but I still can't see that he can count 13 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: will reach to 6..?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it they reach slam level it will be a tough play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unbelivebel friendly hand for NS, but hard to reach the max|pg||
nt|woozle: All he really achieved was avoiding the indignity of playing 7NT where the four missing points were an ace|pg||
mb|6S|nt|afulton: sounds wacky but @c toward Q should have been trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W might have over taken and fired a @S back|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why not |pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard had ace of @S,  and ruff  next |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You'd actually want to be in slam with the E/W cards after South's double|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: she tries to get OT as many as possibe|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: so,be careful Hu|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c out beats 6@H and 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec asking for more guesses ---  4@C asks about @C holding  4@D=not 1st/2nd/3rd round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't explain why South asked in @C rather than @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @S were 3 2 this would have more play likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@H = 2 @S honor, so 6@S is very reasonable|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult contract tough to make|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D,that's S need...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one correct guess -- now how about 4@C??|pg||
pc|s5|nt|westjava: @C asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confirmation of my guess about 4@C only counts if it comes from the table :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: it can be made now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With the KH wrong it would fail of course|pg||
nt|afulton: here, south could have and probably should have ducked|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: suggest line of play to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that looks wrong|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to play E for Jxxx @S though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 2nd @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "no" was supposed to be "now"|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: and then what  (as martin said)|pg||
nt|afulton: but they need to be playing to make the contract|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|westjava: yes,just need 1 x @C ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: might have been wise to ruff some @H's|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|westjava: now,need @D ruff:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trying to ruff hearts looked relatively safe but she's not taking any chances|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: remember to ruff 3rd round of @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: could have ruffed a @D  and finessed for J@S and home|pg||
nt|mariner1: at least it would have been a try :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|westjava: 12 imps for 6 boards,good match|pg||
nt|sybarra: so club, over take, ace of spade (if there) and ruff,  ace of @D  =down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|allanr44: Needs @D lead (or club lead and @D switch) to hold it to 4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|idblu: spec makes a point ...why did W bid 2@S with his meagre 10 count?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the end of Round Robin 1    Indonesia 6th place with 185  Chinese Taipei 4th with 214|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China has very big lead in both Open and Ladies|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He should play three rounds of hearts now. When S doesn't follow the club position is clear|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @D come back into play|pg||
pc|dT|nt|westjava: yeah|pg||
nt|mariner1: looking good|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Immaterial if South helps by covering, though S was still trying to beat the contract|pg||
nt|afulton: east will have a marked finesse of @c ... and then concede last 2 |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|westjava: so,wd Hu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice result|pg||

nt|haans: 5@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: can they avoid 3NT?|pg||
nt|milton_se: no game here w best def|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S by N will go down on a @H ruff by W|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And well done to Hans and Jean for the perceptive comments|pg||
nt|haans: And our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|mariner1: seems best defense can beat 4@H here, so 5@C was a phantom..... though it could|pg||
nt|mariner1: have made too|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, operator can check if there is an opportunity...|pg||
nt|aupillon: Yes. 4 spades were my option on the last one. But cruelling missing a needed singleton, tough|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @s NS ?|pg||
nt|werge: Look´s like a NO-SWING BOARD|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kurtove: 5 sp is 3 down with best def|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|raghavan: This  of NS has not helped them now - they lost 5IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Massimiliano (Italy), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Jean Harings|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Netherlands), P.S. Raghavan (India), George Holland (Canada) and Roland Wald|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank the lovable kibits, co commentators George, Jean and Rob, VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO. |pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Massimiliano (Italy), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|haans: we are 14 is right|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 carder and 14 hcp is a good excuse to open 1nt always|pg||
nt|ahh: other room doubled 1nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, that might have been a good play, but Bocchi didn't need it|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S  - an unklikely contract|pg||
nt|haans: but does 4@H mean single spade|pg||
nt|haans: changed times |pg||
nt|pelu: so last board 5 IMP for Angelini = 16-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed, 30 minutes earlier than i announced, sry|pg||
nt|haans: first time 10 then 11:40 13:20 17:30 19:10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 8  here 4H made 5 Open 6H -1 so MC Leish picks up 11 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: this board can be bloddy|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C = both majors?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no possibilities to go wrong in @c|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably north will have some instrument to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5+ mi, 4ma?|pg||
nt|werge: Here a very UNlucky 4 @S E/W|pg||
nt|ahh: safe 1 off |pg||
nt|haans: EW will not stop here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope N does not bid 2H?|pg||
nt|afulton: this one should be an easy 4@s hand... tho they may try 6 |pg||
nt|afulton: when south shows 5+ spades, north with all primes should make some aggressive move|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: note that 3N is cold for NS on the last board|pg||
nt|pelu: do u like the X from S? - 2@H or 2@S (Michael) in my book|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 5@C - strong @C-suit and no @Hs ?????|pg||
nt|milton_se: that opening bid might help NS to stay low|pg||
nt|jeanhari: doesnt look like that...|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the European Bridge League (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Massimo Ortensi), and all the generous sponsors and organizers for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs!|pg||

nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@s without @h lead|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that @D8 in trick 1 ask for @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: but will have to guess the position of @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: CC says it's a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thank you all. see you on next session|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank Henry - sorry i missed him|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all for being with us... unfortunately there is some problem with the server for running scores, but I hope iy will be fixed as soon as possible|pg||

nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: THX all a lot |pg||
nt|raghavan: Rob, George and Jean It is my pleasure to be with you in this ,Spl tx to u all|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good typing Rob, tx to you too|pg||
nt|daman: N shd double|pg||
nt|fann4: A tough re-opening decision for South. He wants to act, but the @h suit is so bad.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no no was that|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C|pg||
nt|werge: - with 5 @H N/S...|pg||
nt|haans: corrected to 5@H|pg||
nt|raghavan: May be in 2D |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pass by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: xx?|pg||
nt|ahh: south will know this is weak |pg||
nt|haans: depends on what X mean|pg||
nt|haans: x as pen not common today|pg||
nt|petere: break for the operator it seems :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: elu said|pg||
nt|haans: 30 min pelu siad|pg||
nt|jeanhari: best not to pas here|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
nt|haans: and spade to short :))|pg||
nt|fann4: Trouble is, without a 3rd @S he has to plunge in with @H or stay out.|pg||
nt|haans: little action here|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW may be in trouble here|pg||
nt|raghavan: this lets w out|pg||
nt|april7: its a simple 4@S contract,where 2 @D have to be ruffed in  the N hand, so best lead is @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: corrected on our website|pg||
nt|raghavan: George N heard you|pg||

nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: welland indeed gaining 13 on 9|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|daman: can this be t/o?  no way|pg||
nt|mariner1: I pass it anyway|pg||
nt|daman: Garner got caught speeding|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I would play it as to|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may pull to 3C? of course not sure of number of clubs with E|pg||
nt|sharkey: what's E to do?|pg||
nt|haans: well done sweden|pg||
nt|ahh: looks like penalty double to me :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: 2@C not alerted so presumably improvisation|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@C natural or...?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D an underbid and 3nt not really very good|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but not alerted|pg||
nt|athene: actually i think a simple 3@D wld have been OK|pg||
nt|star6ija: and take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: s'alright. I am easily missed|pg||
nt|haans: you and we will be kick out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I am going to rule that 30 minutes = "around 15 minutes"|pg||
nt|werge: This board is against the rule: The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
nt|MolvaM: garner lying in the bushes with a good suit and a side ace|pg||
nt|aupillon: and the impossibility to show picture pattern. I agree with 1NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe hoping opps would reach 3nt|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1D loser and 2H losers|pg||
nt|werge: Right hand is playing now|pg||
nt|april7: it doesn'tmake really any difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, nice Morton's Fork possibility here|pg||
nt|brgpro: seems there was an misunderstanding of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: by playing @c4 he set up "mortons fork" - if West take @CA the 2 discards - if not: the @C-trick go away|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather unfortunate...W has sort of "Nat" @hK lead...|pg||
nt|charles_l: S might suggest it over 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: but N bids 4@h|pg||
nt|wwalter: a manly bid :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: real men bid game :) (and try to make it)|pg||
nt|panja: not an easy lead, but @C is safe|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 22 the other room reached to high in 6 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *too |pg||
nt|jcwla: Should work like a charm here if natural.|pg||
nt|athene: but west perhaps just wants to stop the club lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: it didn't|pg||
nt|henryb: N is relaying again|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Gomerov still not satisfied|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|rnc: It has been an interesting match|pg||
nt|rnc: Herbst making a huge rally from 7-21 to 40-21 in five consecutive boards - never give up!|pg||
nt|fann4: Same seq in the OR, but S gave up over 3@C|pg||
nt|petere: with @D lead one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: better from the N side |pg||
nt|werge: OR: No game bid... - 6 @S|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Did i hear no swing board?  Open room is in 6@S :)  so wait till this auction is over.|pg||
nt|werge: @C-lead from West gives 6 @S away|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wwalter: he made LOL|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it difficult to bid game in S and make it - 2 Club losers Da - will D  belead |pg||
nt|jeanhari: for sure Dubinin has a fast pas if this was not t/o|pg||
nt|daman: I think maybe Weinstein held up the auction|pg||
nt|panja: risky 3@H bid..isn't this one?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: nooo|pg||
nt|petere: with @C lead some ruffs though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: has there been a misunderstanding here? Sabine knows that 3NT isn't solid diamonds...|pg||
nt|haans: only brits play 5@C as slam invite|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that the X = @h + minor - so S has shown his hand!|pg||
nt|kurtove: diamond lead, ruff and small heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=0-11, 4@hs|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes will have to drop QC, since he can't afford E having the trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@d acts as 4sf here?|pg||
nt|april7: @D lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South is not thrilled - although he does have a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: in IMP as rare pen double|pg||
nt|haans: or is it not?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could be yes|pg||
nt|haans: he is worth a well done|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why not S X 2H? Hans|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not x, better action |pg||
nt|sharkey: S decided on modesty....|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens and Bakkeren may have wished they are not in this bidding,  but South saved them |pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes S will be happy gets atleast 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: :) :) @C better :)|pg||
nt|haans: i must be a star|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|henryb: "The Fat Lady is Singing"|pg||
nt|ritong: north went for the practical bid|pg||
nt|ritong: a second cue wouldn t have scandalized me|pg||
nt|ady: north right gave up once south shows some heart values|pg||
nt|daman: has to duck 1 @H and maybe more|pg||
nt|daman: pitching @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding has maded it easy'er for N to play @Cj|pg||
nt|haans: and this was board 10 welcome back in 40 minutes! |pg||
nt|raghavan: Will E signal his D Ace now?|pg||
nt|milton_se: Welland can't expect more than one ace w East, so D is mandatory|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a tricky 3nt! 5 and 6@c is easier, but not longer|pg||
nt|haans: :) they did right :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: next round (3rd from Swiss Open Teams) starts tomorrow 10:3- CET|pg||
nt|mariner1: well right defense just not in game|pg||
nt|werge: 750|pg||
nt|haans: they are the opps :)))|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open playing in 5@C Dbl also, so @H fit never found|pg||
nt|MolvaM: actually if he had passed again opps would probably land in 2nt|pg||
nt|petere: no that are smileys, not stars :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Needs 2 ruffs to profit as natural trump trick disappears|pg||
nt|petere: why not?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @C switch now?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I don't need any coffe :) the play really very slowly |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they*|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: 4 wich pair? :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: maybe will fines the @h :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: he has not made it yet......|pg||
nt|wwalter: it sould be simple now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a grand with 2-2 in @s|pg||
nt|raghavan: another 7 in Hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: or spades or NT|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably :)|pg||
nt|daman: draw trumo|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
nt|april7: why should he lead @C, he will lead @S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: And he might have just turned a huge plus into a small minus|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS do better not drawing here I think|pg||
nt|panja: and now, there is a promotion possibility|pg||
nt|werge: - if not playing for another stiff @C K|pg||
nt|werge: Same play - @H / @C|pg||
nt|haans: @H has been found but longer clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: I thought xx was a wish to "get them"|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think Levin wonder why Hampson bid 3@d with that @hs and points...|pg||
nt|haans: i think he is thinking about how to play|pg||
nt|ahh: will play @S to  throw @C then play on @D |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brgpro: Bocchi thought pd denied @d control|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can finesse in @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: but now it's over|pg||
nt|milton_se: 11 tricks probably|pg||
nt|haans: trust we will see team salokin again|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 4S down  so ew making 4 will get them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx to all Kibitz, co commentators Hans, Malik,sid,Momchil, Vu GR operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all kibitzers, we are waiting all of you here for the next round|pg||
nt|haans:  and thats was board 10 welcome back 17:30 (italian time) |pg||
nt|henryb: S has now presumably shown 5-5-1-2, minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: and plopped into 4 |pg||
nt|lesrays: stopped in time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have overstretched to 5NT in Open|pg||
pc|s4|nt|star6ija: thanks to all commentators, to EBL and to Roland Wald|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can call it an action double.: partner, I'm still not satisfied until now...|pg||
nt|haans: but still +|pg||
nt|haans: wrong - score|pg||
nt|haans: understand 4-1|pg||
nt|aupillon: not too many points|pg||
nt|aupillon: he'll maybe try to create an upercutt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and 2nt might have failed|pg||
nt|afulton: they made 6 in open room but that won't happen here... |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wwalter: made|pg||
nt|wwalter: or not LOL|pg||
nt|charles_l: he may be preserving his options to misguess @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now way south could see passing was best|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 Spades,HA,DA and (a club)  minimum losers|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a violation of Burn's Law (RULES)|pg||
nt|haans: may go down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not DBL....ED another flat board I guess|pg||
pc|d5|nt|murat: he goes down now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Terence Reese had a pithy comment for South's 3@S ....|pg||
nt|ahh: he has fair idea  where the big @H are |pg||
nt|buddyshah: so we do have another swing,.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brgpro: @c i meant|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2 x A from S - have a bet? :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: no|pg||
nt|raghavan: Automatically spade honours fall - no need for worry, |pg||
nt|jeanhari: but depending on what de dbl over 1NT ment|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he said only points|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "He was happy to defend 3@H when it was bid, but not prepared to defend it when partner doubled!"|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wwalter: if he plays @s could come a problewm :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|april7: it was a good pass by S, although 4@S is an execellent contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: Friends- We thank all great Kibitz, co commentators, VuGr operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|henryb: 4N probably agrees spades for the moment, since N is most interested in the @sQ|pg||
nt|henryb: the grand is only good if S has the @sQ|pg||
nt|haans: but onoy may|pg||
nt|panja: S should have played @DT|pg||
nt|fann4: There are 5 top losers with the ruff.|pg||
nt|panja: @D2 is a lazy play|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes probably|pg||
nt|nubmaster: more @d now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh no there was 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no 3 imps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: in 3NT on a @D-lead decla must topplay @Cs - if @cQ in West no problem - if in East has to drop!|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now! I cannot see any 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok, tx|pg||
nt|fann4: thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|haans: sure does|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wwalter: + 11 or -6? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: well if you bids em you has to makes em :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10|pg||
nt|panja: you must reciprocate after a gift..|pg||
nt|sybarra: the nt "right sided"  the @S contract is not |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: never play in a contract where the opponents have more trumps than you|pg||

nt|raghavan: in this session|pg||
nt|raghavan: playing H may help declarer in discard a club|pg||
nt|nubmaster: a @s, ace by Bakkeren and another @d ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: think same here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: no better with 2 @h ruffs|pg||
nt|haans: @H my choice|pg||
nt|raghavan: H e will be thinking whether C 10 could be another entry for 2 ruffs and SK|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ace of @c as entrance for second ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: has to lead @c, he see's he is on hook anyway|pg||
nt|ahh: nice play by east  knocking entry to @S|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||

nt|raghavan: may play D |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|april7: if E would have ruffed 2 @H in dummy then he had 10 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @c to T now, only way to make it...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|raghavan: club again|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|werge: I was asked, whether to cover or not - but with the @C 10, there might be a very small chance, that decl finnesses the @C 10 by East|pg||
nt|haans: 1 imp more|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: no sorry |pg||
nt|haans: decl endplayed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petere: NEXT!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahh: 9 tricks and another imp |pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: West perhaps needed to lead a heart (partner's suit!) to ensure a set against 3@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: 2 IMP = 16-14|pg||
nt|kurtove: east didnt expect clA in south now|pg||
nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|kurtove: cu in 40 min|pg||
nt|haans: cu soon|pg||
nt|pelu: no but he could unblock @DK = -200 ? 7 IMP and and 18-12 - that cost 4VP|pg||
nt|haans: cu Peter|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb: apparently they bid this bad grand in the other room, and will be rewarded with 13 impa, and a 17-13 win for the He Witte Huis team|pg||

nt|afulton: yes, good thing the ladies aren't playing for money!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W will regret not cashing A@C in the post|pg||
nt|westjava: still tied match...1lso 3NT + 3 for   23|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to play AQ@S was a winner|pg||
nt|westjava: also|pg||
nt|woozle: Another very sound weak two from Hirata...NS have no cold game but three feasible ones (4S, 3NT, 5C)|pg||
nt|afulton: or at least the north south pair :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: in 5 deals China has 14 and australia 10|pg||
mb|2C|an|forcing|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15, 0+@D   [2@D opener = 0-10 4+@H & 4+@S]|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score battle|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When they go back with +200 maybe teammates will assume it is from 4 spades doubled :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N supposed to be 12-14|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzre: 1nt=15-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the unorthodox 3@D by Lung preempted his side out of the making 3N|pg||
nt|bebechira: Texan Aces doing very very well 56-28 with 8 to go.....|pg||
nt|raghavan: well N makes Lead direction bid if Opp reach a contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Pass = 0-2@S  [support dbl with 3]|pg||
nt|rodal f: Waited 1NT and tr there, by 3@H as max|pg||
nt|jcwla: 21, the 3NT hand in here, W in OR threw in a junky 2@D overcall and played that doubled, but down 3 and only -500 to gain 3 for Australia.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Macau now leading after bidding the slam on board 4|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS will lose a lot in money|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nigel_k:  N will have deja-vu from board 6|pg||
nt|afulton: they forgot initial passes... |pg||
nt|rodal f: But an other system for NS I belive. 11 - 14 NT in white?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only makes his pard think of game|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|nigel_k:  3H is Ogust showing a good hand and a bad suit|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura not very ambitious - 2DXX might have been fun|pg||
nt|afulton: yet, in spite of all the riches of the E-W pair, this is not a great hand for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W does not like 2@C however has no where to go|pg||
nt|afulton: assume a @H lead... |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity telling all cards - EW will defend better now with information|pg||
mb|4C|nt|westjava: yes:)|pg||
nt|westjava: so,better pass now|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Pass is a bit pessimistic with West, maybe 3H instead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like their chances for 2nd plus score of the set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard, drop the lifeboats|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nigel_k:  Lots of work to do in 4H though|pg||
nt|mariner1: trump leads needed|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there is one|pg||
nt|patricck: NS have missed 4@H here|pg||
nt|woozle: Odd that he didn't even want to play game opposite hearts...from what we've seen of Hirata's weak twos it would probably be laydown|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 24, where Neill upgraded the 14 to 1NT, Ohno also opened it 1NT - as the top end of 11-14!  Over S's interference, West got his side out in 3@C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: @DK and switch to ??|pg||
nt|raghavan: What is there for W to think Pass|pg||
mb|6S|nt|westjava: 7 imps gain to Japan   24 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: A@C being Ax helps|pg||
nt|afulton: as i said... not great hand for east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: opening nebulous @D has the effect of pinning the suit if the opponents hold it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: holding trump Ace - very powerful for West|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a min 1 after the lead|pg||
nt|afulton: they will lose 2@h's 1@c and @s .. for -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: E should X|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  A bit timid by E/W. West could have tried 3H or E a reopening double|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: rehi|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|afulton: but with all high @h played on trick 1... why not try to set up @s right away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great lead should be about 500 here for nothing|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 Spades+1H atleast+1D+1C - contract may be more down|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|westjava: PABF is the biggest annual tournament for the Pacific Asia Bridge Federation for Zone 6, representatives for the upcoming Sao Paulo World Championships are deteremined here|pg||
nt|idblu: only 8 tricks....|pg||
nt|westjava: except @H return from W:)|pg||
nt|idblu: as long as @S played before the @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9th trick [@H] not established yet - defense CAN prevail, but will they?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: NOPE|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|12|nt|ahollan1: now cross ruff & cash 2nd @H -- nice d|pg||

nt|wwalter: 20 imps in 3 boards|pg||

nt|trotto: sorry ,prive|pg||
nt|daman: I agree Adam|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|ady: club lead could have been nasty|pg||
nt|werge: @C-ruff is popular here - but not if N/S plays 4 @S|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: levin pull board on the floor |pg||
nt|haans: we are |pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden gets 1 IMP|pg||
nt|ahh: at this rate Sweden fall 8 short |pg||
nt|haans: yep |pg||
nt|ahh: more fun here though|pg||
nt|mcarroll: depends on your definition of fun I suppose|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden will get some points here too|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a make|pg||
nt|ahh: not so sure about that |pg||
nt|ahh: sweden gaining i mean |pg||
nt|haans: and they tried|pg||
nt|werge: @S better than @H - not only by South|pg||
nt|afulton: doesnt matter...  ew should take 1@h and 1@s |pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|afulton: so, should be 5N, making and 4@s making 5... for push|pg||
nt|sybarra: never cashed the ace of @H's when in with spade|pg||
nt|afulton: i c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In the OR 6@S was not played like this:)|pg||
nt|werge: Who said slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 3N plus a few depending on the lead|pg||
nt|trotto: sorry all,   wrong widow:)|pg||
nt|daman: depends upon who plays it|pg||
nt|haans: no|pg||
nt|petere: Another 3NT with more than 4 tricks for the defender from the start|pg||
nt|haans: but mne Ekrens 2M weak|pg||
mb|2C|nt|charles_l: 6@c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good result here for Badger.|pg||
nt|ahh: they need to find the save too |pg||
nt|werge: South: Weak with majors - seems to be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is invitational?|pg||
nt|raghavan: now S bids 1D|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S i come prepared|pg||
nt|werge: Now direction 6 @D - 3 NT out of question|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry 5 @D, I meant|pg||
nt|werge: Bad @S-break - might swing|pg||
nt|april7: the finesse in @H could have cost the contract on certain layout, but taking the ace , 100%|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 4@H from north now?|pg||
nt|panja: not a bad idea, two key cards missing though|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N bid and made on 23|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|werge: But the second @H-honour might help|pg||
nt|MolvaM: lets see good old blackwood will save another life?|pg||
nt|aupillon: for spectators not knowing exactly the Fante team : Italian name but french team with many real youngsters ( a bit less Fantun)|pg||
nt|afulton: did they believe the NS pair were faking their bids?  When playing, you need to decide who is telling the truth!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: N can make 6@c but EW has a vul. save in 6@h, 800|pg||
nt|athene: looks a bit heavy for that|pg||
nt|athene: east has too much defence and is too vulnerable to consider saccing, surely?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brgpro: he can X 4@h now but i doubt W will save|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to save in 6@H for loads and find pd was going to lead stiff @D against 6@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: S has a rather heavy 3@c , she will pass now|pg||
nt|brgpro: showing some interest |pg||
nt|panja: that must be N|pg||
nt|don paulus: shows 3crd @h ?|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need support doubles when partner has shown 5+ in the suit, i wouldn't have thought|pg||
nt|athene: i wld just bid 4@H with west's hand|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps X is game-try in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if they have that agreement it suits the hand perfectly|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is a bit wet and 4@H a bit pushy|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT doesn't work?|pg||
nt|ady: almist certainly south|pg||
nt|haans: he has two chances to play @CK|pg||
nt|werge: EW 4 @S, naturally|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 2@d is 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|jcwla: At a low level, sometimes it's a free roll to tell partner whether the fit is 8 or 9, but here I agree it wouldn't seem to apply.|pg||
nt|daman: now from the wrong side|pg||
nt|ady: not wrong side   better for north to play|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry problrm on bbo |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I lost bidding we wait for the score|pg||
nt|ady: only a spade lead and club switch could be awkward|pg||
nt|ritong: what is final contract pls?|pg||
nt|ady: not finsished bidding yet|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt|pg||
nt|ritong: grazie|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: By S|pg||
nt|sybarra: "lesson board"  ???|pg||
nt|werge: South must avoid the @H-lead - better lead a trump |pg||
nt|mcarroll: well bid|pg||
nt|haans: Geir Helgemo have stopped using Ekrens no as profitable now that all know how to defend|pg||
nt|afulton: we already discussed earlier that one of these matches went into overtime and an imp is an imp is an imp|pg||
nt|ronpa: lengy is winning 1 imp a board but unfortuantly he needs 40 more boards and not 3 :(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: the 3NT where Bocchi found the @S shift: Semanta won 3NT - he won on and endplay against N! |pg||
nt|athene: well if East bids 4@C or 3@S or 3NT now, west can bid 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: bizarre|pg||
nt|ady: wrong   tht south would open 2NT|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a 2NT opening would be artificial|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It didnt in the Open The void of course complicates things|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I think these days with the dealing programs, you should have good way to locate voids|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: gone all haywire|pg||
nt|MolvaM: as they come up too often|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dcbutler: Hauge is ahead 89-50 with one board to score, so will make the final|pg||
nt|aupillon: can be a swing for Fante|pg||
nt|aupillon: 3NT = WEAK trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @H9 should restrict to 3|pg||
nt|charles_l: hard to lead @h though|pg||
nt|wwalter: who would lead that? :)|pg||
nt|panja: it is a fair choice, even single dummy|pg||
nt|daman: a lot of good teams have fallen by the wayside|pg||
nt|petere: @C @S @C|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brgpro: ......|pg||
nt|haans: will not make my money on that|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and this will be made also|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice 10 of @D in W hand |pg||
nt|MolvaM: I suggested that 1@c opening should ask voids but not many people liked my idea  :)|pg||
nt|april7: only 12 tricks in @S |pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: declarer had just better not play @SAKJ throwing @D3 :) she runs into a nasty accident in clubs if she does that|pg||
nt|ahh: beginning to look like bd 16 was the match winner |pg||
nt|ronpa: this result has prevented an israeli match at the semis :(|pg||
nt|afulton: ok, stir something up for them Ron|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: if N wins the ace now, declarer might not need @Cs to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but N ducks correctly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes looks like they have no intention of going beyond game|pg||
nt|aupillon: even with a nice hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
nt|aupillon: no, no|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Can go off wih @C ruff|pg||
nt|petere: does she have any chance making this ?|pg||
nt|werge: Think, the 11th trick is hard to find|pg||
nt|werge: I think, it will be difficult to bid 7 - to tell each other, that we have a 65 % grand slam or so|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brgpro: with 6@c, Bochi doesnt care as even if they are without @cK pd must have @cAQ 6 times|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, @D to the Ace and a @C-discard on @H King is not directly stupid|pg||
nt|haans: as a speak say only one chane|pg||
nt|haans: spec|pg||
nt|haans: may b|pg||
nt|haans: but three more|pg||
nt|petere: @C will be helpful even|pg||
nt|april7: now E might bid 7|pg||
mb|5D|nt|aupillon: it's over i guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: NS throw the ball at each other|pg||
nt|haans: and down|pg||
mb|p|nt|buddyshah: angling towads a dangerus 7 now|pg||
nt|werge: It´s a very good 7|pg||
nt|april7: all high cards are here, but oly singletn K of @S, and E doesn't know it|pg||
mb|5S|nt|brgpro: a quick claim|pg||
nt|athene: could draw trumps with the @C4 :)|pg||
nt|athene: just to be cute|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N has the chance to stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|aupillon: say 5 spades. You've done enough|pg||
nt|aupillon: why not Blackwood after 3NT. Fit was given|pg||
nt|werge: But when East knows, that they have all key-cards, @S King included - he will bid 7|pg||
nt|april7: just bad luck,if E bids it|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Kx good Kstiff  not so good|pg||
nt|don paulus: cannot avoid losing a @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the thinking should be E did not overcall 1@S, nor did she dbl 2@D..so is unlikely to hold enough to defeat the contract in any of those suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes the spot cards in @H and @C make it impossible to promote a trick|pg||
nt|afulton: they COULD have bid 4@s in other room, no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: you cant bid 6 rounds and play just a 5level contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: its only good if S shows stiff|pg||
nt|werge: Well done, NL|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: N probably assumes S has 2@Hs for the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|aupillon: noway :(:(:(|pg||
nt|aupillon: wait a minute|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: Best play op to now, yesterday included|pg||
nt|ritong: not anymore|pg||
nt|aupillon: not a chance by now |pg||
nt|rnmalik: vow|pg||
pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: specs tell me another 5level making contract.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|april7: not understandable|pg||
nt|don paulus: have Texan Aces bad luck or offday ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|charles_l: 2@d was effectively nmf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: its just that they didnt stop at 5. but this is coincidental|pg||
nt|MolvaM: by the way garner made a good lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: diamond lead could have been problematic|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and let declarer get rid of his heart loser on 3rd round @d|pg||
nt|ritong: this happened other room, but zia somehow mistimed the play|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh specs tell me he could go down even with @d lead|pg||
nt|aupillon: remember taht Blackwood is always a bridge convention|pg||
nt|aupillon: opps, claim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: looking for -2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: Yes well planned by W|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: the @DJ was a good card to play -- it assurest 2 entries to dummy if N wins the Q|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: misunderstanding I believe.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|werge: So another 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|werge: I do´nt beleive that @S 7...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|petere: NEXT!|pg||
nt|werge: Texan needed the luck, that Israel bid 7, but they also stopped - for 980|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 5@D hand does not improve after 5C bid,diff to know why E signs off in this sequence|pg||
mc|12|nt|haans: pay me|pg||
nt|aupillon: a REVOKE can make the slam make :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: test|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thats why its good to claim quickly|pg||
nt|april7: I understand the 6@S call in hand 10, rather then the pass of 5@S here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 6@s |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry problems |pg||
nt|werge: Ijn fact this is NO bad luck. Earning by bidding 5 @S would have been hard|pg||

nt|westjava: x again by E better|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Missed opportunity for both teams|pg||
nt|mariner1: this could be an action hand|pg||
nt|afulton: she thought @s were 4-2 with the trump leader having AKJx of @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has good play EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was well done by declerer.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  An easy hand to get overboard on so may not be too bad for N/S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Another slam here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think both pairs playing upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|idblu: well then @S2 should have been his clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no - NS sometimes std sometimes udca|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both odd/even discard|pg||
nt|raghavan: Zia|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could I have the website for this tourney so I can talk with minor amount of intelligence|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: yes looked like 3@D was gin others had chances|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tough one|pg||
nt|woozle: EW have a very possible (but inferior and failing) 4H, or an excellent 3NT available|pg||
nt|bebechira: I saw some good work on the bulletin...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|davidstern: Nice hand nobody has a fit here|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: so cant she cross ruff it out for 4  or am I misisng something|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S DBL would please E|pg||
nt|rodal f: 50 and fin in my eys|pg||
nt|woozle: Which game EW play will probably depend on which of E and W makes the final decision|pg||
nt|afulton: one thing I noticed when I was watching USBF finals was that almost all of them opened the bidding extremely light|pg||
nt|bebechira: http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|mariner1: NS in a pickle now|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@C 11-15 either 5@C + 4 or 6+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: If Hughes had a support double available, he did well to ignore it|pg||
nt|afulton: and they bent over to overcall (particularly at favorable vul) extremely light|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this makes 6@S or 6@C|pg||
nt|westjava: they will|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7 in fact|pg||
nt|westjava: nice lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H=0-10, 5+@H|pg||
nt|davidstern: I can say that the general consensus is that Asian (and Aus/NZ) Tournaments are among the friendliest in the world. There seem to be an ongoing number of  appeals here which never ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: happens in Asia|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even peeking at just EW cards, not sure where i'd want to be|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and should be bid|pg||
nt|westjava: key of K@C..!:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and west is sitting |pg||
nt|idblu: but after @DK and @H8....only suit left was @S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  7C is a very good contract and may be reached if East uses 4NT key card now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: W is happy :)|pg||
nt|afulton: Hsien has made a very heavy 1N bid.. but South found SUPER lead!|pg||
nt|bebechira: Texan Aces getting closer and closer to the semis....+40 with 6 to go|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Grant steals it, this may not be pretty but only 50's|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: @D lead will make declarer very nervous|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With canape you always feel like you want to rebid a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@C also drifted one off on 24, so the Lamaze class ("Push, push, push") continues.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@C not reasonable missing a key|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on a double finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 @C precission? Ok to alert it for specs also:)|pg||
nt|idblu: vul on his side here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: again the substandard game is reached|pg||
nt|afulton: three rounds of @c and then @h thru... |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hans had a number of choices here.  Will be interesting to see how this one plays out at the two tables.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Jodan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Jordan|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nigel_k:  Very pushy by North|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: trump lead not really best here |pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes does very well to not cooperate in his Neill's investigations|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: actually @H lead troublesome too|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Might be ok if the Ace was not a singleton, eg AC instead of AD|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: director -- we were robbed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: I think we missed a pass here|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls|pg||
nt|mariner1: well bid though|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: ok 2 rounds and ht thru |pg||
nt|afulton: ok, i agree|pg||
pc|dA|nt|westjava: -3 now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ggod night and thx for coming :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East needs West to have seven to the king at least plus an ace, which is optimistic|pg||
nt|woozle: Even if declarer errs and plays on hearts, this will still probably make|pg||
nt|afulton: they never found their @c fit on this hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  On board 6 Macau made 4H at the other table in addition to making 2S at this table |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: @CA then try @DAK?|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to use @S to reach W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just playing north for @CK seems against the odds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there is no problem for 6@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: that 2@H bid in N is a warning about possible @D splits|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 7, other room didnt get to 6 @H either |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer should take two diamond ruffs now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nigel_k:  Still not a bad game but nothing lying well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they had a coach he might be pointing out the fallacies in their methods|pg||
pc|h8|nt|afulton: welcome back Dr. Raghaven :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcwla: Japan managed to play game in their ten-card @S fit on 25 rather than 3NT, so they will...lose 1.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 6@C makes anyway|pg||
nt|westjava: stil have entry of J@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As it happens the QD comes down but cashing AK first is too risky|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Power failure|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: ok NOW @C finesse|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence by South. Left North on lead to ensure a heart switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tough I still belive 3NT are the best spot. But shallbe down|pg||
nt|raghavan: sorry|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i guess this is better than my play of @CA first|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Shirley, I was wrong|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
pc|s8|nt|raghavan: x|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not sure about the spade play here|pg||

nt|sybarra: have to not get too high her |pg||
nt|sybarra: *here |pg||
nt|jcwla: wd by neve to earn the push|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H can be beaten if the defence organise their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|daman: nicely played :)|pg||
nt|ady: strange lead|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure it was|pg||

nt|haans: rehi|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry internet problem|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|rnmalik: always:)|pg||
nt|aupillon: North overbid 3 or 4 times his hand. Sorry|pg||
nt|raghavan: no save  so Sweden may lose 3 IMP|pg||
nt|haans: only 15 down|pg||
nt|ahh: as they say in the best   puppet shows  anything can happen in the next half hour |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: i agree not bidding 5@D to close|pg||
nt|ahh: normal auction in other room |pg||
nt|werge: I think, that the second trick here was a clear-cut Lavinthal position. Without the @C-void, South had played a medium @S|pg||
nt|petere: 3@D in the OR ... second best fit|pg||
nt|werge: I have been told, that declarer could set up a @C for the 11th trick - I do´nt agree|pg||
nt|ronpa: the dealer is not helping as well but the indians has played great this set and deserves the compliments|pg||
nt|werge: Fun goes on - what a set of boards|pg||
nt|buddyshah: so they did bid 6|pg||
nt|don paulus: i understand from operator they were in 6@s after all|pg||
nt|werge: SORRY - 6 @S was BID in CR also|pg||
nt|buddyshah: operator   did E rid 6 on 5D or W raised?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: operator plays any card then claims|pg||
nt|raghavan: This hand looks like a dull 2H hand  |pg||
nt|petere: after drawing 3 rounds of trumps ... mmmmhhhhh :(|pg||
nt|haans: OR bid @S-3@D all pass|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: play 6 with two men off, have a chance and miss it, then finally score +2:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: Canape should help EW here..3@H  makes|pg||
nt|werge: The point is, that you put vour money on the fact, that South has no @C biggerthan the 9|pg||
mb|3D|nt|charles_l: 4@h is 50%|pg||
nt|wwalter: @@ the oter table was the @h9 as lead|pg||
nt|athene: but unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|afulton: there has been some wonderful commentary at this table by Ron Pachlmann, Shirley Ybarra and Martin Carroll |pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphztg: est|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in 12 boards 70 to 2 is massive|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D is a good save, but only S can bid it, N with AK in @S won't|pg||
nt|buddyshah: ty massimilano|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: good stop|pg||
nt|athene: east has to lead a diamond at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: not impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Canape is a style of bidding wherein longer suit is bid on second round|pg||
nt|panja: so here, W has 5 Clubs and 4 Hearts, he opened 1@H|pg||
nt|aupillon: hello Henri. |pg||
nt|ritong: hi.|pg||
nt|werge: That is DOUBLE-DUMMY only - South could have 5-4-2-2 - this Ekren is out of control|pg||
nt|werge: But a good point anyway, thanks|pg||
nt|haans: sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yet another straightforward 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: hard when partner didn't double any artficial diamond bids, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't expect opps to have so many diamonds that a ruff is likely|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C sign off?|pg||
nt|ritong: don t think 2@c was|pg||
nt|MolvaM: agressive 2@s but understandable at this vul|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought after 3NT by S there was no room to go wrong even with a void|pg||
pc|dA|nt|aupillon: look disclipinated East|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I thought that most US pairs had a higher standard than Jxxxxx for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|ahh: south will take his chances on defence |pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: but yes, they might try for bigger things|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: so, is a matter of @c complement|pg||
nt|ritong: here, rather poor|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: No chance for gimmicks by any one of the 4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: interesting 2@S rather than 2NT rebid from east|pg||
nt|pelu: they open 4 card major|pg||
nt|brgpro: many play 2NT is extra and 2@s=waiting|pg||
nt|pelu: B24 NS in 6@S - played by N! - so diff to find the @H-lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: still, have to guess @cA|pg||
nt|athene: strong @C or a shaded 2NT opener?|pg||
nt|athene: east might still lead @H10 surely|pg||
nt|haans: all may think its very close|pg||
nt|ahh: looks like 8 tricks  no more no less   but lets see |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have stopped in 3@H in OR|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: they shouldn't have to work so hard to beat this, though|pg||
nt|jcwla: A bridge too far.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|afulton: Oops, and I forgot ... some super stuff by Georgia Ray! |pg||
nt|ronpa: defeating 3@H is great result but 4@H has no play in here so another push|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: defence needs to play spades early  to get 2 spades  1 heart and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|werge: Quite a world between the two Ekrans in Bd 11 and 12...|pg||
nt|haans: yes they call it vul|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|aupillon: MOST... :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: Hard to see 3NT making, and in Open E is in 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: desperado bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As Spec says witholding @DK a good move|pg||
nt|haans: hard to understand what is happening|pg||
nt|mcarroll: TRUE|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but they are in europe. maybe that explains :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: best chance is that East lead her singleton @D = she cant have an A when she lead a singleton!!|pg||
nt|henryb: 6 could make, if South is inspited to lead a @d|pg||
nt|henryb: inspired*|pg||
nt|aupillon: good point. In France, MOST never open unless at least 3 honours ( from AKJ10 and 9). Otherwise you loose your club licence :)|pg||
nt|petere: this will score more than +110|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: I wonder what their theoreticl Ekren HCP range is, 2 points last hand, and a good 9 here?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: easy to understand RIGHT???????????????????????????????|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if you become the european champion by constantly opening 2 with Jxxxxx they could live with that :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: In Turkey a good sequence headed by 987632 can do. Not true, Murat ?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sure but we prefer 987642 better actually|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be right |pg||
nt|werge: If you bid 5 @D, E/W might try 5 @S|pg||
nt|werge: Look at the West-hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s5|nt|athene: yes :))|pg||
nt|athene: if north has announced strong balanced, east should be able to avoid the @CA lead|pg||
nt|pelu: a fall from grace : @cA - and easy 12 tricks - the 3. slam-sving in the match|pg||
nt|brgpro: i've seen people leading singleton against a grand...so...|pg||
nt|haans: who has @S6?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|aupillon: aha|pg||
nt|werge: Men lettere havde været at see signalet i spar 4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: or 2nd diamond to kill the diamond suit|pg||
nt|haans: some questions will be sked after the match im sure|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: this is OK|pg||
nt|ritong: three comparisons to come|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: that is Ekrens|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: to have finessing position against the 3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|charles_l: +1 here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This looks like closing it out forNL with only 2 boards to go|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: declarer is under no pressure here - although if south had @SK107 left, a diamond back wld be nasty|pg||
nt|pelu: the 4. slamswing: NS in 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: 96 imps changed hands in 11 boards|pg||
nt|haans: most likely 1@D did never happen|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: that's what we like to see!|pg||
nt|petere: so, a new leader again|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: so all kibs - stay for tha last 2 boards!|pg||
nt|haans: sometimes 44 in M|pg||
nt|buddyshah: next|pg||
pc|s7|nt|raghavan: It is their trick ,  take it says declarer|pg||
nt|raghavan: so that a D can be ruffed|pg||
nt|haans: @S6?|pg||
nt|ahh: all about stopping south making a @H trick now |pg||
nt|ahh: pitch @S andits down on the ruff |pg||
nt|haans: lead of @SJ = does not know from how many|pg||
nt|ahh: but  need to cash the @C  before the ruff or 1 goes away |pg||
nt|ahh: so its a bit deeper as north must underlead |pg||
nt|raghavan: Will declarer finess H9 after entering via S ruff|pg||
nt|haans: @S 5 and 6 bid cards|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|brgpro: the last 2 bds will be pairs or BAM ( board a match)|pg||
nt|wwalter: probaly they play 4M , we saw canape earlyer, so 1@c denies 4M|pg||
nt|ahh: has to pitch @C now |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahh: then another @S and  hand begins to fall apart |pg||
nt|werge: I support Helgemo - no Ekren|pg||
mc|10|nt|MolvaM: garner is on the way to 6 imps|pg||
nt|haans: new spade|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: should have played small @C when in dummy with @SJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, I know - he scored +920 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, should play @C7 from dummy after overruff @C6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  reasonable question to ask though :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: So sorry all specs. I was blind as.......|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  First partscore for a while and there is more action coming up so get coffee now if you need to|pg||
nt|woozle: Another normal game for NS...3NT is much better than 4H despite the solid 9-card fit|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why there are ni fire works?/|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be good for Aust|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kiwibridge: NS can make 6@H here|pg||
nt|bebechira: 26 and 27 should be good for Australia as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The 200 is unfortunately correct|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: possible 6@H here|pg||
nt|idblu: a quiet 4@H here|pg||
nt|westjava: NS just lost 3nt...|pg||
nt|afulton: after last hand, i am not surprised east didnt open|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will shake the hand of any pair who reach 6@H on this hand|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hard to reach|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It will be hard to interest North after a 1H opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has good play here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I did say can, expect them to reach 4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Wasnt in resp to your comment just a passing comment|pg||
mb|4H|nt|nigel_k:  Yet another close game|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the lucky lead it's home.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S playing precision so South can safely pass the 1S opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura trots out Drury, from the looks of it, and I assume that Neill's double is a lead-direct|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: this looks "easy"  |pg||
nt|woozle: 4H will be very difficult on a club lead|pg||
mb|5D|nt|nigel_k:  South must be worried about missing slam but his options over 1NT are not great|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H are 3 2 , K@D in pocker|pg||
nt|mariner1: pcoket|pg||
nt|mariner1: pocket :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes obeys orders and manages to avoid the temptation of his diamond holding|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting @C5 lead.|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think the South hand is strong enough to bid hearts and then spades or double on second chance|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michaels doesnt get across the playing strength|pg||
nt|davidstern: Give north doubleton spade and @DK and it is laydown|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here.....|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@S, 1@H and 2@C loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S back from W will end its hopes though|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @S can go on @D if no @S back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 = 3rd/lowest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't see Dawei doing anything other than @CAK and @S shift looking at dummy @D holding|pg||
nt|westjava: should be like that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and hoping that his p has A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Dawei ask what 2@S was|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wondering because no @S lead then no @S singleton|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCruff AH|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D and 1 down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...surprised no exploration for a major.  @D lead would set the @H (Hans' @H) to racing.|pg||
nt|raghavan: David > get  ready to shake hands whatever the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  You probably wouldn't want to bid this one but the auction is very normal|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|westjava: best line of defence...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think risky not to cash 2nd @C -- imagine North  3613|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@C now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- i'd like to retract that please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 = down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Dawei preserving @C really was very fine play|pg||
nt|westjava: that's why he was thinking a while|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E is still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: frustrating when player at table finds better play seeing only 2 hands than i found looking at all 4 :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, E thinking now at the scence|pg||
nt|westjava: E has to ask what was 2@S..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: S replied W 2@S = 3c+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is another case where holding trump Ace gives defender more choices|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,always think alot if you've A of trump|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Claim|pg||
pc|h3|nt|westjava: upss|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: E just asked N the same question about what 2@S was|pg||
nt|westjava: ty:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: same answer = 3+|pg||
nt|idblu: about time able to press the "Easy" button|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bit hard from here in Italy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: now sure how they found the @D back|pg||
nt|afulton: by the way, on last hand... if ew could have made 7@c/@d ... the score would have been 1440 |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: many moons ago Billy Eisenberg wrote a BOLS Bridge Tip that said "play low from dummy"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. @CJ gains nothing .... ever|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its funny how that works|pg||
nt|idblu: true....let the def guess|pg||
nt|woozle: 4H looking good now - Hughes can't continue diamonds profitably so the long spade will set up|pg||
nt|woozle: probably DQ next, playing neill for T7x|pg||
pc|sA|nt|westjava: a new leader now, 12 imps gain from   10, a double score 4@S here and 2@H there|pg||

nt|april7: another 6 @S|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: nederland seams to have made it ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @H or 6 @C  (hate the break in clubs) |pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: 6@D has possibilities here|pg||
nt|ahh: Sweden should bid 6 to flatten it  but very few ways to get 15 on 1 board |pg||
nt|rodal f: For service by all resalt: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm |pg||
nt|petere: 1 free suit still|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: will E dbl 2@d?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems to have been wrong-sided in the open room|pg||
nt|haans: try it all u get|pg||
nt|werge: It is hard to be the only one in the world, who would not bid 1 @D...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|afulton: what is south's double? |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: small chance they might try 6nt from south and pick up 2 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: how do they find the @D fit now?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans > I was hoping S to bid Diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: i thunk 3@H show 3-5-4-1|pg||
nt|haans: they are relaying|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brgpro: if 6@h is played by W, it is easier to find @d lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: E wont pass this...|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that Bocchi-Auken are exp that they are on lead - only 1 bad board - the 3NT-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: pass=2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yessssssssssss|pg||
nt|daman:  3NT here   has chances to go down, but not many|pg||
nt|daman: zero in fact|pg||
nt|ady: South needs to avoid a club lead|pg||
nt|petere: 3NT (NS) depends on 4 @C tricks, but can't get those @Cs running|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am with you on this one Hans, |pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|petere: so, +500 looks fine for Joel|pg||
nt|werge: STOP!!! I have allready 427 messages from good players, who agree with me upon tha PASS instead of 1 @D...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the X from E?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|xenya: but all W's cards in the minors were "right", so perhaps his final raise was not too unreasonable -- though somewhat inconsistent with the cuatious style he had dispalyed before|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR just finished (and not on a good note for Badger), so welcome to all those who have come here from the OR.|pg||
nt|haans: and so they made it well done|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same here|pg||
nt|haans: assume it means MAX|pg||
nt|raghavan: But 6D by S may be good - Rare occasion W may not lead SA.|pg||
nt|werge: Double? NO?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: e/w jammed the auction |pg||
nt|afulton: nice job of jamming the signals|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: sorry for bad typing|pg||
nt|xenya: so it might be 13 imps for the trailing team |pg||
nt|henryb: not enough boards left|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: thinking or are we crashing again |pg||
nt|haans: not know|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27 hcp and down 2?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nightmare of a rubber bridge player|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way with xx in @D that S can bid |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet N is sick seeing dummy |pg||
nt|ronpa: opp bid without pts to 5@D nv they have AT LEAST 10 of them|pg||
nt|afulton: I asked about the double because it often isn't played as support over the 2 level|pg||
nt|don paulus: more than close - with @h loser pitched on @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that lead is better than a spade|pg||
nt|ritong: can make now|pg||
nt|ritong: for the declarer, yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the other room zia led @s9 specs tell me|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a killing lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but here Henner still has work to do|pg||
nt|ritong: hope north will keep his @c8, for a start|pg||
nt|buddyshah: certain slam, did E really X?|pg||
nt|werge: Probably not|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no @D stop = stop!|pg||
nt|charles_l: should always make - @d sets up for a loser discard|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am sure being on vugraf we all noticed the backward finesse in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a nice scientific auction, asking NS to lead diamonds, please|pg||
nt|xenya: but the gap is already too wide to overcome, true |pg||
nt|daman: up Simba|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4D now atleast|pg||
nt|haans: have u really counted them :)|pg||
nt|werge: I am not a good counter, honestly|pg||
nt|petere: no he estimated and then subtracted a few to pretend a count|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no misclick|pg||
nt|buddyshah: pass looks like E  Xed or @S forgo 4@H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brgpro: could be an important imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume they VIP it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: She has to pass the @D to N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: by playing the @D 9|pg||
nt|ritong: south will split|pg||
nt|werge: Peter, that is in german called "Enthüllung"...|pg||
nt|petere: :9|pg||
nt|petere: ducking this trick ... may help to destroy comm. but does it help for 9 tricks?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: EW could either play a third @D for W to ruff small|pg||
nt|haans: or as I say MAX|pg||
nt|ahh: notice the economy of effort in the relays |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahh: not a bid wasted between 3 and 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: but relay take spades itself|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: nees to play a hearft to the queen|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead could still work now|pg||
nt|april7: with 4 losers N passed? unbelievable,but they have enough imps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: if EW just blast into the slam, i think it's far from obvious to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes|pg||
nt|aupillon: missing cruely the 10 @s|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|daman: at risk now|pg||
nt|ritong: this @d 3 was not a jewel|pg||
nt|daman: another @D by South|pg||
nt|ritong: i think @d J would have been much more helpful|pg||
nt|daman: un autre carreau par Sud|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, when declarer has K9x, it looks bad|pg||
nt|ritong: but anyways, north is not on lead soon|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the other room, declarer played a heart toward the queen|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ko immediato?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcwla: The quiet before the (mild) storm of 14.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could choose to draw trumps and exit @SA and another here|pg||
nt|athene: then eventually the defence have to open diamonds or give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|ritong: a better move imho|pg||
nt|werge: This is in fact a very poor slam, even with the @C King on-side, it´s not extremely good|pg||
nt|ritong: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was careless?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes 27HCP and no fillers|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|haans: spades very right|pg||
nt|petere: 9 tricks via an endplay against East ... ist the suggestion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a revelation?|pg||
nt|haans: @CK and then finesse|pg||
nt|don paulus: and we had very few misclicks - even if Max's eyes are burning after 10 days :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, i agree|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorry on vugraf I should say "Im not sure why south didnt play @d10"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|ritong: right M:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thats standard commentator jargon|pg||
nt|ahh: so when you defend against relay systems  with a suitable hand  preempt  they are not as comfortable |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: undo! :)|pg||
nt|henryb: these are KO rounds, Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I start to became tired..............I lost the hand sorry :(|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: kib asked  is east Frances Hinden?|pg||
nt|daman: he/she would be on lead if South played another @D|pg||
nt|ady: thx kibs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I was wondering how it might make but this lead certainly helps|pg||
nt|haans: i am now corrected KO after 2x 14 boards|pg||
nt|werge: Surprising, that North did NOT just lead a small @D|pg||
nt|werge: So - come-on, how does he make this double-dummy?|pg||
nt|haans: so stay on 12:30 (italy time) for next part|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: of course nothing matters with both diamonds right|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: and gin says North |pg||
nt|werge: This will be first real score for Texan, they bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx Paul|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb: probably down one. no problem :)|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|ritong: you can also content urself with "!", like i do:)|pg||
nt|ronpa: other table had the exact same bidding|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: East is indeed Frances Hinden, one of our regular commentators (Finch)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a busy poster on BBO forums|pg||
nt|daman: this contract was going down had S played a @D and not a @H   still may go down|pg||
nt|ady: not an unreasonable line |pg||
nt|ritong: frances is a remarkable commentator|pg||
nt|ahh: however i do not give a government guarentee with that advice |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: these are long sets for operators |pg||
nt|haans: endplays are not as good as squeeze you never know when it is working|pg||
nt|nubmaster: only 8 now|pg||
nt|haans: Ms Sokolow has only 2 @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes, so she will be endplayed|pg||
nt|petere: @D through and @H back|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|nt|haans: but you may read a book article about relay|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: right these are KO,  forgot format |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, looks like 1 or 2 off -- hardly matters really|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah all is clear now thanks to kibs |pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: specs tell me that Zia did play the @d10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D and A@C and low @S N is endplayed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|werge: Honestly: North had 4 suits for his choce - and all three seems more "normal" than this @H-Queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dont think it can be made, unless @C discard|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am inundated with ways to make - the one I like best is @H to the 7, endplaying S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is getting interesting for N|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|daman: done like dinner now|pg||
nt|raghavan: remove trumps  and develop H  |pg||
nt|haans: @D endplay I say|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|s3|nt|nubmaster: the last on Q of @d...|pg||
nt|buddyshah: amazing Operator, by far the best Open room in 6@S|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|haans: hand are with is best in the system|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
mc|12|nt|ritong: or adopt chess notation and use " ? " for dubious moves and " § " for brilliant moves   " ?! " meaning " unexpected, not sure if it is brilliant or dubious"|pg||
nt|haans: it does not always work|pg||
pg||

nt|afulton: well bid and well played by west |pg||
nt|woozle: Very soft bidding from Lavings at the other table...appears not to have even tried for seven|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may play in part H|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@H needs a diamond lead to have a chance to beat it and even then 50% or better on the bidding|pg||
mb|1H|nt|westjava: a grand slam time|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW this time|pg||
nt|afulton: this hand will make 1@h e-w or 5@s n-s|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H cold N/A and 5@S pretty bad|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should double and N will bid 5H |pg||
nt|davidstern: If you divine the diamonds and they dont get a ruff -500|pg||
nt|davidstern: else -800|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand would require some handling by both sides|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|1S|nt|westjava: may be next time:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yet another part score|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 7 this time|pg||
nt|afulton: she wont play in partscore in @H if north has a say! |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: just needs to be sure to ruff a @D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|westjava: let's we see how NS to get 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: odd?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: odds?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One this one South would prefer to defend a heart contract than play one|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sure|pg||
nt|woozle: East too strong for a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|afulton: double and then raise of 3@s to 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Neg X and on for fight bough pairs?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: On Board 23, where Hans conservatively settled for defending 2@S and beating it 1, in the OR Fu has made 4@H on an intricate play in which the AK7 opposite Tx of trumps, with Q986 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: in one defender's hand, came into play.|pg||
nt|afulton: crossing fingers that partner isnt totally broke |pg||
nt|afulton: ah, she will make only 4, not 5|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H quite timid. I would have bid 4NT and over a minor bid 5@H to show values|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hoping partner doesnt think I just have 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4 should be asking bid|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: well N has X ray eyes that there are 2 losers|pg||
nt|davidstern: So optimal spot on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: So the only big swing so far is 11 to China.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need a @D lead now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W are playing a strong NT so East's 1NT is 12-14 unless I am missing something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not THAT is a lead director 3rd seat 1@S opener :)|pg||
nt|woozle: 1S from Hirata an interesting choice... a bit weird that he didn't want to describe his hand in one bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I think I would have bid 3@D over the DBL...... to jack the auction up a level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually people have some mechanism for showing majors over a strong club|pg||
nt|afulton: wow, conservative raise!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W needed to force here|pg||
nt|jcwla: All roads probably lead to a @S partial.  W might have forced them up a level with 3@C.|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes might have bid more, although 3C can be beaten a couple of tricks anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|westjava: Japan add their imps from   27|pg||
nt|sybarra: seen pard in action (balancing) before |pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S is ok|pg||
nt|afulton: but the 1@s bid could have been made without one of those aces|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I  would do more than raise|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but perhaps a 2@H bid might have given some juice to this auction|pg||
nt|woozle: With the cards lying well, 9 tricks look inevitable|pg||
nt|afulton: lucky diamond situation (i tell you guys, @d's are key to women's bridge!)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: now W can pass info to E cheaply|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@C & 4@S both = cue bids|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One of those rare occasions where N can even show QC if they keep going|pg||
nt|sybarra: so many specs suggestion 2 @H as bid bye W |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and it isnt even a great poke hand |pg||
nt|sybarra2: misisng the inside card|pg||
nt|sybarra2: (for the straight)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if West bidding twice -- i prefer 3@C first   but i think should pass 3@D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Rob,no use redbl|pg||
nt|westjava: no loser in @C,@D and @S,then...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's that chance :)|pg||
nt|afulton: (which would show LR +) |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: the hand with short @D needs honors to pull trump -- so really dislike 3@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: best to play cross ruff here|pg||
nt|westjava: on @H and @D, yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to be sure to cash the A@C in time|pg||
nt|westjava: dont forget to remember|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ruff cash @CA and A@H and cross ruff the best I can see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't south get to ruff high on 4th @H?|pg||
nt|afulton: South was probably sitting there saying unkind words to partner before dummy hit (and a few afterwards) but all will be well on this hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Best defence is third spade hope for promote perhaps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idblu: only 1 down...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF North overcalls 1N then does Shen still bid 2@S?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|westjava: The new leader,Indonesia...|pg||
nt|davidstern: But East will be hoping for a minor trick|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|westjava: no problem...what can decl do..?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the other hand -- defense against 3@D is easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure why the pitch here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange:)|pg||
nt|westjava: a different plan...|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i dont know either why pitching...what's the line of play??|pg||
nt|mariner1: he did not pitch a loser so|pg||
nt|westjava: better 2@H (very good 3 card spade raise)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This should have been a routine 3NT or possibly 4S for E/W but clearly a wheel has come off|pg||
pc|d5|nt|westjava: 23 - 20 imps now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sad really|pg||
nt|afulton: probably best to take a @c finesse... not sure how many times she will be in south hand!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|davidstern: Would be a great hand if West held @HQ x|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: claim|pg||
nt|westjava: I bid directly if only in 6@H:):)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|westjava: may be the answer is yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: nz have got to 3@H by E here other room|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually not good to declare the same suit at both tables|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|afulton: much better than a simple 2@s... which could be anything... |pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As spec told. Any lead. It makes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|afulton: these are the kind of hands that when you play them, they take a while because you have to consider all of the variations |pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: may miss the @D ruff if not careful |pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: EW must lead low from doubletons, otherwise E couldn't have read the position|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcwla: E/W lead low-high from doubleton?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: i like duck at trick 1 -- not clear what might happen, but seems crossruff only 8 tricks to worth a try|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: @HK are one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then maybe 2@S DBL|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|nt|idblu: that's a little too fine|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|afulton: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|woozle: I think their style is to lead reverse count|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|s8|nt|jcwla: thx|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then reverted back to crossruff anyway -- so it goes|pg||
nt|afulton: she must have heard you|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: or 2@H NS|pg||
pc|d9|nt|westjava: again 9 imps to Japan   28, 6@C here and 3NT there +3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idblu: thats poss|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nigel_k:  There was some chance of making this double dummy but not easy. Good defence too.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: well done Hu!|pg||
nt|afulton: i dont think playing 2 rounds of trumps first was a good idea... since West had preempted, it was unusual that @s split so nicely... was very lucky as a matter of fact|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|cJ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ronpa: thx everyone. hope next match the israeli sqad will win! have nice day from the sunny san remo|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: So the only real big pickup this segment for Badger (and a deserved one) will be Board 6, where Allix/Neve rested in 3@S while Hinden played 3NT.|pg||
nt|werge: By to Munich|pg||
nt|don paulus: next segment was scheduled for 18.00 local time - probably some delay|pg||
nt|rnmalik: thanks all C.........U|pg||
nt|werge: Pass in West? Strange|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brgpro: how many extra bds if the match is a draw?|pg||
nt|pelu: pl stay for the last board, Massimiliano :) - u have done a great job|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i'm here :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: second half consists of 14 more exciting boards so dont go away|pg||
nt|haans: something like that yes|pg||
nt|ahh: 780 swing not enough |pg||
nt|ahh: need 900 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 4-1 @S break with K offside kills an otherwise godd 6@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: on a good day you make 6@S. This is not the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: don't know baout important|pg||
nt|athene: East in the other room was trying to kill the entry to the diamonds>|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s will be the final contract anfter 2NT-3@s ?|pg||
nt|haans: lets end last board|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|daman: thank you everyone    |pg||
nt|werge: OK - there was a double|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk4: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She was hoping for @DA with partner|pg||
nt|athene: putting her partner with the @DA|pg||
nt|ritong: after the strict fourth best lead|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case declarer would perhaps have just knocked out the @DA first of all|pg||
nt|werge: Without a @D.lead, 6 @S is a great kontrakt - but @d are for ever|pg||
nt|werge: Makes East (un)happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Thx also to EBU and all of the folks who help bring this important tourney to  BBO |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best way of pytting it I suppose is "declarer took advantage of a minor slip by the defence"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
nt|haans: a way so show @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@H is a wee bit wet|pg||
nt|don paulus: probably next segment by 18.15 or so - stay tuned on BBO TV :)|pg||
nt|buddyshah: OR simple 2@H for E-W |pg||
mb|4D|nt|haans: and Welcome back 12:30 (italy time) match continue|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: last board see you soon and sorry for my mistake ...........|pg||
nt|werge: Take a look at the score - Bakkeren did NOT make the slam|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: mistakes |pg||
nt|werge: Maybe 4 @S is the best spot now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I doubt they will bid beyond game at this table|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: west think a lot |pg||
nt|haans: its has been funny (nervy) match this far|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this segment (these semis are quite short, aren't they?), a big thank you to Roland, Bill, Paul, Mike and all specs.  Some great comments.  The second and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: final segment is scheduled for the top of the hour, so stay tuned.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows 3+ and is forcing. It denies 4 and a minimum|pg||
nt|werge: I think, that West has NO slam-ambitions here - knowing probably 6-5 by East|pg||
nt|mcarroll: putting|pg||
nt|haans: thank you all (beru included)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|april7: what a bad luck for EW again,but its not over yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i didnt envisage stayman there|pg||
nt|panja: y, Major suits..so more equal|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: only one think please Massimiliano or Max not Massimo :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: Yuval, a spectator, points out what we said that reaching the phase of 16 it's a very good achievement. True|pg||
nt|raghavan: I like this fast approach to game . |pg||
nt|ahh: game over  bad luck Sweden very well done Vito  from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: see you all tomorrow for the rest thx so much |pg||
nt|ahh: more matches tomorrow  |pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|ahh: thx to our great operator in San Remo  Massimillio|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last deal of this session. We thanl all sweey spectators, co commentatos Haans abd Jim and Dr Raranjapee, Tx to VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|haans: i was first :)|pg||
nt|april7: E is afraid of X, W might go out:):)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  thx for thoughts and comments,  we appreciate them @H@H  hope you enjoyed |pg||
nt|henryb: and to the BBO staff who make this available to them and you all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a little scary|pg||
nt|nubmaster: agree but not that easy when having both M's|pg||
nt|haans: but an easy make|pg||
nt|werge: Match over|pg||
nt|petere: so, have to go now ... lunch preparing. Thanks all and c u :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3@h could make @s disappear|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Match is not over|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is the first half of 14 boards|pg||
nt|haans: :) GOOD BYE ALL :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Yes and it's exciting, only 4 imps up...|pg||
nt|werge: Masochisme bidding by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Roland in particular who herds us cats (sometimes called commentators)   He works very hard to make this run smoothly  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: simple 3NT |pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: Whats for lunch Massi |pg||
nt|henryb: probably down 1. declarer will take the @c finesse, and a @h shift will sink the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: May be a sandwich or a salad.........very light however I could sleep on 3° tournment :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to you Roland for your yeoman efforts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous and bravi to the winners|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Play will resume tomorrow with the final (48 boards) at 10:30 CET, 4:30 am New York, 9:30 am London, 6:30 pm Sydney. Welcome back then|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye all see you tomorrow for final macht|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of specs,  we appreciate you comments and insights, @H@H!  keep them coming |pg||
nt|haans: this has been a very fun match (to watch)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nice day tommorow|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mr Haans , I am with you on the good interest of your country team|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ??? - why not keep communication?|pg||
nt|pelu: before u take the trick - be sure what u wont to play next trick - if u dont know - then dont take the trick!|pg||
nt|brgpro: she was afraid Q10x by dec. and pd Jxx|pg||
nt|brgpro: now she knows QJ10|pg||
nt|pelu: I know that S cant see QJ!0 by decl - Bocchi could have the J - but she has to decide before taking @HA|pg||
nt|charles_l: Max is shorter to type :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: in the meantime 2@h is not going to be fun...|pg||
nt|athene: are you sure 1@S promises 3 spades? an earlier board suggested NS play 1@S = any weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it won't go 8 down which is what's needed to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she both asked and looked at the convention card|pg||
nt|haans: but he has a slammy honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be fun hand also |pg||
pc|c6|nt|panja: bye|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has 3 1Ss, 2@Ds and 3 @Cs -- unless she is clairvoyant|pg||
nt|athene: and now east's 2@S bid suggests the same|pg||
nt|werge: They might loose all here - North is ready with a DOUBLE|pg||
nt|haans: passing time now|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt is that Turbo?|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, there is a play for 6 @S, even on a @D-lead - but double-dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Ignore the banner (top). It has everything wrong on it|pg||
nt|april7: why didn't N X 4@C???|pg||
nt|buddyshah: now this is interesting|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: if she makes this she will gain 10 IMPS   a day late and a dollar short|pg||
nt|haans: overboard only if they x|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Got any news about the times Roland? Is it 13.30 Paris time for next half?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk5: It's a quarter-final from whe *women's* event|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On that lead it's even close to making|pg||
nt|don paulus: he liked that contr|pg||
nt|werge: I think, that South and West should form a pair - same style on this board!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|werge: South has no entry now to the @H-tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: might have done better leading @dK at trick 2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Now she has three heart tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The losers will both win a bronze medal. No play-off for third place|pg||
nt|daman: is there a website Roland?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: is there a playoff for third, or do both semifinal losers get bronze?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: read above|pg||
nt|ritong: see up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|dcbutler: too quick for me, Roland|pg||
nt|daman: thanks|pg||
nt|ady: this might make|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer a simple 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the winning teams go to quarterfinals, losers go to play in the open pairs, or go home crying, or go to a restaurant to get drunk|pg||
nt|werge: Best play was to take first trick with @S Q - K might be doubleton - and an entry was safe|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: is she?|pg||
nt|sybarra: go for your woman's intuition!|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is thinking about it |pg||
nt|sybarra: I can feel it |pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: feel good shirley|pg||
nt|aupillon: it's over ( sung by Robinson)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: two ruffs|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt felt better |pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope this doesnt sould slammish to Bertens |pg||
nt|sybarra: *sound|pg||
nt|haans: it sounds to me STOP SOON!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brgpro: and 4 trumps and @cA|pg||
nt|ritong: one club|pg||
nt|werge: South should know, that if E/W can make 6 @C - they would have bid 7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|werge: - and he knew|pg||
nt|werge: We learn about South - that he is a she...|pg||
nt|haans: and we have a winner|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Some imps to O'Rourke, they missed 4@s last deal at the last table...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh if was Bertens who made the try wit 4 @C,  forget my comment |pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to all commentators, our brilliant bbo operator|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brgpro: well, she tried Merimac copu|pg||
nt|pelu: 27 = flat - so this board will decide the winner|pg||
nt|brgpro: coup|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So Hauge (Norway/Bulgaria) vs Neve (Franc) in the final tomorrow. Hauge won comprehensively against De Botton (England)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: O´Rourke is a SHE|pg||
nt|werge: South is Lou Ann - and the family name is your guess...|pg||
nt|haans: we will remember that to next fight|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: absolutly MRS O'ROURKE|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: France  even|pg||
nt|haans: we learn all the time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Massi|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: and our spectators with their guiding comments|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|aupillon: and Master and Commander = Roland Wald|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d5|nt|pelu: now 9 toptricks - working for an overtrick|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: 11 IMPs to France it seems|pg||
nt|sybarra: and -1 coming |pg||
nt|ronpa: now declarer can make by squeezing East in the minors|pg||
nt|ronpa: just run all the trumps|pg||
nt|joemanjo: sqz|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: she does possess supernatural powers then|pg||
pc|hT|nt|werge: - and my grangmother once had the North hand, she double 4 @C... (By for now...)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|charles_l: only consolation is its only 50 a pop|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry I lost all |pg||

nt|nubmaster: thank you all, see ya later|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: too late now|pg||

nt|MolvaM: I believe next set will start at 6pm paris time|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|dcbutler: she could always make it, i think|pg||
nt|daman: lose by 4    ouch|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is the squeeze going to work?|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: Cool hand.|pg||
