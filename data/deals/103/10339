nt|ady: 1@D    south?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David |pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no room for -en in Christiansen, so we will see Christians|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think n/s play a club system, however I find 1 @D an unusual opening |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C = diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play transfer advances|pg||
nt|justin c: or not|pg||

nt|xenya: the names are wrong though|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ciao a tutti, hello everyone and welcome back to Sanremo in Italy for the 4th European Open Bridge Championships. Open Teams, final, three segments of 16 boards|pg||
nt|xenya: or not? sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w  can save in 6@H for -800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told they have some canape elements in their system |pg||
nt|justin c: north cue bidding to show a good @C raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@h good raise in @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Justin :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: great to have a tarzan expert with us :) phewwwwwwww|pg||
nt|niekbrink: if you find the king of clubs you will make six clubs|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s have a foolproof 5 @cs|pg||
nt|justin c: headed to 5@C i imagine|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: hi|pg||
nt|xenya: just another slam here -- there have been quite a few in the firdt half i guess|pg||
nt|justin c: also a possible 3@SX|pg||
nt|xenya: *first|pg||
nt|justin c: East bidding a lot with that collection|pg||
nt|yuval10: W = Barel|pg||
mb|3S|nt|werge: Please repeat the bidding...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ciao again Eugenio :)|pg||
nt|werge: hi from here also|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy, Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to asses value of e/w hands|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Hi all|pg||
nt|mowen: and Justin|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: y, they are both imaginative players, and very nice guys|pg||
nt|werge: Here|pg||
nt|ady: be interesting to know what 3@C showed|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hans |pg||
nt|roswolf: hi shirley|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Shirley of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Bob and Nigel|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi all|pg||
nt|mowen: good lead|pg||
nt|mowen: should beat this easily|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very threadbare 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|mowen: and pushy 3NT bid|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Same contract in OR but 3 of @s as lead...|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like Welland decided that EW were prepared for a spade lead, so has tried his luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But decl can play a small now|pg||
nt|justin c: or maybe he just doesnt like to lead Zia's suit :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think a spade lead also beats it but this is better|pg||
nt|justin c: not sure what declarer is going to do trick 1|pg||
nt|nubmaster: small from both hands but then after second to ace Zia can attack with a @s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnc: Welcome to this match from group Q, leading Apteker (74 VPs) vs Welland third (53 VPs)|pg||
nt|werge: I´ve seen worse 4 @H-contracts|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome to this match between two teams in the qualifying positions at the moment, but close enough to the cut off line that a loss here could be a serious blow|pg||
nt|werge: The lead is safing trick number 7 for East - can´t misguess the @S-suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland, Shirley, Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|patricck: EW can make 3NT, but bidding it isn't certain|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wc all|pg||

nt|pelu: hi Jordan and Urban - US - Sweden- Denmark - good cocktail :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3nt by south at the other table|pg||
nt|werge: Should lead to 3 NT with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like at least one off, even after this lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: pleasant lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'll do my best :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Edgar Rice B. is here?|pg||
nt|snorris: this is shaky|pg||
nt|niekbrink: this is a dangerous contract|pg||
nt|niekbrink: maybe east will lead a diamond|pg||
nt|niekbrink: in which case trouble is over|pg||
nt|snorris: tempting sequence in @ds|pg||
nt|jbgood: a slam to start this session|pg||
mb|4C|nt|nubmaster: yes it is :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4-2 fit played very well in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Stefanov opened 2NT in OR and is playing 3NT after Puppet sequence.  Got @H lead there.|pg||
nt|snorris: and he fell for it|pg||
nt|justin c: 3nt does not make a lot of sense - it needs the @C suit to come in (on a @H lead), but any time the @C suit comes in you make 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: other room play 3@s, i believe|pg||
nt|werge: Interesting start, might survive trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: Hi Roland max on air :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ciao Max|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 3@h of W indicates that he has @s's, a fact that can aid declarer in his play|pg||
nt|xenya: @D lead beats it easily|pg||
nt|jcwla: Slightly unbalanced 2NT opener here - so of course pd just HAS to have both majors.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rnc: The Apteker team is a mixed of South Africa and Sweden|pg||
nt|justin c: so angelini going minus in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: But there might be a danger - only give away ONE red trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jean |pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to get @ds going for a @s discard|pg||
nt|justin c: down by 20 plus, they might have tried for slam here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good judgment|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5C needs the heart guess plus diamonds to behave nicely|pg||
nt|niekbrink: hearing story from the open room, this might wel be 10 imps for the dutch to start wiht|pg||
nt|jbgood: there are13 tricks in hearts - but i wonder if he can get to them..|pg||
mb|4N|nt|werge: The job is easier with North as declarer|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jean|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we know what the 3 @C was?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: vProoyen-Verhees play an Italian based strong club with canape opening bids|pg||
nt|patricck: the play shouldn't take long, 2 imps to harangozo|pg||
nt|andyv:  Roland, did W have 1@S available or was that also a transfer?|pg||
nt|patricck: 1 imp sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice quick auction:)|pg||
nt|justin c: but have stopped safely in 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@S shows exactly 5=5 12-14 p.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To all those who are asking. BBO does not decide the matches we get, so approach the EBL if you are unhappy. Personally, I think it's fine that we have the women, just for once|pg||
nt|xenya: but no reason why E should lead that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Hello Calle and Avram|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi Roland and Avram|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|justin c: @H10 to indicate a @S entry|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like a squeeze will make 13 tricks in NT also?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk4: Ciao a tutti, hello everyone and welcome back to Sanremo in Italy for the 4th European Open Bridge Championships. Open Teams, Round of 32, last segment of 14 boards|pg||
nt|jcwla: Muller blocked the @H's by leading away from KTx when in with @CK but still set it 1.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good slam though|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Rob.|pg||
nt|jbgood: if I am not counting incorrectly there are 13 also in nt - east being squeezed in the black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I prefer the OR auction.  There, N rebid 3@C over 2@H and S bid the 3NT.|pg||
nt|werge: East knows, that South has 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=3  for standing and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|hantveit: Now south will be pushed to make it. He must take the diamond finesse. I cannot see other ways to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: No other way |pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe south could go wrong if east ducked the heart lead?|pg||
nt|werge: No - he would just fines in @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C would be transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: name for west is STEGAROIU.... BBO nick is pisoy|pg||
nt|andyv:  considering the last set of boards, this is a pretty tame start.|pg||
nt|justin c: well done|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm not sure that is the case on a @d lead - there are entry problems|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - i withdraw my last comment:)'|pg||
nt|jbgood: and put it back on:):)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|april7: either W plays S having the ace of @H or might endplay N to lead away from K of @S, I thing he will choose the later|pg||
nt|athene: north couldn't really double, even though he knows the hearts are no good|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wc all co commentators|pg||
nt|athene: E-W might have a million tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, though declarer is surely doomed|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt S was thinking abput converting to 6N, looking at @SAQ|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, either contract makes, thanks to the @C finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer only need to guess trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: E I mean |pg||
nt|chmitty: Seems that the strong Zimmermann team has had some problems during the first half|pg||
nt|chmitty: Trailing by 55 Imp's|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Pierre, Justin and Bill|pg||
nt|xenya: that helps of course, but declarer could make it anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: he knows that his only chance is AJXX or ATXX or AXX with W|pg||
nt|yuval10: but now he can also let 2 trump trick go away and still make|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: good shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Verhees only in 5 so he could take the club finesse |pg||
nt|justin c: y, the last set was very swingy|pg||
nt|jcwla: I stand by mine from the start. :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course you play safe for 12 in 6 NT|pg||
nt|rhelle:  te other table is in 6@c ... that won't make|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good start for Israel here|pg||
nt|jbgood: win the di ace, five rounds of hearts throwing dias and a club, then spade AQ - and the di king should squeeze E in the blacks|pg||
nt|jbgood: if he was in 7:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=5334  Ophir Herbst|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=5333  Ilan Herbst|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yup E would be singing that Peter Paul and Mary tune: "I'm being swallowed by a boa constrictor / and I don't like it very much..."|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4569  Bauke Muller|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=21130  Simon de Wijs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Service Uanavailable means that server is busy, too many hits. Try again later|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The WBF server is not world class; can't take more than 3 hits at a time|pg||
nt|jbgood: Bauke Muller was on the victorious Dutch team in Bermuda Bowl 1993 in Chile (guess who lost the final:))|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Rob predicted 6@C went down 1 so looking like 14 to Herbst to cut the deficit almost in half in one board.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hantveit: he definately should do that :)|pg||
nt|ady: showing long diamonds   - but undefined strength?|pg||
nt|sybarra: which was off |pg||
nt|sybarra: East |pg||
nt|andyv:  E pretty aggressive with 11 count and void in pd's suit|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has a good hand if there's any fit at all in diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: A club shift is needed that too C 10 preferably|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... and got stuck over 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: east would rather south were on lead|pg||
nt|athene: because south might find it harder to attack clubs, leading up to the concealed hand|pg||
nt|athene: but he wants to duck the first diamond to keep his entries fluid|pg||
nt|hedyg: happy to have stopped now in 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jon was very young then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: NL beat Norway and Jon was in the Norwegian team|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Holland remains unlucky with slam, here's another one that fails on a bad trump break|pg||
nt|jbgood: at least some years younger, Roland|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nubmaster: yes but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: Hi all|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am trying to make our operator correct the typo in South's name|pg||
nt|Walddk4: m  instead of  h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Grazie Sergio|pg||

nt|chmitty: Well done :)|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: seems he dound the only wrong line|pg||
nt|xenya: *found|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h from E could've challenged the contract better|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: No, 1@S would be natural|pg||
nt|athene: @H5 = "clubs are nice" :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|werge: - and to win|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a 1-round force|pg||
nt|chmitty: That's a difficult name|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: But since Jens is that strong, he can afford to show his longer suit first|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Martin Wüst from Germany|pg||
nt|werge: In closed, East - a bridge teacher of good reputation! - bid 1 @D over ! C. (BON appetit!)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT would show clubs|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer shows out in a suit, the defence can use it for suit-preference right away|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so this is a well-deserved swing to Israel|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: declarer playing to make, but now the roof falls in|pg||
nt|athene: he's lucky north doesn't have @h8 or @h7 :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: North is Rajesh Tiwari and South is Honey Prabakar both from India|pg||
nt|justin c: the @CK lives up to its reputation of being offside and singleton :)|pg||
nt|xenya: but 6@H is better|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it looks like making|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: north claim and west ask for a few second to think|pg||
nt|xenya: E should have played another @H to tap the dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 7 imps for netherlands and a good start|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  process of elimination...6@s lead probably not 4th best:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Even H from South is good|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chmitty: But for a great player|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to William Frisby|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|desert: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: @H6 saves declarer another 50|pg||

pc|d4|nt|paulg: North-South convention card available at http://tinyurl.com/mrkrj7 (PDF)|pg||
nt|chmitty: seems around 8 tricks now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|werge: Closed for France is Ph. Soulet. M. Lebel|pg||
nt|hantveit: The right club play ther was to play club to q, and a new club. picking up Jxxxx by west|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trump lead was indicated on the bidding|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Martin.|pg||
nt|xenya: as long @D can be set up for a @C discard|pg||
nt|justin c: y, in 6@H he might be able to set up a @D trick for a @C discard|pg||
nt|xenya: hello George|pg||
nt|justin c: sry, too slow|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nubmaster: hi Martin|pg||
nt|bobholl: than indeed no chance|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: assuming he has been following the spot cards of course|pg||

nt|raghavan: It comes to 4 down|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Ralf Willquist|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rnc: Looks like a good start for Apteker, 11 IMPS|pg||
nt|athene: whoops|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: he missed the fall of the @H87|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: weird|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hantveit: if west had Jxxx, south could play diamond to A and finesse the club J|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello all|pg||
nt|niekbrink: drijver forgot about the 9 of spades|pg||
nt|jcwla: My commentary partner from 6 hours ago, Kieran Dyke, would cite this hand as evidence of "his rule" never to lead from a four-card suit headed by the ace at NT.|pg||
nt|justin c: he might be right|pg||
nt|snorris: thar is a good rule|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/nycmu2 for running scores in both matches|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnc: hi Ralf|pg||
pc|h5|nt|werge: How often do we see and end-play - making 90 out of 70|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: The germans have a nice word for this: Write +-(score) and win...|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When they play in declarer's second suit you usually just reach for a trump and put it on the table|pg||
nt|xenya: same result in OR|pg||
nt|justin c: as against that, though, on a @C lead he would have to decide right away what to play for|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nubmaster: we start with a push here... |pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: hi Calle|pg||

nt|pelu: 3Nt again - but some work|pg||
nt|ady: cant see the problem of playing on spades first|pg||
nt|sybarra: E returned a club |pg||
nt|werge: Oh - even 110|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is something wrong with the spelling of North's name. I'll find out how|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe it was Zhudzinksi playing it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Bill :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done N/S|pg||
nt|justin c: only 1 off in the other room (maybe on a @S lead)|pg||
nt|justin c: would have made this with the @CK wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: true, but here it would be a purely psychological problem|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nubmaster: south will be looking for slam here, dont you think? nice cards though|pg||
nt|sybarra: Lets try that website instead of PABF   (sorry)|pg||
nt|raghavan: wc back all|pg||
nt|athene: amusing layout here|pg||
nt|andyv:  another flatish looking board|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT with @H lead ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting hand....let's see if EW can find their @s fit and sacrifice over 4@h|pg||
nt|jcwla: In fact I think at that point it was limited to 12 - needed to cash @DA when was in hand - I was ready to cue the waltz...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|werge: This double - just what East was hoping for|pg||
nt|werge: East has 13 loosers|pg||
nt|justin c: if this is a penalty double it looks quite aggressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: No majors call by E.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S is a 40% chance that doesn't make today, however the imp chart for teams encourages you to bid vulnerable games, even at those odds|pg||
nt|hantveit: Welcome to closed room Match A. |pg||
nt|chmitty: East is also Desmoulins and not Desnoulins|pg||
nt|justin c: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4@h for sure|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good but thin 4S on this hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: i thought he cashed the di honors. sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS have a club control - they just don't realise it :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s looks like down 1 with @c lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh good - so we didn't use up ALL the freakish hands in the semis.|pg||
nt|jbgood: lucky slam on here in hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|april7: on careful defence S should go down in 4@H losing 2@S and 2 @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 1NT, 2NT, 3@C?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C it is|pg||
nt|haans: nothing is really good|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make up to 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: north should surely pass this|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, looks like 4@H for NS|pg||
nt|daman: Muller could be the slowest player in San Remo|pg||
nt|daman: "deliberate"|pg||
nt|justin c: is this a penalty double, or...?|pg||
nt|xenya: he might vie for the title even on a larger scale i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: What has South showed - to me it can just as well go for a 15-17 as for 12-14|pg||
nt|andyv:  choice of games|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of points for n/s but need to stay quietly in game|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of points and hard to find a contract...probably will end up at 3N |pg||
nt|Walddk4: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|athene: of course the defence can take the first five|pg||
nt|athene: if they don't, it gets interesting|pg||
nt|athene: normal play with this sort of hand is cash one AK and try to drop the Q|pg||
nt|athene: then fall back on the finesse in the other suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Niek Brink|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h making is a very good result|pg||
nt|niekbrink: hi all|pg||
nt|jbgood: impossible to bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nubmaster: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: Zimmerman is ranked  1 and WH is tied for second at moment |pg||
nt|jeanhari: this will just make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hegedus|pg||
nt|bobholl: how reliable is P at this VUlna|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S is going to make a few overtricks|pg||
nt|mowen: 9@D helps|pg||
nt|snorris: my bet is some @ds bid by west|pg||
nt|justin c: lol, he might|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There it is|pg||
nt|andyv:  upside down n:)|pg||
nt|patricck: need to stay in 4@H, both 3NT and 5@D would be unlucky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they stop in game I wonder|pg||
nt|niekbrink: this probably forces partner to bid 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|jcwla: The X of 2@C prevents any possibility of 3NT.|pg||
nt|justin c: does it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@c is artificial ... they start every intermediate hand with 2@c|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 3@H bid here, showing this @H suit. |pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: I like the pas from East - 5-5 in major, but too weak - 2@D (Michael) only help opp to find the right play|pg||
nt|bobholl: but in 2nd seat :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry no explanation of 2NT in the CC|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5 of a minor is no better but can West stop in a partscore after the opening bid?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Heart ruff may beat it but 3NT also possible|pg||
nt|daman: Michael Rosenberg is the current champion|pg||
nt|xenya: oh|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's more like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: I learned: In the middle = 14-16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Hungarians did in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems to be a general gf bid|pg||
nt|niekbrink: good result from Israel in the open room|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Niek|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Niek|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now it's up to Barel|pg||
nt|xenya: quite exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: East has an easy defence here|pg||
nt|pelu: to bid 2@D = hi opp - can I help u .)|pg||
nt|ady: with K@C onside  had they been breaking 3NT would have made |pg||
nt|bobholl: i couldn't but my partners open not that ligth|pg||
nt|justin c: perhaps the x showed a major-minor two suiter, and now north is cue bidding to try to get to game in the major (only a guess)|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D was rich|pg||
nt|niekbrink: well done by Barel |pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: Looks like 3nt can be made EV Hans? 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades and one heart. |pg||
nt|patricck: nicely done|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes judged to a T|pg||
nt|andyv:  quality of E @h suit made bidding on precarious|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Opposite some partners you would worry about losing 4 trump tricks or so|pg||
nt|athene: NS might play Gazzilli here - 1NT or 2@C artificial with strong hands|pg||
nt|snorris: 2@c showed @ds I am told|pg||
nt|justin c: with the @CA in north, E hand looks pretty good|pg||
nt|rhelle:  even 3@s is likely to go off on a @d lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice bid by Barel|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nubmaster: yes, in pairs you ca be more agressive but no reason to act here...|pg||
nt|werge: West ducks the @H-lead, and best for defence will now be a @S-shiftm killing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe not |pg||

nt|andyv:  E didn't even bother to cue @ss|pg||
nt|patricck: should be routine not to finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Søren Christiansen always takes his time. He is a very competent declarer. Was in the Danish team that won the bronze medal at the Olympoics in Rhodes in 1996|pg||
nt|patricck: but position of A@C would mean declarer is safe in any case|pg||
nt|hantveit: Monaco came 16th with 116 points in Swiss A, while Zimmerman won with 142 points.|pg||
nt|bobholl: with Q of @D tumbling down 6 is easy :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: Yes, how to reach 6 on this hand?|pg||
nt|bobholl: a protective micheals is somewhat undefined in strength i suppose :)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2NT isn't needed as big balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: he bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: i believe Bocchi-Duboin played it as 6-4 with 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|justin c: on a @C lead, needs only a @S finesse to succeed in 3n|pg||
nt|snorris: 3nt hings on @s king in place|pg||
nt|xenya: double game swing in sight now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|werge: If North continues @H, 9 tricks look safe|pg||
nt|hantveit: and south is not overtaking, he might overtake with K|pg||
nt|werge: Sout´s hesitation shows West, that she has K-x|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, that is a problem.|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good 4/5 club bid took away room for NS|pg||
nt|snorris: ecco..|pg||
nt|jcwla: They're a level higher in the OR.|pg||
nt|yuval10: what was the 2@d Niek?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: NS should be careful to beat this. I think they have to play clubs in time|pg||
nt|jbgood: a likely push|pg||
pc|c4|nt|werge: In you unblock the King, West is home|pg||
nt|ady: but that would have beden a lucky make|pg||
nt|werge: They just start bidding board 1 now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is gf with 4+ @cs or balanced as per CC..|pg||
nt|bobholl: everything that could be wrong is wrong :(|pg||
nt|justin c: it was, particularly with the @DQ wasted|pg||
nt|rhelle:  small @c next?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  or maybe the @dJ, and then a small @c|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, good point. And his partner...|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes hard to govdown here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|werge: Over now 400 E/W|pg||
nt|werge: What´s problem - with @H 4-3 yoy just loose 4 red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: you|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H natural and minimum i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and this should be the end of the line|pg||
nt|andyv:  no 3@s or !4C from Versace|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c might ask for shortness and 3@H=@c?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: the 2@D in Open = 2@HX by East!|pg||
nt|jcwla: I paid my entry fee, I am in there helping them out at these colors. :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR east plays 2@hx|pg||
nt|andyv:  re hi|pg||
nt|athene: a fairly typical contrast in styles between the two sides here - West in the other room bid 3@C over 1@H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They are in 4@s in OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: now must underlead @h and get @d ruff to defeat|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  one more try:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2nt relay , 3@C minimum, 3@D relay, 3@H 5=5, 4@D set @H like trumps|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - 5...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|justin c: the hand with long @C now has no entry|pg||
nt|niekbrink: no danger there either i guess|pg||
nt|snorris: not realy..with @h back remeber to ruff high|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nubmaster: just after a cue-bid showing M's|pg||
nt|justin c: very aggressive bid with that @C suit|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wouldn't have made :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 2@c not enough|pg||
nt|athene: but it wasn't really possible for NS to get their hands on 3@CX|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess that is why Brink chose 2NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But N as decl got the J of @c out...|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 time..|pg||
nt|niekbrink: i dont know what 2 diamonad was. I used to play as a constructive race with a 3 card support|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nubmaster: perhaps 2@c wass conventional by EW...?|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding the double - you have an open bridge-book for playing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: At the other table W plats 1NT doubled|pg||
nt|nubmaster: plays|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, the @S Jack is saving a lot for E/W|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: rather easy to see that there are 2 tricks in @d|pg||
nt|werge: But home now|pg||
nt|werge: claim|pg||
nt|hantveit: The contract can always be made, if south is not overtaking the hearts, dec can take the first trick and play diamonds. THAT wuold be a prize play :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Dano says 2NT set @H as trump|pg||
nt|justin c: still ok at the five level|pg||
nt|rhelle:  only just ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  a much easier sequence for stoneage bidding:)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the fact that the @s 10 drops may make the difference in the end|pg||
nt|hedyg: you mean 1@s-2@d-2@H-4@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract already in danger if A@s was with W.|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace thinking swing|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he bids on, he will get his wish|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: me 2...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|werge: First trick very interesting in this 3 NT...|pg||
nt|patricck: these two teams are tied for 14th=, but just 3 victory points ahead of the cut line|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  couldn't talk himself into bidding 6@h:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: tried though|pg||
nt|yuval10: wd Drijver|pg||
nt|niekbrink: nice defense|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: there was just no good bid to show the S hand|pg||
nt|justin c: i imagine declarer will pitch clubs on spades then ruff a @C|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, that's why dropping the @s 10 is so important|pg||
nt|rhelle:  otherwise, with trumps 3-1, he'd run out of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: right now Lauria is wondering why he is playing on the 5 level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They will be pleased that just about any partscore goes down as well|pg||
nt|niekbrink: still losing 11 imps on the hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Jens Auken was also in the team, but they were not partners|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D opener didn't stop east leading his 5-card suit in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps they play a strong club, so 1@D was nebulous?|pg||
nt|athene: that was weird|pg||
nt|athene: he really went up with the @CA??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good play to remove the entry from West first |pg||
nt|nubmaster: He will make now, loosing to the two kings|pg||
nt|justin c: how is 4@S going to do in the other room?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes he could even make two diamonds now with KQ both offside|pg||
nt|nubmaster: first a finesse, then checking @h, they dont break so another @d finesse...|pg||
nt|justin c: EW might duck a @H, threatening a @H ruff|pg||
nt|justin c: (vs 4@S i mean)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: To late... the lead was J of @c and now N has finessed @s to E|pg||
nt|xenya: can play his left shoe it seems -- 1@S, 1@H, 2@Ds and a @C there for the taking|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) on Monday. Five more rounds of Swiss tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is full tourney site:  http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|yuval10: yet still 11 imps for Israel looks likely|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|s4|nt|nubmaster: not so good communication here, 9 of @d solves the problem|pg||
nt|athene: playing low guarantees you nine tricks doesn't it?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - a lot of possibilities|pg||
nt|werge: Faster this way - 140|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They lost in the semi-final against Indonesia after 8 extra boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|justin c: y, the @H109 make quite a difference|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  @h?|pg||
nt|justin c: Looks like he will give E a @S trick, win the @C return, cash @H ending in dummy, then run the @DJ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: may be 8 |pg||
nt|xenya: well done indeed -- NS couldn't do more on this hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: very good bridge here at this table|pg||
nt|niekbrink: pas by Drijver on 4 spades meant he did not want to bid 5h. If he would have doubled, he would like his partner to bid 5 h|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Herbst brothers in the OR has already won the event in his 1st edition, back in menton 2003, as part of the Israeli "Kalish" team|pg||
nt|yuval10: does any of the dutch pairs played in the winning team of 2005 ?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: yes, the pair in the other room|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Muller - de Wijs won in Tenerife|pg||
nt|niekbrink: In tenerife the opponents surrendered after 2 of the 3 sessions|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so this might well be their first 48 board match at the open Europeans|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|raghavan: Yes but could have easily got a club trick|pg||
nt|niekbrink: notice that drijver returned his lowest heart from 2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: sometimes you do want to make that sort of play|pg||
nt|athene: rise Axx with KJx in hand|pg||
nt|athene: if you want to persuade the defence to continue their first line of attack|pg||
nt|andyv:  too advanced for me... prefer to take the tricks defence gives me|pg||
nt|athene: but not here, when playing low gives you 9 on top|pg||
nt|athene: and the heart finesse risks them winning and taking the diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  People do open hands like East now but I doubt it really pays|pg||
nt|bobholl: terrible lack of tricks but that will be the case at both tables :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|snorris: did n falsecard?|pg||
mc|13|nt|hedyg: A@c lead vs 3@H in OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nyström went down in 5@H in our other match. He finessed @S9 which may well be the best line. Just not here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 3|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: ok 1down|pg||
nt|niekbrink: no other options but 1 off i think now|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|jcwla: So helpful to tell pd about a suit like this (not so much on this particular bd) - some people require X number of side cards also...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: most don't. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|werge: Flat boards now and then means = good bridge|pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting hands NS|pg||
nt|werge: I open 1 @H - the "less bad"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You will see them practise a lot on BBO, not least in the JEC mathes. Usernames are sac and jauken|pg||

nt|bobholl: @H 8 didn't promote ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: not quite|pg||
nt|chmitty: don't think so|pg||
nt|athene: one thing worth mentioning is:- many people ask "is it right to bid 3@C with west or not?" |pg||
nt|athene: because passing and bidding 3@C are two actions so different, people think one must be much better than the other|pg||
nt|athene: but that isn't true|pg||
nt|athene: your expectation might be nearly the same|pg||

nt|snorris: a slam|pg||
nt|jcwla: not a happy one|pg||
nt|daman: they will reach slam   maybe even the grand salami|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 12 tricks seems a lot|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nubmaster: and easy 4@s here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ironic i think :) they were lucky... 5 or 10 out seemed more reasonable|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Let's see if Zia is shooting higher...|pg||
nt|mowen: 6@C is partner has classic preempts|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This is Welland :)|pg||
nt|justin c: well give North @CAxxxxxx and out and they would have 12 on top|pg||
nt|mowen: does he pull bids out usually?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in all Open matches|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He's adventurous|pg||
nt|justin c: the actual north hand not 'classic'|pg||
nt|mowen: thats true|pg||
nt|niekbrink: you don't get 26 HCP every day|pg||
nt|xenya: and a 13th on a squeeze?|pg||
nt|yuval10: no slam here with @c lead, so the Dutch pair did well in collecting 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: South has a 5 loser hand. North a 6 loser|pg||
nt|athene: NS in other room might play a strong @C, i thought, so 1@D only 2+ or something|pg||
nt|athene: then diamond lead much more attractive, of course|pg||
nt|athene: if one style was clearly inferior, it would have been weeded out by now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT=9-12 in 1st favorable..|pg||
nt|justin c: this might be a keycard ask (I dont know the system)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: it is|pg||
nt|nubmaster: y it is|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@h for NS here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: That´s why he should have won the @c trick earlier and not be squeezed on the @d|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks for e/w  in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The most notable fact is that Team Lavazza did not qualify for Swiss A and that they won't qualify for the knockout phase either. They are currently 28th in Swiss B|pg||
nt|bobholl: could have been 6 |pg||
nt|justin c: not shy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s=nf natural|pg||
nt|mowen: this does really solve the problem|pg||
nt|justin c: y, the S hand not too bad :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok for me, but I have a passed partner, |pg||
nt|ady: sorry 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I am sure they are having a wonderful time as well as great bridge |pg||
nt|bobholl: only 5 or so in 14 :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: now a@C lead beats 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The rooms are not linked after the open room crash I'm afraid. We need our operator in this room to shut down and reconnect|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 6h i think|pg||
mb|2D|nt|desert: not really.....Being vul and facing a passed pd i prefer pass|pg||
nt|hantveit: I agree Hans, I prefer IH also. The hand is too strong to open 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 6), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead impossible to find|pg||
nt|athene: 12 tricks is a lot|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 3NT went down1 so Texan gets another 12 IMP|pg||
nt|athene: did declarer set up the clubs, or manage to get 3 ruffs in dummy?|pg||
nt|hedyg: how should S find a @c lead?|pg||
nt|athene: well, if 2@S showed clubs, that's a hint|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eugenio?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A good system using 4D as RKCB when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|mowen: an ask for suit length/quality would be better|pg||
nt|snorris: think so too|pg||
nt|niekbrink: oh no, hearts break 4-0|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Grand slam is not obvious - I don't think there is a squeeze, because all threats are in North|pg||
nt|justin c: if they were to reach the grand salami, do they have a thirteenth?|pg||
nt|xenya: well perhaps not -- sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle:  if South keeps the @h as a threat, it has no entry - and that would spoil any squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: very straightforward and correct bidding, but not a pleasant spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They stopped in 1NT next door after a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S transfer :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: it showed @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please be quiet for a second|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't you see that I am trying to say something to the operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The rooms are not linked after the open room crash I'm afraid. We need our operator in this room to shut down and reconnect|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2 was indeed a push at 110 in @D's.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nubmaster: 3NT by north after showing @s support in the OR...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: showing 3c support?|pg||
nt|hantveit: West has a 6 loser hand, East 7, East will push to game but no more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Spade or heart lead with East?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: actually, on the current layout pass is the best thing drijver can do|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so on proper defence it's never more than 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and even that contract did not make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Same lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  may be forced to play hearts correctly for this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But declarer will likely use his entry to dummy to finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT can be made double dummy, but only double dummy, declarer is very unlikely to play for Qxx of hearts offside and AQ of spades with a doubleton diamond |pg||
nt|athene: the former, on a trump lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: will be heading for slam in S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West looking for a major suit fit - 2NT was his alternative|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-15 NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  @d spots make leaving entry tempting|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be they will bid 6 now |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, no double, no trouble|pg||
nt|chmitty: may be a small one here. Seems that EW could make 2NT but not 3 @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: no polish NT :)|pg||
nt|justin c: given the scoreline, South might have doubled this|pg||
nt|chmitty: he was probably hoping another bid by West after the cuebid|pg||
nt|justin c: i am getting many comments about the wisdom or otherwise of finessing the @S9 vs spades from the top|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  There is no bid that asks which opponent has KD|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Seems, that West (and East) have overbid their hands|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 hearts is checking if partner has a max hand..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh well, it's only going to go down 1|pg||
nt|niekbrink: even on any other lead, 12 tricks is a lot. Only 5 spades maybe 4 hearts and 2 minor suit tricks|pg||
mb|2N|nt|april7: N can't imagine such a weak hand with his partner|pg||
nt|pelu: dont push to hard - u risk to push op in ¤@s - making :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: weak nt opening by E and 3@S the contract in OR|pg||
nt|patricck: very aggressive by East in particular, game is not good, though we have all seen worse....  not even close to making on this layout of course|pg||
nt|bobholl: serious 3 nt ??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With all this bidding they're lucky nobody makes a lead directing double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1NT-2NT-3NT better|pg||
nt|snorris: they are on their way|pg||
nt|snorris: to slam|pg||
nt|daman: even Roland couldn't make this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@D? I can|pg||
nt|xenya: would he bid it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: South is not so interested in 3NT with this weak hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Balicki Zmudzinski in 6@D on board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A discouraging spade perhaps, the 8 or the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a "correct way to play @H's? if so its now |pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder what 2@h was about since no alert.|pg||
nt|hedyg: save them for poor Nystrom ?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: not that great a contract   need spade break plus only to lose 1 diamond trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no but the easthand wont pas any invitation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I know Søren too well|pg||
nt|hantveit: And then 4H: I have done enough.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I guess it largely depends on what he knows / suspects about the overall distribution|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@H is a pretty good contract until the trumps break 4-0|pg||
nt|rhelle:  On the other table, Holland are in 6@d, and Bas Drijver is thinking ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it would seem that you need to play for Qxx in order to have a chance|pg||
nt|athene: well, if 2@C was not GF, 2@H might just be 4th suit forcing to set up GF|pg||
nt|athene: even if no alert|pg||
nt|athene: or it might be garozzo-type auction where 2@C = clubs or balanced; 2@D = 11-15 without 4 hearts; 2@H = asking|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be... I'd still expect an alert:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This will be a push since OR also no slam 4S+2|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead looks very likely in here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another "easy" slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 in a row |pg||
nt|rhelle:  spologies ...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1NT = relay, 2@d = natural|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay, 2@s = 55|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2NT = relay, 3@h = exactly 5-2-5-1|pg||
nt|rhelle:  slam is still far away from East's perspcetive|pg||
nt|rhelle:  sadly I have to go ... customer appointment|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bye Rob.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he can bid 3@s as a strong relay, asking for controls|pg||
nt|rhelle:  or 4@c as a weak relay, askign for min/max|pg||
mb|4C|nt|werge: I find Wests transfer-bid worse of all - he has nothing but his good health|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has been  employed at my bridge centre for 16 years|pg||
nt|athene: the only slight danger with trump lead is something like @SKJx in dummy and @SAxxxx in declarer's hand|pg||
nt|athene: partner doesn't usually thank you for finding his trump queen at trick 1|pg||
nt|raghavan: william and Andy - could 2H be 4th suit forcing twlling there is game?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Yes, 3nt there would work. But would you bid it with a flat 7 loser hand?|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't finesse i suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: @d lead to the Q was enough as declarer squeezed his way later for 12|pg||
nt|xenya: a coffee hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 tricks are likely here though|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so could be 1 imp to the Dutch|pg||
nt|rhelle:  if Max, it also asks for controls|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so West will bid 4@d, not max with 4+ controls (only 3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: West will start in his BEST minor|pg||
nt|werge: Oh no...|pg||
nt|hantveit: Probably not. If D 2 is single, and south club AQ then you are down.|pg||
nt|andyv:  finessing 9@s seems to be the lesser line...play for 3-3 spades or 10@s to drop or, finally, A@c to be onside seems to be the percentage play|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT may make on a spade lead unless West rises with the Ace and plays a heart|pg||
nt|snorris: will win on a @s lead|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: not sure why the @C shift..tap might have been better (not that it matters) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Over now.. give us another deal with some action here|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I saved the interesting hands for later|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Rob|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to our Tarzan Club expert, Rob Helle|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thx Roland ... just walked in, sorry for being late|pg||
nt|nubmaster: lol|pg||
nt|mowen: Zia gave up easily|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Rob|pg||
nt|mowen: slam would be cold with QJ to 7 and a useful king|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Muller thinking   is one of my macros|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Grøtheim thinking   is another|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Come on Muller|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer can almost claim|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now you know why Muller is tied 1st on my Top 10 list of slow players|pg||
nt|nubmaster: small @d to earn a imp!|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Holding AC and not leading singleton on opening lead is almost worth risking contract for anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1-2:  P.O. Sundelin and Muller    3-4:  Grøtheim and Shenkin|pg||
nt|nubmaster: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, I'm not familiar enough with the partnership style to assign blame  :)  but certainly someone overbid |pg||
nt|werge: Worse is, that minus 2 will take several minutes to reach|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 1 down now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: straightforward bidding by Sjoert|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will probably cash trumps now...he has 10 tricks already|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hantveit: We are all waiting for the next hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: telling|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5C appears hopeless though|pg||
nt|niekbrink: jack of hearts!|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR, big club, 2@S by W, passed around to S, who bid...3NT -- all pass.|pg||
nt|snorris: no 6 @h ,,lacks connection for a @d-@s squeeze|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and now east will sign off in 4@s|pg||
nt|rhelle:  West may look at his hand again, of course - he is very good|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  I'm sure Mr Nystrom knows all that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: In OR they are playing deal nr 20 now...|pg||
nt|niekbrink: i can't see a way of making this|pg||
nt|xenya: no excitement|pg||
nt|justin c: unless i missed something, this is a good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  finesse only works if qxxx is with E....if Qxx, doesn't matter who has that holding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As a spectator rightly points out, the Danish declarer in the other room had a certain route to 7 tricks, but had a blind spot|pg||
nt|patricck: finessing the J works against Qxx and Qxxx with East, while AK and small only works against Qxx in either hand, I think that gives the finesse an 8% edge|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks now, 2@hs, 3@ss 2@cs, 2@ds|pg||
nt|yuval10: and try @d to.... |pg||
pc|h4|nt|werge: A clever spec: Only @S-lead beats & NT by North|pg||
nt|werge: Double-dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 4), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|rhelle:  best slam is in @ds ... but still only a 50-50 guess if South ducks @d smoothly twice|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  at least 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|justin c: were it not for the 4-0 @H break, declarer could pull trumps, pitch a spade on a club, then ruff the long diamond in dummy if necessary|pg||
nt|snorris: no way|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mowen: we might be here for the day at this rate of play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because there is none|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @S passed out in OR|pg||
nt|patricck: might take 9 tricks with a safety play in trumps, but if you are in 4@H you can't take that line|pg||
nt|patricck: and still too difficult to dispose of diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx William|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Lead @SK from hand and you can't be prevented from taking 7 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: X of 2@S probably showed weak spades (in context)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: not even a defensive error|pg||
nt|niekbrink: will help|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of whether enough credence given to the red-on-white bid by W.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's roughly a 90% slam (hearts no worse than 3-1). Very unlucky|pg||
nt|justin c: a diamond discard from west would help|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chmitty: Helness tried to double 4@h next room board 16 ... not a success|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nubmaster: safeplay|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No idea why we are still playing|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|jbgood: did he throw a @d, Max?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nubmaster: depends on style... with a passed partner that not attack you it's ok...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  I think it was 4th suit forcing (2@h) and might have been alerted|pg||

nt|xenya: another pretty simple hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 23 points to EW vs 17 to NS Ns has both Majors ket us witness bidding|pg||
nt|athene: E-W shouldn't allow N-S to play 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: but big club fits have a habit of falling by the wayside these days|pg||
nt|athene: rehi|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Four in a row|pg||
mb|3C|nt|nubmaster: 1 level is ok here.. |pg||
nt|patricck: how to stay out of game with 25 points, or how to steal a 9th trick in hearts if you do bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: fantastic result for EW in the closed room!|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting 4N in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: Eu will need time to enter the results by hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi did they make 5 or 3 on last ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will find out in time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am getting loads of private messages and can't respond to them all. BBO does *not* decide which matches we get, so approach the EBL if you are unhappy about no match from the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open in this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Should we repeat the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tiny.cc/eegFD  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt think Versace would go quietly |pg||
nt|patricck: radulescu licking his lips|pg||
nt|sybarra: (of course S just loved that call) |pg||
nt|sybarra: E likely to bid again|pg||
nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a question |pg||
nt|patricck: oops, only 3 spades, need 2 hearts :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: If 4S, killing lead from E to be a Diamond and W shifting to H and getting a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing majors allowed east to get that critical 3@C bid in|pg||
nt|athene: which made all the difference|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'd say this is a pass, especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|niekbrink: in the opgen room declarer could set up his 4th diamond as the 10th trick|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: aI open a lot of 11 HCP-hands - but this time closer to pass - bad suit - no Aces and problems to show the good @Cs|pg||
nt|werge: Sure East will bid NOW|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, much to West's disappointment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm, my bet is not looking too flash|pg||
nt|chmitty: interesting situation now for North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@c seems strange, but the way Tarzan works is to simply ask up the entire hand|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@d = 44 minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-15 NT still|pg||
nt|hedyg: W surely looking for  slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: but the distribution is not favourable :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Will need accurate defence to beat 3NT though|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S is a touch better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is very lazy|pg||
nt|xenya: i suspect i would pass as S|pg||
nt|lml: I play weak notrump but no that weak vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may get the @D lead now |pg||
nt|werge: Must be FORCING|pg||
nt|athene: west will surely lead a big club|pg||
nt|athene: east can't be happy about passing this out|pg||
nt|athene: but if he is going to double now, why not earlier? - and 5@C is just a wild stab in the dark, if 1@C might be only two cards in a balanced hand, for instance|pg||
nt|raghavan: where is entry to S ?|pg||
nt|athene: you are right - even on @CA lead, the defence have time to get west's heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: as declarer can't get to hand fast to draw trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and this deserves to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as it will now|pg||
nt|yuval10: Barel has a problem now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: and 3!nt is better than 5@d|pg||
nt|hantveit: Very nice hand for south. 6H is a good contract|pg||
nt|justin c: sos xx|pg||
nt|rhelle:  mmm ... maybe they changed the relays ... this would show a 2-3-5-3 in my system|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe this is 3 2 4 4|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm sure it is|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 4@H is going to be a struggle with this trump break|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and of course this will make West less keen|pg||
nt|justin c: (assuming that is where they are headed)|pg||
nt|mowen: strange choice by north|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Faster but not that much faster|pg||
nt|snorris: s invitng to slam..|pg||
nt|lml: DeWijs wasn't going to be talked out of diamonds|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm not sure if I agree with that ... he has stoppers in all suits|pg||
nt|lml: SOmeone said colors are for children but sometimes red and white becomes black and blue|pg||
nt|rhelle:  maybe taking 100's in NT is preferable to 20's in @ds|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and against 1NT he is on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Marty Bergen believes, "Virtually any hand that is worth opening will contain at least two quick tricks."|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West passed in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who can lead for aqx of club? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The fact that Jens opened 1@C may persuade North never to lead them|pg||
nt|patricck: nice intermediates in the West hands, but too many honours in short suits....I like the pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has two chances though|pg||
nt|bobholl: is N worth 4@C with bad @S and @H ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c will not make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Rather effective from N/S there - shutting out the easy 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: escaped :)|pg||
nt|justin c: wisely |pg||
nt|bobholl: @S switch or lead :) but can you do that ??|pg||
nt|nubmaster: jesus, 5 trick in @s and -1 in 3NT|pg||
nt|niekbrink: seems he's not really afraid of spades|pg||
mb|4D|nt|justin c: I think they play that 2@C is either natural and GF or a 9-13 @S raise|pg||
nt|nubmaster: He has showed 9-13 3c support and 5c @c|pg||
nt|justin c: presumably 2@D asked and 2@S showed the good raise|pg||
nt|raghavan: I doubt > William N has no entry to S so may not make 4 S|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Yes, Tarzan is the name of this particular type of Symmetric Relay Precision|pg||
nt|mowen: will wast take the @HK?|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|snorris: probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: did they forget to check aces in CR?|pg||
nt|hantveit: No need, I checked the spectators - no Danish :)|pg||
nt|haans: the use 1@C-1@S as a relay bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: S has to start wildly signaling clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jens will surely return a heart at trick 2, then hope|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He won't get the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: S never in |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but they will have the chance to switch when in with the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another option, and a losing one, is to enter dummy with a diamond and finesse @S10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is a legitimate chance|pg||
nt|patricck: that is what happened in the other room|pg||
nt|chmitty: but EW could make 4@h probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s in OR|pg||
mb|4H|nt|werge: I see the first 8 tricks for West -let´s see|pg||
nt|patricck: the cards are friendly for EW|pg||
nt|werge: Lucky, that South has the 8...|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i was playing it upside down :) but all the same considerations apply|pg||
nt|hantveit: Difficult bid, but with 3 hearts and AKA you are probably to strong for 4 hearts.|pg||
nt|niekbrink: zack will bid 3nt with his 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: now they will reach 6 @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=796&qphase=32&qroundno=1|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6H is actually not as good as it seems at once. You need hearts 3-2 or 4 on east, and spade 3-3 with split-H or go for the diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no double|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if angelini's pass over 1@S was forcing?|pg||
nt|athene: he probably didn't mind that much|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s for them is SMOLEN i believe, showing 5@h and 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: looks llike diamond lead|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: q of @D lead looks a lot more interesting from W  |pg||
nt|andyv:  can always hope @c blocks|pg||
nt|roswolf: the psychological attempt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jens opting for the deceptive line|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he showed @hs and HCPs|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East may be starting to think partner has spade shortage |pg||
nt|bobholl: now the 4 small @S on the table not too difficult|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh sry:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Bidding a bad suit on a good hand is usually not recommended|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has will have only 8 top tricks, but he'll have time to set up a 9th -- and here it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: so looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or to W I should say |pg||
nt|jeanhari: sorry, 10|pg||
nt|athene: it can be awkward to play forcing passes just because you have passed a t/o X|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in this case, 4@d would be a transfter to 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d transfer?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and immediate 4@h a mild slam try|pg||
nt|hedyg: signoff in @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would have taken 20 secs more to go through 2@C. Why the rush?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: good lead|pg||
nt|werge: Why keep the @D-entry in North - South is short of entries|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, the price tag is in 100s|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd made a balancing double as passed hand. no need to hang him|pg||
nt|athene: you might have a massive trump stack in the first suit but nothing else|pg||
nt|justin c: If so, that suggests that with the same hand minus the @SAK he would have bid 1NT instead of passing?|pg||
nt|athene: the hand might not belong to your side at all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  singoff in any suit, really ... East doesn't know what West wants to do at that stage|pg||
nt|justin c: was north endplayed at trick one?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sort of|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: 6H NS is the contract. |pg||
nt|bobholl: won't he double finesse in @S ?|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like @D ruff then uppercut|pg||
nt|chmitty: not so easy may be Bill, crossruff at 4@h seems easy but North is also short in @d and can overuff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|raghavan: H shift|pg||
nt|hantveit: Well, you need the spade 3-3 also. 75%X35%|pg||
nt|hantveit: 37,5%|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Oliver Clarke|pg||
nt|oliverc: Good Morning everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: GM too :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: in diamonds you can survive with 3-3, 4-2 + stiff K by West|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 3 spades as a splinter on 2 D would really work here. But 3nt will be the final contract anyway|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: Might bring him 8 tricks, if he plays @c immediately|pg||
nt|jcwla: West might also have handled this hand differently.  An action double instead of 3@S would be my preference having bid 2@S on the previous round.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR south bid 1NT showing @hs and a m and thet were in 3@h but east bought the contract there with 3@s.. another push here?|pg||
nt|hantveit: sorry, 4-3, 5,2 that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: entry for @D gone now :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: There is not enought time to calculate all the possibilities, but there is a chance that he can ruff the spades. Start with a spade to J|pg||
nt|hantveit: Spade 3-3 is 35,53%|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would double finesse :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would think he might|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is a nice start for declarer|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If West did have a singleton spade and the hands fit perfectly it will be harder after the 2S bid|pg||
nt|mowen: Muller correct to return the original 5th best|pg||
nt|justin c: y, simplifies things for W|pg||
nt|mowen: giving partner no reason to duck|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Daniel Gulyas|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: now N shall play @dK or continue with @s|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, that was a bit sleepy|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has to cash HQ and give a ruff lat us see|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C would be an interesting contract|pg||
nt|athene: for example @DJ lead you could duck|pg||
nt|athene: then draw trumps, @DA, three hearts throwing spade, ruff heart, endplay north with the @SA|pg||
nt|andyv:  re|pg||
nt|hantveit: That is 75%, but then you need the spade 3-3 in addition, so then you might as well ruff the third spade.|pg||
nt|chmitty: board 4 Multon on his way to win 3NT ... first swing then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You were right with your 2NT prediction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I think you are right about 4@H being not so easy, though I suspect it will eventually make|pg||
nt|chmitty: I let you know my bank account number|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4@h will make yes|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will south let 4@h play in open room ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 3@C will not :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: started 1@d 1@h 1@s 4@h indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S lead also necessary against 5@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes I don't think I would lead a spade on this auction|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Fortunately I'm not the one on lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|april7: now or never, ace of @H|pg||
nt|werge: VERY sleepy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: after all it's difficult to switch to a club into declarer's suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am glad i don't have to too :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Another 13 imp to the Ned's|pg||
nt|xenya: but i forgot about @Cs -- he has to get them right of course|pg||
nt|niekbrink: that will be his 9th trick|pg||
nt|xenya: so it's not as simple as that after all|pg||
nt|niekbrink: he might duck a diamond now, but i think he is just cashing his clubs|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Dutch ladies are on the bozrd|pg||
nt|yuval10: i bet it was even harder in the OR where S doubled @c for takeout|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Daniel.|pg||
nt|gulyas: an exciting match for sure|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Jordan|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hantveit: spade 9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Understandable but unlucky|pg||
pc|s8|nt|werge: Will normally cost the first IMP in this match|pg||
nt|ady: can relax while this is played|pg||
nt|chmitty: south thinking :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: and now run for home|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking looks more like a mp play than an imp one|pg||
nt|yuval10: but the Dutch declarer did very well to guess right|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|athene: but he could cover the first heart and block them|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|snorris: east will know to pull his second ace when in with the ather|pg||
nt|snorris: other|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the 4-1 trump break, 4@S is not easy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|justin c: not so much of a struggle after all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and now simply giving up 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|justin c: i was thinking declarer needed to force NS to open up the @S suit, then guess it, but i didnt notice north's problems on lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like a conventional 4-4-4-1 showing bid.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hantveit: spade 4 is actually better because East might have stiff H.|pg||
nt|chmitty: two off here ?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nubmaster: Q of @c now|pg||
nt|ady: might still make only 9 as cant aford to play a spade  till taking 9 tricks   depends on the discards from east|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S must get rid of his K@h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|patricck: it felt as though the K@H might have been a good card at trick 2, but that needs the 9@H to come down, which doesn't happen either|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3 for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is a 28 bd knockout match played in 2 segments|pg||
nt|athene: north might have considered leading a big spade to unblock|pg||
nt|athene: then he could reach his partner with the fourth round of the suit|pg||
nt|athene: it might not matter, but he must be slightly worried about being used as a stepping-stone|pg||
nt|athene: and having to give declarer some heart tricks|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a 4-4 fit in defence against 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: you often need to use it for transportation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: scores entered manually now. Thanks to Eugenio|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Eu, wd!|pg||
nt|hedyg: tough job to be operator and these juniors are doing great!|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if you an operator, people only notice you when you make a mistake|pg||
nt|hedyg: true :(|pg||
nt|athene: the better you are, the more invisible you are :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: Driver thinking how to avoid an endplay in @H|pg||
nt|athene: now the defence only get one club|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could have 2@hs..|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can just hold up the @CQ once|pg||
nt|athene: @CA sorry|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hantveit: agree, but I a was trying to be nice for a change|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of frozen out of both hands  |pg||
nt|chmitty: 6@c doubled by South open room ... hummmm|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jeanhari: will he play for spade ace in west (no overcall) or take his tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cA|nt|raghavan: West has played in 4NT in OR. that means Texan gains again though going down here|pg||
nt|chmitty: South bid 6@c ... Multon checked the back of his cards and doubled|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I think the double of 6@C is the correct bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: agree :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I mean it could make, but probably would go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he'll surely do it in some point|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hantveit: heart ace and a new heart and still a flat board|pg||
nt|yuval10: to prevent an extra trick|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: It looks like GIB defeats it 1700|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|werge: Seemed to work also, East assisted with the @C-finesse|pg||
nt|jeanhari: east...|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, very interesting contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: claiming|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Claim|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @S ruffed 1 on a of @H C|pg||
nt|bobholl: first sizeable swing to poland|pg||
nt|bobholl: director at the table may be the 4th colour is the problem :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Assuming perfect play 3NT is a better contract, but the defence against 5C may be harder to find|pg||
nt|jcwla: Has managed to block @C's?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some swear by 4-4-4-1 showing bids, others say dig a hole in your backyard, put that bid in the hole, then close it back up.|pg||
nt|jbgood: doesnt matter really, club to nine and small heart - and cannot afford S to have the king - so...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Often against such auction you close your eyes and lead a trump but obviously not from S hand here.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s9|nt|roswolf: north should have reflected a little more at trick 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N needed a lead out of turn|pg||
pc|c9|nt|patricck: North should ask himself why declarer is playing back hearts to let him set up his suit....the only answer possible is that his tricks are set to cash and they must be in @S and ...|pg||
nt|patricck: @D, therefore a @C switch must be the answer|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done west|pg||
nt|oliverc: Double dummy: Q@C, @D finesse, A@D, @D finesse, @C to King, A@C, @D finesse, draw|pg||
nt|oliverc: trumps and exit with the J@S|pg||
nt|chmitty: GIB is so strong player|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @H|pg||
mc|10|nt|hantveit: Wd, a slam home and a nice start|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room went down |pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm sure North will be disappointed, wityh such a fine trump holding|pg||

mb|2N|nt|april7: here we have a nice @H slam|pg||
nt|haans: it is you say 'i make game'|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not ideal with @SAxx|pg||
nt|athene: partner might have @SJxx or @SQx and you want him to play 3nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least you can hold up 3 times:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: tarzan nicely stopped in 4@H|pg||
nt|jcwla: "fun" suit splits here|pg||
nt|lml: nice colors for it|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: 2@H is weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps his only chance |pg||
nt|athene: double not ideal either with only 75% of the hearts you would lik|pg||
nt|athene: like|pg||
nt|justin c: @h ruffs beating 4@S here|pg||
nt|rhelle:  EW open deviate from the system ... as here|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he has only 15 points, but considers it too strong for a 12-15 NT|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he opens a strong @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: all primes|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H showing a 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult to get to show the huge side suit now? and miss 3 NT?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nubmaster: 2@s by north at the other table... |pg||
nt|nubmaster: dont like 1nt with 5-2 in M, atleast not in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point andy|pg||
nt|patricck: always easier to find a logical reason when you can already see the answer, but since the KQ@S and KQ@D are both in dummy the logic seems sound|pg||
nt|athene: interesting...east treats that hand as a "good" 2@S bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand not ideal but 3N probably will end up there.|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ducking 2 times, N will make 3 NT |pg||
nt|rhelle:  absolutely|pg||
nt|lml: but Muller does know that he has a lot of high card points |pg||
nt|gulyas: 3NT is not bad, because it makes:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Who do you trust?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: will want to stay as low as possible here i'd think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Normally a little less than a standard weak two opening|pg||
nt|hantveit: 12+13 points NS but not possible to find a good contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and now has to rebid 1NT to show 16-18|pg||
nt|rhelle:  or double for take-out|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=0-8|pg||
nt|rhelle:  also showing 16-18|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think I prefer 1S to pass|pg||
nt|snorris: e-w have a @c contract|pg||
nt|lml: no matter how much the opponents bid|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s ... now there is a he-man bid :)|pg||
nt|justin c: not shy|pg||
nt|lml: 2@S would have been my choice.  I think that does the job|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nubmaster: are they playing strong @c? So 1@d is nat or 11-13 NT ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: They will be in 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The advantage of playing weak jump shifts is that a 2@H rebid becomes invitational and a jump to 3@H game-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: the "good raise" bid is actually useful for NS|pg||
nt|athene: it suggests that east, not west, has the entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: no XX by N to show Kx @s?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @D not alerted ? so a trick ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Mike Amos|pg||
nt|mowen: quick route to 12 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: perhpas 3@S is weaker than 2@S for them?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@c must be splinter , agreeing @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: careful play needed, ruffing @S twice in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  2@H     1@H  3@H|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is more appealing|pg||
nt|athene: angelini has a very nice hand - all he cares about are @HAKQ @DA @CA|pg||
nt|athene: that's what RKCB is there for - but it does take you quite high|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H in OR could contain 5+@ss, 1@s was forcing relay|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry for late arrival|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi:)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: with the diamonds 3-3 and the hearts 3-2 11 tricks should be easy played in east|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: South has 8 losers, I would bid 2H - pd passed first, now way there is a game on.|pg||
nt|werge: On a good day, South might get 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hantveit: no way|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is ok|pg||
nt|athene: now north is worried about trying 4@H because it sounds as though 3@S was just making a slam try in hearts :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nubmaster: No action here.. 1NT at the other table with west as declarer.|pg||
nt|werge: One upon a time, this war for penalty|pg||
nt|werge: OH - back again|pg||
nt|werge: Oce upon...|pg||
nt|werge: Once|pg||
nt|patricck: Versace buys a better dummy than he might have feared, the Q@H is a welcome sight as the @HKJ7 looked a bit sick under Easts majors|pg||
nt|chmitty: amusing defence against 3NT here : lead small @s by north and south leading small @d at trick 2|pg||
nt|chmitty: but he will lead a @d probably|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm confident this will make|pg||
nt|snorris: up to 10 tricks maybe|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it, yes|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@s seems timid ... maybe Muller has seen these bids before|pg||
nt|lml: maybe but it is too much for a preempt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tomorrow we will be showing the Open final + either the Women's or Seniors' (depending on score)|pg||
nt|daman: square hands so far   no swings|pg||
nt|jcwla: the old sneak attack|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: odd bidding again|pg||
nt|hantveit: good start for dec.|pg||
nt|werge: I would like to play this contract - if I might now and then play from the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another advantage is that it takes room away from the opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: this just has the obvious 5 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree R,  weak jumps (everywhere) makes like easier |pg||
nt|patricck: 4 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: well it is also a good makeable contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm, that's a disaster start - a SMALL diamond would work much better|pg||
nt|chmitty: absolutely|pg||
nt|justin c: me too :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he does have 7 top tricks|pg||
nt|snorris: also in @hs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: no safely in game |pg||
nt|haans: some chance to make +2|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt will be reached often :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: nicely avoided playing in @s|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ok, make 12 now and a push... new deal please, we want action|pg||
nt|yuval10: and E will quickly sign-off with 4@h|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think it generally is a bad idea to lead single when you have 4 trumps. Better to attack dia.|pg||
nt|werge: South has only ONE problem - she has no tricks...|pg||
nt|hantveit: lol, a well known problem to us all|pg||
nt|werge: Could have been worse!|pg||
nt|ady: could make 12 tricks  if getting hearts right   but a terrible slam|pg||
nt|haans: sorry @CK wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok he wont lose 3 spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  into the abyss|pg||
nt|athene: this all stems from the double of 1@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|athene: does it PROMISE four hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-advised to bid 2@D over 1@S, i think|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner thinks that a negative double promises 4 hearts here exactly 100% of the time|pg||
nt|mamos: EW seem to have arrived not at all for this hand :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This hand is an 'apportion the blame' problem|pg||
nt|lml: after that lead DeWijs can go to sleep... yawn draw trump|pg||
nt|jcwla: great score for the Dutch in the OR|pg||
nt|james_h: Brinksmanship|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi James.|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi All|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: finess in @c and crossruff  with so solid @h|pg||
nt|rnc: I think 1@C is 17+ and 1@H a fairly balanced hand (no 5c M/6+m/55 m). East gave room for West to show his handtype|pg||
nt|april7: hi shirley, neither do I|pg||
nt|patricck: that will be the difficulty :)|pg||
nt|werge: The only entry is best used for @c to the 10, I think|pg||
nt|athene: Fantoni-Nunes beat the 3NT on board 3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chmitty: would give North a chance to unerlead @s ace later on to put declarer on teste|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I vote 70% East, 30% West|pg||
nt|bobholl: you can't blame west so it should be 90 10 or so :)|pg||
nt|mamos: West might have a fairly clear view of what is happening in passout seat|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5/5 in the two unbid suits nonvulnerable and having passed already you should balance|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: hi all,  just dropping by, |pg||
nt|rnc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: I did not understand the pass over 1 @S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe we used up all the action boards in the last match.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now there is no entry|pg||
nt|bobholl: and score game :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably will get hearts right|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N bid 2@s over 1@s overcall... that seems a bit more descriptive|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, very difficult to stop. Probably 2 down. In a bad day West dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in all Open matches|pg||
nt|rhelle:  looks like he'll make 11 now - losing 1@c and 1 trump|pg||
nt|xenya: this might take some care, but it looks like declarer's best chance is to set up @Ds -- this plan will work here|pg||
nt|jcwla: nice|pg||
pc|s9|nt|raghavan: Goes 1 down with a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S over 1@S is possible too|pg||
nt|raghavan: N played in 5Clubs and made in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  always play for the revoke|pg||
nt|chmitty: end of the story|pg||
nt|bjacobs: to give declarer a spade guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s was on|pg||
nt|james_h: looks like he has to play spades from hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: hello Shirley|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: oh, I see|pg||
nt|april7: E bid 1@S not N|pg||
nt|sybarra: or if N bid 1 sp,  1 @H was gf, and pass was forcing is what on spec suggested |pg||
nt|april7: if W plays on @C with the finesse then its easier to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now they will bid 6@h|pg||
nt|hantveit: On|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gulyas: now a @C to E, and a @H back to make him guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|desert: ;)|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone in favor of overcalling 1@s with S hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h are blocked ... if South plays a @c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess North was swayed by the @D8, but even so, experience says it's losing strategy to lead an honour there|pg||
nt|justin c: claiming 12 would be a fairly quick route|pg||
nt|justin c: nowhere for the @C loser to go|pg||
nt|lml: bridge is so easy|pg||
nt|daman: another flat hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: duplication in diamonds   on a bad day could go down in 4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hantveit: should unblock club 6 there, in case it is an endplay later.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The main concern is it might score game for N/S if partner passes your double |pg||
nt|mamos: what was 2@D ?   no alert?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|niekbrink: miroglio leads 46-0 to the bulgarian seniors|pg||
nt|jcwla: hmm|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he is home with the @Ds coming in|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Who do you believe, me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
pc|h9|nt|werge: @C-ruff and a trump - still I only see 7 tricks, but you might do better|pg||
nt|patricck: double dummy that is certainly true|pg||
nt|niekbrink: intresting defence by Brink|pg||
nt|justin c: Well, he managed to sneak a @S past north|pg||
nt|snorris: very|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hantveit: South played on the only chance, QJX by East|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunately no play record|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass by N seemed tame|pg||
nt|mamos: spec tells me 2@D is two way Diamonds or weak @h  makes sense|pg||
pc|h7|nt|april7: its better to take @C finesse first, because even if it works, has to make @C finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|april7: if @S finesse works W has to take @C finesse anyway|pg||
nt|rnc: Remains to play it cautiously|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead for the defence is @h9|pg||
nt|athene: i am told it was declarer who beat it :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: that was when the table had crashed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hantveit: when you know the spade honors are behind the king - play low from the king.|pg||
nt|hantveit: I cannot see how now. Maybe ruff a dia and play low spade from K, but too late now. Vest will play spade J and Game over|pg||
nt|werge: When I was a child, we just ruffed and plaued the @H 10 - but that´s long time ago|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - born during second world war...|pg||
nt|hantveit: So, you are still semi-young|pg||
nt|werge: West, please - it´s my lunch-time we are playing with now|pg||
nt|snorris: 10 tricks now..|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR, Muller opened the E hand 2NT to show both minors (weak) and Wijs jumped to 4@H.|pg||
nt|snorris: finesse @cs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|april7: then @C finesse @C@Cruff ace of @D @C ruff and pull trumps and so on|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|james_h: lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess the operator lost the play somewhere|pg||
mc|9|nt|gulyas: it probably went @C to the A, and @H back, guessed right|pg||

nt|jcwla: Both pairs well done in the bidding to stay at the one level.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores are back|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have a monster heart raise with everything except a diamond control"|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c is hard to read but holding xx in diamonds, i'd have to agree with pass|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: GIB could do better +)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead very difficult to make|pg||
nt|jcwla: With both declarers making their contracts, it will be 7 to the Dutch.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3NT for NS ... another flatty|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a nice grand slam for N and W...unfortunately they don't play together....|pg||
nt|reisig: Make 600 and lose 9 IMPs  !!  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 1 @H Doubled...|pg||
nt|justin c: all pass?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt - 1@D - 2@C - 2Nt - 3 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|patricck: very lively scoring, every board trades at least 5 imps|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @D here - if you can guess the @C-suit, which the bidding might make easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  just seemed like N/S were reading different books|pg||
nt|raghavan: 5 Diamond contract as I see all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: not a weak 2 ??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 9 points to the Dutch, up by 26 |pg||
mb|1C|nt|hantveit: 12+13 EV, but no fit in majors. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@C ok, 3NT in danger?|pg||
nt|hedyg: can duck 1@c and make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: to check the entry fees|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so the dutch back in the lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nubmaster: not clear yet, Nick at east still's thinking|pg||
nt|nubmaster: or 3NT directly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no 11 trick in clubs, sorry|pg||
nt|haans: overcall make them find 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 10 tricks in clubs   I wonder if they will try 3NT    which is likely to fail|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S X with his spades?|pg||
nt|patricck: North more likely to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: 14+10 NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: kind of  NV 3nt now but too heigh|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4@s bid and just made at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: they might make a move towards slam but stop before they get into too much trouble|pg||
nt|yuval10: Herbst in the OR overcalled 2@c natural over 1@c by W|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: most X saying no spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes hence my question |pg||
nt|sybarra: and can N a spade agst 3 nt? (next question) |pg||
nt|ady: playing reverse system   double says no help?|pg||
nt|athene: even seeing all hands you lose @DA and two spades?|pg||
nt|justin c: either EW player might disturb this|pg||
nt|niekbrink: som specs complain about me favouring the dutch. As my brother is the south player, i hope the can forgive me that|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: he passed, same contract at both tables|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 12 points and a good 5 card suit?|pg||
nt|haans: what better lead does he have?|pg||
nt|patricck: you would persuade me to overcall 1@S at a different vulnerability, but that looks a bit too rich for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical punt|pg||
nt|justin c: nice @S position for declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, there's a very simple route to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: and @c also|pg||
nt|chmitty: so 9 tricks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  There is some risk vulnerable but most would open a weak two I think|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1NT = 16-18|pg||
nt|justin c: they need West to be declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes|pg||
nt|rhelle:  simple transfer now|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S cold by west but not by east on a @H lead|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like he will be now|pg||
nt|daman: they had a better chance to reach ther doomed slam if the opps passed|pg||
nt|daman: now they will proceed cautiously|pg||
nt|yuval10: and it's the same here so far|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: A Roland slam here.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not in teams, they have to investigate the @s's|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 12-14 - and open for bidding by pd if he is very strong|pg||
nt|jcwla: W hand not quite right for interference, likely get to 2@C by E then maybe a t/o X by S?|pg||
nt|snorris: dobl: one suited?|pg||
nt|justin c: does anybody know what this x shows?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer probably never touche clubs there|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: a @H lead sees declarer home, the defence does better to play spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what does E lead?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Played by E in OR...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the match between Lengy and Texan Aces, South found the lead of @H10 against 4@S!|pg||
nt|snorris: 5+ minor I am told|pg||
nt|justin c: i am told it shows a 4 card major with a longer minor|pg||
nt|rhelle:  not so easy to figure out they have a @d stop now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: win the spade lead and play a spade back|pg||
nt|jbgood: really 3 @h?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hantveit: and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|sybarra: true,  not much |pg||
nt|sybarra: thats impresive!|pg||
nt|patricck: I lead a @H and watch them chalk up 9 tricks, thats why stegariou is playing and not me :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *impressive |pg||
nt|werge: His longest (side)suit|pg||
nt|patricck: Stregaroiu sorry....must watch that spelling :(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade close to being s success for the defence, but no cigar, only four traicks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tricks even|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Christiansen is an obedient citizen. He leads partner's suit|pg||
nt|athene: borderline rebid decision for north|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade goes in H - if S is not led|pg||
nt|nubmaster: No @h lead though|pg||
nt|snorris: or 4 major|pg||
nt|niekbrink: this might end in 2 diamonds doubled|pg||
nt|snorris: sorry AND 4 major|pg||
nt|justin c: hopefully not too cautiously |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: even without a spade lead   could still go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  easier to win the post mortems that way|pg||
nt|athene: raise the major with 3 and a ruffing value, or repeat your trick source|pg||
nt|andyv:  i like 3 card raises but not whenI have a 6 card suit to rebid.|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer 2@D with that north hand, yes|pg||
nt|athene: if partner has 5 hearts, then 2@D will still be OK|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth stop now|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, but will south invite with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I know some who would have led @DQ|pg||
nt|snorris: so 5+ minor AND 4 in Major|pg||
nt|justin c: xx obviously some sort of takeout bid|pg||
nt|lml: think they might end up in 5@c|pg||
nt|justin c: somebody has to decide they have a @D stopper|pg||
nt|rhelle:  or 4@s|pg||
nt|niekbrink: best way to make your trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: are they playing pass system?|pg||
nt|hantveit: That makes more sence|pg||
nt|jeanhari: if declarer reads spade well he can make this|pg||
nt|haans: how does South  enter to lead @S|pg||
nt|ady: White house missed the close 4 spade game on board 13|pg||
nt|andyv:  if pd can move over 2@d, then I have a terrific hand for him.|pg||
nt|athene: but if partner has only four hearts, 2@D will almost always be much better|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes 2 D is correct but N has ruffing value - his small trumps can win tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: declarer may however ruff two @d in hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess 1NT is systemic|pg||
nt|athene: East doesn't need much more to put a 1@S overcall in|pg||
nt|mamos: Looks about a normal weak two as you'd find but I'm afraid I dont know EW system|pg||
nt|bobholl: W will feel happy winning the bidding but will lose 1 imp :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|desert: This board doesnt look very exciting, too....|pg||
nt|werge: What is the E/W system . Jump to 3 NT...?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting contract, there are ways to reach 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess is that they play some kind of pass system Hans.|pg||
nt|werge: EaST HAS APPARENTLY OPNENED 1 @c !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ady: yes   duck first won and take 2nd|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wouldn't :)|pg||
nt|mamos: this is ok|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would bid 3NT with the N hand   so would Zia|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hantveit: Some players might open 1nt 15-17 on Norths hand. 109 in hearts J10 in dia and EQ10 in clubs.|pg||
nt|oliverc: South's intermediates not good enough when partner limited to a 14-count maximum|pg||
nt|oliverc: Vulnerable it might be a different matter|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable i migth because off higher gain possibility|pg||
nt|hantveit: Yes, and he knows north will open 1nt with a strong 14 point hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: trying to achieve 8 tricks with a bad trump split|pg||
nt|chmitty: thinking about that|pg||
nt|chmitty: but he will see @s finesse is the best route anyhow|pg||
nt|rhelle:  lol|pg||
nt|mowen: far too obvious|pg||
pc|d7|nt|justin c: this looks like it is going to be very close|pg||
nt|werge: Bad defence, better @D Ace and a @C through|pg||
nt|werge: Now East can enjoy two @C-tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, but first you need to know if you have game values|pg||
nt|bobholl: is the best play :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he would just like the @S10|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d usually shows 5+@ds except if 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like a @H lead will beat 3NT, but a @S lets it through|pg||
nt|hedyg: or @c?|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy, A@c and @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead doesnt beat|pg||
nt|justin c: dont EW get 2@H2@C1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes :( sry|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Not best defence here, now he can ruff a @d|pg||
nt|snorris: east not liking it..|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@DX looking like an accurate prediction Niek :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 2d thats not too bad for NS, as long as sjoert passes now...|pg||
nt|lml: good job finding the best spot|pg||
nt|justin c: move that @DJ to the east hand, and zia & your mum might change their minds |pg||
nt|daman: they would still be there    we only speculate because we can see all 4 hands   at the table we would all bid 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: YES |pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: nice lead though, only 11 trick now|pg||
nt|andyv:  with A@d, tempting to lead spades anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: was just looking at the @H spots|pg||
nt|niekbrink: ai.......|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe the cue-bid-mediated 3NT shows some sort of doubt|pg||
nt|justin c: so South could remove with a singleton, say|pg||
nt|lml: I was speculating about their auction too|pg||
nt|rhelle:  now 12 tricks are possible, if he plays the 9|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|werge: In OR, West never got his  @C-Ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 rounds of @D's  and ugh |pg||
nt|andyv:  since E only has one heart|pg||
nt|chmitty: no :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: this looks like 2way checkback, 2@c forcing 2@d, then 2@h nf|pg||
nt|andyv:  lack of redbl by W over 2@S could have persuaded a @h lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the @C finesse off, the contract is doomed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Yuval|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the table of the former champs of this event - NS in 2003, EW in 2005|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Yuval.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Yuval, hi|pg||
nt|odysseus69: confusion about opener |pg||
nt|gulyas: the same 4@H went down in the other room, lets see if it happens here too|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the overtake, the @D suit is frozen for the defense|pg||
nt|gulyas: but it doesn't matter, cos they can just cash their @S tricks and wait for the @CQ to make the setting trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: if he did overtake, he cannot return any minor card, but is fine with any major card|pg||
nt|jcwla: The pace has been a bit...what's the word...|pg||
nt|henryb: turtlish?|pg||
nt|jbgood: on and off?|pg||
nt|jcwla: ill buy that Henry|pg||
nt|gulyas: thoughtful?:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: one|pg||
nt|athene: yes 2@H invitational on this sequence presumably|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jeanhari: Verhees thinking which spade to return?|pg||
nt|raghavan: S has correctly decided it is not so pass 2H|pg||
nt|justin c: fairly close to 4@H, but too much work to do for declarer|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ace of @s and another gives decl problem... he has to guess @c then|pg||
nt|niekbrink: he should have started wiht 2 clubs then....|pg||
nt|lml: of course Zia and your mom would make it anyway since they didn't LEAD A DIAMOND|pg||
nt|daman: matchpoint top|pg||
nt|yuval10: we'll probably see @d now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|april7: 3@C,3@D,6@H and 1 @S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @d lead at the other table so we keep the average, another imp to NS :)|pg||
nt|werge: This should end up with at least 9 tricks - |pg||
nt|haans: why take first spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can beat it,  with another low spade from N |pg||
nt|hedyg: it is not like he wanted any other suit led|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4S is a minimum- 3NT is extras but not so big - eg KXXXXX, Ax Kx AJx - 4C over 3S|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hantveit: hmm, now vest has no entry to the diamons if defence play hearts.|pg||
nt|patricck: the spades are so bad though, both @S and @H look unlikey to succeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe, but 3NT did not promise three stoppers. Could have been one and a solid club suit. Then perhaps @SKx and a spade gives the contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s lead and @c return ducked would work best here|pg||
nt|justin c: will just set up the 9th in @S now|pg||
nt|jcwla: oy|pg||
nt|gulyas: turtlish is nice|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hantveit: Spade Q and new spade would be nice|pg||
pc|s8|nt|niekbrink: this might be very very costly|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead seems sensible on a broken suit like that|pg||
nt|daman: nobody leads their suit when my Mom bids 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|lml: got to bid it confidently. |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, maybe you can get 12 here, but it's a bit double-dummyish|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: u are almost right - but East can just play up @D 2x - so not a standard "fork"|pg||
nt|werge: It would be nice to turn back to the flat boards - the big swing in board 5 was tuff|pg||
nt|hantveit: must take the dia finesse now, |pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, hard to play when all those imps are running out...|pg||
nt|werge: We would like mto se South duck another @S...|pg||
nt|werge: to see|pg||
nt|hantveit: diamond to Q and K, and a new spades that is ducked?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Truly no comprendo.  Well, same contract in both rooms.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: would be right to take 1st spade if jack was with north|pg||
nt|patricck: mustn't cash the J@H, switch back to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he should cash |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's so much easier with all cards in view|pg||
nt|niekbrink: by the same team...:(|pg||
nt|niekbrink: So, win the ace, play 3 rounds of spades, and a diamond|pg||
nt|justin c: unfortunately, neither side can make 2@H|pg||
nt|niekbrink: more unfortunately, on of the sides is doubled....|pg||
nt|snorris: max -2|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe -1..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: 1H4 smith?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: down now |pg||
nt|ady: its just a guess|pg||
nt|werge: Still West will be endplayed|pg||
pc|s9|nt|werge: New trouble will arrive for N/S|pg||
nt|haans: @H4 neg @D4 neg = spade|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk3: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after this round. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: So much for the simple approach|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @c ?|pg||
nt|xenya: so the defence will probably get 1@S, 3 @Hs, 1 @D and 2 @Cs for 2 off|pg||
pc|h9|nt|werge: It´s called end-play|pg||
nt|oliverc: Maybe there's a case for ducking at trick 1 to protect the K@S|pg||
nt|daman: now a @H to the J|pg||
nt|lml: well he has a while to think about |pg||
nt|lml: he can play everything else first if he wants|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry -- i miscounted|pg||
nt|daman: and back to a @C to get a count on East's hand|pg||
nt|niekbrink: drijver should play the 6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hantveit: now he looks for overtricks...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|werge: North should have taken the first trick|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jeanhari: wd by defense|pg||
nt|werge: Naturally he shoud´nt take the @H Jack - but makes anyway|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  true, but should have told pd @Ss weren't that great.|pg||
nt|justin c: a couple of spades and W has to discard|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, lovely squeeze|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: a small ! is not so bad from N|pg||
nt|Walddk3: After this round there will a long break before the Swiss begins. Restart at 17.30 Paris, 4:30 pm London, 8:30 am Los Angeles, 11:30 am New York|pg||
nt|hantveit: I forgot the bidding in hand 2. East did open pass with a pass hand, so pass system was out the window. :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: imp is an imp |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|rnc: And these two teams will qualify for Swiss A, if only nothing big happens.|pg||
nt|lml: wow no problem with the spades|pg||
nt|niekbrink: no way of avoiding 2 off now i think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|werge: But the @s-duck is not subject to a TEAM-match|pg||
nt|athene: now can cash @HAK and run diamonds through east|pg||
nt|chmitty: Multon playing 3 NT lead is @d 2 ... board 19|pg||
nt|snorris: like you said Niek..|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3 more @c's and 2 off indeed|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so 5 imps to Herbs|pg||
nt|niekbrink: herbt|pg||
nt|niekbrink: herbst|pg||
nt|henryb: in that vein we will now christen Chagas and Sontag as the rabbits of the expert world|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: sorry - kibs asked about 6@c - almost a "mortons Fork" play|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead, declarer might just go up with the @SA so as not to waste a tempo|pg||
nt|daman: sorry    cash the @H A and K|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: now the @ds are dead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|justin c: now it is going to be east who is endplayed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer is in a mess, but he can still get home, using dummy's @S9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or even not using it ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: Barel loves to think....|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: over-ruff when he ruffs and return to dummy with a club ruff for the rest of the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 now for a push|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: called "using a side-suit as substitute trumps"|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room opened 1nt and reached 3 nT|pg||
nt|xenya: do EW play a strong @C, Yuval?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|justin c: & forced to open up the @S suit|pg||
nt|werge: claim push come on|pg||
nt|hantveit: I wonder how vest would play if south covered the second heart...|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|niekbrink: as specs pointing out, at least the non vulnerable side is doubled....|pg||
nt|niekbrink: gib says that if west plays the jack of hearts, it will be made...|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrmmmm|pg||
nt|yuval10: no|pg||

nt|werge: Could (should) have made this|pg||
nt|nubmaster: another push|pg||
nt|nubmaster: both decl had the opportunity|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes, 6@c makes easily made but imagine south leads a small @h :)|pg||
nt|werge: So Nederland has doubled their lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: Another imp out |pg||
nt|werge: Hard battle for losing 1 IMP|pg||
nt|andyv:  all that work for 1 imp:)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@H was an imp better than 2@D :)|pg||
nt|athene: but i know which contract i wld prefer to play|pg||
nt|raghavan: ah ah ah|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@s for NS here|pg||

nt|chmitty: another flat board here :( |pg||
nt|hedyg: as a matter of fact nothing was great about his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT has some chances on this one but won't be bid i guess|pg||
nt|mamos: 24 points vulnerable - players keep telling me it's automatic to bid game vul at teams ....|pg||
nt|nubmaster: wd for a push|pg||
nt|justin c: could have been worse for NS there|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so although the dutch made 14 tricks in hearts, they lost 5 imps on it|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|justin c: 6 flat boards i a row|pg||
nt|justin c: unacceptable|pg||
nt|rhelle:  you don't see that very often|pg||
nt|lml: Skorchev didn't want to ruin the perfect score with an extra overtrick|pg||
nt|xenya: 0-0 so far|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and this one doesn't look much different|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I predict 1NT - 2@h - 2@s - all out|pg||
nt|justin c: might try 4@S?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  not when East can't super-accept|pg||
nt|lml: maybe north south can liven it up a bit|pg||
nt|lml: they do have a lot of red cards|pg||
nt|lml: although going above 3@H is not good|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcwla: Bamberger's on the board with the overtrick IMP on 16.|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding to a spec-voice, East is probably a women|pg||
nt|yuval10: competitive auction in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2@H X and 2@S ?|pg||
nt|pelu: good adwise to S: dont bid :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Let's use up lots of space when we have some points and might actually want to explore for the best contract...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: the action ended by 3@c in OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4 @S on queen guess|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 4@S (or 3NT) for EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: not the kind of deal zimmerman wants :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Is it a bad game?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hantveit: Looks like 11 tricks in a heart contract.|pg||
nt|werge: I would not be very surprised to see a 650 N/S-score here - and a very fast board|pg||
nt|werge: Not much, vulnerable 1 @S...|pg||
nt|hedyg: last bd Fantoni is playing-------2@c!|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry no! 3@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: not at all sure they get there without help|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3NT by N in OR.. same here? or asking for M this time? :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 3nt in EW might be hard to beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: possible slam for NS here|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 3@C in East??? - not me - but I am old :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: a nt game to stay out of  |pg||
nt|werge: Confirmed - we only knew it after the brave 3 @H-opening...|pg||
nt|patricck: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 6), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Most notable result was that Team Lavazza did not make it to Swiss A|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will take a different bidding sequence to 3 nt |pg||
nt|oliverc: but can go off with @H ruffs|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D (6@D?) for EW|pg||
nt|justin c: 4NT is 2 places to play|pg||
nt|nubmaster: How can DeWijs bid 3@s when 3@c is asking for M? isn't he satified if NS come to 4@h?|pg||
nt|snorris: this will end in 3nt..I think|pg||
nt|justin c: i am told this is 13-15|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: sry even better|pg||
nt|chmitty: they won't play 3NT any more|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure if the X by E is everyone's choice but it worked well|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: a transfer break from north would help them get there|pg||
nt|jcwla: No.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not in teams...|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 1spade is ok.|pg||
nt|bobholl: lavinthal should solve the @C @D return problem|pg||
nt|mamos: not even a sniff|pg||
nt|justin c: West knows no fear|pg||
nt|snorris: 1nt is ?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|werge: 800 - when I was young|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can see 8 tricks where is 9th?|pg||
nt|haans: mamy always said pass with 8|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c artificial?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and meaning what? |pg||
nt|athene: interesting lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: CC says: 2@H=weak|pg||
nt|athene: i have seen Versace do this a lot|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes against 3NT as well|pg||
nt|athene: he leads an ace to see dummy and see how to proceed|pg||
nt|bobholl: was he really thinking about balancing :) ?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Sometimes the NT range means you don't sniff at these ones|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Probably 10 or 11 is East's upper limit|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good 12 - 15|pg||
nt|niekbrink: anyone for 2nt with west after 2 spades?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told 1@C shows 2+, so NS have probably agreed to use natural overcalls|pg||
nt|xenya: after 1@C|pg||
nt|yuval10: best def. is win and play @s... not easy at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: difficult to bid against a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|werge: Should be a standard 650 - or so|pg||
nt|nubmaster: west doubled 2@h at the other table, easy 680 there|pg||
nt|nubmaster: and i'm not "that" old :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: when you were young, they had a different dbl table...|pg||
nt|hantveit: so not 800 :)|pg||
nt|ady: escap a heart lead and 3NT can make|pg||
nt|raghavan: Are EW going to 3NT Andy?|pg||
nt|justin c: think he plans to remove 5@C to 5@D, showing the reds|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT 9-11 I'm told|pg||
nt|mamos: well that lead looks helpful|pg||
nt|jcwla: Unlucky for E/W, @H's are split 5-0 against them :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Likely did not want to deal with rebid over 1@H-1@S-?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|patricck: West has a very big hand considering how much everyone else is bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it:)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s was for the lead :)|pg||
nt|lml: he has that|pg||
nt|rhelle:  well, there is a twist ..|pg||
nt|lml: that is very aggressive white|pg||
nt|xenya: now they will get to game|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think East will bid 3NT with his 4333 Max|pg||
nt|lml: partner we have 24 high at most and flat hands so lets try for the NV game|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 3 10s!|pg||
nt|justin c: we have all been in worse games than this|pg||
nt|lml: if they play and I hope that they do that responder is the pusher then maybe not but I suspect they will now too|pg||
nt|justin c: @HA in North, and get the @C out for 1 loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: The double of 2 @H ist very clever - for opponents|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the other dutch team high in the rankings lost exactly the same big swings on board 1 and 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just a game-forcing relay I presume. Some play that|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 + clubs gf  I am told |pg||
nt|patricck: getting NT from North was important, a diamond could beat 3NT if played by South|pg||
nt|raghavan: w to bid 3D|pg||
nt|athene: i guess with the weak opening bid on his right, the chances of setting up @DK in declarer's hand are low|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but on a @d lead, this will not fare well|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  already in the danger zone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They should get doubled and go for 500|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he has it it makes no difference anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: comfortable spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: even playing 8-10 (as i do ) wouldn't bid 2nt with this one :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: hahahah... yes, didn't see that before now :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is 2 off|pg||
nt|lml: what is 3@C anyone know?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@c is not good news, of course - now there looks to be duplication of values|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think it's natural|pg||
nt|justin c: might be showing values in @C with @S fit|pg||
nt|lml: I got a great answer from Fonzie to my question here is his answer to what is 3@c|pg||
nt|daman: probably asking what his long suit is, if any|pg||
nt|lml: "The last making contract"|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hahahahaha|pg||
nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|lml: thanks the Fonz|pg||
nt|justin c: correctamundo|pg||
nt|daman: meckwell would be in game and they would make it|pg||
nt|niekbrink: but found smoothly|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: y|pg||
nt|werge: Service-double we call them|pg||
nt|sybarra: best hand at the table I only used my "blue card" |pg||
nt|bobholl: suppose the X was support |pg||
nt|bobholl: no other choice but duck :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will be disappointed @hK on side|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: nt is rightsided|pg||
nt|hantveit: This will probably be very easy for EW|pg||
nt|oliverc: A fairly inevitable @H lead by East here|pg||
nt|hantveit: HA, H9, game over|pg||
nt|hedyg: no mention of nr of cards nor of Muiderberg|pg||
nt|niekbrink: alost same auction as in the open room|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I guess rusev is wondering about the heart lay out|pg||
nt|snorris: this can be won|pg||
nt|snorris: if s plays on @ds|pg||
nt|niekbrink: he has 2, there's a void in dummy and his partner doesn't lead them...|pg||
nt|snorris: low @s..to start with|pg||
nt|snorris: and in the end the jack of @cs is entry to @hs|pg||
nt|justin c: not easy for declarer|pg||
nt|niekbrink: can't cash his hearts too soon, it will squeeze dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess S got the turtle flu as well:)|pg||
nt|henryb: having opened, as we all would, that S hand, do you now bid 2@d, 2@s, or 2N|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnc: Current standings in the group: Apteker 87, Welland 86, Begijntje 79, McLeish 78, Dhampur S...M... 52|pg||
nt|desert: Hot X.......who likes it?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andrei Varlan|pg||
nt|sybarra: just a different way to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: but similar |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the other room they had another GF gadget, 1NT over 1@H. That is game-forcing. Very economical|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what do they bid with non GF|pg||
nt|sybarra: just pass? |pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S PRESUMABLY|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes sense (given the system) Geof |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is a contract without arms and leg, and body too for that matter|pg||
nt|andyv:  marshall miles must be playing:)|pg||
nt|athene: but neither defender knows that|pg||
nt|athene: each defender thinks that his partner has a yarborough :)|pg||
nt|justin c: no way for EW to get 2@C tricks if they open up the suit|pg||
nt|justin c: (and if they dont, declarer can establish a @S trick for a @C pitch)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they were not getting them anyhow since 1 @c was going on a @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am too slow :(|pg||
nt|xenya: not on a @D lead surely|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S or 2NT, depending on the system|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jeanhari: some work for the coaches :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 opposite 10 and a misfit, amazing|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes one wonder how they missed slam|pg||
nt|athene: north could have doubled 2@H perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: if he had done that, then *maybe* south would hit 3nt - but still unlikely|pg||
nt|chmitty: board 20 given the score Multon opened 3@s the West hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bingo|pg||
nt|chmitty: lucky to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No it looks like an 8-10 hand to me|pg||
nt|mamos: If declarer can make 3 diamond tricks looks like 9 tricks will make more often than not|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So 3S will get what it deserves in a roundabout way|pg||
nt|daman: in 4@S|pg||
nt|daman: losing 3 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello all. Tks Roland|pg||
nt|hantveit: Hi Andrei|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - no 800, 1.100|pg||
nt|sybarra: start clubs or @H's? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: They often pass with 9 or less because the opening is limited to 15. Also, they have a 2@C gadget for invitational hands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many different hand types|pg||
nt|patricck: still need to knock out @C first, so as to have enough entries to lead spades up twice|pg||
nt|sybarra: and so fascinating to see them all in action!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a risk of going down if you play for diamonds to be 4-4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and spurn the @SKJ onside chance|pg||
nt|bobholl: or @H 2 if they play it like meckwell|pg||
nt|chmitty: room for another 6 Imps so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Surely, West didn't bid enough, particularly after the double by North, which presumably suggested short diamonds with partner|pg||
nt|justin c: West has gone very quietly here|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT for me - 12-14 with 5 spades|pg||
nt|gulyas: if 2NT showed no extras, just my shape, I would go with that|pg||
nt|henryb: I also bid 2N, but I play 2@c is a gf, and I would not force with the N hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nubmaster: it wont be anything else but another push, third in a row|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hard to assess this, but it should go at least 2 down|pg||
nt|andyv:  some auctions are best left alone....dbl of 2@h may have warned E/W to stay low.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  well, it isn't a bad lead in that it gives nothign away ... declarer has a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: for sure no X from me - I would wait and X 5@C :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @c now and decl has 3 @d loosers|pg||
nt|desert: Fat chance....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you consider the 3@H advance to be game forcing?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: one on @s but still 2...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: almost gameforcing but they know N has up to 16|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: The poor young lady has no tricks|pg||
nt|athene: you normally set up the long suit in the hand with entries|pg||
nt|athene: but here, NEITHER hand has entries :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Better play by South is to duck KC probably|pg||
nt|snorris: I might be wrong..again..only -1 if played by my suggestions|pg||
nt|niekbrink: very good defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: i was wondering what 2NT in this position would've shown ,too Niek|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|werge: Should be forbidden|pg||
nt|nubmaster: for us specs yes :)|pg||
nt|lml: how do they avoid the four losers|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Herbst's style is to play games when Vulnerable|pg||
nt|henryb: whereas North did|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: thinking exactly the same Jean |pg||
nt|andyv:  spade lead in OR made this hand much easier for declarer (W dbld a 2@S bid by S)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6-4 and 10 hcp is usually opening value, but with a void in pd's suit, invitation would suffice |pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: i suppose you go for diamonds and lead to the @D9 maybe|pg||
nt|athene: or just duck a spade and hope for 33|pg||
nt|raghavan: He will try 33 Spades with OPP so give 2 tricks, 2Hearts, 2 Diamond =6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Irene Baroni|pg||
nt|justin c: @SQ an unlucky play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: nice defense|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play|pg||
nt|xenya: somehow|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes they do go down against top opponents and I think this would be one of those times|pg||
nt|daman: they would lead a low @H from AQ :)|pg||
nt|lml: nah|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nubmaster: 3NT bid and just made in OR|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT looks hopeless on a club lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe @D4 now is too revealing|pg||
nt|patricck: absolutely, declarer very likely to go down. In the other room an artificial 2@S was doubled by West so they got off to the wrong lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They lead 4th against NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: first @S finesse coming |pg||
nt|nubmaster: make now with doublefinesse @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer did well not to finesse @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now W is stuck|pg||
pc|d4|nt|desert: hmmm|pg||
nt|aupillon: If 2 women play like men, these French ladies does|pg||
nt|raghavan: S8 is another check |pg||
nt|athene: now @HA and @HQ, to show the diamond (not club) entry?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|lml: the cards just dont work out for an endplay even on a misdefense|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice|pg||
nt|niekbrink: this might get expensive for NS|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|werge: Board 8, pls|pg||
nt|athene: or he might just play passively|pg||
nt|niekbrink: seems like brink hasn't recoverd from his own bidding on the last hand. A very unlucky touch of the cards this board|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: no extra trick but still nice|pg||
nt|andyv:  not if declarer had 109x|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: @D9 or 10 would have been deceptive, but then again from K109x Christiansen would likely have led the 10|pg||
nt|hedyg: Brink not risking going off by taking another @c finesse|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he has only 1 entry left|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  coded !9D lead would have made it harder to read|pg||
nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
nt|patricck: excellent declarer play|pg||
nt|chmitty: so the lead will probably be cut to 30 Imp's with 7 boards to go ... stay with us :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so far 1 huge swing of 1 imp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East will have to provide the second finesse or a club trick|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 and next!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes very well done|pg||
nt|oliverc: North would have done better to insert the 10 from Dummy here. On rare occasions|pg||
nt|oliverc: might convince West that East had led from Qxx and persuade them to switch|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, that they play the same system on both sides is important :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yep but will have for K of @c instead|pg||
nt|lml: he might have been better to not duck the diamonds then North would play a diamond back for less downage|pg||
nt|justin c: has to hope N has !KC@HA|pg||
nt|justin c: when he doesnt, many off|pg||
nt|xenya: must go up?|pg||
nt|lml: after all its only 50 a trick|pg||
nt|justin c: must go up|pg||
nt|lml: he knows he has to but |pg||
nt|justin c: if the @HA is in north, he has 9|pg||
nt|lml: he just feels he is going to lose it... he will go up after a lot of squirming|pg||
nt|justin c: from a kib:  if not, NS have 9|pg||
nt|lml: unless he peaked he will go up|pg||
nt|henryb: I would force over a red suit opening|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: he knows declarer is ducking from two spades hoping for 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: a very good switch be W|pg||
pc|h6|nt|april7: -3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: does he finesse @D again?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: only 8 after a heart lead so good bidding..|pg||
nt|athene: and so clearly has no tricks :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 20 will be a big swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like -3|pg||
nt|niekbrink: east might have don better here by playing a club|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|gulyas: I agree with that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: on the heart switch may be worried to take 2nd diamond finesse   may settle for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c discard by W might cost a trick|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'll admit that a @c lead is much better on the hand|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but since Zia - Welland are unlikely to have very detailed agerements about intervention|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Shame on yourself, stand in the corner W...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I like the fact that West tries to make their life as tough as possible|pg||
nt|nubmaster: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and of course East might have well lead a @d ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Muller, play a club|pg||
nt|justin c: @CK now?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jeanhari: he will count the hearts still left|pg||
nt|haans: 4|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will finesse if 3|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so zimmermans discard (spade or heart) will make a two trick difference in a way|pg||
nt|haans: play @HJ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: taking his time|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A diamond appears likely on the West hand :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|niekbrink: Rusev should be able to reburn the king of clubs now. Only 1 club left outside his and dummies|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|patricck: and the reward for that excellent play?   LOSE 2 imps  :(|pg||
nt|lml: someone gave it away, one way or another or that play makes no sense|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcwla: So making 3NT.|pg||
nt|niekbrink: and he did....:(|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|patricck: the @C discard was crucial|pg||
nt|roswolf: twas ever thus|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days are like that |pg||
nt|athene: declarer would have gone for clubs if he had any chance of bringing those in|pg||
nt|yuval10: oops...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|nt|athene: or diamonds similarly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade, DA and D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Irene is a woman|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: rehi|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not much happened|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|jeanhari: cant see him tae the finesse|pg||
nt|jeanhari: k|pg||
nt|haans: spade K has been played|pg||
nt|jeanhari: think zimmermann discarded spade first|pg||
nt|haans: only 1 imp to fuss about|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they were in 3 nt in the other room making|pg||
nt|jeanhari: v prooijen must be ALMOST sure de Q is on his left|pg||
nt|ady: going to lose imps whatever   in game making OR|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|haans: even if he is wrong he may still get @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Zmu-Balicki lucky in 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: spade lead there also |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so this two trick problem is reduced to only one imp|pg||
nt|ady: yes  just a toss up   spade or h eart|pg||
nt|andyv:  better than the other "reward":)|pg||
nt|athene: so i think north can probably put his partner with @DA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: right sru|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: sry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: we may cash |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb: really?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I doubt that|pg||
nt|henryb: so do I|pg||
mc|6|nt|gulyas: it is probably 3 off|pg||
nt|henryb: he had no count at all|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: yes 3 down too fast for me sorry|pg||
nt|gulyas: operator having problems|pg||

nt|jcwla: If W's cards weren't aces might have been uglier.|pg||
nt|aupillon: 2 hearts by E/W ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 more bds for the decision |pg||
nt|sybarra: andy did your mother play duplicate?>|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope, canasta|pg||
nt|sybarra: or even rubber bridge?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The trick for E-W here is to avoid 4@H|pg||

nt|athene: 6@S must be cheap here|pg||
nt|athene: if you work out that NS really do make their slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: one can critisize W but what should he do ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bid 3@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: At least|pg||
nt|chmitty: or 3@d|pg||
nt|justin c: another 3nt hand|pg||
nt|justin c: not what Angelini needs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 @H 2 @H 4@H simple but effective|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This looks like the hand to go get coffee :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Slam here|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@S|pg||
nt|snorris: I mean 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: -6 imps, playing the @HK would have resulted in -7|pg||
nt|justin c: well at least it wasnt flat|pg||
nt|lml: well as they say in gin rummy we broke the schneider|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 3 more imps to israel|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  I suspect we're back to boring pushes|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: 2NT all pass?|pg||
nt|hantveit: what about 3nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think Auken will insist after he shows 6 of them shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see if EW enter the bidding|pg||
nt|raghavan: BD 17 OR Texan played in 2S= so Texan gains another 6 IMP|pg||
nt|hantveit: 13+6 NS. EW have a nice club support. 5 clubs is on|pg||
nt|rhelle:  slam was bid and made at the other table|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nubmaster: in OR Nick opened strong @c, south bid 1@s, pass, pass, Nick jumped to 2NT and south bid 3@h, all pass...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 3), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - with 8 or 9 tricks, depending on the eventual @C-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: E-W never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|athene: now it gets interesting|pg||
nt|bobholl: good 5@C but difficulkt to reach|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has the purest 15 count ... 2@S was totally inadequate|pg||
nt|bobholl: but will E than bid 4 ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: he should|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3NT most probably here, but can you grab 9 tricks ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3 NT board 21 open room|pg||
nt|chmitty: after a 1 NT opening bid .... by EAST !!!|pg||
nt|chmitty: they play 10-12 and he upgraded his 9 count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|chmitty: what's going on here ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: not a lot|pg||
nt|bobholl: someone asleep ?|pg||

nt|chmitty: with a @s lead (best for defence)|pg||
nt|chmitty: operator ??|pg||

nt|bobholl: espresso please :)|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Airmail or surface freight Bob?|pg||
nt|mamos: Ive got a new machine :)    so anyone who wants to drop in is welcome|pg||
nt|bobholl: thougth you'd bring it :)|pg||
nt|mowen: easy to make  so can they bid it?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Always difficult to bid a slam when an opponent opens. Well done Drijver and Brink|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's true. I didn't notice East had an opening bid.|pg||
nt|lml: even if I "thought" from the table action that Popov had the @HA I would rise|pg||
nt|xenya: oh it was 7 -- sorry|pg||
nt|lml: it is worth it for the chance to make the hand if I am wrong|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice bid by S in the CR . he knew he has a @s fit but wanted to play the slam from HIS side|pg||
mb|2H|nt|aupillon: in my youger days...:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Let us view how NS reach slam bidding method|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 7@H, knowing they will take the "safe" sacrifice|pg||
nt|andyv:  @ss were never bid in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he imagines 4@S for E-W|pg||
mb|d|nt|nubmaster: pass? |pg||

nt|athene: after all, you might have a spade void|pg||
nt|athene: and if so, 7@S has to be right|pg||
nt|ritong: kind of blackmailing|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2D+2C losers in 7S|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D would qualify as 'a lot'|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If 3C is shortage N may even think of slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3NT looks difficult as well, even though it made in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is forcing for them. It is not for many players|pg||
nt|hantveit: reachable...|pg||
nt|bobholl: say it worked :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace feeling robbed?|pg||
nt|justin c: wonder if north was tempted to whack this?|pg||
nt|athene: well, at the risk of getting shouted at by 480 people, i think this often happens when you don't open a weak-2 just because you have 4 in the other major or a bad suit or something ...|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: would be "bid on"|pg||
nt|athene: if west opens 2@S he is spared this horrible "last guess" situation|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you saying you would open the W hand with 2@s?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, for sure|pg||
nt|athene: i admit i might be completely mad :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Has he? |pg||
nt|nubmaster: Easy now...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  it's a pretty marginal opening bid|pg||
nt|snorris: 3@hs is very weak with@hs|pg||
nt|snorris: @ss sorry|pg||
nt|justin c: @D suit blocked|pg||
nt|xenya: now S can almost bid 6N all by himself|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: strange pass from W - but maybe only East have the right to overcell :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: you both are talking about younger days... :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why 5@s?|pg||
nt|athene: north could have bid 3@H over 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah!|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs says: the Dutch were on the Brink of disaster! :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he does :) !!|pg||
nt|rhelle:  oops!|pg||
nt|aupillon: Sorry Roland :)   And suddenly this match recovers "life".... Hello all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is a serious position to take ...|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andrei|pg||
nt|justin c: this is the luckiest contract i have seen so far today|pg||
nt|rhelle:  on the other hand, it may be that 9 tricks is simply the limit of the hand|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in @s or NT|pg||
nt|lml: I wrote a blog about luck yesterday|pg||
nt|lml: bridge is about percentages.|pg||
nt|lml: here North-South got to the wrong game|pg||
nt|xenya: Sasha :)|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, that was private|pg||
nt|lml: but the percentages dont always work out on a single deal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would he lead a diamond?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He can't see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|aupillon: and the lead was....|pg||
nt|lml: he problem wont and that is part of the luck too|pg||
nt|xenya: after the 2@S opening|pg||
nt|niekbrink: now 7nt might be made by south....|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: I alm told director was called at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, in some systems he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: probably no big swing here, playing for the overtricks|pg||
nt|athene: along the lines of "bidding my suit before the auction reaches the 8-level"|pg||
nt|athene: :) 5@D was certainly Brinksmanship|pg||
nt|hedyg: Net White missed the game on bd 20|pg||
nt|hedyg: here wrong 4card suit led|pg||
nt|yuval10: X is a risky bid... most of the chances are that you'll be in the lead anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: but he would like to know if N has the @HA|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H probably showing the suit, with a minor on the side|pg||
nt|yuval10: Muller could've left it go|pg||
nt|gulyas: and x was t/o|pg||
nt|henryb: I sure would pass 2@hX|pg||
nt|gulyas: he did have good trumps:) but also @S fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll surely X if North bid 3@h now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|april7: why 2@C???|pg||
nt|werge: East unblocks and has an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|werge: Why not @S Queen.....?|pg||
nt|werge: That´s sleepy bridge - take it or leave it|pg||
nt|werge: North has minors, so S should find the @c-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, he bid 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it does but the defence are forced to open up suits because of the distribution|pg||
nt|snorris: this is a good stop|pg||
nt|yuval10: will he ask for the queen?|pg||
nt|xenya: or maybe a void? -- admittedly, not very likely|pg||
nt|niekbrink: of course, 7nt won't be bid|pg||
nt|xenya: so no Ace|pg||
nt|xenya: 7N is silly despite E's double -- whta if W has the @HA?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: How would you bid the N hand over 1NT?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Ducked by N|pg||
nt|aupillon: eventually|pg||
nt|werge: Problem is, we cannot remember what is going on now - only the past|pg||
nt|sybarra: need an early @D hook |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a very delicate hand to play and I can assure you that it will take time|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm still not past trick one|pg||
nt|roswolf: are there enough tricks i can see how 8 may be made but not 9 - it may take a defensive error|pg||
nt|patricck: I think that 3NT would be dead on a small @S lead and continuation, but yes, the defence has problems if they start with a club|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should be able to win trick and ask S to lead again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: where there is 8.....|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 6@s immediately gets the job done|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: who said dont lead from Jxxx?|pg||
nt|justin c: very|pg||
nt|snorris: no way for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes he is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: E slightly surprised now?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Rule of 11 revealed that North has no card higher than the 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: btw "deep Fantoni" made 3@c on bd 6 with AJ10x @c behind him!|pg||
nt|mamos: bidding 4@H and folding your arms doesn't work with screens does it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South's 4H should end it as she would cue bid a minor suit ace or void|pg||
nt|jcwla: How about pass of 2@S?  What is 1NT range?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now X and leave in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 11-7 = 4   Christiansen can see all 4 in his and partner's hand. Accordingly, North can't beat the 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It is not often that this rule comes into play, but here is an example|pg||
nt|andyv:  revealing @h discard|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the 8 of spades may come to declarer's rescue but it is nip and tuck|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I should have said  11-6 = 5   and declarer can see all 5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or even 11-5 = 6  and he can see all 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Doesnøt matter. The thing is that North can't beat the 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This should not make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  everyone :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: N wont stop under 6@s now after S's 2NT bid...|pg||
nt|lml: that is why Frank Sinatra sang "Luck Be A Lady TOnight" before going to play craps|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow, no X ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 14-16?|pg||
nt|henryb: strangely passive by the dutch|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is happy with their lead I think, trying not to do anything foolish|pg||
nt|yuval10: he has like 4 tricks in his hand and P must have something for his X ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he doesn't know that the 6NT hand cost them 14|pg||
nt|yuval10: he can't sit on this kind of lead with more than 20 boards to go|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'm told 1NT 12-15.|pg||
nt|jbgood: he also knows that prd - who is now certain to be short in hearts - had no bid over 2@s - so he may not have much but distribution|pg||
nt|henryb: well he can of course, but perhaps he shouldn't|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hantveit: The other table played 3H -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sorry all,  my time just got crunched ...see you at the PABF  tonight |pg||
nt|Walddk4: and what else can you lead on this auction?|pg||
nt|justin c: this is going to be v awkward for declarer|pg||
nt|bobholl: same bidding and lead in open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok had 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@S has gone off 1 in the OR.|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Brink asking for spade queen|pg||
nt|niekbrink: will correct to 6nt now|pg||
nt|yuval10: S will correct to 6NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: Poor South - his last entry|pg||
nt|jcwla: This will not take the Romex award.|pg||
nt|athene: heart back not hard to find|pg||
nt|athene: go Irene :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Drijver has the trump queen, but no extra's i guess...|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess J@s is an extra for THEIR style of pre-emptive bids :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: or the 6th spade|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: he certainly has a max, with good trumps - if pd has a weak hand, he could pull|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: a small @S - but still a danger of blocking the suit|pg||
nt|nubmaster: more action in OR, there W bid 2@d over 1NT (multi), N doubled and west 3@d (preempt in M). south doubled and west bid 3@s and Smirinov as south bid 4@d by a long thought and North ...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ended it all by 4@h|pg||
nt|aupillon: depends on the ruff in clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec tells me gib says -1 well that might well be the case but i wouldnt put my life savings on that result happening in real life|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess he goes after hearts|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas 42 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks a bit odd to me|pg||
nt|niekbrink: some luck for the dutch here i think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Shirley|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: but not here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You read about those underleads in books, but you rarely see them at the table|pg||
nt|athene: he has to bid to dodgy contracts so he has a challenge in the play :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: the four teams in the semi finals did not really impress in the swiss. The vito team did best, by winning the B swiss. The other semi finalists were 11, 14 and 22 in the A-swiss|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess there's some point with this pass - E will probably lead @c anyway, and @d's are always badly devided, as according to the Italians :)|pg||
nt|xenya: not bidding 6N i mean|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: usually when you try this in real life, declarer wins @SK stiff in dummy and has a sure side loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And if you do, they are often unsuccessful|pg||
nt|andyv:  Net white trying to run out the clock:)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Fast and easy, nos problemas... DO NOT think 5 minutes before the lead Muller!! :)|pg||
nt|mowen: well done - notice Zia gets to be dummy again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fast?|pg||
nt|justin c: @DK?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mortals would have led @DK 5 mins ago|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Just noticed through a spec that East opened 1@c, and South doubled ... that is also brave|pg||
nt|justin c: this promotes a trump for south|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: We not only get flat boards - same contract, same declarer. If only one pair would make some transfers...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as North bidding slam now becomes easier :)|pg||
nt|daman: I'll have to try that|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like discard of @h would indicate where suit was|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8|pg||
nt|yuval10: N may have Q@h after all, so 6NT is down 1 and 6@s cold|pg||
nt|yuval10: W found the trump lead and it will be a massacre now...|pg||
nt|gulyas: he played a @S from hand?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT went down 2 in OR so 3 to Dutch on 23.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|hantveit: a lost chance for EW there. I guess East must find strength to bid 5 clubs on 3 clubs. That is very difficult.|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 52 cards always easy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: still can be only 1 down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc 2@hs, finesse @h, ruff 1@d and play @s|pg||
nt|mowen: should plat=y @SJ at trick 2|pg||
nt|justin c: guess Skorchev did that also|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hantveit: click on the movie button, and open room if you want to see the open room score card|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: yes the diamonds block and yes he didn't have a diamond lead anyway|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Now he can just knock out @HK for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  now Q@C would have scuttled 3 tricks in @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The problem is that he doesn't know that North has it|pg||
nt|chmitty: low @d by Allavena are supposed to deny @s 10 in the pair's convention I believe|pg||
nt|justin c: y, can handle long @S in W but not E|pg||
nt|mowen: can pick up 4-0 break with west having the 4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: Walter Johnson points out it is J9xx not Jxxx|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The diamonds don't run so a club loser is unavoidable|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: But what else can he do?|pg||
nt|justin c: (to go with a couple of diamonds and a @H trick later)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think a redbl would be the best bid over 2h X. why bid 3h?|pg||
nt|daman: Roland sings that when he and his partner are bidding slams|pg||
nt|yuval10: S can only count 11 top tricks in NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird|pg||
pc|d2|nt|aupillon: big mistake|pg||
nt|chmitty: now he can make|pg||
nt|hedyg: or the other way round :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but will win 1 imp anyway :)|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
pc|d3|nt|niekbrink: seems like 5 more imps to Vito|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|chmitty: with double @c finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Pleasant development, and it must be said the East had a problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps West should habe played @D10 on the second round, telling East he had control of the suit|pg||
nt|chmitty: East indeed had a problem, but a top class pair is supposed to know whether West hols 10 @s or not in this situation|pg||
nt|justin c: a smith echo would have avoided this|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So a couple of possible solutions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and assuming Balicki gets home, the match is well and truly alive|pg||
nt|justin c: the idea is that west uses a high card in @D to encourage a continuation of the suit led|pg||
nt|lml: if I bid 3NT East would have AKQ9xx of diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: how come no K@h ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't think we see the correct play here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: with open cards he can make now. wim and take @h AQ 2 @d  and play @c|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did he forget that North pitched a heart? No! He never forgets anything. I know, because never ever did he forget to come and get his pay cheque. Very sad|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol:)|pg||
nt|patricck: don;t you give him direct credit Roland? Do you make him come and get a cheque?  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes to the latter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He put an invoice on the table and I give him a cheque|pg||
nt|justin c: (which West didnt do, so East switched)|pg||
nt|chmitty: interesting move by North|pg||
nt|henryb: I think Muller is in a trance|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: building an endplay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess he figures that since the defence gave him one trick, he might dump them in again and get donated another|pg||
nt|bobholl: not home yet and not down yet :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: down two open room ... |pg||
pc|d9|nt|chmitty: 11 imp's in play|pg||
nt|bobholl: a @C will do that|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: now hope for split @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: and say hard luck|pg||
nt|bobholl: already knows they are not :)|pg||
nt|justin c: only if south revoked|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes that might help :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so hope for a revoke|pg||
nt|hedyg: TD at the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: any info appreciated Eu|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 2 :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not yet|pg||
nt|lml: who was the unlucky bridge player in Victor Mollo|pg||
nt|gulyas: I doubt that as well|pg||
pc|d5|nt|werge: The @S-suit was some sort of violenced in this board (at this table!)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|henryb: the play has been strange|pg||
pc|d6|nt|justin c: lol|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: was it Papa the Greek?|pg||
nt|justin c: karapet|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: He played it well, so maybe he will get paid next year too, but only maybe|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And once again, East is Balicki's friend|pg||
nt|chmitty: well ... a guess now|pg||
nt|chmitty: North can play West to hold the @c king with this defence|pg||
nt|chmitty: and then cash a top @s and exit ace @c and @c|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chmitty: he does not now who has the last @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: know|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's fine - club to the ace, heart ace pitching a diamond, club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and another club ... I really think he is going to make this contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: I bet no :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: one beer on making :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: so strange that East opened the @c with the king|pg||
nt|chmitty: my pleasure|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|pc|h5|nt|gulyas: I guess we have to sit and wait to find out what the score is|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: West played @d 3, 8 and 10|pg||
nt|chmitty: can hold 3 cards and now stay with @h Q8 @c K5|pg||
mc|7|nt|andyv:  and a sigh of relief|pg||
nt|jcwla: If that (or anything like it) really was the def and still down 2, that supports the view that a double was indicated.|pg||

nt|werge: Game seems easy...|pg||
nt|werge: I would not have defended like that!|pg||
nt|hantveit: not even when you were young?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Eugenio,  everyone asking me if 3 @S -1 is correct |pg||
nt|ritong: always impressive to see them play as if they had the whole hand in view|pg||
nt|raghavan: Lara get 17 IMPS in this 1 Bd|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be a push i guess :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: I suspect so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So what brand do you want?|pg||
nt|chmitty: One from you beautiful country please|pg||
nt|andyv:   20, N/S in sane 3@d contract and -10 imps|pg||
nt|nubmaster: next deal... nore action pls|pg||
nt|nubmaster: more MORE|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Karapet the Free Armenian :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3 IMPs in it with 6 boards to play ...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is exciting stuff|pg||
nt|lml: so that adventure only cost North-South an imp|pg||
nt|xenya: good result for the Dutch from OR|pg||
nt|xenya: +620|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed - a very aggressive game|pg||
mb|1C|nt|snorris: n-s are close to 3nt but it cant win|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: another baby slam in H|pg||
nt|bobholl: he really passed that 13 pointer ?|pg||
nt|oliverc: East never going to give much weight to their stiff K@D and West has too many|pg||
nt|oliverc: outside losers|pg||
nt|hantveit: 13+12 NS, this time with a support in D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Such good taste you have |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the pass of 5@S was alerted ?? as don't bid on i suppose|pg||
nt|nubmaster: There are 2300 spectators here Zia... we want some action|pg||
nt|rhelle:  EW are of course delighted to see all these flattish boards go past|pg||
nt|nubmaster: y|pg||
nt|lml: and how did they make it one wonders|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 4 losers|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  awkward 4@s in OR.|pg||
nt|justin c: another flattish looking board in 4@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: IMO too strong for 1nt |pg||
nt|niekbrink: losing 5 tricks from the top|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s partial is the limit here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|aupillon: certainly not . ( i was unsked not to underlead King by that time)|pg||
nt|aupillon: asked*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Moysian fit was not successful next door|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes good bidding by defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: we were not told :(|pg||
nt|athene: TD on last board is likely to be misexplanation of NS's actions over 5@S i suppose|pg||
nt|justin c: Brink likes bidding|pg||
nt|niekbrink: i guess 1 spade means a transfer to 1nt|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d by S must be @h's|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: there's a slight danger this 5@H might be taken as advance saccing in some situations|pg||
nt|athene: but not after strong NT, pre-emptive overcall AND at unfavourable|pg||
nt|athene: i didn't think this NS pair would stay quiet with a 5-5 spade fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: nv in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|athene: the only question was which of them would get the 2@S bid in first|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: wow thats heavy if 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like we may have had a wrong carryover. On the official website they have 7-19 after the first set. We had 2-26|pg||
nt|snorris: unless if played by north and he gets small @d lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: so perhaps 1@h from W is some sort of a takeout|pg||
nt|gulyas: and the x is 3 card support|pg||
mb|2H|nt|aupillon: game in 4@h|pg||
nt|hantveit: both major kings are on for EW. 4H will make|pg||
nt|werge: I vote for West, 4 @H, 620|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 5@c a bit saner|pg||
nt|patricck: the lucky spade position will allow 5@C to make, but because EW can force in @H it isn't enough to allow 4@S to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it's obviously better than 3NT|pg||
nt|oliverc: Good spot|pg||
nt|chmitty: I loved to travel there few years ago|pg||
nt|hedyg: surprised N didnt|pg||
nt|justin c: the one with the worse hand of course :)|pg||
nt|xenya: on a crossruff, a kbitzer tells me|pg||
nt|justin c: a couple of diamonds, a club, and a trump|pg||
nt|lml: they didn't exactly crossruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR will probably opens 1NT and then goes 2@h - 2@s - 2NT ... ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 7NT is also easy|pg||
nt|raghavan: S does not want to bid 5S only to push them to 6|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps west thought 5@H was asking for spade control|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, very possible|pg||
nt|athene: she is probably still preoccupied with writing down the previous hand|pg||
nt|athene: to show to her friends|pg||
nt|andyv:  bid is confusing since W is looking at A@h|pg||
nt|raghavan: OR they bid slam |pg||
nt|raghavan: and made|pg||
nt|yuval10: oh, so indeed S upgraded his hand and bid 3@d, and that leads the brothers for a hopeless game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: perfect distribution for 12 tricks if played accoringly and helping lead from E|pg||
nt|werge: Yes N/S!|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes always easy with 14 high cards but I think they will stop in 6@d or @h|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think Walsh 4@h bid in OR was a "little" underbid...|pg||
nt|werge: One more of these doubles - and here red against green, so no play E/W|pg||
nt|justin c: at the other table they didnt look for slam NS|pg||
nt|nubmaster: What is RD by Justin?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C has a shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: more than a shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: it's rigid|pg||
nt|patricck: %@C needs @SQ10 in the pocket, and there they are :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: Yes, a good practical bid.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Yes, this half is very boring ... especially compared to the previous one|pg||
nt|snorris: AND finds the q of @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: like this on|pg||
nt|josj: can you ask?|pg||
nt|patricck: looked to me as though declarer only lost 4 tricks 2@S, 1@H and 1@D, East discarded a club to let declarer take all the club tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  or Q@D to drop:)|pg||
nt|hantveit: But why did he pass in opening??|pg||
nt|oliverc: good question|pg||
nt|hantveit: pas|pg||
nt|lml: they lost a spade to the offside king but a club trick disappeared|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Flat board|pg||
nt|roswolf: or @D Q singleton or doubleton|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, the spade isn't needed because of the diamond dropping|pg||
nt|andyv:  lovely hand for S to hear 4@d:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is 4@D  rkcb I wonder, or a splinter in hearts?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keycard ask I am told|pg||
nt|roswolf: might even consider exploring a slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  when I hold these hands, after I gave pd a raise, I just want them to place the contract so I can go back to sleep|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It takes time for Szegedi to count all his keycards it seems|pg||
nt|hantveit: In norwegian we write PASS :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Dummy will certainly be wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|chmitty: This board will be flat ... definitely|pg||
nt|athene: some might have bid 4@C leaping michaels with west's hand over 2@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 places to play|pg||
nt|hedyg: less so at the other table where on bd 21 Nunes balanced with X and Fantoni passed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe there is an adjustment we don't know about|pg||
nt|yuval10: good chance for NED. to gain imps here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I'm no longer disagreeing with you|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they will be pretty sure of the game swing on 18, and nothing else has happened since|pg||
nt|justin c: cards lying well for declarer here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @c break 3-3 so it's 10 easy for a push|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed - another easy game and flat board|pg||
nt|nubmaster: new deal.. put it on the floor|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't see a way of preventing declarer from winning 5@s, 2@h and 1@d at the very least|pg||
nt|gulyas: Muller showed a good 2@S bid probably, and they rest in 2@S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|werge: Who is E/W - maybe indiscrte, but their family names are hidden|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@D overcall would have led to a different contract.|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, West has an abvious 4H bid with only 5 losers and south giving away the spade K.|pg||
nt|werge: In a match like this, a 7 IMP victory deserves an award|pg||
nt|aupillon: next ( that's Joey silver phrase)|pg||
nt|hantveit: Well, it has not been many interesting hands. Very difficult to get lost|pg||
nt|werge: South opened 2 @S in OR - good luck|pg||
nt|aupillon: Gimme a break : Soulet - Lebel didn't call THE GAME in ! h ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: hearts*|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would pass 3H also. |pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 points and 9 losers - why would I bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be a success for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah then has south forgotten?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hegedus knows that 5@C does not exist by looking at his cards, so he also knows that partner did not take 4@D as rkcb|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@C could be 2 key cards and the Q@C couldn't it?|pg||
nt|justin c:  4NT is two places to play here|pg||
nt|athene: but either he doesn't play that, or he considered there was too much outside the club suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d= if you have @ds, so do i, if not i have @h fit|pg||
nt|justin c: (neither of which is @D)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT on its way down in the OR.|pg||
nt|niekbrink: with a small diamond lead, he is likely to find the queen of clubs as  east is know to have 9 red cards|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like a low @D would let this through|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think it will be duplicated |pg||
nt|gulyas: good lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm not sure if he's worth a "good 2 bid" with worthless Q@h and K@c singelton, but they stopped low|pg||
nt|yuval10: and that's all matters|pg||
nt|gulyas: with a fit and combined 24 hcp, they did well to stop, lots of wasted values|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that if those K and Q would've been in @d they can make 4@s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chessmaste: Adrian Thomas - Wales - Gay Keavney - Ireland|pg||
nt|nubmaster: lucky for NS the @ds break 4-3|pg||
nt|raghavan: 13 IMP to Texan ( slam IMP|pg||
nt|snorris: so in with the ace of @s east must cash @ds from top|pg||
nt|justin c: he has no way to come to 9 tricks without knocking out the @SA, at which point EW can cash out the @D suit|pg||
nt|justin c: i am told the lead at the other table was the @CQ|pg||
nt|lml: but then again this is a hand Meckwell might make|pg||
nt|rhelle:  clearly the @cQ is the right lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead looks pretty normal here|pg||
nt|justin c: err...|pg||
nt|justin c: is the @CQ lead really likely to be a good idea?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think with West being so weak, he hopes to find gold in his partner's hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't always be sure which seemingly not great cards might be useful.  Seems like a nice sequence to me.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nubmaster: another "support opp's" double... what's the meaning by doubling here...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It could, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In that case she should bid 7|pg||
nt|patricck: a bit unlikely to pass at his first turn tho with all that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: he, sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  S might not have passed 1@H with that holding:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: if you need a swing, finesse the @d jack ?|pg||
nt|justin c: i was just wondering that|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Definitely too strong, I'd rather open a 20-22 2NT but really it's in between|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @S = 0-10 with clubs - so Easts best card was devaluated |pg||
nt|aupillon: eventually i play in San remo, teams. And vulnerable i go for the bonus :(|pg||
nt|hantveit: West might play heart ace and another hearts, afraid of the spade ruff.|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a hand like E you dont want to bid 5@c and have pd pass with @c/@h 2suiter|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  12 tricks possible but it's not a good slam|pg||
nt|lml: the @CQ doesn't seem that bad|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: last hand no @S-stop - this time no @D-stop - but @D 4-3 = 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hantveit: 10 or 11, that is the question|pg||
nt|justin c: north cue bidding, but south will not cooperate|pg||
nt|bobholl: will  loose at least 1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: but it is terrible on the hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|justin c: again NS push EW to the five level|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@S= no control in red suits|pg||
nt|rhelle:  intresting that Zia never mentioned his 4-card @h suit ...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Is Muller really thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ha|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes ... which @d to throw :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: He has SIX dias... just discard one of them|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
pc|d7|nt|werge: West is Thomas, East Keaveney, Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@H = the @HQ, but no outside kings, so S knows the @DK is missing|pg||
nt|justin c: Jason seems to be giving 7 a look regardless|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not 5@s to show K of @s?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: which also makes sense because if you play four rounds, then the @s switch becomes obvious|pg||
nt|chmitty: when if you finesse early and loose the J, defence is more difficult|pg||
nt|justin c: but for all he knows, the @S are 5-2 and he already had a swing board|pg||
nt|bobholl: rule of 11 will tell to out in Q|pg||
nt|bobholl: what did i tell :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good play JC under queen to allow club finesse later without wasting an entry|pg||
nt|justin c: you cant hurry these things|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, good sequence|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|patricck: Versace will be feeling happy, defending a doubled contract with 6 trumps is always nice|pg||
nt|hedyg: but Versace is up to it|pg||
nt|athene: another club gives him a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: @CK would be wrong if south was going to ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but even then you would have residual chances in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni in 5@d X on last bd|pg||
nt|hedyg: Wijs did not save him there|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: he doesn't believe in luck|pg||
nt|april7: only @c lead might hinder|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs are saying this is a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: so swing to Ned White|pg||
nt|hedyg: and new leader|pg||
nt|justin c: @CK looks like it keeps more chances alive|pg||
nt|hedyg: what if N has long AQxx in @c?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  it's only terrible because West has no more entry for a @d play|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|rhelle:  East is a bit stuck now ... can't play @d, can't play @c - he might give the position of the @sK away|pg||
nt|rhelle:  a@h is also not attractive|pg||
nt|lml: a club isnt too bad.|pg||
nt|lml: even if West has the @SK he wouldn't play it necessarily|pg||
nt|justin c: am getting many opinions on the merits of the @CQ lead :)|pg||
nt|lml: partner might have the @DK but he will have another chance to find out so he could wait and see a bit|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to me that it can blow a trick rather easily, and that a ruff is very unlikely|pg||
nt|lml: or he could try a diamond now|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think he can see the @dK in dummy :)|pg||
nt|xenya: he can see the @DK|pg||
nt|lml: oh sorry I am backwards|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think the @cQ is so bad|pg||
nt|lml: dummy has hearts|pg||
nt|lml: you think they might work|pg||
nt|lml: you need to get something going|pg||
nt|rhelle:  well, two world-class players found it - so therefore, almost by definition, it can't be so bad|pg||
nt|lml: so you try a minor|pg||
nt|aupillon: And now ,the end is near, and drop the final courtains ( Frank Sinatra, you quoted) |pg||
nt|justin c: hard to make 'the end is 6 boards away' rhyme with anything|pg||
nt|rhelle:  "they joined the fray" ?|pg||
nt|lml: so specs please stay|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|justin c: getting many suggested song lyrics|pg||
nt|rhelle:  every trick is now important, and both teams know it ... so I think ew'll see a lot of serious pauzes from now on|pg||
nt|justin c: dont give up the day jobs :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i disagree, but it's all academic now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|justin c: this depends on the lead, on a non-@C lead 6 could be right|pg||
nt|werge: After West double it´s not a 5 or 7, @C-lead is out of question|pg||
nt|hantveit: I have learned one thing from my father. Look at your cards, ask if you should bid again, if the cards says no, take a green bidding pad that says PAS and put it on the table.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: I think N will be suprised that pard has J of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to Hungary|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q@d makes play of hand very quick|pg||
nt|lml: this was his best shot|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|werge: Still 650 possible|pg||
nt|aupillon: same for me, but things changed i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he is off playing K@c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: but queen wasn't played lol|pg||
nt|nubmaster: unfortunately... but if we scream really loud  perhaps even the Sanremo-people might hear us? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There has been a TD ruling, so the real score is 9-33|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Someone take notes pls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Justin?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am at 4 tables at a time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We can't change the scoreboard while the table is open|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Really ace of @s before testing clubs and @h finesse? seems stupid to me...|pg||
nt|justin c: no problem, 9-33 it is|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  West cashing a spade doesn't really hurt and he forces them to discard |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: sort of need to untangle this a bit (n/s) |pg||
nt|sybarra: for max|pg||
nt|oliverc: 11, that is the answer :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: we will never know :(|pg||
nt|xenya: best defence but declarer will prevail|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|werge: Count in @D from North, should lead South in the right direction|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess it was lucky there was an entry to that @DJ10, there didn't have to be on a different trump break|pg||
nt|hantveit: Monaco picked up another 3 imps on board 7 as Zimmermann went -2 in open|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Now club to 9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|justin c: was he intending to run that?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  JC even better play in that case|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 24, where E/W beat 3@H two tricks in here, they played in 2@S E/W in the OR, making on the nose for no swing.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|werge: YES - 9 IMP|pg||
nt|snorris: and so he did..|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|aupillon: down 16|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, that and knowing West had probably 5 spades|pg||
nt|chmitty: fly to San Remo (nice place) and ask him :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  safe line. He just gives up 1@h, @d Ace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Normally East having trouble with discards would be revealing|pg||
nt|justin c: this is looking like the fifth flat board in a row|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Muller doesn't reveal anything. This is his normal pace|pg||
nt|nubmaster: If decl have Qx in @c he cannot discard a @c... |pg||
nt|justin c: maybe Muller decide to pitch a @H now - live a little|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Better playing W with @h8 and discard a @h...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With some luck this set will finish before the next begins ... in 3 days|pg||
nt|nubmaster: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yesterday Rob tried to convince me that Muller really isn't as slow as many people say|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Did Zia and Roy bring their sleeping pillows?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe you can seel that one to someone else, Rob, but not to the 2300 here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sell|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Is anyone monitoring the table?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Muller fell asleep our operator tells me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can happen|pg||
nt|nubmaster: hahaha... sure :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|nubmaster: ?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bobholl: flawless:) |pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h and 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: then he would need to fall back on @ds|pg||
nt|rhelle:  now a @h?|pg||
nt|lml: things are looking up|pg||
nt|lml: a club is fine too|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think it needs to be a @h|pg||
nt|lml: I dont see more than 4 tricks after a club|pg||
nt|lml: 4 trump tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: any card actually -- he can't possibly make it now|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, that's true, he only has 6 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: the @H K is dead|pg||
nt|lml: like cribbage... 8 tricks and the rest dont mix|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Muller is now mentally scanning every card combination|pg||
nt|lml: he did well to find the club play that lead to this ending|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is the thing with Muller|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I've played with him on a few occasions|pg||
nt|lml: I like it when you play slow good bridge|pg||
nt|xenya: so where did he go wrong? or was it just a misfortune?|pg||
nt|lml: it si slow bad bridge that gets me|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and he thinks for an eternity, but you know that he then almost always does the right thing|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and as a partner, that is very comforting|pg||
nt|rhelle:  what is even more fun is to falsecard a little - and that really tortures him :)|pg||
nt|lml: when a partner like muller takes a long time on defense I try to use it productively|pg||
nt|justin c: at the moment, i think he is choosing between 6 right things to do|pg||
nt|xenya: of course he could have cashed @H early|pg||
nt|xenya: @HK|pg||
nt|justin c: suspect he will continue a @C here|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I have had conversations with him, what he is thinking about|pg||
nt|justin c: (not knowing the relative size of the missing trumps)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and it defies belief ... the depth of his analysis|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure what declarer's plan was|pg||
nt|lml: he didn't want West in, I get that|pg||
nt|xenya: then he would have made it on a crossruff it seems|pg||
nt|rhelle:  of course, declarer could have 5@s and 2@d ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Play finished in the open room; cards were easier to bid and play there|pg||
nt|lml: if he was going to play clubs right away anyway maybe he should have ducked the @cq|pg||
nt|daman: sominex coup    put everyone to sleep and make a false claim, which is accepted|pg||
nt|lml: I do like the idea of cashing the hearts early and then playing a crossruff.  No suit seems likely to set up and you were given those beautiful spade spots|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he's thinking for over 10 mins now ... it does take some time|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they may lose the match on penalty IMPs :)|pg||
nt|justin c: contemplated the merits of each card for a minute and a half|pg||
nt|lml: this is how I think you should play this hand... I have heard many opinions from specs... I may be wrong but here goes|pg||
nt|daman: maybe the operator fell asleep waiting for them|pg||
nt|lml: duck the opening club lead|pg||
nt|lml: win the opening club lead|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: ultra hard|pg||
nt|lml: there is no good answer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|justin c: not off yet, can still make if @D come in or N can be squeezed in minors|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: it is a hard hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nubmaster: Think the operator felt asleep to?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: @c won't matter as well|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: now the @C on the table pls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: he thought for 10 minutes and discarded @HQ?|pg||
nt|haans: doyou know why they have clock in chess once upon the time players  was waiting waiting waiting. Then one said What by turn?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @DQ even|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice play|pg||
nt|niekbrink: play a spade|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|justin c: well, the last time muller thought for this long he eventually emerged with the least appealing card in his hand|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think that is a sensible defence - cash 3rd trick, and hope partner has a trump trick|pg||
nt|lml: he had a pretty good count|pg||
nt|aupillon: common sense you said, Rob|pg||
nt|lml: declarer had 5H, 4S and 2-2|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that I'm not sure about ... I think the problem was 4 or 5 @s in the South hand|pg||
nt|lml: so @DA and a heart pretty well guaranteed down 1|pg||
nt|lml: wouldnt he open 1@S with 5-5|pg||
nt|lml: oh dear|pg||
nt|lml: sorry everyone|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chmitty: I am suggested to send him a SMS ... who's got his number ?|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|nubmaster: we will be backing here I guess|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: he has a safety as long as @s's are 3-2|pg||
nt|niekbrink: pitch your diamond on the heart|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lml: I kept getting mixed up|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|niekbrink: well done|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: safety play in @Ss -- declarer didn't want to see E win the !Q and return a @H|pg||

nt|nubmaster: last one|pg||
nt|justin c: another slam hand|pg||
nt|nubmaster: when in doubt, bid 3NT...|pg||
nt|werge: No big cake here|pg||
nt|hantveit: Last hand arriving, but we have not score from the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: Eugenio did we jump to bd 20? |pg||
nt|sybarra: "sorry pard" |pg||
nt|sybarra: says W |pg||
nt|patricck: VERY sorry pard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR, N chose to bid 2@d over NT and allowed room for E/W to explore for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would also have interpreted 5@H as looking for spade control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bid 4@S first, then 5@H over 5mi, and you show a spade ctrl yourself|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems logical|pg||
nt|athene: only 76 imps changed hands so far :( we need action!|pg||
nt|hantveit: If they bid 5 clubs on board 8 this will start to look like a kill...|pg||
nt|bobholl: SMS is a lot cheaper :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i hope tarzan won't reach 6 @H roughly on a finesse :)|pg||
nt|justin c: anyway, no @C ruff, no problem|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No sorry JS wins last one|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Best play in hearts is Ace or Queen first then the void shows you can finesse|pg||
nt|jcwla: Was down 2 in OR so 2 to the Dutch.|pg||
nt|lml: hey Muller Sominex coup|pg||
nt|lml: coup'd me|pg||
nt|lml: that is a first|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 6 imps, so the margin has narrowed to 2|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  this set of boards seem to have escaped most logic however:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: well ... nowdays low cost companies take you to San Remo for the price of only a few SMS|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Only one card that made a difference no wonder he took so long to find it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least Muller can't do damage with those tram tickets one would think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: on a good day slam makes, but not today|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'll bid 1@h here|pg||
nt|yuval10: not 2-suiter|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jeanhari: so v Prooijen took his 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @cs were 3-1...was never making unless E held stiff 10@c|pg||
nt|raghavan: Dear friends we are having the last deal of this session Our Thanks to sweet kibits, co commentators Andy and Williams, VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO Tx again|pg||
nt|bobholl: it almost already is :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you partial Bob? :)|pg||
nt|snorris: this looks like rutine 4 @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he may get into trouble|pg||
nt|yuval10: but South doesn't think like me|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: lookd like an easy 4@s on NS with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: @S 2-2, how could they know in OR?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I told them|pg||
nt|werge: Nice man, Wald|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I sdaid: this grand slam makes 4 times out of 10, this is one of the 4|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 18 - only a very good defense could defeat 4@H - played by S a winner - By N @SJ to q and K - AND @S2 back to !10 and now ! = -1|pg||
nt|nubmaster: some action here? NS make 5@c...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If W believes in banging down aces, this could be a Roland Slam.|pg||
nt|sybarra: it wasnt the worse overcall in the world |pg||
nt|justin c: a team trailing by 20+ might try 6@S here|pg||
nt|mowen: not a bad 6@S especially by north|pg||
nt|snorris: I will get some coffee..|pg||
nt|lml: well whatever east-west did they won 12 imps|pg||
nt|rhelle:  a pretty aggressive weak 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: my prediction is 4@Hx down a lot:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: looks....|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it comes....|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: 3@S I propose|pg||
nt|hantveit: there it is, 2nt -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: but on this hand it was |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now. Many thanks to Eugenio, our splendid operator in Sanremo. Well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@s on previous board over 6@h might only go down 1100 as one spec points out|pg||
nt|ritong: it did in an other romm|pg||
nt|athene: ok last board now|pg||
nt|ritong: room*  helness finished the hand hooking the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H= spades|pg||
nt|athene: (X would be hearts)|pg||
nt|bobholl: you mean i hope the dutch win YYEESS|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|justin c: increasingly popular method|pg||
nt|hedyg: slightly..|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: OK - let´s see it this way. Do´nt bid too GOOD at this board|pg||
nt|werge: 2 NT? Do they play 18-20...?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Shirley Ybarra, Andy Vinock, Patrick Carter and Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to our operator Eugenio, and also the EBL and FIGB for bringing us this event|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like a routine 4@H |pg||
nt|rhelle:  Now it is West to play .. .this may be quicker|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, Muller may bid something... he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: otherwise N might pass|pg||
nt|rnc: He took your advise!|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you |pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 2S made +2 =170|pg||
nt|buddyshah: make or break?|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes... almost|pg||
nt|bobholl: they reached 4@S doubled :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  East of course isn't too worried, he has an easy escape to 2@c|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but for South this is tricky ... partner may have a 0 count|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and only 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S -- some kind of transfer?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: i think its a transfer to 1nt|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting bidding problem for natural bidders...supposed S opens 1@d and W overcalled, what do you do with N?|pg||
nt|henryb: double? by Muller?|pg||
nt|gulyas: what is Wijs thinking abt? trying to find a calculator?:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: Niek Brink has mentioned that the dutch pairs are playing those sequences differently|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: hahaha... but they needed that one though... could be 13 imp here|pg||
nt|hantveit: A desperate invite?|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, but West must at least have considered a double instead|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it's played a lot these days|pg||
nt|hedyg: denies 3cards in @s i suppose|pg||
nt|lml: it is not my kind of weak 2 but at least it gets the auction over fast|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nubmaster: Are they playing lebesohl here?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe X was better |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c that is|pg||
nt|mowen: they will get to 6 now i think|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 3 diamonds probably shows shortness|pg||
nt|justin c: aggressive?  Some of Brink's have been positively warmongering|pg||
nt|jcwla: It will play out badly here because of the trump break but I like the 2NT - get it all in in one fell swoop and eat up some room.|pg||
nt|yuval10: X would be - i want to play 5@d whereas pass means i don't want to|pg||
nt|henryb: and how do you say "I want to punish 4H?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: north could just have bid 2@C over 1@S, showing a good heart raise, surely?|pg||
nt|andyv:  good brakes|pg||
nt|hantveit: The kill is on...|pg||
nt|athene: i should have thought those diamonds were worth a rebid|pg||
nt|mamos: same auction as open|pg||
nt|lml: Popov really doesnt want a club|pg||
nt|justin c: y, EW put a premium on speed|pg||
nt|lml: this is why I don't like 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: I have useful high cards and terrible hearts|pg||
nt|lml: the only good thing is the heart spots|pg||
nt|aupillon: and so it was... See you Thursday. By all, and sorry Roland....|pg||
nt|daman: oh no   another tank|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: he even herd me|pg||
nt|brolucius: With spades agreed, instead of hearts as in the other room, N-S will surely identify that the queen of trumps is missing.|pg||
nt|werge: Bad luck to pay 13 IMP here - maybe|pg||
nt|justin c: the trouble with agreeing @S is that you get to find out the @SQ is missing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: obviously not...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2NT with only 18? Is that in the system?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finally, our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match today in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I always find it hard to criticise the guys out there ... they are world class players, under tremendous pressure|pg||
nt|niekbrink: specs telling me 1s just denies 4+ spades|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told it shows no more than 3@S and 6+ hcp -- thanks all|pg||
nt|jbgood: then you dance a passo double |pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: it never happened to them, i guess :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then you have to say DOUBLE real loud:) and shove the tray with full force:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't like bidding 2NT with intermediates value|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rhelle:  well bid ... but not laydown |pg||
nt|niekbrink: at least they are telling us the same...:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: E didn't X 2@h - will it prevent W from leading it?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphztj: had some problem with bbo server|pg||
nt|haans: looks like it|pg||
nt|sybarra: Last board now. Many thanks, to our excellent operator in Eugenio.  A job well done as always!|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  declarer is looking at 2 trump, 1c and 1@d loser|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and needs to get rid of them, maintain communication, draw trumps and discard losing @ds|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so there is serious work to do, and he needs to do it all in the right order|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 imps gained by Angelini on nice defence to 4@sx in OR.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Maybe he should take, discard a @c on the 2nd spade, and duck a @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing defense i would say !|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs seem to think declarer play had a lot to do with the result on 21:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he forgot to play trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  details details|pg||
nt|andyv:  first 3 tricks look easy on this hand..then come the headaches|pg||
nt|hedyg: play 2@ss and @d?|pg||
nt|justin c: declarer can ruff 2@D here i think, and still just about stay in control of everything|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm not sure what the best line is|pg||
nt|niekbrink: no|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be interesting to watch|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the CR N bid 2@c in the sequence i've mentioned|pg||
nt|niekbrink: what is the right line for 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|xenya: on the surface, this looks makeable|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: so a flat boars. Thanks all and see you again 17.30  CET|pg||
nt|april7: bye all untill next we meet|pg||
nt|ralfwil: board... I have to change keyboard to a one with better spelling|pg||
nt|rnc: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right there|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Hans and  Patrick.  Great fun guys and thanks for  important insights on these hands. |pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
nt|patricck: a pleasure, very interesting set|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @sQ lead now|pg||
nt|mowen: how long for east to lead?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph!  (he has to herd us cats ---commentators I mean) |pg||
nt|andyv:  6@s?|pg||
nt|bobholl: with another nice win|pg||
nt|hantveit: More pain arriving here|pg||
nt|oliverc: If Declarer finesses everything in sight, this is easy enough|pg||
nt|justin c: is it my imagination, or did welland show the @SQ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, def. can't take more than 2@c, 1@h and 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: i like my 2-suiter overcalls as 17+ or sub-opening|pg||
nt|henryb: I would feel naked without the ability to say "I do not think you can make this" in at least some situations|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, thats a good treatment generally I hear|pg||
nt|jbgood: some like the mother  - other prefer the daughter - I like them both, so i also like 2 NT:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: The old start paso doble'ing then claim "I was just stretching, my leg was asleep" routine - we're all on to that by now...|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think this conversation goes beyond the topics of this site:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: as always..|pg||
nt|henryb: what I miss is verbal bidding: "you bid what? 4@H?? well I ddddouble that!"|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6 more imps for the Dutch on 25|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Israelis stretched to game and went down|pg||
nt|jcwla: As someone said they believe in playing game.  Usually a good approach but not on these last two hands.|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, on the NS hands, 4@H doesn't look that tragic|pg||
nt|henryb: I have observed before that I believe people stretch too far in the modern game, and that many many imps are available by being a little conservative|pg||
nt|gulyas: if the trumps were 3-2, and @Cs 3-3, you would claim 10 tricks very fast|pg||
nt|yuval10: it'd still be a bad game that happenes to make|pg||
nt|henryb: another 20% chance|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: sorry but Muller thinck 10 minutes every card |pg||
nt|gulyas: true, but these players like those prospects - if you don't bid a vul game, you will never gain the game bonus|pg||
nt|henryb: fair enough; turtlish|pg||
nt|jbgood: getting close to snailish now..|pg||
nt|henryb: and they remember the 10 imp gains on two boardt and forget the 6 imp losses on eight|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: we have all seen 'unmakable' games make, even if they could be beaten, see the 4@Sx hand earlier this set|pg||
nt|henryb: "Look at this board, Joe. We bid 4@s and I made it on a strip-squeeze."|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: and what other choices he has |pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace did not think so, he knows his pd has @ss|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dblt @d may help declarer|pg||
nt|rhelle:  if East continues to play @cs, West may ruff high at some point and promote the @h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  dblton in E hand |pg||
nt|mowen: quite quick|pg||
nt|lml: thanks Joey Silver for this line ... the other good thing about 2@H was the flop|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so, 4d, 2c, 1h, 2 s for declarer?|pg||
nt|xenya: actually any reasonable line will result in 9 tricks here i think|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nubmaster: a good convention to be used at this board, then south maybe can go further with 4@c|pg||
nt|oliverc: none|pg||
nt|oliverc: 10@C now might induce a misguess|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnc: Bye and thanks|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play the @SK and the @SJ or @SQ falls from East, you can follow Restricted Choice by finessing the @S10, which increases your chances slightly from that of a 2-2 break. |pg||
nt|patricck: This will drop Romania out of the qualifying places, but they still have time to recover..... Angelini should be able to breathe easy for the last two qualifying matches after this ...|pg||
nt|patricck: win|pg||
nt|buddyshah: loos like this board will hurt texas the most  along with 6@C|pg||
nt|chmitty: another push probably here|pg||
nt|chmitty: Open room already playing board 26 ... an interesting one believe me|pg||
nt|snorris: if north is promissing good hand 12+hp they might be haeding for trouble.. 5@s isnt sure|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|werge: IF  E/W has a 3 NT here - then East has NOT a 1 NT-opening!|pg||
nt|ady: no problems here  J@S  down in 2   and K@D laying well|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth but i don't believe it would|pg||
nt|justin c: somebody needs to put the brakes on|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rhelle:  well, that may well decide the match ...|pg||
nt|xenya: you can start with @Ds or @Cs -- doesn't seem to matter much here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oliverc: Declarer will surely finesse in Clubs if left to their own devices|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  we got our wish... no push boards:)|pg||
nt|ritong: with diego and irene at the same table, push boards are as rare as snow in springtime|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not unless we are both imagining it|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|niekbrink: safe stop now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: why not? - even oif N has a semi-positiv hand, there are long way to 5@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: and that is BAD news for him|pg||
nt|athene: four small clubs are bad news in 2@D if they lead trumps (which they surely will)|pg||
nt|justin c: @SAK pitching a @C, then @DA and another maybe|pg||
nt|niekbrink: in the open room declarer somewhere set up the spades for the defense before they got their 2 clubtricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: now W should play back @s|pg||
nt|xenya: it's a finesse hand|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally, cards are quite friendly for declarer here|pg||
nt|henryb: "But John, what about board three where you were -800?" "It was unlucky, trumps were 4-1 and a finesse was off."|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like -2 now|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: could've been worse|pg||
nt|yuval10: but still a bad result to show to your team mates|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, @DA a good play now|pg||
nt|henryb: a third diamond before releasing the @cA might have been even better|pg||
nt|yuval10: we'll see how the Israelis will manage the defense, as they play the same contract in the OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 tricks played already? what is the average time per trick so far?|pg||
nt|gulyas: they should have a timer, like in snooker:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: some commentators have fallen asleep|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: still 22 minutes |pg||
nt|gulyas: I am keeping myself awake by trying to figure out hot go only 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: they must play 6 boards |pg||
nt|jbgood: and those still awake  wish they had fallen asleep|pg||
nt|gulyas: *how|pg||
nt|gulyas: ruff this in hand, discarding a @C, @S to A, @CK, ruff and overruff with the 10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh, hi.  What's happened?  Nothing?  Oh, OK.|pg||
nt|gulyas: @SK, @HA, and no way to get to dummy without getting overruffed:(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: might have had been more difficult with clubs 4-3 and the 8 with west|pg||
nt|Walddk4: we have snow in april|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 of @D !|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and claim|pg||
nt|yuval10: even now, declarer can still make it|pg||
nt|niekbrink: but declarer now has to play on hearts and diamonds instead of clubs|pg||
nt|niekbrink: east wil set up his spades if declarer double finesses clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: thx also to the specs,  helpful comments and funny also |pg||
nt|sybarra: we should be back shortly |pg||
nt|snorris: nervous Niek?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hantveit: well, you migh be lucky. Can have AKfifth in clubs, dia A and heart A|pg||
nt|aupillon: Thanks all. Not convincing...Let's see later :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: Thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @C now |pg||
nt|bobholl: coming from E i mean |pg||
nt|bobholl: K better :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems to me S will have count of the W hand |pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: maybe as rare as snow in the sahara|pg||
nt|andyv:  keeping entries to spade suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now need @d switch?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Yes, @d switch looks obvious to kill communiucation|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Yeah, it's on the cusp both ways.|pg||
nt|athene: Denmark exports snow to other european countries who need it|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, so your scorebaords often look like 6/4 with 20 bgoards played|pg||
nt|rhelle:  note also that West played his highest @s - not count, but Lavinthal|pg||
nt|bobholl: Q of @H |pg||
nt|chessmaste: The solution is to call a monitor the first time East is slow to make sure any penalty at the end is correctly  assessed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: scheduled time is 7:15 am Los Angeles, 10:15 am New York, 16.15 Paris, 3:15 pm London, 12:15 am Monday Sydney|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|nubmaster: thanks for now... see you in a while again|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: 46% chance of making 5 spade tricks ... which would increase to 57% if one of them held the @sJ|pg||
nt|nubmaster: He did because he ahve 3 and took a chance probably... against possible 6 at Zia|pg||
nt|niekbrink: of course|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nubmaster: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: extra entr disappeared however |pg||
nt|ady: can make 10 now|pg||
nt|ady: unless diamond switch|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last bd here |pg||
nt|sybarra: . Many thanks, to our excellent operator in Eugenio.  A job well done as always!|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ducking is great play|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h now|pg||
nt|yuval10: and makes|pg||
nt|niekbrink: heart is the best|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, he needs a @H trick to make|pg||
nt|yuval10: down now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|bobholl: what if partner has J of @C ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: oh|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@h now|pg||
nt|yuval10: not that it matters much....|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, wow, he played several cards in a row|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Hans Sjostrom (SWE), David Edwin (GB) and Jean Harings (NL) .  We appreciate your time and important insights on these hands.  Always a fun ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: discussion. |pg||
nt|justin c: 'there are no bad hands, only bad flops'|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|yuval10: now he's making|pg||
nt|xenya: and he can't play a @D|pg||
mc|8|nt|haans: And I would also like to thank Shirley Ybarra and Jean Harings my  co-commentator |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@d would have allowed @H discard|pg||
nt|yuval10: hand plays itself now|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure the @S finesse was the right play though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and that's the best answer for the 100001 messages i got that told me that declarer can't make :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: if west returns a club, you duck. east plays a diamond and you set up a spade|pg||
nt|gulyas: 500 in the OR|pg||
pg||

nt|niekbrink: imps is not correct...no plural....|pg||
nt|snorris: sorry :)|pg||
nt|snorris: imp..|pg||
nt|jcwla: like moose?|pg||
nt|lml: I do love bidding 4@H on Muller's hand.  One day I will make that bid and the opponents will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|justin c: (some poker player)|pg||
nt|daman: 4 more hands|pg||
nt|yuval10: the contract was ALWAYS MAKES|pg||
nt|gulyas: same here|pg||
nt|gulyas: phew|pg||
nt|jcwla: So the fifth push in ten boards in the first 2 hours of this segment.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oliverc: West has to try something to mislead Declarer there|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hantveit: I do not understand why dbl. NS is in the floating zone and partners says with 4sp he has zip. Do you really think 5 clubs is -2 after that?|pg||
nt|bobholl: than you know you did the rigth thing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria is certainly one of the best declarers in the world|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-15 NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt was not the best contract !!|pg||
nt|justin c: I would have thought that you wanted a 10 card fit to try that |pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@s appears to have 4 losers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10-44 now|pg||
nt|mowen: is this the last set?|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@S|pg||
nt|niekbrink: penalty double by west?|pg||
nt|daman: salami for EW here|pg||
nt|daman: grand salami|pg||
nt|yuval10: Grand Roland Salami|pg||
nt|rhelle:  impossible to bid 7 .. rewuires a 2-2 trump break|pg||
nt|daman: nah   this one is cold   his are never cold|pg||
mb|d|nt|chmitty: If Allavena looks at his score sheet now, he probably believes his team is still a lot upfront|pg||
nt|bobholl: helness forcing a little bit in open|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe liked his @C suit|pg||
nt|chmitty: another stop ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT was very close to making|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oliverc: agreed|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room stayed in 4@S X so almost even now |pg||
nt|hedyg: looked like a @c trick still for Versace there|pg||
nt|hedyg: no +1|pg||
nt|hedyg: just =|pg||
nt|hedyg: (for the newcomers)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Yes ... 4 boards to go|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think so..:)|pg||
nt|snorris: east is thinking 7..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm sorry, no clue what 2@d means|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|justin c: likely headed to 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: he might go 4@C now|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe not with void|pg||
nt|athene: but i think, assuming 2@S was limited, slam is unlikely|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c is an option?|pg||
nt|athene: he definitely won't want to go to the 5-level, surely?|pg||
nt|mamos: fit jump?|pg||
nt|lml: this hand is such a perfector it is hard to get to slam without a lot of help|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would like to see them come close to slam after a 11-15 opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: 4spades now|pg||
nt|snorris: and if invited.. west might accept|pg||
nt|jcwla: the layouts have not been dull in this set|pg||
nt|snorris: difficult to bid this one..for e-w|pg||
nt|justin c: 4-1 @S break not so nice for 7@S|pg||
nt|snorris: no..kills it|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe East will just jump to slam|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to see what else he can do here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: how about @SA lead, @H to @HA, and another @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did bid 4@c but doesnt like it :)|pg||
nt|justin c: play could turn nasty for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: versace has the stiff @SA again but he won't be able to discard it, as he did last hand|pg||
nt|mowen: so miracles required for Welland|pg||
nt|rhelle:  well the @hAce lead worked on te previouis board ... will East try that again?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: with no @c lead there's a chance, small @s first and then ace and then dias to discard...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Ah - I hear a good hand with 3@h|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|lml: to show a good raise|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Steve Martin once said three hours into the Academy Awards, "We're almost halfway through, folks."|pg||
nt|yuval10: -1, it looks like|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: YES :(|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if W leads @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he doesn't.....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: @S A is difficult on this bidding :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It is kind of understandable after the 2C overcall|pg||
nt|snorris: might be the best solution..instead of muddeling the waters anymore|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: will they find the @C ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: wooooo|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
nt|bobholl: would be good for tension is !!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oliverc: 2 chances to find it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1st one missed :)|pg||
nt|lml: 3@s is a great bid|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: xx now first round control (i think)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: no, doesnt work here...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @h2 for a @c switch|pg||
nt|nubmaster: was distracted by a phoe call, sorry|pg||
nt|mowen: west asked for a club|pg||
nt|rhelle:  The first semi finalist is Vito ... 96:33|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR there were two times @d leads so decl could discard dummys @h|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Muller is thinkngi whether a @c switch can wait, or not ...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I have many comments ... it's either @s or good @h :)|pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know what any of this means, but it looks like they are trying for slam|pg||
nt|gulyas: at least Muller was awake, and did not play low, thinking declarer has the singleton A:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with @c lead declarer has no entry to dummy to dispose his @h over the A@c|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless its covered:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: so the only lead to give the contract away is @d or....K@c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|oliverc: only 1 missed. Declarer can get a @C away on the K@H now|pg||
nt|snorris: 4nt :rkcb?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think they play transfers over overcalls|pg||
nt|lml: apparently 2@d only promised two card heart support but 3@S obviously upped the ante |pg||
nt|justin c: if any of it has told east that west has long clubs, and/or short spades, they might get there|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so in that case it would show a raise in @h, invite or better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Muller can't know anything about the source of tricks in clubs. Could be diamonds which would not be as good|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so 2@d = @h|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 3@s splinter|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@c and 4@d cues|pg||
nt|lml: West must be loving his hand in this auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: now XX showed 1st round control|pg||
nt|justin c: looks that way|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle:  3@d = super max with 4 trumps and short in @d|pg||
nt|justin c: E breaking the transfer with a good hand for @S|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@h = re transfer|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: slow again :(|pg||
nt|athene: surely XX from south wld be @CA? wonder why not|pg||
nt|justin c: because south has it :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess he wanted to see what N could bid|pg||
nt|niekbrink: what suit is trumps|pg||
nt|snorris: 5@hs for the Q of @s|pg||
nt|justin c: now asking for @SQ (i think)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: where is this gonna end?|pg||
nt|snorris: a spec predicts 6nt in west..|pg||
nt|snorris: and he should know..knows these guys well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hantveit: North can see that partner needs spade K or club A to take the contract down|pg||
nt|justin c: is the @C lead a bit strange with north known to be void?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Any bidding suggestions for E/W after 3H?|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking about 5NT bid|pg||
nt|rhelle:  It seems I was wrong ... 2@d = @cs, |pg||
pc|c6|nt|yuval10: def. should find the @d ruff |pg||
nt|xenya: now that EW haven't found 2 @D ruffs, it's only -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if they don't the contract isn't rate to make|pg||
nt|xenya: but they need to find at least 1 ruff or it will make|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably @SA now, if its 3-1, he is gome|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  OR in 4@h on  24|pg||
nt|hedyg: N opened 2@H|pg||
nt|mamos: i think thats a bit unlucky for ew|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have the ace|pg||
nt|athene: well, the double of 4@C doesn't look so great at this point, but of course west's alternative lead was a diamond, which also wouldn't work so well|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace doesnt know|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and that means the East hand is now looking very good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What can you say other than well done|pg||
nt|gulyas: and nothing he can do abt 4-0|pg||
pc|d2|nt|justin c: afraid i dont know - i would have thought 6@D to show the @DK@SQ|pg||
nt|niekbrink: nice!!!|pg||
nt|lml: okay... spec said otherwise but they might be right|pg||
nt|justin c: very well done|pg||
nt|daman: 13 to EW|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is a 27 IMP lead with 3 to play|pg||
nt|lml: not a claimer but everything works|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: good slam|pg||
nt|rhelle:  downside is that Muller plays it|pg||
nt|justin c: i am told this is the only pair in the semis to bid this one so far|pg||
nt|justin c: so chalk one up for the Tarzan club system I guess :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I just heard that the last two hands were not good for NL|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Muller is trying to guard against bad breaks now|pg||
nt|gulyas: sneaky play:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|snorris: this was not good..for e-w|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Look out below, 'cause here we go!"|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|justin c: that would be an unlikely splinter raise tho with @CA|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: makes now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|niekbrink: sorry, the nice was very rude|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: T@h should perhaps indicate that he wants @d back|pg||
nt|yuval10: as well as the fact he didn't play @d again|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: even though his partner encouraged it by playing small|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: well it did take him a long time|pg||
nt|gulyas: he still needs to extract some trumps somehow|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: im told 3@H was gf five cards  - uses up a lot of bidding space|pg||
nt|niekbrink: just a bit of  excitement here....|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North is messing with declarer's head by playing the â¥J|pg||
nt|lml: that should slow things down|pg||
nt|justin c: north should consider all of us before doing that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4569  Bauke Muller ... if you get Service Unavailable, it's because of too many hits|pg||
nt|rhelle:  declarer needs to set up the @cs, but hasn't got that many entries|pg||
nt|Walddk4: surely a slow response to the web site is what you expect for Muller, a rude spectator suggests|pg||
nt|lml: be right back |pg||
nt|rhelle:  so can he do it if @h are 3-1 and the @cs don't break?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is what he is no doubt thinking about|pg||
nt|daman: Muller in the tank is not a good thing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: warum so langsam? is it allowed to bore your opponents into submission? by the time we see his picture he will be 10 years older  ... are just some of the private messages I am ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: getting at the moment|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think a safe line is @cAce, @c|pg||
nt|daman: we can time his next play with a sundial|pg||
nt|justin c: should play on @C now i think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is an unknown circle in hell (in Dante's Divine Comedy) where slow bridge players are sent for eternity, and they have to sit and watch Muller thinking|pg||
nt|justin c: I am unreliably informed that he is a muller because he likes to mull over things|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Muller of course also knows that South has 5â  or more|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Just suppose that the score are close at the end and there are slow play penalties - who will get them?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5+â , 3â¥ ... that makes the chance of a bas â£ break much larger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You Mark, you are slow|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think both parties were equally slow|pg||
nt|lml: if you are going to spend time thinking then a vulnerable slam seems the time|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and I'm not biased at all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: who is on lead, a very funny spectator asking|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: he is regretting the @SA play now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hantveit: Well played by West|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's making the contract, i don't think he's regreting anything here :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he is home, if E overruffs, he only gets another trump, if he doesn't, declarer plays a trump off dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|gulyas: OK, I guess its Wijs who is regretting something:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hantveit: Another 8 on board 8. Everything is going wrong for Zimmermanns|pg||
nt|oliverc: A situation where opening with the A@S might give you a chance to spot the right|pg||
nt|oliverc: continuation|pg||
nt|snorris: family is family..|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|nt|bobholl: first good(reasonable) board for zimmerman|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|justin c: East playing West for a huge hand with @C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: at least the claim will be fast....|pg||
nt|yuval10: now J@d and claim|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hantveit: but is it too late?|pg||
nt|justin c: do i detect a sudden change in tempo?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sure, there are penalties for time violation, but it matters little if they have not been monitored and they both say that the other side spent most of the time|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 8 tricks i think, so 5 more imps to the good guys :) (sorry Israel...)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: that makes it 25 imps in a row in the last 4 deals|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|oliverc: it'll be flat, though, I suspect|pg||
nt|oliverc: very difficult for North to lead the K@C at trick 1 :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: wd stay in 4@S and make overtrick :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play negative free bids you have to |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If 3H doesn't show a diamond fit then W really has no choice|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good defence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10-56|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @s e-w is the place to be|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then the TD doesn't know who to believe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and he will give them 100 each :)|pg||
nt|justin c: couple of thousand witnesses here if needed|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a routine game for NS|pg||
nt|gulyas: this should bring 10 imps to the Herbst team|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: milano is leading by 19 imps against the dutch in the women's, and miroglio by 45 against bulgaria and the seniors|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s from N now?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rhelle:  4@s has definite chances ... and I think they'll bid this|pg||
nt|jcwla: So only 3 to the Dutch there despite the accident.|pg||
nt|yuval10: Roland will bid ( and make ) 6@s from S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 17 boards 33 imps not impossible but difficult :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@H = Weak both Majors, I presume|pg||
nt|hantveit: If you are so "lucky" that you have one of the best players in the world on your team, just ask where he wants to sit..|pg||
nt|bobholl: reach wrong fit now ?|pg||
nt|oliverc: lol, yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: the poles probably would have had a bid to show the 2 suiter|pg||
nt|snorris: and 4@hs..|pg||
nt|niekbrink: and another exciting board now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: lebensohlish 3 @D now ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Interesting 2@S call|pg||
nt|Walddk4: C + H  or  D + S|pg||
nt|lml: CRASH type bid|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that will make South happy - guaranteed fit somewhere|pg||
nt|rhelle:  East temoted to bid 3NT no doubt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  tempted|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least they right-sided diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: For all the Israelis who's flooding me with questions regarding the Herbsts - they've won their match, 98:50|pg||
nt|justin c: both East and west can chance a guess at North's 2 suits|pg||
nt|justin c: unclear whether south can tho|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 4h from N now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@h as a play, but that's the problem with pre-emptive bids...|pg||
nt|yuval10: *has|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: I have been begging him to play a tourney with me for months now, looks like I will get a lucky break in Sep/Oct|pg||
nt|hedyg: major accident in OR on bd 10|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @ds might push e.w overboard|pg||
nt|yuval10: and will play in the finals tomorrow at 11:30 , Israel time|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Even though he knows it's @css and @hs, stilll ...|pg||
nt|justin c: Will south jump here?|pg||
nt|lml: he could bid 4@S I suppose|pg||
nt|lml: but he is sort of vulnerable|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So is his partner who bid 2@S|pg||
nt|niekbrink: spec suggest 4 diamonds should show 6 spades 4h now....|pg||
nt|yuval10: really? and the next time i'll have 5-5 major? :)|pg||
nt|xenya: don't think N will bid now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: Texan Aces are through, and so are Ned White|pg||
nt|Walddk4: along with Vito|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the last semi-finalist will be Herbst|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S looks hopeless, 3 aces and a trump to lose|pg||
nt|rhelle:  sorry - of course 4S has no chance, 3 aces and a trump trick|pg||
nt|justin c: he is indeed sort of vulnerable|pg||
nt|yuval10: other human beings will settle for 4@s from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: EW have found their Spade fit but may wish they hadnt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2NT is no doubt a value raise to 3@h|pg||
nt|justin c: still might try 3@S, to play there or 4@C|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@s shows 5-8 with 6+@s|pg||
nt|lml: One of the spec's asked who Ned White was?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|justin c: is this a penalty double, or a transfer to @C i wonder?|pg||
nt|lml: anyone tell us about him|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: 3nt anyone?|pg||
nt|justin c: (the first x)|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@HX would collect a few|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems to be pen|pg||
nt|athene: X of 1NT is surely penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: X of 2@S t/o|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West may be considering 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: but he did!|pg||
nt|niekbrink: than you bid 4h, or overcall 4d immediately|pg||
nt|yuval10: another big board for the dutchs here|pg||
nt|niekbrink: it seems 4h has play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: 2NT must be lebensohl, rather than scramble|pg||
nt|niekbrink: very well done by EW, stopping in 4 h|pg||
nt|justin c: two @S and a ruff, but thats all for NS|pg||
nt|lml: this should end it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ned White is short for Nederland White|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They have many teams with different colours attached|pg||
nt|lml: ah|pg||
nt|justin c: Ned is going to be fine in 5@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: where @d lead will limit declarer for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: is Roland's nickname GIB?:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oliverc: depends on what options North has over 2@S, I guess. If they don't play Lebensohl|pg||
nt|oliverc: here, difficult for South to push over 3@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @D isn't much better than 3 NT but migth make|pg||
nt|oliverc: North is a passed hand, after all|pg||
nt|hantveit: if 3 d is lebensohl, I think I would bid 3nt.|pg||
nt|bobholl: S will come to the rescue :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South has a good hand now - too strong to pass 2H|pg||
nt|mamos: North knows oppo have -3 fit|pg||
nt|mamos: 5-3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: specs who know say not pen|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Or not|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes ... I don't understand 3@d, the hand looks far too weak for a forward gonig bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: sometimes its amazing how these machines work these things out, I remember a hand in Beijing, where it took our whole team at least a half an hour to figure out a given number of ...|pg||
nt|gulyas: tricks:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: um...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  it's played by West, of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the three colours of the Dutch flag (red, white and blue)|pg||
nt|lml: someone asked about why not play 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: Orange isn't one of their colours, too?|pg||
nt|gulyas: even double dummy it was hard, with best play and defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 to Herbst on 27 for that great low @D play.  Score has not been input but it's now 75-50.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hantveit: West might think I have good hearts, and with xx he might start with something else, like a club...:)|pg||
nt|oliverc: ok, but it NS are playing Lebensohl here, 3@D doesn't look right|pg||
nt|oliverc: if|pg||
nt|mamos: North obviously thought of doubling|pg||
nt|snorris: operator?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  He's a passed hand though|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
mc|11|nt|mamos: which probably should help declarer|pg||

nt|mamos: Club works best|pg||
nt|snorris: ah..|pg||

nt|bobholl: to say the least :)|pg||

nt|niekbrink: now we have a serious difference|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Dutch team is definately outplaying their opps now....|pg||
nt|yuval10: 38:0 lasr 5 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow, what a hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: more fun now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ooh - another gorgeous fit...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h by N probably?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: simple 3NT now|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@D is a nice place to be|pg||
nt|snorris: might even not be doubled!|pg||
nt|jcwla: So six more to Vito up ten with two to go.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wrong game in the other room. 4@H is the winner, so a chance for Bulgaria here|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S might be in danger if declarer has no quick entry to hand to draw trumps |pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  3NT will be difficult though - it is 25 HCP but not a good fit|pg||
nt|niekbrink: slam again|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@h i imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: 39 imps would be 25-5, but that dos not matter here. |pg||
pc|c4|nt|nubmaster: D showing xtra values here right... not 3c support on 3-level..|pg||
nt|justin c: headed to 6@H i think|pg||
nt|snorris: and a winning one|pg||
nt|niekbrink: but remember, we play 3x 16 today, so many boards to go to recover|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW can make up to 5@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: not much to the play here, especially not after the lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s's will go on the @c's and 11 tricks will be made|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: 1 1/2 NT now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes this might be a hand where game is just too difficult|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@S is good|pg||
pc|c2|nt|niekbrink: brave pass|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good pressure from E/W|pg||
nt|justin c: unless they decide that they dont need the trump queen again|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They endend in 7@c in OR...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: 1@c=16+ any|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: showing single @S i guess|pg||
nt|hantveit: Zimmermann won 21-9 over Monaco in the Swiss|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D is reasonable but @C wrong |pg||
nt|oliverc: At last Zimmerman gets on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|hantveit: In open the dec did not play D to ace and HK, and north found the killing club K|pg||
nt|snorris: 2@c game force?|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 2@d=8-12 balanced|pg||
nt|rhelle:  it seems the Dutch ladies team has made it to the final|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing here then|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|justin c: where every imp matters, 6NT by south is even nicer|pg||
nt|mamos: getting there now surely|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Semi-finalists Women: Joel (USA/GER), Dutch Blue (NED), F.I.G.B. Ladies (ITA), CBC Milano (ITA)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but they're Blue :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|justin c: i am very reliably informed (by Michael Rosenberg) that 6@C can make by endplaying W with fourth @S to lead away from the @HQ|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is a healthy swing back - and no 7@d save either|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: this could have been the 9th trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: played by E down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: Zia led 9@s|pg||
nt|bobholl: now choose for @D or @C 33 |pg||
nt|hedyg: which minor to attack?|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 keycard|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wouldn't dream of 2NT on 4144 |pg||
nt|justin c: onthe previous one, the raise to 4@D helped West to visualise the @D shortage opposite.  The raise to 3@D in the other room suggested @D losers opposite|pg||
nt|niekbrink: ducking costs an imp|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes, careless play as a @C ruff is the only real danger to 4@S there|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  2NT with North looks too much but it could make|pg||
nt|mamos: there certainy are ways that 3NT can be made|pg||
nt|bobholl: lot of possiblities|pg||
nt|snorris: probably|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and so have the Bulgarian seniors|pg||

nt|rhelle:  2@s from South?|pg||

nt|yuval10: N has a nice distribution but his @h void is definately a minus|pg||

nt|mamos: just result I mean I havent thought about best contract|pg||
nt|jcwla: So the Dutch up by 3 entering the last board of the first of two segments.  Thanks to Sergio, Roland, Snorri, Justin, Niek, and all specs - some great comments.|pg||
nt|daman: made it a bit closer but still need a good thing to happen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they can afford it|pg||
nt|lml: they did find it at the other table ... very well done|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR plays the good spot of 3@d|pg||
nt|jcwla: The odd boards have all been swings, the evens have all been pushes.|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW can make 4@H here, but after both passed, its not likely they will get there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yuval10: 18 imps = 1750 to 1990|pg||
nt|justin c: dont know where that double in the other room came from|pg||
nt|niekbrink: invitational with diamonds|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hantveit: Monaco picked up also on hand 12 as NS came in 4D-2|pg||

nt|justin c: Z can't like the looks of this one with the @H finesse known to be losing|pg||

nt|gulyas: thats odd, but the score is not even:)|pg||

nt|yuval10: N violated the so-called " rule of 15"|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|hantveit: I am informed that open room is in 3nt on board 13.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well done Monaco! A big upset|pg||
nt|athene: no problems in the play here|pg||
nt|athene: just go for clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will|pg||
nt|athene: you hope east will get strip-squeezed or something in the red suits, but you don't care that much|pg||
nt|justin c: East might decide that NS are prepared for a @S lead, and try a red suit instead|pg||
nt|hedyg: something like...J@D?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  6S looks worth bidding I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Restart in ..... well, your guess is as good as mine|pg||
nt|yuval10: Barel will have to find the @h shift|pg||
nt|niekbrink: on a club lead, EW have to hurry|pg||
nt|yuval10: after his natural @c lead|pg||
nt|niekbrink: spade shift will do the job probably as well|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will probably play 2nd @c back, he only needs one more trick after small @c lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: yes, people tend to lead the "other major" on these auctions|pg||
nt|justin c: im getting too old to try the @DJ :)|pg||
nt|athene: when partner didn't raise |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: well @H is weird when S is supposed to have them|pg||
nt|athene: south is more likely not to have four hearts if he is strong|pg||
mb|3H|nt|niekbrink: good decision by EW to let NS play|pg||
nt|justin c: speaking of bad breaks...|pg||
nt|yuval10: you add your HCP to the number of @s's you have in order to determine whether you open in 4th hand or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he will give away a few points for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 1NT 3nt very simple and efficient (@C the other way i wouldn't say that )|pg||
nt|athene: and he obviously is strong for 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: the deal generator decided this would be more fun if the trumps were 5-0|pg||
nt|snorris: though 3@ds will win but nothing in it for e-w|pg||
nt|jcwla: The perfect encapsulation of the segment in the 5-0 @D break...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but Barel leads the A, and that might give him time|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how it can be made -- barring a gross defensive error|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so 13 imps at stake, beating this 2 will give israel 6 imps, if its made it is 7 imps to the dutch|pg||
nt|yuval10: this isn't the last board, as we have 2 more for this session|pg||
nt|yuval10: as Niek mentioned, it's 16 X 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: am told that west opened in the other room|pg||
nt|yuval10: game over|pg||
nt|lml: it was played from the other side though so that helped|pg||
nt|rhelle:  absolutely ... superb bridge, even though it was a bit slow at times|pg||
nt|justin c: still doesnt seem that east is unduly burdened with defensive tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: a bit?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The understatement of the century|pg||
nt|yuval10: so tomorrow, at 10:30 AM local time ( 11:30 in Israel ) , NED. White VS Herbsts|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this lead will do nothing for the health of this contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|oliverc: ...and 12 tricks taken in 3NT to add insult to injury :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt better than 4 @H ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot be strong and have @hs?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 8 minutes according to the bulletin, but .....|pg||
nt|justin c: detrimental|pg||
nt|niekbrink: good switch|pg||
nt|niekbrink: but can east read it?|pg||
nt|xenya: a passive @D would have also  worked |pg||
nt|yuval10: if the number reachs 15 - you open. here he only has 13|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the !J located well, he will end up with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: @SJ, sry|pg||
nt|jcwla: Roland game.|pg||
nt|yuval10: much too good for Roland|pg||
nt|gulyas: its better than that:) you only need a finesse|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3 for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right - that's always the answer.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: he can be yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: so the italian ladies win :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 55-24 is the score|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let's say 40-45 minutes|pg||
nt|mowen: a club or A@D needed|pg||
nt|mowen: but i think he will play hearts|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think he'll lead the @c6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: money for the @c6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: or Ace of @d... not @h|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It is more interesting after a heart|pg||
nt|mowen: declarer has @Ss and @Cs and must have a few @Hs so A@D  ???|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is for 2 off|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@h ?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hantveit: club 5-1 is 14%|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes, looks that way|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not easy to bid though and other slams less than 50%|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and of course the players don't know it's all over ... |pg||
nt|jtr: Hi:)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: guess not|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's cold now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: but even with the queen of D, made now|pg||
nt|xenya: i guess E's failure to go up is what i call a gross error|pg||
mc|10|nt|rhelle:  with the @hAce right and @d 3-3, he just can't go off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|justin c: the deal generator has also allowed for the possibility that somebody might try to play in @C of course|pg||

nt|gulyas: 4@H did make in the OR bd30, so 6 points back to Herbst, the lead down to 19|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 6 to Herbst on 30 are in.  They have shaved 11 IMPs off their deficit so far in this segment.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: declarer can still make it here|pg||
nt|niekbrink: probably is afraid of a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: it might requires a double-dummy vision though....@s to T, then J@s|pg||
nt|niekbrink: spade to the ten, cross with a heart, and play a club will probably work as well|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|yuval10: we'll all remember the 21st board, with the 25 imps swing in favour of the Dutch team|pg||
pc|c6|nt|niekbrink: you ruff in hand, cross to dummy again and west is caught in a trump coup|pg||
nt|jbgood: Thanks also to our operator, Max, who has the toughest task of us all! |pg||

pc|cK|pc|s5|nt|yuval10: Drijver is still on the right trail|pg||
nt|jbgood: dont think he can win now..|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: he can even ruff this now|pg||
nt|yuval10: and play @h to the K and 9@c|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: he ruffed with the 8@s, operator|pg||
nt|yuval10: and played K@s and another @s probably|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2 down is what I expect|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|jbgood: Also thank you fellow commentators: Roland Wald, Denmark, Rob Helle, England, Jordan Chodorow and Henry Bethe, USA, Yuval Yener, Israel and Daniel Gulyas, Hungary, for devoting ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: your time and expertise to guide us through this session. |pg||
nt|jcwla: OR auction 1@C W - 1@S E - 2@S W - swish|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|yuval10: might be another 5 imps if declarer plays it carefully|pg||
nt|jbgood: And last, but not least, the audience: Your inputs are very much appreciated! Hope you enjoyed the "speedy" show!|pg||
mc|8|nt|jbgood: And dont miss the thrilling final session that will start when the players are fit for another fight:)|pg||

nt|xenya: wht happened?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: played for spades 3-3 i think|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, what a long, strange trip it's been.  Thanks to Roland and to Jon, Daniel, Yuval, Henry, Rob and all specs.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: i think he played it right , T@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: must have|pg||
nt|xenya: This is the last board of the match in this room. A big thank you to our operator Max -- an admirable job! Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) ...|pg||
nt|xenya: for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world.  Thanks to my co-commentators Yuval and Niek for donating their time and expertise to ...|pg||
nt|xenya: guide us through this set... And, of course, to all spectators for their helpful comments - there have been lots of them! |pg||
mb|2C|nt|yuval10: thanks all, very well played by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: thx a lot|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|niekbrink: operator, was it made? did he play 10 of spades instead of the 8?|pg||
nt|jbgood: a direct 3 NT would have seen N on lead - and the @c king is surely no easy lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@D the spot in the OR - wd by Barel and Zack|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR stopped in 4@d, i've heared|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, OR stopped in 4@D, so that should make|pg||
nt|gulyas: now its up to the Dutch to do the same|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: We have seen some very good bridge in this set -- hope you enjoyed the show as much as I did|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm sure he did.... |pg||
nt|vugraphztj: he claims in fact 8 tricks |pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S made in the OR, so 4 more to Herbst, now only 15 behind|pg||
nt|yuval10: no game making here for NS - both 5@d , 4@s or 3NT are going down with K@c lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: for EW, that is|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@D is the limit|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: very good session for the Israelis , that would've taken the lead already if not the disaster in board 25|pg||
nt|yuval10: 21 sry|pg||
nt|yuval10: it costs 25 imps....|pg||
nt|gulyas: we all know you are very sad abt that bd, Yuval:) it happens|pg||
nt|rhelle:  if this runs, it could be very costly ... 3 rounds of @h, 4@d and the @sAce|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|gulyas: this would be 800, where 4@C is only 500...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 4@C will go for 500|pg||
nt|jbgood: so the price may be high even nonvulnerable|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|nt|yuval10: funny, doesn't seem like he was in any position to claim...other than if he played T@s|pg||
nt|niekbrink: an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Usually we regret the bids we don't make.  That will not be the case for this flight of fancy.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|nt|niekbrink: not anymore|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  there may be a misunderstanding between N and S here.|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead comming soon...declarer can escape for -300|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Some people play a double of a takeout of a weak NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s and 3@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 3@H is hard to understand (as was 2@S).|pg||
nt|rhelle:  maybe South momentarily lost his concentration|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, with @SA being 3rd, he can take 6@Cs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|gulyas: S has not passed yet!|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is a midsummer Christmas present for E-W, who had no game available. The splendidly accurate E-W bidding at the other table will pass unrewarded.|pg||
nt|jbgood: i dont know what 2 spades means here, but must either deny 4 and 5 card majors, og be a major preference. My guess is the former |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would pretty unusual to go back to hearts after you were doubled in 3|pg||
nt|yuval10: he must know that his p has @c tollerance....hence the 3NT|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm not sure he has any clue what is going on|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  he knows there is a weak NT behind him, and possibly he has realised he made a mistake earlier|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT : please save me in something else, prd:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: A@d was the wrong lead.... now can escape with -1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: @h now is likely|pg||
nt|niekbrink: good result for israel in the open room|pg||
nt|yuval10: can only prevent an overtrick as Israel will score a double-partial to make a bad session taste a bit better|pg||
nt|niekbrink: with 3 diamonds likely to make herbst brings the margin down to 30 imps with 48 boards to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 32 to go|pg||
nt|rhelle:  doubled partscore ... lead a trump!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I thought that the auction screamed for a trump|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: 3 segments of 16|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I've told him that 1000 times!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|niekbrink: 32 to go... I am so much enjoying, I like to keep them going and going|pg||

nt|jcwla: So Zack and Barel earned their team an IMP after all for 4@D. :)|pg||
