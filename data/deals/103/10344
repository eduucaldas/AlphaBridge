nt|bjacobs: So far, he averages 6.333 clubs per hand|pg||
nt|petergill: This sensible Japanese style, using judgement and not overly reliant on one particular Law, is one of many reasons why these Japanese players won the World Senior Championships ...|pg||
nt|petergill: last year then came 2nd to Lauria - Versace in Australia's biggest event this February.  |pg||
mb|1D|nt|bjacobs: Well, that seems rather definitive.  "Disobey the Law and do well at bridge"?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|nigel_k:  As rules go, there are worse ones ...|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: No, the Japanese approach is more like "follow the Law only when it is most likely to work well, use your brain instead of relying on a tool"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That 2@S overcall - not exactly sane / safe / sensible has set quite a problem for N/S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: Not for everyone, this "using your brain" stuff, I admit. |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Hartono is not Japanese. Note East's Pass at the other table. |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In New Zealand we tend to think aggressive preempting is sensible - so I agree with East's 2S|pg||
nt|petergill: The Indonesians are winning this event comfortably, having lost a gripping semi-final to the Japanese in last year's World Championship, |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|petergill: so this event is more of a triumph for the (Indo) term which bids higher in competitive situations than the Japanese do.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: What's this 10 point opening in South?  That seems out of character|pg||
nt|petergill: On the previous board (18), the 2@C strong opening outbid the 1@C strong opening, when @CJ fell. |pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it's a good start in getting to the excellent 6@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Excellent ... but possibly failing ... 6@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West might have to stay away from the normal spade lead to beat it|pg||
nt|petergill: They are not mad. 1@C is so normal. It is wild preempts and unnecessary high bids that the Japanese eschew (is that a word?) - that the Japanese avoid, I mean|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a lovely word|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  6C looks ok as trumps are 2-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, how should it be played on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't see how South can show both the singleton spade and @HA. |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Had North splintered with 4@H over 3@C, South would have cued 4@s, then slam should be reached. |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D = to show the @D support|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H - 4@S - but 4NT might take them to 5@D (which is OK to pass ) if 2 keycards are missing, so slam is still possible to bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H and 4@S = cue bids of 1st or 2nd round control. |pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|5C|nt|bjacobs: North has good reason to expect that spade cue-bid to be based on shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  West doesn't know that he is on lead and the double may help N/S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But no, safety wins out|pg||
nt|petergill: Cue bids being of 1st and 2nd round controls, instead of the older method of cue bids being 1st round controls, used to be only played by the Italians, Poles and Precision players ...|pg||
nt|petergill: and a few others several decades ago, but is now played by most top experts everywhere.   |pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: South does very well. Points shmoints. |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  To answer Bill's earlier question, on a diamond lead if diamonds are 4-1 with East I think you need 2-2 trumps so just play 2 rounds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very impressive|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: South could see that his hand had the key features, control in both majors and good trump texture, so almost any hand on which partner could try for slam made 6@C worth bidding. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Great judgement. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: @D break badly and no entry for 2nd @H ruff, so need to lose a spade early I think|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 16 boards, Bds 31 and 32 first, then Boards 17-30|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: H Bill, hi Nigel|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|petergill: Many experts prefer to open strong two suiters at the one level, not with 2@C. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Having done so, North needs to curb his enthusiasm|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In this case 4@C, then subside|pg||
nt|petergill: The 3@C bid makes South think his hand could not be worse. |pg||
nt|petergill: or 3@H, then 4@c over 3@S, then subside|pg||

nt|petergill: The top Japanese experts are known for their safe sound sensible bidding, and top class card play. No wild preempts from these Japanese players. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nor from West.  Would you criticize a 3@C opening here?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|petergill: North might even have to duck the first club, then insert @CJ later, pitching diamonds, in order to make 4@s. |pg||

nt|petergill: with 3-2 trumps it's easy, but if trumps were 4-1, one might pitch a @D when @CJ loses to the queen at Trick 1, to retain control|pg||
