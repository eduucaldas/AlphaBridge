mb|d|nt|athene: you might even do that in first seat, never mind third|pg||
mb|2H|an|Fit|mb|d|nt|athene: 2@H = a good 2@S bid (i.e. a hand Terence Reese would have bid 2@S on)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jtr: Double will do from South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H=good raise to 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: direct 2@S = a hand with three spades Terence Reese would have passed on|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: most people would play that west's 2@S over the double is his weakest action|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: passing would be stronger|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2NT scramble now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS can now choose the spot they will go down in.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ophir's second double usually denies four hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|athene: major-suit undertricks are a higher class of undertrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w aggressive bidding here paid off|pg||
nt|jtr: North seems to have taken the double as showing more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it's interesting whether south's double of 2@H is hearts, or responsive X of spades|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why it should|pg||
nt|athene: the more people use aggressive artificial fit-showing bids, the more you are faced with this issue|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: it's his last chance to show hearts|pg||

nt|jtr: Why would declarer duck?|pg||

nt|granguru: specially when you dont bid the suit|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: EW play Tarzan Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well done by Wijs :) most people don't consider mere 5-card support for a minor enough to go past 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: 2@S made on board 2, so "only" 3 imps|pg||
nt|jtr: Most specs have noticed a loser on loser play in 6@c by letting North hold the @hK after you lead the Q|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: strip the black suits, ruff @H, then @HQ throwing @D works just fine|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jtr: And if North doesnt cover?:)  Or doesnt have the k even|pg||
nt|athene: of course, when you play something like that, you really want the @SQ and @DK to be wrong|pg||
nt|athene: as they are in the textbooks :)|pg||
nt|jtr: I prefer to be in 7 where there are no mind games:)|pg||
nt|athene: even if north doesn't cover, it doesn't hurt to throw the @D|pg||
nt|jtr: Loses nothing true|pg||
nt|rhelle:  East still hasn't passed yet ... |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you still have the 74% chance of @DK or @HK being right|pg||
nt|athene: although you might say that if north plays low on @HQ, he is less likely to have @HK|pg||
nt|rhelle:  it seems the other room in in 7@cs|pg||
nt|athene: but he can surely see elimination staring him in the face|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow!|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but they are still bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4NT must have been some kind of "rolling" bid rather than Blackwood|pg||
nt|jtr: May not lead a @h anyway |pg||
nt|jtr: 1N - 3@H - 6@C! - 7@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Next door|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that would be sick for Holland ... to suffer a grand slam on two fineses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, as David says, there's really only one way to play 7@C |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 4nt is turbo? do they play that?|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case, 7 might still be cold, so west should have continued to explore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: CC says 1430|pg||
nt|jtr: Apparently South bid 6@h|pg||
nt|athene: turbo 4nt = 2 keycards|pg||
nt|jtr: I have just shot my messenger|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think West jumped to 6@c to show a minimum for his 1@c opening|pg||
nt|rhelle:  with good clubs and controls|pg||
nt|athene: sorry yes Turbo 4NT in general shows even number of keycards|pg||
nt|athene: but here it has to be 2 really|pg||
nt|jtr: I think 6@c asks partner to bid 7@c if both finesses are working:)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  still the bidding in the other room is not finished ... they have doubled 7@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then someone had better bid 7@H |pg||
nt|rhelle:  so they may run to 7NT, which only has 12 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they go 7nt|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|athene: afraid of a diamond ruff on the lead or something|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 7@c is slightly better than 2 finesses|pg||
nt|jtr: If South as the @sQ and 5@ds or North has Qx@s|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks specs  7@c has been doubled|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will eliminate and throw north in with the q heartsb at some point|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess by South who thinks @c97 is a trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder why - neither the North or South hand looks like a penalty double of 7@C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I like to hold the ace of trumps to double grand slams|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it's a psychic lightner|pg||

pc|cA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told showed no defensive trick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|athene: ah right non-penalty doubles|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: basically, if you have found a fit and a sacrifice is viable, and opps bid a slam|pg||
nt|jtr: Taking the marked line|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|athene: the idea is you can use double to find out whether to sacrifice|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra2: welcome leao @H|pg||
nt|othered1: ON EW cards alone, there is play for 4@H (less for 5@C). But they haven't gotten into the auction yet|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H could be iffy on @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H is presumably a transfer cue bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: prescott has also represented Aus (paris 2001)|pg||
mb|p|nt|leao: ty Shirley :))|pg||

nt|jtr: ah|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: 1@D only three cards if 4135|pg||
nt|athene: some might open a strong club with that east hand|pg||
nt|athene: but Muller doesn't think @HQ is worth 2 HCP i suppose|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, but the singleton @hQ is ugly|pg||
nt|jtr: It might be:)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, not trivial for declarer here|pg||
nt|athene: *for north here|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will become pretty if north ducks this|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer has @HQx, you give a trick away to play @HA, maybe|pg||
nt|rhelle:  there is a system bid later after 1@c - 1@d to show 16-18 witht he minors - but he clearly didn't fancy that|pg||
nt|jtr: Assuming declarer has a useful discard and an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Both of which are unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
nt|athene: the only use for @HK would be as a pitch for a spade|pg||
nt|athene: but there's no fast dummy entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north appears to be tanking|pg||
nt|athene: so you can surely win @HA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C-1@D-2@S, 5/5 minors |pg||
nt|athene: and if east follows low, you can switch to a spade anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle:  nope, 3@c actually :)|pg||
nt|athene: he can't win @SAx and get his spade away on the @HK because no entry|pg||
nt|jtr: North is maybe asking about the bidding|pg||

nt|lestergold: the 6c/7c gesheft levelled it out i expect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS next door will know that that is NOT good|pg||
nt|rhelle:  from a Dutch perspective, this is just incredible ... to lose 14 IMPS on a 25% grand slam, when otherwise you'd win 18 or so|pg||
nt|rhelle:  32 IMP swing ...|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky - you make 6@C on an elegant loser-on-loser elimination and lose 14 to the finesses in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: itis very unlucky for the dutch|pg||

nt|lestergold: tell me privately david|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: 3@S gave NS no room to mess about with stopper-showing bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s is an enormous save against a making game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: interesting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 1@S alerted|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@s ? is that right?|pg||
nt|athene: NS play some weird system in third?|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room|pg||
nt|jtr: Action replay:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: i am sure 1@S was actually 1@C|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that would make sense ... and then 2@c for the Majors|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests north surely opened 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: that makes a lot more sense|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all rather mysterious|pg||
nt|athene: since a) he has a 1@C opener and b) south has a 1@S response, if you play transfers|pg||
nt|athene: now 2@C from west is michaels|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, 1@c pass 1@s maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that makes sense|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west cuing the club for michales i assume|pg||
nt|jtr: Eria?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have excellent save in spades against infrangible 5C|pg||
nt|jtr: Eugino sorry|pg||
nt|jtr: Eugenio|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: north wants to bid 3@C now if it's weak, but he certainly can't otherwise|pg||
nt|lestergold: i will be surprised if par is achieved on this hand|pg||
nt|athene: so 3NT is very understandable there|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we are getting the correct auction now|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@S is very wet|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 3nt won't be a success|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|athene: the modern tendency on opening lead is to try to lead the unexpected suit|pg||
nt|rhelle:  will West find the @h lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is bonkers when west has announced hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you have 4-card support and some shape (and Qxx in pd's other suit)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, he hopes his partner has a heart stop|pg||
nt|athene: not that unreasonable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of messages about the bidding - it is highly likely that North opened 1@C, and 1@s was either diamonds or no major |pg||
nt|lestergold: operator could we please have correct auction confirmed|pg||
nt|jtr: He will lead a @h of course|pg||
nt|rhelle:  whether West leads a low or high @h, this won't make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: south is playing partner for a perfect hand here - and he (as ever) hasn't got it|pg||
nt|lestergold: and u and bill are not likely to suffer from commenattor's curse on this one!|pg||
nt|rhelle:  lol|pg||
nt|athene: one interesting general issue of bidding here is:-|pg||
nt|athene: if opps have shown two suits|pg||
nt|athene: does your cue-bid ASK or SHOW a stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: there are exactly two ways to play it|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you play the same as pd, you are ok|pg||
nt|jtr: With 2 open suits it shows|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is generally a good principle :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i think that's the norm|pg||
nt|athene: but it does bite people on the ankle with monotonous regularity|pg||
nt|athene: because it's the opposite way round from when opps only have ONE suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely the principle is that west has effectively bid hearts and spades so south bidding 3h now should ask for a heart stop|pg||
nt|rhelle:  true|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, most people play that as showing a @h stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not they should have a clear agreement as to howto ask for or show a stop in one of them |pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 3@s would show a @s stop, and ask for a @h|pg||
nt|rhelle:  here of course he wants to right-side the contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: it should be a matter that an experienced partnership has resolved|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hence the 3NT bid, rather than 3@s|pg||
nt|jtr: It is clear enough that with 2 missing suits you show the stop but equally clear the other way i guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: both ways are logical|pg||
nt|lestergold: as long as u have an agrement|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n is not correct are we all agreed on that?|pg||
nt|jtr: I prefer to make partner guess, it is more exciting:)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I'm with you, dude|pg||
nt|rhelle:  let the basta..rd work for his money|pg||
nt|jtr: John Matheson points out that 3@s may wrongside 3NT|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that's what I said 5 mins ago :)|pg||
nt|athene: true, but if south shows his stop and north bids 3nt, that wrongsides it at least as much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would have thought that 3NT here was a definite statement ...of course it may be East thinking |pg||
nt|jtr: Blame him!|pg||
nt|athene: south has a positional stopper under the 5-card spade suit|pg||
nt|athene: i think that usually, south wants to declarer|pg||
nt|athene: *to declare|pg||
nt|jtr: East may well be thinking of saving|pg||
nt|athene: north might have a non-positional stopper or the suit might block anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East may be thinking of saving|pg||
nt|mdgraham: right vulnerability|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is what may be happening at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|jtr: Possibly some doubt about 2@c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree a bit of a barrage needed at these colours|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the thing about first 2@s is that it changes the tempo of the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: now is correct|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty Eugenio|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and so bidding 5@c is not at all obvious to North anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: after all this a push?|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely South can encourage 5@c by passing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but he hasnt|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: asking moment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but he hasn't supported clubs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  if East preempts straight away, the momentum of the bidding may carry NS to game|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe that encourages 4NT though|pg||
nt|jtr: East thinking again?:)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so I think that Muller may have doen this very cleverly ...|pg||
nt|athene: with @SAx rather than @SKx i think south would be much more inclined to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has two bullets for defence and no reason to think that game above the level of 4s is makeable now|pg||
nt|jtr: True Bill|pg||
nt|athene: with his major-suit holdings, i don't think he wants to venture the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: although to an extent he is bidding his partner's hand for him by doubling, i wld say|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: or perhaps they play inverted doubles of course in this position?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  that is true ... pass must surely be foring|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I was a young man when this hand started|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and X invites pd to go on, and pass asks for a X?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: oh, this will be expensive|pg||

nt|leao: if marcelo bids his @h, that is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west has a problem, too few points for 2@H, some would solve problem with a jump to 3@H, some would ignore the points|pg||
nt|othered1: cash minors lead second @H?|pg||

mb|d|nt|frankaus: this will not be a challange - |pg||
nt|othered1: That said, 5@S is very pushy.  East on the other hand didn't know if west was bidding to make or saving, so didn't act over 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: really - ordinary hands so far|pg||

nt|henryb: the problem with not knowing partner's second suit is that when you have a fit for only one its hard to take good saves|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|othered1: Tend to agree, since @C shift is possible if you tout partner off @H.  Or do you give count there?  |pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: i would be a lot happier doubling if i knew we played scrambling 2NT here|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  then partner knows you haven't got 4@h|pg||

nt|fabsayc: many ways to play a hand like this|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: but reversing the dummy is attractive |pg||
nt|henryb: Other partnerships use transfers: 3@d would transfer to 3@h, and then 3@s would show 4-5; 3@h would transfer to @s and show 4+ and by inference either 4-4 or 5-6 in the majors|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: muller has to pass a board out occasionally to keep up with the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nederland made 3 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and in ones, twos, and threes, this is getting closer |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: 5@D here i guess|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: i suppose they might try 4@S instead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@D has problems|pg||
nt|athene: muller might double if they stagger unconvincingly into game|pg||
nt|athene: since he knows the hearts aren't going anywhere fast|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the question now is whether 3@D bu North is forcing |pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: 3@s maybe just says i dont like 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jtr: may convert|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S might show four diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: it's useful in these auctions to have some way to show the fit without going past 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: the same thing applies after 1NT - 2@D; 2@H - 3@D for example|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: it's useful to have some bid to say "yes, i have 4 diamonds, but do we really want to bypass 3n?"|pg||
nt|jtr: He may regret that @cA|pg||
nt|jtr: Cant see the point|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer has @CQJx, he wants to encourage him to take a ruffing finesse perhaps|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes possibly|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The au pair has already switched to a diamond and gone shopping|pg||
nt|jtr: But he would have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: She is always shopping!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wouldn't need the ruffing finesse to throw a loser but he might not want to ruff twice in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: and use up the spades|pg||
nt|jtr: You pay her too much|pg||
nt|athene: for example he might then have to rely on 3-3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: which muller can see will work for him|pg||
nt|jtr: I can understand her wanting to go out when you are home but you are in Samremo|pg||
nt|jtr: 4-7 a @d|pg||
nt|jtr: The au pair has gone to the bookies to back it|pg||
nt|athene: how about a club back now? he might think declarer has @CQ10x, and  @CA was to induce the misguess now|pg||
nt|jtr: Possibly he has complictaed matters for himself by not winning the @cK|pg||
nt|athene: small club back now and the @C10 loses to pd's @CJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: When I am away I have no control over her spending|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec suggested that and i offered 100-1 against|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She has a credit card for emergancies - lat week she had nine!|pg||
nt|jtr: Do you leave her your credit card Mark?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I was once commentating on a match and East took so long to play I said one could be forgiven for thinking he had died - the trouble was he had|pg||
nt|athene: hahahahaha|pg||
nt|jtr: oh dear|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: Voila|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jtr: The au pair rakes in the cash|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: he might win @HA and play a small club NOW :)|pg||
nt|jtr: He wont do it quickly|pg||
nt|athene: this gives new meaning to the term "avoidance play"|pg||
nt|athene: when you are in time trouble|pg||
nt|athene: at all costs|pg||
nt|athene: keep muller off lead|pg||
nt|jtr: I was watching this Dutch pair in Brighton a few years ago with PO|pg||
nt|athene: he is slow when following suit, but not AS slow|pg||
nt|jtr: He whispered to me "Arent they slow":)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Muller should retire|pg||
nt|athene: it's a bit like the story about Paul Morphy, the 19th-century chess champion|pg||
nt|athene: he wasthe perfect gentleman|pg||
nt|athene: and never hurried his opponent|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he has Mark|pg||
nt|athene: (they played without clocks in those days)|pg||
nt|athene: and anyway|pg||
nt|athene: he was playing against Paulsen|pg||
nt|athene: who was mulleresque in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: and about 2 hours went by|pg||
nt|athene: and Paulsen didn't move|pg||
nt|athene: and eventually Morphy was forced to ask|pg||
nt|athene: "excuse me, why don't you move?"|pg||
nt|athene: and Paulsen sat up with a jerk|pg||
nt|chessmaste: There was a great line from an early report on a chess match - both players almost asleep|pg||
nt|athene: "oh, is it my move?"|pg||
nt|athene: no wonder Morphy went mad and gave up chess|pg||
nt|jtr: Victor points out that he should be fairly certain declarer has the @hK|pg||
nt|jtr: single|pg||
nt|jtr: Partner did not lead one|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The unofficial record for one move  was 9 hours|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that would give the au pair time to do a bit of shopping |pg||
nt|jtr: Let's hope Muller does not beat that Mark|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Tacchi likes taking pictures of Muller - he has time to take it to the shop to get it printed and still see the finish of the deal|pg||
nt|athene: muller should by now have worked out that the difference between the @H3 and @H2 is negligible|pg||
nt|athene: so he really only has a choice of FOUR cards|pg||
nt|athene: not FIVE|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Tacchi calls for a time monitor so he has a chance for dinner|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jtr: Now he has to think what to play next.............|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|jtr: Thank God i have the tennis to watch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It would be interesting to see a Muller - Chagas partnership in action  |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Muller is forming a new partnership with Robson|pg||
nt|jtr: It will be a long one:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The decision will be made in 2013. They both have to think about it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's turn....|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland has had 8 hours sleep since he left on board 6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: seriously; they have been playing for 2 hours and 15 minutes; 10½ boards|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I shall have to go and have another shave in a minute|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: I know that the European teams is at stake, but this seems a bit extreme  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: now declarer can't go @H ruff, @C ruff, @H ruff AND draw trumps - even with 3-3 break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only advantage I can think of is that Eria has an easy job following the play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry, Eugenio now|pg||
nt|athene: overruff will speed the hand up (diamond ruff)|pg||
nt|athene: but discarding will also beat|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: there are two problems for west|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think I have the best of all worlds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: a) @CA might have taken him in|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: b) he might not know south has a 4-card diamond fit|pg||
nt|rhelle:  putting a hot tub together and keeping an eye on the play|pg||

nt|jtr: Odd auction next door|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opposite a passed partner - pass |pg||
nt|athene: having doubled, he didn't want to bid 2@H over 2@D, as presumably that would show a very strong hand|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This will play very well|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Could be a funny flat board|pg||
nt|athene: the same layout that was nice for 2@D, is nice for 2@S|pg||
nt|rhelle:  of course the inference East has is that 1NT bid; 1@s being 11-15, with a singleton West would have passed it|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: rare, nowadays, to get to open with a flat 13 in 4th seat.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the other table  East responded 5N to 4N ask -- probably showing 1-KeyCard + void|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@D by a team that was being outplayed isn't surprising|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me would be 2 and void|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|henryb: Its a good thing that single imps are not crucial in this match since many boards are being misclaimed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: trump Q gets lost in the shuffle, so I really don't like the choice of 5N|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: would you rebid west's hand?|pg||

mb|p|pc|h3|nt|othered1: yesterday I played with my only partner (and a long-standing one at that) who insists 5N is one plus a void|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: of course if responses to 4N KeyCard are 0314 then maybe worried 5@D gets passed|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: something mysterious about this auction|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: that's fine agreement if you're sure void will help|pg||
nt|othered1: Is east's bidding natural?  Why 2@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i expect void to be irrelevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our East splintered with 3@S over 2@D |pg||
nt|othered1: Are they playing something like Blue Team Club, where the rebid of the 5-card suit was mandatory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so, but i might do it anyway to save space with aceless hand|pg||
nt|othered1: if 5@D is responding to key card ask, maybe excludes partner's secondary suit as a useful void.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now was afraid 5@H to play, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S looks like ask @DQ|pg||

nt|mdgraham: that puts paid to 3NT EW|pg||
mb|3H|an|barrage|nt|Walddk2: 4@S the only game with a chance|pg||
nt|athene: now East can invisage a 4-3 spade fit playing quite well|pg||
nt|athene: *envisage|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@s = 0-5, no 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though partner has only two hearts, so the long trump hand won't get forced|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@S can be defeated after three rounds of hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H choice of games now?|pg||
nt|jtr: May let this go|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: No game looks likely|pg||
nt|athene: he has a lot of quick tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but it's always scary doubling opps in 3major when they have solid 9-card fit - you just don't know how much side shape they have|pg||
nt|jtr: Depends what double means i guess|pg||
nt|athene: if you pull you surely bid 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle:  dbl = takeout, max|pg||
nt|athene: that has to be choice of games with exactly that hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Reminds me of an account of a Go game - 'On the morning of the third day only two moves were made'.|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@s meant that|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: This is an automatic one down|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Am I dreaming?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence DON'T find @H@H@H against this, will declarer hook the @S9?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But I think they will find the defence with that dummy should East pass|pg||
nt|athene: this spade suit is full of evil restricted choice thingies|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also, they know West has only three spades|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland said 110 minutes ago that 3 rounds of @hs beats this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as 1@s denied four spades |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Jos Jacobs has just walked from his Hotel to the office - he did not miss a single card|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if semi-forcing, west continues only with a real suit|pg||

nt|fabsayc: since you can anticipate the problem if you open 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like taking @C finesse into "safe" hand, but also East slight favorite to hold the Q|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|othered1: Anyone for 1@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this way can handle 4-1, else i would be inclined to take the opposite way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been interesting to assume @S 43, then win 2nd and exit with @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like 4@S should make|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|leao: i agree, merit to campos' bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: at least you won't have to make an ugly rebid over 1@S without getting your best suit in.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "interesting" means -- i don't know if that is good odds or not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I can rebid 2@C (1N is meant as forcing, passed at opener's risk) and we'll get to 3N if east tries.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: But that's not the style we're watching here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: 1@D became much easier when Checkback mechanisms were invented|pg||

nt|mdgraham: spectators for some useful and perceptive comments.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This may be a new record as to how long time it has taken to complete 16 boards on BBO vugraph. I'll check one day|pg||

nt|jtr: Thanks Mike|pg||
mb|3S|an|weak|nt|rhelle:  pas was 6-8, by the way|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: how limited was west's pass over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so with less, west has to do something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this has certainly been one of the longer 16-board sets to be shown on BBO |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difficult to see Israel gaining here|pg||
nt|jtr: This can make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle:  this can't make ... but no more than 2 off|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: sorry maybe not|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What a fantastic match; thanks a lot to all players involved!|pg||
nt|athene: playing "medium" pass after strong 1@C and overcall reminds me of the Baron system|pg||
nt|athene: which was played in the 1940s|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes hear hear Roland|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he'll lose 3 @s, and a trick in every other suit|pg||
nt|athene: in that system if you opened 1 of a suit and next hand doubled, your pass showed 5-8|pg||
nt|athene: with more you redouble and with less you had to bid something|pg||
