nt|justin c: playable 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|brolucius: Polish pair 7th.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Arnim could bid 2@S to shut out the hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|brolucius: Either North had 5 spades or he does not have four hearts, so a heart fit for E-W is almost certain.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to William Frisby|pg||
nt|trotto: 2@s  it's better for Sztyrak, he bid dbl|pg||
nt|justin c: hi bill|pg||
nt|justin c: passing here invites EW into the auction - think she will raise|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprised at the long thought. Either way, it does not seem a very complex decision.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C (whatever its merits) would actually have more chance of shutting out E-W.|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|justin c: for many of us, bidding 2@C with South (then 2@S over 2@D) would show extra values|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: 2@S here is typically a 3-card raise for NS|pg||
nt|justin c: the play is going by too fast for me to see it :)|pg||
nt|athene: because they open 4-card spade suits if they can|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: E-W can be happy with 170, I should think.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|justin c: X or 1@S for North?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is the normal action i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S is the modern bid. A few years back everyone would double.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: intending to double later if appropriate|pg||
nt|vugraphzth: 1@C polish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Often a weak NT|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: south has trump length but not sufficient strength to pass, under the bid, if west actually has a club suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT looks normal on the South cards, but it does invite an unwelcome rebid in one or other major.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: many people pass these doubles at the 1-level on long broken trumps and are then sad when the contract racks up an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now South is a bit stuck.|pg||
nt|athene: S.J.Simon makes this point in "Why you lose at bridge"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: She may even pass and hope that partner can scramble 7 tricks or so.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This will inevitably lead to a shaky trump 'fit'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is no fit at all|pg||
nt|athene: of course north didn't actually double :) i was thinking about south's decision if she had done|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Automatic lead is a trump in almost all textbooks|pg||
nt|athene: you have some fast values as south so might grab 7 or 8 tricks on a crossruff|pg||
nt|justin c: passing 2@H isnt pleasant for South, but nothing else is too appealing|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: Declarer must grab whatever side-suit winners she can and scramble some trump tricks on a cross-ruff.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|athene: now a spade off dummy and at least if west plays a trump that solves the @HJ problem|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three side-suit winners and five trump tricks will give her the contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sztyrak doing Janisz' job|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|h8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: club ruff, @SK, spade ruff looks happy |pg||

pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|hK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: when the auction calls for a trump lead, it's often fatal to "just" play one round of another suit first|pg||
nt|brolucius: The result backs up Roland's observation about a trump lead being called for when responder gives preference to the second suit. This will often be based on a hand with a singleotn ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in declarer's first suit, where declarer will be able to take a ruff or two.|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|dJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the difference between 7 and 8 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|h6|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: also, here, East's heart length suggests that south doesn't really like hearts and therefore must hate spades|pg||
nt|athene: south might even be 0-2 or 0-3 in the majors for instance|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a trump lead, declarer might in fact have been able to score a second diamond trick, for the contract.|pg||
nt|justin c: might manage 8 on a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S from Germany|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Asp/TotalPairsRunning.asp?qtournid=10100072&qroundno=3  for standings after session 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is a bit confusing that the new players' names are affixed to the top of the bidding table for the previous board. We must ignore that.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 24 boards remaining|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One pair had to withdraw from today's play. They had a plane to catch to Argentina|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H played fairly well on the last one because declarer had two bid honours in the shorter suit. It might not have been so good if North's hearts were something like @HQ-x-x-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were in 11th position after yesterday. What a pity|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably they did not expect to do so well.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: 2@D artificial game-force. 18+ hcp and 3+ spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|brolucius: 3@D, I am told means 6 spades, weak hand, no singleton or void. |pg||
nt|brolucius: I toyed with the idea of claiming that I myself had a working knowledge of their system, but I realised that no-one would believe me.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North has every chance of ditching a trick with his lead.|pg||
nt|athene: this 3@D bid might well help the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer may make 12 tricks here even on a non-heart lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: knowing that declarer has no singleton or void can be a big help|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North could be triple-squeezed|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But easier said than done, and now he can't|pg||

nt|brolucius: There was no convenient entry to lead towards East's trumps.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|justin c: cant cross to the W hand without giving up something|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, just as well that they stopped in 4@S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's diamond lead worked just fine.|pg||
nt|justin c: 620 isnt going to score much|pg||
nt|brolucius: North will not mind that a few kibitzers may be thinking 'Only bad players lead from a jack'. He will pocket his excellent score for holding the spade game to just 10 tricks.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Then declarer can make 12, can't he? He saves the losers in hearts and spades.|pg||
nt|athene: yes it saves him two tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: a kibitzer points out that south may be on lead a lot of the time|pg||
nt|athene: since east will open 2NT|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: but there are lots of polish clubs and things, so it won't be universal|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: surely 1@S is the normal rebid with north's hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Rebid must be 16-18 for South to take another bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jallerton: Hello everybody|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not all would choose to, at matchpoints.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|athene: no; the usual philosophy is to play NT if you have values but run to your minor suit if you don't, i thought|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Perhaps declarer thinks he is 1NT. He has not drawn trumps yet.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: south with 7 hcp facing a strong 1NT rebid...pass looks normal|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jallerton: Many Norths will rebid 1@s and get to clubs that way|pg||
mc|10|nt|justin c: how many tricks available in NT depends on whether it gets a @D lead|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead is very, very nice for 1nt :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still no running scores in session 4 I'm afraid|pg||
nt|jallerton: NT depends on the lead.  East will lead a @s unless N has shown them|pg||
nt|athene: many people would open that north hand a 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|justin c: @S lead would do declarer no harm at all :)  (run the @HQ and make many many tricks)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT looks a better rebid than 1@S, to me, at matchpoints. You don't want false preference to clubs.|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north's rebid was just trying to play with the field|pg||
nt|athene: but if you want to play with the field, why play a weak NT in the first place? :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The new E-W pair were 33rd on the last listing that I have, which may be that for the start of this session.|pg||
nt|jallerton: Exactly, I've never understood the 'play with the field' argument in this sort of event where you do not expect to outscore every time in the play |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Got it!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Asp/TotalPairsRunning.asp?qtournid=10100072&qroundno=4|pg||
nt|justin c: one advantage of 1NT over 1@S is that you want the lead coming up to the north hand rather than through it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|athene: no, if you are trying to win the event, there's probably a definite merit in playing slightly anti-room methods|pg||
nt|justin c: could be expensive to put that @DKJ down in dummy and see a @D lead come through it|pg||
nt|athene: then you generate swings |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That's right. declarer cannot take spade discards until trumps are drawn.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: A spectator is wondering if 'game try' should be hyphenated. I just called a professor at Oxford University, and he says 'no'|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|brolucius: That particular spectator is in the bottom 5% of the world's population for understanding hyphens.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|jallerton: N on lead here, S will be on lead at most tables|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the bottom 2% for commas. Surprising he is allowed to commentate on BBO so often, in fact...|pg||

pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to David Green-wood|pg||
nt|jtr: Fowler said|pg||
nt|jtr: "We have also to admit that after trying hard at an early stage to arrive at some principle that should teach us when to separate, when to hyphen, and when to unite the parts of ...|pg||
nt|jtr: compound words, we had to abandon the attempt as hopeless, and welter in the prevailing chaos."|pg||
nt|brolucius: That must have been cut-and-pasted. No typos at all!|pg||
nt|justin c: this @S lead looks good for declarer - a passive lead might have held this to 9|pg||
nt|jtr: From Fowler's English-Usage|pg||
nt|jtr: You shoul buy a copy|pg||
nt|jallerton: Some Souths will find the @d lead after 2NT-3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: a laugh on every page :)|pg||
nt|athene: whether you should hyphenate "game try" depends on whether you are viewing it as an action ("he made a game try", as in "try for game") or a single indivisible unit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not sure that the second half of a hypenated phrase should have a capital letter.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jallerton: Sadly, bridge terms are not included in most grammatical reference books.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not write one?|pg||
nt|athene: you would certainly say "he made a game-try double", wouldn't you? not a "game try double"|pg||
nt|jtr: 'game try' is an abbreviation of try for game therefore no hyphen|pg||
nt|brolucius: If most of what you say is nonsense, it hardly matters if you add a few hyphens to it.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|jtr: Agreed Bill You got it right|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|athene: not true - once it becomes a single unit, you hyphenate - as in "drawing-room"|pg||
nt|justin c: drawing-trumps|pg||
nt|jallerton: Can play @h for 4 tricks after that discard from N|pg||
nt|athene: "having gone for 1100, he went home and smashed the drawing-room furniture" - has to be hyphenated|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: I am sure the specs would prefer Bridge talk:)|pg||

nt|jtr: I just could not resist David mis-using a hyphen:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Careless from North. But declarer did not want to risk taking advantage. |pg||
nt|brolucius: If you keep poking the bear, he will sometimes lash out. I am always very tactful about what passes as punctuation in your comments.  |pg||

nt|jtr: Do you mean N/S?|pg||
nt|jallerton: but @h discard less successful.  Surprising as East was dummy and declarer marked with @hK on the auction|pg||

nt|brolucius: Indeed. North appears to have made only a mild try (which is indeed what she holds).|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Perhaps they play 2@c as puppet to 2@d then 2@s = game try |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, checkback, or is it check-back?|pg||

nt|brolucius: Well, they have bid it. Well done!|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems not|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jtr: Trump switch will not please declarer|pg||
nt|jallerton: Polish "2nd & 4th " leads|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North was the dealer, many players would open 1@S nowadays on those values and it would be automatic to get to game with a 13-count and three-card spade support opposite. |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even a trump back does not assist, with the @CA falling early.|pg||

nt|jtr: Somewhat late with that analysis David|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|athene: declarer will be thinking what can be done with the hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: West was worried about Kx@h|pg||

nt|athene: so i would expect a fair proportion of the room to play game|pg||

nt|jtr: Hairy|pg||
nt|jtr: @ss on your left|pg||

nt|athene: the other issue is that east has to have something in spades to bid 2NT, you would think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: wow|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may pass and think that +100 will not be so bad. Well, I was wrong there.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jallerton: Auken figures 3@s has to be a 4-card suit 3-suited t/o as she did not bid 2@s earlier|pg||
nt|athene: north doesn't double, either because they play it for penalties or from fear it will be passed too often anyway|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: A new auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if east starts with @HAK, that doesn't leave so much for west|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem is, declarer's natural play is to finesse spades before she finds out about the @DK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: If she takes the @d finesse early she will guess the @ss|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe @cs too|pg||
nt|jallerton: but she might still know enough to drop @cQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jallerton: as East is a passed hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: East needs to conceal @hK|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it is natural to play @ss first|pg||
nt|athene: east might play a LOW heart now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East does not need to play second top heart if overcall shows six hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: this idea of concealing honours to make declarer misguess another suit comes up a lot|pg||
nt|athene: but more commonly in third seat|pg||
nt|athene: for example if you have AKQxx and you know declarer has a stiff, you play ace and another|pg||
nt|athene: not Q and then A|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 12 boards of the tournament remain. Good evening to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|athene: yes, terence reese mentions this pseudo-squeeze where you manipulate the spots in a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Vladimir.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence have to remember which hand will win the last one|pg||
nt|athene: bakkeren-bertens have had an argument it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S from USA/Sweden - Sweden and E-W from England|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bewrtens will be replaced by Fallernius|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bertens|pg||
nt|jallerton: Murray (the only Brit left) is on court later.  Hewitt is through to next week|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did Jeffrey not say that there is a Dane through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not that I would do it of course|pg||
nt|jallerton: It depends how you define Danish, Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what do you mean?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No, her parents are|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: action|pg||
nt|athene: "action" double from West|pg||
nt|athene: double by a pre-empter says "i know i am not supposed to bid again, but come ON, partner!"|pg||
nt|jallerton: Is she allowed to double in this sequence?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: I like the double. white vs red|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hantveit: but can backfire because the heart suit is not strong|pg||
nt|justin c: has decent hopes of @h shortage / @S length opposite|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S is down, you want 200 not 100..if it's making, you want to sac in 3 of something|pg||
nt|athene: that's MP thinking :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|justin c: if 2@S is down, pass it before they bid something they can make|pg||
nt|jallerton: but may have backfired as 2NT has chances |pg||

nt|athene: horrible decision for east here|pg||

nt|athene: so you hope that some other NS pairs are doing the same|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jallerton: might get there when N overcalls 2@s directly|pg||
nt|athene: for example 2@H 2@S overcall, 2NT from south right away|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Those who believe the preemptor should never take subsequent action may add that hand to their evidence list.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|athene: but the overtrick was bad for sure, as a spectator points out|pg||

nt|justin c: not a good round for Holland-Brunner|pg||
nt|jallerton: well the "magic" 200 may be quite common on this board.|pg||
nt|hantveit: a get a lot of comments that spade and spade was not right. |pg||
nt|hantveit: remember that south cannot see that partner holds heart K|pg||
nt|athene: of course, if you see all the cards, it isn't :) but it certainly looked reasonable|pg||
nt|jcwla: Useful for N/S who stood third.|pg||
nt|hantveit: spade K and Q was therefore the most likely play by south, and as we saw, what happened|pg||
nt|hantveit: Brunner was (maybe too) aggressive 2 times, and paid the price. |pg||

nt|justin c: the last we heard|pg||
nt|jcwla: A huge round either way here could be dispositive.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|henryb: better shift to a spade NOW|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jallerton: @h10 suit pref?|pg||
nt|justin c: sage advice|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hantveit: if you use suit pref in trumphs, HT is either single or indicating something in spades|pg||
nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|henryb: Verbeek and Van Zwol won the Ladies pairs|pg||
nt|jallerton: @hQ10 doubleton just about possble|pg||
nt|hantveit: or J (10-q) and nothing in spades...|pg||
nt|athene: this isn't easy - @SQ and @SA might easily be swapped|pg||
nt|henryb: and declarer would probably have bid game with a sixth heart|pg||
nt|henryb: I now no other results|pg||
nt|hantveit: dec dos not know that club is braking 3-3|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe it is with the odds to play the king, to avoid a spade ruff from east from qx?|pg||
nt|hantveit: now, when the spades are 3-3 also, it dos not matter...|pg||
nt|jallerton: but East might have @sAx too!|pg||
nt|athene: if spades are 3-3, then playing the @SK wrongly loses three spade tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|hantveit: north could play more hearts on last. But that would force east to play for the spade finesse.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|justin c: i am told that martens-jassem defeated 3nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|justin c: so no clue what the leaderboard looks like by now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: I think 4 clubs is a good bid there. telling pd that you do not have much to defend with so he might go for 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: Brink trying to get @h into the game|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hantveit: or syaing 3 hearts over 3spades, but that might make partner think you actually have something...|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2spades|pg||
nt|jallerton: well judged as 5@cx is -500|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hantveit: I still prefer 4 clubs over 2 spades. give partner club ace instead of Kq in spades...|pg||

nt|athene: just a struggle for overtricks in 3nt here|pg||
nt|hantveit: 17 + 12 ns. I guess you have a lot of tired players now... Last round folks|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: i suppose you might lead a spade to the @S9?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: strong @c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would lead HJ|pg||
nt|hantveit: West is leading...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: on a heart lead declarer might not want to finesse against the @SJ first time|pg||
nt|athene: since if it loses and they clear the hearts, you might not get even one spade going|pg||
nt|jallerton: East may be on lead at other tables, but a black suit lead will not work particularly well|pg||
nt|henryb: at the other vg table East led a club|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||

nt|henryb: I would have said successfully done; not clear it is right|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in isolation it's how you want to play spades, but in the context of the hand, it's not obvious at all|pg||
nt|hantveit: spade to the 9 gives you 3 spade tricks every time west has the J, spade to K and spade 9 dos not give you 3 spade tricks every time east holds the J|pg||
nt|jallerton: you mean Jxx|pg||
nt|henryb: @s to 9 only three tricks when W has Jx or Jxx|pg||
nt|hantveit: I ment 2, but maybe 3|pg||
