nt|raghavan: Hello Haans|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|raghavan: Hiw are u?|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably 4@H will be played|pg||
nt|haans: in good condition|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: so Brink - Drijver possibly going for a 2nd gold this week|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: well they are on their way|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: though close|pg||
nt|Gerben42: only half time anyway|pg||
nt|danilo1: automatic lead ... and expected switch to trumps trick 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a fairly easy one to start with, @C are 3-3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|danilo1: but with @C 3-3-, trump switch will not help too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42: win @HK and play @C to Q|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: why not trumps?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|danilo1: Fredin sees not only @C 3-3 (even if 4-1 @C8 becomes good) ... therefore trying kind of forcing defense ... |pg||

nt|danilo1: and that will be rather better score for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably a good score for EW then|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|raghavan: Looks like 3NT by N|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: Haans: just checked the scores, EW are 7th|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|haans: yes have checked u right|pg||
nt|danilo1: as cards are 3NT is best (not to say 6NT :)) ... but thk realy best contract is 4@H|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the @C stopper is a bit thin|pg||
nt|danilo1: NT scores 10 more than @H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: if either black finesse is off, @H is likely to be better|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Gerben42: no good bid ever goes unpunished...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: did not 2@S show cards? then let p do the rest|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: but many play 2/1 bid you suits|pg||

mc|11|nt|Gerben42: yes is lucky enough just has to not continue trump but instead play @H!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: trump shortening play|pg||
nt|haans: an easy deal in my mind|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after he sees @DQ fall he is home|pg||
nt|danilo1: after @DQ comes down .. declarer had a chance of making ... trump reduction ... and 2 @S entries|pg||
nt|haans: and right u r|pg||
nt|raghavan: He should stop think about DQ falling and play -- then he would have played correctly - he did not notice the effect of DQ that other hand has 10 X|pg||
nt|danilo1: so .. unlucky EW - NS are probably one of rear pair to bid slam ... became - lucky EW|pg||

nt|haans: many will not bid game|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|raghavan: 5H +5 D = 10 tricks |pg||
nt|haans: i think 3@H is good opps prempted from entry|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 420 will be above avg. for EW|pg||

nt|haans: no|pg||
