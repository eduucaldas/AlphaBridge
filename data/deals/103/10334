nt|westjava: yes Nigel|pg||
nt|westjava: Lau,operator,has followed the lineup sheet|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: WC again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Modified Precision    1N=12-15 throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=non-forcing Stayman    2@D would have been artificial game force|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|woozle: This will probably make 1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Operator, could you put in the correct player names?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2@C looks like something F-word-esque.|pg||
nt|nickf: 2C is weak both majors|pg||
nt|jcwla: Generally against such auctions, you "close your eyes and lead a trump."|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If it is Christine and Jenna Gibbons 2H is 11-14 which seems more likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2@H =5@H + 4m, 10-14|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Charles |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: greeting all and welcome|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: nice @S game here|pg||

pc|h3|nt|westjava: ty Lau|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Nick.|pg||
nt|woozle: North has violated my own personal rule - never lead against notrumps from a four card suit headed by the ace|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwibridge: NS play 5 card majors 15-17NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even more surprised that partner has @HA|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|raghavan: Entry problem is there  for 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: E showing 6 cards in H, if I were west, I would bid 3H and may land in 4H makeable|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  Looks like North is taking South's opening bid seriously|pg||
nt|westjava: agressive bid from N|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bebechira: hello everybody|pg||

nt|nickf: hi Jordan, just here for a bit.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Blows tricks too often with too little upside.|pg||
nt|woozle: indeed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: this should not be a great challenge to declarer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is first match of the 2nd round robin, right?|pg||
nt|westjava: also Lawrence Lau (vu operator)|pg||
nt|westjava: I think so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  upside-down count & attitude, odd/even discard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  Looks like eight tricks anyway|pg||
nt|westjava: Jemmy Bojoh,always like that,Lau...:)|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|raghavan: a D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i'm still wondering if declarer had a better chance if he'd guessed @H correctly at trick 1|pg||
nt|westjava: http://www.pabf.org/ecscore/ec_ranking.asp    for running score|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now E is in control making 3 NT |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: you arrived on a rather boring hand |pg||
pc|dT|nt|nigel_k:  With the favourable heart and club suits and South having only one spade, 12 tricks are possible here|pg||
nt|allanr44: Hi Nigel, specs  :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Allan|pg||
pc|d5|nt|super nova: sorry just came across from other room because people were asking me who was playing.|pg||

nt|jcwla: them" to the OR.|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: sry late:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: evening Shirley|pg||
nt|westjava: this is match of 5th (Taipei-211 VP) and 6th (Indo 185 VP) after RR-1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: William -- i said FOUR @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: oh well I was right then :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :) delayed - neighbours birthday tea|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: big EW hands which slam will the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  E/W play precision with a 15-17 1NT so the 1NT rebid after 1C will be 18-20|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes playing the straight man and opening 1C...I'd have considered 2NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|westjava: battle for part score now|pg||
nt|westjava: battle of part score now|pg||

nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Shirley..:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C strong forcing  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: upgraded :)|pg||

nt|westjava: yup,where the prec system come from (CC Wei)...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 1NT rebid 18-19|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like N/S are going to steal it in 3H |pg||
nt|allanr44: how forcing is 3@D?  Anyone know?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Their card says 10-12 4 card support|pg||
nt|allanr44: then I imagine south can pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL probably any 5-8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that makes 14 top tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Clubs 3+D5+ H3+S2 = 13|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since transfer response to 1@C -- i believe EW are Chen-Furuta|pg||
nt|westjava: and looks like standard system from Japan pair|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5C may make on the layout but I doubt they'll bid that high|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its a pretty good hand |pg||
nt|westjava: yup, and x is 5-7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|westjava: hard to bid:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: leaping to 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: (I think)|pg||
nt|allanr44: well done them!|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting rebid decision...3C, 3NT or something else|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  E/W have a good chance of making 3S at least but missed out when West didn't double|pg||
nt|sybarra2: liliek :)  @H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: our room will play boards before Open Room, so no realtime comparison|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: W wrote 1@C+1NT=18-20|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No good lead except a spade which is unlikely :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I feel 3 Nt is makeable - Which suit E will try C or S to be seen|pg||
pc|c9|nt|westjava: right contract but not easy to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wasted values in @S's |pg||
nt|sybarra: got to love it |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Normal lead but unfortunately resolves the diamond suit for declarer so should make 9 tricks now without much trouble|pg||
nt|sybarra2: think E is saying I had @C!!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary then you must have had a feast I envy you|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: each has now cued the suit the other one has :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: it could be a close thing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|westjava: wow,fly too high|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another nice stopping point for Australia.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@S is too much best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D rebid doesn't fit any of the descriptions in the convention card :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: win in hand, lead @c and its about done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can he convert to the top spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to watch both room simultaneously   http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: then one window per table|pg||
pc|hK|nt|westjava: yeah,EW fly too high|pg||
nt|woozle: East might have considered 3NT on the third round (having already shown his 5/4) but 4S is definitely the best game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: so grand is reached but could still be a loss of imps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|westjava: more and more @C..:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|westjava: no way to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West is Dawei Chen   East is Kazuo Furuta|pg||
nt|sybarra: club up |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they find @S after the 2nd @C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: doest matter now |pg||
nt|jcwla: K & R Hand Evaluator calls the W hand 20.3 pts|pg||
pc|s7|nt|westjava: all lead advantage to decl:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: without knowing what the cues mean we can't determine their reasons|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: anyway as the cards are it has good chance|pg||
nt|woozle: Tough hand to plan...drawing trumps may disappoint when he discovers the club layout|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm guessing down 1|pg||
nt|woozle: club shift now provides a line to make - J,Q,A...finish trumps, club to the eight|pg||
nt|woozle: If South splits, concede a club|pg||
nt|raghavan: Divided honour principle is ok but here ??|pg||
nt|raghavan: If OR bid 7Nt some 2 IMP will be lost|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|westjava: 500 miles...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|westjava: hi Rashed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 10 via 4@S, 4@H, 2@D ruffs|pg||
nt|mariner1: don't see it has any chance really|pg||
nt|westjava: S has to cover@D and @C return|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi all |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes no cover and @c back was not best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes 2nd trick was the key|pg||
nt|westjava: first @D cover by K|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Needed to play low there.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has to find low @S|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now N will play D - only 8 tricks are there|pg||
mc|10|nt|nigel_k:  Depends on methods but I would be content with an immediate 3H on the South hand|pg||
nt|westjava: the right name of EW are Irne Karongkeng and Conny Sumampouw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if these hands any indication -- black trump suits not splitting today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 4@S i would have gone down 2 -- just to show that 3@S couldn't make either :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: possible auction here:   P-P-P-P|pg||

nt|woozle: 2D looks like some kind of Multi...perhaps awkward for EW to deal with|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: @h shirl & all|pg||
nt|patricck: a good board there for Australia, not only making an extra trick, but EW never found their club fit where they could take 10 tricks themselves|pg||

nt|raghavan: W may land in 3NT |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 3N yes|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: E migth saw this one off|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=1-suit  @H/@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|westjava: Thai leads the way now|pg||
nt|westjava: and 4@S N..!:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in a couple of @D I think|pg||
nt|patricck: aah, the first board, which was board 17 of course|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will work to be in 4 @S |pg||
nt|westjava: much better with opening point|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe trying to get X's|pg||
nt|woozle: If Hughes bids over that, EW may reach a dire contract unless they can sort out their diamond firt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hate that double! VUL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D denies 4@H/@S unless game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: A VIEW i wouldn't favour|pg||
nt|othered1: And double is? |pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H/@S overcall would be 4M & 5+minor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North does have a good hand but slam is a long way off and the diamonds are a worry|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @S bid keeps S from balancing|pg||
nt|jcwla: The Duplimate has split the points between the pairs very evenly.|pg||
nt|westjava: now 4@H on the way|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes stays quiet with a tempting hand. At least he probably has a plan for his lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not the right hand to interfere.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: if not Capp or DONT,what's the name of 2@D by N..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I assume she was considering a heart slam not a spade game|pg||
nt|sybarra: rightly so |pg||
mb|2S|nt|westjava: all VUL and 1@S pass out|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead makes this easier|pg||
nt|westjava: a lovely lady of @H|pg||
nt|allanr44: hard to miss, with a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S means 5@H then a decision|pg||
mb|d|nt|raghavan: Spade 8 and 9 are very valuable cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all suits favour declarer even @S|pg||
nt|othered1: If support, 2@H pretty well describes his hand, |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Patrick, would 3@D over 1@D be your choice with Nunn's hand?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's been a while since I saw someone not open a balanced 11|pg||
nt|woozle: Both majors makes it very tempting, but the thin suit quality could work very badly|pg||
nt|raghavan: But has gained now -makes 3 with spade ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: as the card lie 2 and even 3@H has play NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 3 or 4 now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: win Q@H and lead @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my |pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card doesn't go that deep -- we'll have to guess  either specifically 4@H or more likely takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think anybody plays "support double" to show 3@D - but that fits West hand too|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: 3N works with the @S stop holding up and the @C hook favorable|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: also not Brozel's|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: it depends what it means in Tony's system|pg||
nt|patricck: I like to bounce the opponents around too, so if playing solid intermediate jumps, would make the bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Wow|pg||
nt|allanr44: 7 is on the hook.  depends on the trailing team|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @H and a minor:)|pg||
nt|westjava: may be:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it looks a bit like Woolsey where 2@D="multi" but Kit's version DBL covers the 4M & 5+minor so 2M overcall = 5M+@C/@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: there are several NT defenses that use transfers|pg||
nt|bebechira: on 18..EW bid to 7 NT in the open room...so 2 IMPS to China HK|pg||
nt|sybarra: jo Ed |pg||
nt|sybarra: amd a;; |pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle: 1NT will make two, losing a spade and four diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not very well versed in the nuances of support doubles.  Just seems not to be very well standardized yet.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|allanr44: strange|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: mmm helpful|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Shirley!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|westjava: different plan|pg||
pc|hK|nt|westjava: I am using Brozel's with my pd, 2@D = @D and @H|pg||
nt|westjava: @D,end of def|pg||
pc|hA|nt|patricck: their system card just says intermediate jumps when vul....certainly was a good one, but needed to be with the hand partner had|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looking for a fourth trick I guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: needed to lead @c at trick 2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as we sort of expected, still no great loss|pg||
pc|h9|nt|westjava: sure,why not..?:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: too late shift to Trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1N would have been 6+ hcp  so East had a choice to show shape or not wrong side eventual NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|allanr44: It did not occur to me that the contract would be 4@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West should expect to take 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bojoh would have been better off passing at first turn then he would know needed to 'save'|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: for max result|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|westjava: loser on loser|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good line and should be able to make three trump tricks now|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should win and lead @D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,before @D return from N|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: "we" are not doing so badly now|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|westjava: he will|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i have no strong feelings about either choice - strictly style/partnership|pg||
pc|c2|nt|allanr44: I hold west 100% responsible|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|nigel_k:  He can't just get rid of trumps and play winning clubs but he can use the clubs as a threat to stop opponents playing trumps while he crossruffs|pg||
nt|othered1: since E and W each had a "half stopper," might have been nice to have a way to show it, maybe with a redouble by east or west|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|westjava: official web site : http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/|pg||
nt|westjava: brb|pg||
nt|westjava: best result,so wd|pg||
nt|westjava: the new leader with 1 imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost a BAM game |pg||
nt|westjava: again, battle of part score|pg||
nt|allanr44: a serious loss, vul|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Possibly East denied both minor aces but looking at the West hand that is unrealistic|pg||
nt|allanr44: Give me AK A, and partners 2@C, there is no way short of slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we have potential for double game swing|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,4@S was a very good save|pg||
nt|westjava: and make..!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Assume partner's better holding is a not-great holding in your worse suit and if the contract might be ridiculous, don't suggest it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here @H's would be ridiculous - if could suggest @D's and @S's at the 2 level (DONT or some such), maybe, but even then I don't think it computes to an interfering hand.|pg||
nt|woozle: quite often, 2 of your best fit will make, as will 1NT...it's just a question of whether you;ll find your best fit|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 2 a push = both 3NT made 3|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be a part score deal |pg||
nt|sybarra: over killed it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well together they have a half stopper but only because 1@S bidder didn't hold AQ10|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW in 4@S here I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who I vote for hee|pg||
nt|sybarra: *hrere|pg||
nt|sybarra: *here|pg||
nt|othered1: Right.  And 5@C isn't terrible, either, needing roughly the finesse and a @C break.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  partscore swing to China on the second board - they made 2C at the other table and 2S here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: doesnt it make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=0-10, 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ho thinking   great, another 4333 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A flat looking 3NT here.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: 6@S is too much with @c ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: 6@S down by @C lead:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to hope they do not WIN it|pg||
nt|allanr44: Maybe it is a home ground advantage?|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@S loose only 1@H and 2@C, is'nt it??|pg||
nt|woozle: Hirata with a very fine hand, but 3NT may still be a bit of work|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 18, where E/W here played 4@S down 2, they stopped in all of 3@C - which had the virtue of making - 5 more to Japan.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true that contract is also there|pg||
nt|sybarra: fingers should not do the walking  obviously |pg||
mb|1H|nt|nigel_k:  Are they playing uphill and into the wind in the first half?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not a fan of overcalling 2C on that sort of hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor me |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: here is same, never overcall this w/5332 and poor @C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: 3@D a nice nuetral spot for all|pg||
nt|westjava: for -1, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra2: someone has to have a @H stop |pg||
nt|westjava: first blood to Indonesia from   1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very nice bid from Bojoh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tell East BBO will not allow him to bid 1N :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Old-fashioned, right up the line bidding to a normalish spot.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: Thai gain 8 imps from   2, play only 3@H|pg||
nt|westjava: @D lead..??|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but probably a frustrating start for the chinese pair, they have already defended 4 making contracts in 4 boards, this is going to be the 5th|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: a good stop|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT not my choice to show this hand but nothing much matters here.|pg||
nt|patricck: what would you like Jordan?|pg||
nt|allanr44: In Wellington?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Into the wind in Wellington you'd be worried about game going down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 tricks the limit here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcwla: You're right Patrick, defense is "a trick harder on every hand" and even if the boards are flat, it just doesn't "feel" great to defend making contract after making contract.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs have increased size of 1@C-1N response so that they don't get to these uncomfortable 2N contracts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|allanr44: you'd be worrying about survival!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Fred welcome |pg||
nt|idblu: ge all :)|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C might be defeated, and 4S had excellent play...I know which way I'd rather go|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agreed.|pg||
nt|woozle: Anyway, back to the current hand...apparently Hughes leads third best from this holding|pg||
nt|jcwla: W is not going to have fun discarding here|pg||
nt|woozle: Declarer has eight easy tricks (two clubs, four diamonds, two hearts) and may or may not find a ninth|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT.|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS gets a game board - 3NT makes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|westjava: but enough tricks for decl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway 2NT here looks ok, concede a heart and make three hearts, three clubs, a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|othered1: but 11?  Even this 11?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|raghavan: Yes Gary |pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: I was thinking small @c back hoping S has A@D and will cash and lead one|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Fred:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sets up the 1 trumptrick :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: For the specs:  Wellington NZ is known for its breezes   :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|woozle: two discards (small spades) are easy...the third discard is harder; heart is best - declarer might not pick it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: One overtrick IMP to China in 4@S on 17.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nigel_k:  Can she find KH now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: if trust E @ST, always @HK|pg||
nt|patricck: close I guess, must be worth somewhere between 2 and 3 and it is a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh pd wants to be there as much as I do.  When we aren't there is the rare time we definitely don't want to be there.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good lead-in for reference to my favorite tool    K&R [Kaplan Rubens] Hand Evaluator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    says West hand worth 9.70 points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wasted quacks, unsupported honors = yuk|pg||
nt|othered1: I might open east a weak NT (west passes without thought), but would pass it in standard, where west may think it have something, like length in my suits.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, vwd|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: nice|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, easy nine tricks. Should be flat.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4H E/W has some chances but is very thin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another option when playing checkback mechanisms is for East - if that is an opening hand - to rebid 1N|pg||
nt|othered1: All of this, of course, is a matter of partnership style and temperment.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly right Ed|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: next pl |pg||
nt|mariner1: 8@C asked for the @H switch which was also reasonable|pg||
pc|s4|nt|westjava: @S for @H loser now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|patricck: So you believe in conservative invitations because partner is an aggressive accepter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS standard carding|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|woozle: Declarer hasn't given himself any chance here...down one|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nigel_k:  Actually East will be squeezed|pg||
pc|sT|nt|westjava: yup:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well this line has the virtue of saving time.|pg||
nt|woozle: If the diamonds are played out, West does well to pitch a heart early, not as the last pitch...but here he was untested|pg||
nt|woozle: Australia's first good board|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary I have a question - In New Zealand do u always use Pre dealt computer hands - I ask always? |pg||
nt|raghavan: I see the cards and say makes 11|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  His best hope is partner with 9D|pg||
nt|westjava: making is enough,decl claim:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
nt|allanr44: this is very ordinary ...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  he does have a guess as North could have six spades and clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|allanr44: -3?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pretty well always at both club and tournament level|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: I'd say always yes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: an awful bid reaps its reward|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately East didn't play another spade so they'll have to settle for +300|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then continuing clubs would be correct and fall back on the heart finesse if clubs don't break|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there goes the extra @C for declarer|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: we get printouts each session with deep finesse too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|allanr44: yes|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  However if he can read the spade length from the opening lead then conceding a heart after the club finesse works is 100%|pg||
pc|c6|nt|raghavan: Do u find any particular pattern of hands?|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have a swing on brd 19...EW in 3NT E....now to make it !! :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: and the @H throw-in possibility, too|pg||

nt|jcwla: prefer invitations to be one last chance to avoid game when we really don't want to be there; otherwise, we go.|pg||
nt|westjava: wd Bojoh|pg||
nt|idblu: was a great call|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 2@S opener too?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably another push board there|pg||
nt|raghavan: I agree rhey are Random - But in comparison to hand dealt, there more hands with voids and singletons|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: mirrored hands NS make any game tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes because hand dealt are not properly shuffled|pg||
nt|raghavan: This W hand is from book - bid stayman and pass any bid ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly|pg||
nt|raghavan: So Those players who practise with computer hands have better experience than the have nots  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|idblu: not in Canada|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 1@C = 15+|pg||
nt|westjava: Conny Sumampouw (W), won 4 Gold Medal on Indonesia Multi Event 2008|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate that opening |pg||
nt|woozle: NS will reach some game here...both 4H and 3NT are cold|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@H heading down in OR on 19 also - so a push there.|pg||
nt|raghavan: This X is penalty - I hopw that is their understanding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now fit is found|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|westjava: some times,over call with 4 cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a corollary of playing 1@C=2+ for balanced hands is that 1@D can be 4+ and always unbal, but EW 1@D=3+ :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I like the overcall here|pg||
nt|mariner1: good cards and NV vs VUL position|pg||
nt|westjava: back to   3, also 6@S in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 1@H = 5+@H & 10+hcp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes apparently South has 15+ and North 10+|pg||
nt|sybarra: but probably a "must do" |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N NS has good play here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|westjava: 2@S - 3@S and pass out..?:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perhaps she can't count|pg||
nt|mariner1: if N uses disciplined 1N then S should bid 3N|pg||
nt|westjava: ladies team,woman pair,mixed pair and mixed team|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is a good call too|pg||
nt|westjava: Taipe take over by 5 imps from   3|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2H is H and a minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ahh|pg||
nt|raghavan: If the minor is not C, S will bid Diamond - also agreeable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the hand I'd be coming in on|pg||
nt|raghavan: W must pass I suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these days it seems almost mandatory to bid over 1NT on anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The singleton honours don't count extra|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred, their card says  2M=0-10, 5+suit  so anything seemed possible|pg||
nt|woozle: A missed opportunity for Japan, but they still lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same hand|pg||
nt|othered1: probably forcing 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that East hand is so much better than board 5, yet it is passed :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why S didnt bid 2 @D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 1-round force |pg||
nt|othered1: Very aggressive, "playing hand" jump to 3@H.  Maybe they had an alternative call with stronger high card hand.|pg||
nt|shals: Hi I am sorry I am late chcking in to commentate here|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: wow, 3nt..??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North and South will need to discuss the strength of 3D after this|pg||

nt|jcwla: I prefer 3@H over 2@C here to show this suit.|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe he needs a better hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS playing Modified Precision so 3@H is in context of max=15|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: good pass |pg||
nt|mariner1: no easy entry to W might allow this|pg||
nt|patricck: this finally looks like a contract that EW can beat|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Shirley!|pg||
nt|shals: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, pardon my ignorance of their methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now it is really easy to blame shirley|pg||
nt|shals: tyhanks a lot!!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|raghavan: Yes Gary|pg||
nt|othered1: Wonder what they play a 2N rebid by opener means?|pg||
nt|shals: thanks ie|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats because there is now 2 of us  LOL|pg||
pc|dA|nt|idblu: if thats systemic,,,,then he violated system :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't like the 4H bid much - this is a great dummy for 3NT - but he'll make it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nigel_k:  4S is not too bad though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so you lower opening by 1 and raise response the both still lie? seems silly to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: If ruff is tried H loser will go|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: some specs not happy with Berman opening pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S 3 3 and K @H and K@C on side assure the game|pg||
pc|h4|nt|afulton: isnt this a similar theme to last hand? |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|westjava: to return a @H...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2 imps to Ina from   2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1st big swing to China with 3N bid and made board 5|pg||
nt|shals: yes of course..good name  must be same vintage!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (lets not admit it) |pg||
nt|shals: never|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: will lose 2 @S now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: what would cc wei think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2NT shd be 1 top honor in @S, explained by S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They do both have good playings strength, the problems will come when you have a misfit but are already committed to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s seemed to have arrived in best spot |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the @C leads are cutting the ruffs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it is the last hand :)|pg||
nt|afulton: don't they bother to reshuffle? ;)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nigel_k:  A possible 4H here for E/W. Unfortunately they sold out to 1S by South.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|westjava: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S can't beat 3H so no harm done as long as they get to play undoubled ...|pg||
nt|idblu: unless they don't do it on 5-5 hands|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|patricck: I know there are 16 points in the North hand, but the flat shape and poor pips would have kept me quiet against two bidding opponents|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20 also a push at 1NT/S making 2.|pg||
nt|raghavan: QMay enter in CQ and discard 2 clubs on H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: and now @c are only 1 loser|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  Small point but South should play 8H not 3H|pg||
nt|westjava: very nice @H return|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S thru for another @C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: operator, we just had this one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 3N rolled in for 11 to China|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: or vul vs not means 6, or, or, or|pg||
nt|idblu: thats prob more like it...vul w2rong|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting problem for west seeing @SK in dummy -- show highest @S, or give count|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idblu: wrong|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: great def and down they go|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: having proved that 14 + 9 is not always game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nigel_k:  -150 and +140 is a push :)|pg||
nt|westjava: exactly:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|woozle: looking like an overtrick now|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|afulton: good morning, sorry a bit late from NYC area!|pg||
nt|afulton: a bit different, but yes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Arline no problem|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: count probably [keyword] says not overly anxious for 2nd ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If W is thrown in he should give a ruff/discard not open clubs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E slipped there by ducking A@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|afulton: ruffing finesse |pg||
pc|hA|pc|c3|nt|westjava: claim now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i vote for      Quicker Claims :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6N NS?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S slightly overestimated his values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS us original Precision NT opening of 13-15|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: having to face team mates with "if onlys"|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think that last one is a game you would want to bid, just with a different auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 @h anyone?|pg||
nt|westjava: slam time now|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry,  only 6 |pg||
nt|mariner1: is a nice slam|pg||
nt|idblu: i 2nd the motion|pg||
nt|woozle: looks like a game for EW, 3NT or 4S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S here for EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nigel_k:  N/S doing very well at this table so far but currently behind in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 12 tricks already|pg||
nt|westjava: first blood for Indonesia from   4, 9 imps|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@S cant go any where:)|pg||

nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt look close enough at first |pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: all in favour?|pg||

nt|westjava: seems like 3nt NS now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: deja vu all over again :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I told VuGraph operator |pg||
nt|afulton: but was it rotated? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so are we not live then Ragha?|pg||
nt|raghavan: shouldstop in part|pg||
nt|afulton: north has no bid|pg||
nt|shals: the result from the other table will be inteesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-15  so Li Jin doesn't even think worth that|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|sybarra: does N move with super accept |pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL transfer to @H??|pg||
nt|idblu: redbl?  psychic?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6?  they'll play some level of @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=non-forcing stayman  2@D=game forcing stayman|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 18, where E/W here sold out quietly to 2@H, a highly competitive OR auction ended in a Moysian 3@S by Australia, on its way down some number.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: hard to get to this slam I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS do need to be care not to bid 7|pg||
nt|patricck: a good vulnerability there for Australia, but the Moysian @S fit doesn't play as well as @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless 1@H-1N;2@H|pg||
nt|shals: yep|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idblu: ah:)|pg||
nt|othered1: aggressive double by east but so far, so good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Canadians know all about bidding 64 depending upon full opener or min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2 step of @H/@H/@D = weak  @H/@D/@H=good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 2NT = Grand @H, no 3c@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only over 4 @c or 4 @c |pg||
nt|jcwla: If 1NT is natural there, I'm delighted to bid it.  (I wouldn't play it that way but that's beside the point.)  As you say it's flat, but it's got some intermediates. |pg||
nt|patricck: Wang just LOVED having to bid 1@S, but you gotta do what you gotta do|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe says "get me out of here"|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you,Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfers over opponent takeout double is very useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@C, cue or asking bid?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C agrees which suit is N's issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: here, North only interested in 4 card major, so 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H ok but he has 4 keys and Q@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: no cue by S?|pg||
nt|westjava: has change...|pg||
nt|idblu: with the E hand, i would rather the opps played the hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in big club context - they probably have a bid that shows both minors|pg||
pc|dA|nt|westjava: whay N not to use 2@D..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South must be tempted to double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then again - maybe EW find @S on  6  -- so it WILL be interesting to watch|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: those H will be a disappointment|pg||
nt|westjava: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: missed opportunity |pg||
nt|jcwla: So 3@S went down only one, 3 to Australia on 18.|pg||
nt|idblu: @D's play very well for W|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even 4@H -- but 4@S it is. |pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes' rebid is a style thing...apparently 2S is acceptable with this shape...and Neill wastes no time in bidding game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like the 2@S?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: acey hand in S,  and pard transfers to your 4 card suit |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Thin game here missed by E/W|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@H ask the stopper|pg||
nt|afulton: for a sleepy auction, this started to get going|pg||
nt|shals: I agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Li Jin PASS over DBL says 0-2@S |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: I dont get being so pasive  |pg||
nt|westjava: I am sure that other room, Fera Damayanti - Riantini will reach to six|pg||
nt|idblu: nice lowball hand|pg||
nt|westjava: will down on @D lead|pg||
nt|idblu: 34567|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will W find it?|pg||
nt|idblu: will have time to switch after @CA|pg||
nt|westjava: has to check first by A lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it required?   doesn't @HJ work|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: declarer only seems to have 8 tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: thats true as well Al :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: deserves about -3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly - I didn't notice the @S issue --- thanks Martin|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: when not looking for slam or starting to force in his own suit -- 2@D gives away extra information to opponents|pg||
nt|sybarra: (and I am criticized for "sitting on my hands")|pg||
nt|mariner1: needed to make a move over the transfer to 3@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Should be a straightforward 4H, losing a spade, club and trump|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: for comment about @S on  6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|afulton: if west leads another @H and east ruffs with Q, would have been a good play.. how do you tell you partner to do this? |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  2H by West a bit heavy but not unreasonable|pg||
nt|afulton: and should they figure this out?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: boy on mans errand sgould play Q@C|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: upside down count|pg||
nt|westjava:   3, 4@H other room and 10 imps|pg||
nt|sybarra2: needs to cash soon |pg||
nt|afulton: this is ladies championship.... should have sent in the Queen! |pg||
pc|s8|nt|westjava: from N,yes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  Now it will be damage control mode|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  China made 4S on the last hand so now has a decent lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed 4@S did make and China race to a good lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S has to make the move somewhere|pg||
nt|westjava: hands up|pg||
nt|idblu: I give|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: such as opener holding 5 card @C/@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: I was advised a dictum  - when you ruff - ruff high and when you gollow the suit play low Here CQ ruff is needed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|raghavan: folloe|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: follow|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This will be one or two down depending on whether South can get a club trick set up|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nigel_k:  New Zealand made 2H on this board so is headed for a pickup|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c8|nt|nigel_k:  Glenis Palmer rebid just 2H with West which is conservative but reasonable|pg||
nt|othered1: @D 7 now @CA and @S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|patricck: throwing clubs on diamonds and ruffing a club with the 6@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|c3|nt|westjava: claim and next board|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm told that on board 21 the other room opened 2NT and played there..winning imps with a 28-point partscore|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N gets away with a gross bid :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: well makes with cross ruffs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzre: don't understood W line....|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||

pc|cQ|mc|7|nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||

nt|allanr44: Indeed Nigel|pg||
nt|westjava: ty:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: With a worthless doubleton, three to the ace, and a min hand, it seems eminently reasonable to me.  Some prefer only with a stiff.  Some of it may have to do with how much ...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|westjava: Japan, leads the way 1 imp from   19|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: agree aholl view|pg||

nt|afulton: sry|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 1@D bid.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is a good spot that can be beaten with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He would enjoy the 3C response from East if there was one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room stopped in 4@H on  4 :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
nt|idblu: P appears right|pg||
nt|woozle: We get an insight into style as Hughes declines to open a moderate 11-count, but Neill is there, upgrading a decent 14 to a strong notrump|pg||
nt|woozle: South will probably bid something and EW will get to 3NT quickly|pg||
nt|afulton: 2@s?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S and a minor 5-5 weak|pg||
nt|afulton: opens door for perfect takeout x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|westjava: 4@H or 3NT EW is ok now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hardly perfect|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but has strength for 1N opener so can't be that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not for interrupt but for interested persons: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
nt|allanr44: If west bid 7NT north may lead H   :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East could still try 6 now but it's a gamble|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@D DONT?|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D, @D and M..?|pg||
nt|jcwla: game values, no @S stopper, and no 4 @H's I'd guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzre: 3@D = Good Trump Bad Point explained by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@S on the way...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice treatment  Assume 2N is @S raise so DBL for takeout|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's a pretty good 3NT with the overcall though 5C is a bit better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2N puppet to 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: Arline, my guess is she meant to be talking to me |pg||

mb|3C!|nt|afulton: ok ladies, claim and next hand :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how did W "guess" the minor :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think 2@H = 100% game force - but don't quote me|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Clubs don't break so 7NT is out :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: true|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North must bid 6S now|pg||
nt|idblu: @D and @S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|westjava: August,I think|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 3S is just a stopper-ask rather than a lebensohlish thing failing to deliver a fourth heart|pg||
nt|jcwla: Probably right, in any case all roads have led to 3NT.|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT is easy on a black suit lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: because S bid 3C|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: so,I dont like ur 3@C pd,S said...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or West's 1@C opening :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: good judgement|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,S will bid 4@S if his hand @CAxxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think i'd try @D3 lead - but don't really like any choices|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been hard by the 12 if S runned one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or if North had short @H then try 4@S|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Rodal:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yup it's Ogust, named after Harold Ogust|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from convention card, i think 2@D= 1-suit  @H/@S|pg||
nt|woozle: or maybe not...spade to Q, diamond up, South winning the king, another spade to kill East's hand|pg||
nt|woozle: diamonds still blocked...likely to go down|pg||
nt|afulton: because it was as you said... showed weak opener with @S + minor |pg||
nt|raghavan: SK |pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: when South bid 3@c, west assumed the minor was @d|pg||
nt|afulton: since @d ARE a girl's best friend!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Play trump |pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: the 3NT tells Nunn there is stuff wasted in @H, but he has such a nice hard it is difficult to give up there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C maybe alerted as game forcing but not necessarily @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all Al's conjecture|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice singleton @S partner!!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|westjava: sry,Ogust:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Par contract achieved - well done|pg||
nt|idblu: but E bypassed his S!'s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Just behinde Lillik:)|pg||
nt|patricck: oops....nice hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: In case we were wondering whether N would ever show his long suit. :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: N to play Trump|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|idblu: @H's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now overtrick - @D going on @HK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Operation successful...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who hates leads away from Jack so much -- he complains even when it is right!!|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D isn't as good as 6@C, because the @D losers could have been discarded on AKQ@S, probably both were doomed tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because likes hands if partner has @H   i.e. 2@S=pass/correct|pg||
nt|raghavan: reduce the ruffing |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mariner1: can either set up @c or use cross ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: previous board : 3@H was not so bad, super accepting can actually make slam bidding harder, since you dont hear partners natural bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, that 27-point 2NT making 3 was worth 6 to Australia and we're tied through five comparisons.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  No problem for declarer here. Certainly easier than 3NT so good judgment by East|pg||
pc|dA|nt|westjava: ahaaa...so do I Al|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Martin:)|pg||
nt|idblu: OK...some specs sugg that|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can ruff 2 Spades and twice finesse Clubs|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idblu: I don't play that :(|pg||
pc|s8|nt|westjava: 1 imp gain to Japan   20|pg||
nt|mariner1: I too do not like those, especially low from a J if p did not bid or imply the suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence from East because her spade spots mean the suit can't be run if she switches and partner has an entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have used 4@C cue to show slam interest over 3@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: A much more competitive (sense a theme?) OR auction on 19 ended in the same place, 3@H making for a push.|pg||
nt|raghavan: He should have played immediately after SA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nigel_k:  Best play is probably to start with KS as West is more likely than East to be void|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would lead and also play trumps|pg||
nt|afulton: i visited Macau back in 1989... beautiful country!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately it gives away the 12th trick here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just anoter flat board :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect similar result at other table - but maybe @C lead|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Doesn't matter if they're 2-1 of course|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|westjava: agree Rob|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West did imply @H with DBL|pg||
pc|s9|nt|westjava: good trump means 4@H :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Now diamond, overtaken, diamond jack, spade exit for down one|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: if you bid 4@H over 3@D you also cause an issue to N since S has 4 keys and Q@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Are we sure there isn't 6 on double squeeze?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mariner1: when p bids transfer to @H your hand is game level automatically|pg||
nt|othered1: at that point|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dJ|nt|westjava: but at a minimum 5@H over 3@S, again from M...meesage, I have everything to cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- i think you're right Ed|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Wang and Zhuang aren't the most aggressive pair, that doesn't seem to have cost them too much so far tho|pg||
nt|jcwla: "While Mrs. Lewis leaves the witness stand, we have time for a short break."|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|nt|woozle: or a different path to down one, an odd choice since it offers no play for the contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: and down he goes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: never a great contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: thats why you bid over 3@D...... immediately|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to hand 7 for a moment|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cJ|nt|jcwla: In the OR, South took your advice on 22 and raised 2NT to 3NT with the solid @H's.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|raghavan: Arline - I asked Gary - whether playing at home tourney always with computer dealt hands makes one better - like players fromUS.NZealan etc|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there was a Lancia match in Los Angeles many moons ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentators were talking about various lines of play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then - over the microphone there is a "gulp"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garozzo just claimed at trick 4 on double squeeze and players returned cards to the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  This should be a routine game - it needs AC onside but there are ample values to bid it|pg||
nt|woozle: Easy game for EW..slam may be tempting but will certainly fail if played by East|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcwla: Making 5 for a push board.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a slam NS|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: another part score, who gets to 1N 1st|pg||
nt|westjava: again part score hand now|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't know if W can bid 3H as a raise here...maybe he doesn't know either|pg||
mb|1D|nt|westjava: yes, 20 vs 20|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt a bid other than 4 @H a super accept,  such as 3 @S?|pg||
nt|westjava: nice to discuss...|pg||
nt|afulton: well, i think playing against the toughest competition and studying where you went astray helps to make one better|pg||
nt|raghavan: After alond time NS getting a good deal|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 could be void @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: E very quiet with their 5 5|pg||
nt|idblu: 1@C strong....dbl prob 4-7 or some such|pg||
nt|jcwla: uh oh|pg||
nt|othered1: In my eyes, if you gotta bid on the south hand, double stands out over a pointcount 1N|pg||
nt|shals: I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I would play it that way Shirley|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sneak attack time.|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT is an odd choice...now the spotlight is on North|pg||
nt|woozle: If I were to bid 3NT, I'd rather show a spade raise first|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 2@H is reasonable too|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@C rebid 1nt = 18-19,but he has 17 only..?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: i have no objections to either decision - but Edgar Kaplan would say South nowhere near strong enough for 1N overcall|pg||
nt|othered1: not a hateful spot at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he thought it should be more like  good 16-19|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  This one should be an uneventful 4S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as was other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2nt=inv 3@D=suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Presumably 2NT is because West had thoughts of slam|pg||
nt|afulton: with my partners, i like an agreement where bid of 3@s = I have very positive accept + useful doubleton (in this case, probably ace) |pg||
nt|sybarra: not the "loviest" 5/5 |pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who said 18-19?|pg||
nt|idblu: 5th @C = 1point|pg||
nt|afulton: is the 1@c bid strong opener?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: The 2@H opening is too rich even for my blood, but it must be what South expected otherwise it would have been impossible to stop. A shame since game does make|pg||
nt|woozle: North aims straight for the newspaper columns and ends up on the cutting room floor|pg||
nt|jcwla: trying to pin stiff @HQ in dummy - matchpoint top there for e/w|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't much like the HK lead, partly because catching a bare queen might not be enough to hurt the contract anyway|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@H now trf to 2@S oppss...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer just needs to take care to ruff high on the third diamond|pg||
nt|afulton: if so, I am surprised with 15 count in south, she didn't stop to consider slam |pg||
nt|shals: with a base of 15?? well i like his style  ..so ok|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I play, even today, putting me in the most conservative decile of the field|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 'decile'  haven't see that one in a while|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|jcwla: Include me out.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when you open without opening values you wind up in theses contracts which seldom make|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is a no chance game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|westjava: the older suit win:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess not :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and E is very RED|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N open = 14-16, so Shen shows 17-18|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 2 unsupported Kings and an Ace, WHY would you open?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lung will loose the first 4 tricks...|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|westjava: ok|pg||
nt|shals: must changd..|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 3@S punishing partner for balancing|pg||

nt|mariner1: very RED = they are VUL and Opponents are NV|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: especially with 4@H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence playing hearts|pg||
nt|afulton: which btw, will make |pg||
pc|d8|nt|westjava: again,3@H trf to 3@S opps:)|pg||
nt|afulton: 6@c looks odds on here|pg||

nt|rodal f: @HJ as lavental?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This is going to get them all the matchpoints|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  Not only South can ruff but declarer will be cut off from dummy's hearts after drawing trumps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has underbid is my opinion - It does not show 11 points -1A+2K and 3 cd support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sneaky @H2 -- little does Chan know :)|pg||
nt|shals: change!!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  That's better|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Was a free signal from N|pg||

nt|rodal f: Aint with u there Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think driving force should have been -- it looks like @C running |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i actually agree with call for @HJ|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,and what decl thinking about?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South should be curious about North overtake to return trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if singleton - why not try to promote partner's length, if doubleton, then must have control of @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer also thinks @C finesse not working??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|patricck: down here at the bottom of the world the blood rushes to our heads Jordan :)|pg||

nt|idblu: I'm glad Al does his homework :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 6@C of course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 100% blame to North dear Ragha|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary South did not show much values - It is all South's fault|pg||
nt|raghavan: Soory N did not show much values|pg||
nt|othered1: Anda 1N overcall likely would have gotten you dangerously higher.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6  East did open 1@S,  then defended 8@H for +500 and 9 imps to China|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 8 deals played both rooms - China 27 and Indonesia 4 IMP|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NO, south had a full opening hand and his pard had opened|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: what do you open with West??|pg||
nt|idblu: Pass 4 me|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nigel_k:  Interesting on board 8, at this table they invited game after a 2H opening and the other table passed a 3H opening|pg||
nt|westjava: Thai get 6 imps from   8,3@H only there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this 3@D going to get them to 4@S?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Given my record I won't predict another routine 4S|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case there was thought behind it but likely no swing as that contract will probably (hopefully?) not be duplicated in the OR.|pg||
nt|woozle: 13 top tricks for NS, if they care to bid it|pg||
nt|jcwla: Up to N - S will not accept an invite.|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura might just give up and bid seven if he doesn't have the machinery to avoid it intelligently|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: well if cards sat better EW then NS would have 12|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: go on it looks sane|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  N/S doing well here to compete in spades|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not sure how Stayman helps...maybe I'll find out|pg||
nt|jcwla: 23 a push at 4@S making 5.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kiwibridge: next|pg||
nt|bebechira: E will bring this home on D lead... |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@S & 8-10|pg||
nt|westjava: I think so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and e/w might never find the @C suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd vote for 1@H or 1@S -- just not sure which is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East DBL probably showing @S honor -- but I think it just helps NS|pg||
mb|5S|nt|nigel_k:  Ha|pg||
nt|bebechira: he has 3h+2c+2d|pg||
nt|othered1: with the opponents forced to game, anyone think east's double might help NS more than west?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at least i think should be 8-10|pg||
nt|mariner1: S should bid game now....... dual fit and short @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt know about clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H a little timid I think|pg||
nt|afulton: played carefully, NS can make 5@H, losing only @d + @c|pg||
nt|afulton: oh good, just what you want to hear when you bid stayman... partner answering you in your stiff |pg||
nt|raghavan: This lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|afulton: yes|pg||
nt|afulton: it will allow Hsien to hold the @c losers to 1 while establishing the suit|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: another guess coming -- 3@H shows 2 top honors in @S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh the double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Ok the double was just to test us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prompted by?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Sorry no dbl, just tht all pass and press DK = dbl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H transfer after the DBL|pg||
nt|sybarra2: again the @H is transfer?|pg||
nt|idblu: if I had to...1@S for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I think East was looking for slam there actually :)|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@C best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there enough tricks if @D discard?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  just a club guess for the overtrick|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,K of @C on side...|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick in the same 3@D contract earned China 1 IMP on 20.|pg||
nt|patricck: their cc does say 2@H can be 0-8, so maybe Nunn was scared it was even worse than that|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not enough from West unfortunately|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: had us excited operator|pg||
nt|westjava: not too late...|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does a good job|pg||
nt|othered1: Sorry :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  After QC wins declarer has to guess whether N has doubleton 10 or South has doubleton King|pg||
nt|idblu: lots of handling charges|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think declarer wins the race here - but not positive|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think can handle it|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra2: draw trump and ruffing ......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may come down to the fortunate lie of NS @D|pg||
nt|idblu: can't play on @D's w/o 2 rds of trump|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't argue with success.|pg||
nt|woozle: Some spectators are admiring North's auction, but I still can't see that he can count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: This will make easily, when @C come home for discards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry folks  8@H = shortcut for 4@HX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, very nice slam even with 40 trump |pg||
pc|s5|nt|westjava: will reach to 6..?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it they reach slam level it will be a tough play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unbelivebel friendly hand for NS, but hard to reach the max|pg||
nt|woozle: All he really achieved was avoiding the indignity of playing 7NT where the four missing points were an ace|pg||
pc|s4|nt|afulton: sounds wacky but @c toward Q should have been trick 2|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might have over taken and fired a @S back|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why not |pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard had ace of @S,  and ruff  next |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You'd actually want to be in slam with the E/W cards after South's double|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he will ever guess the @D|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe not so easily, as some timing is required to avoid the @D guess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: she tries to get OT as many as possibe|pg||
pc|s3|nt|westjava: so,be careful Hu|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c out beats 6@H and 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec asking for more guesses ---  4@C asks about @C holding  4@D=not 1st/2nd/3rd round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't explain why South asked in @C rather than @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @S were 3 2 this would have more play likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@H = 2 @S honor, so 6@S is very reasonable|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult contract tough to make|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D,that's S need...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one correct guess -- now how about 4@C??|pg||
pc|hA|nt|westjava: @C asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confirmation of my guess about 4@C only counts if it comes from the table :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: it can be made now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With the KH wrong it would fail of course|pg||
nt|afulton: here, south could have and probably should have ducked|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- i think @C at trick 2 is best -- just not sure if @C to King or 10|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: suggest line of play to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that looks wrong|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: has to play E for Jxxx @S though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 2nd @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "no" was supposed to be "now"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: and then what  (as martin said)|pg||
nt|afulton: but they need to be playing to make the contract|pg||
nt|othered1: gib will have claimed this long ago, having peeked at the EW hands.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: this will work out as an "extra chance"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still must be very careful with transportation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think must decide early about whether @C coming in or @D finesse|pg||
pc|d4|nt|westjava: yes,just need 1 x @C ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: might have been wise to ruff some @H's|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: that's why i'm still thinking about trick 2 @C to 10 :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|westjava: now,need @D ruff:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trying to ruff hearts looked relatively safe but she's not taking any chances|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember to ruff 3rd round of @D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: could have ruffed a @D  and finessed for J@S and home|pg||
nt|mariner1: at least it would have been a try :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|westjava: 12 imps for 6 boards,good match|pg||
nt|sybarra: so club, over take, ace of spade (if there) and ruff,  ace of @D  =down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course, East may help by playing @D :(|pg||
pc|s8|nt|allanr44: Needs @D lead (or club lead and @D switch) to hold it to 4|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idblu: spec makes a point ...why did W bid 2@S with his meagre 10 count?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the end of Round Robin 1    Indonesia 6th place with 185  Chinese Taipei 4th with 214|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China has very big lead in both Open and Ladies|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  He should play three rounds of hearts now. When S doesn't follow the club position is clear|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undo please|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: now @D come back into play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|westjava: yeah|pg||
nt|mariner1: looking good|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Immaterial if South helps by covering, though S was still trying to beat the contract|pg||
nt|afulton: east will have a marked finesse of @c ... and then concede last 2 |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|westjava: so,wd Hu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice result|pg||

nt|afulton: yes, good thing the ladies aren't playing for money!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easily the most difficult part of being vugraph operator is keeping up with play of the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. when some players hide the cards or play super fast |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W will regret not cashing A@C in the post|pg||
nt|westjava: still tied match...1lso 3NT + 3 for   23|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to play AQ@S was a winner|pg||
nt|westjava: also|pg||
nt|woozle: Another very sound weak two from Hirata...NS have no cold game but three feasible ones (4S, 3NT, 5C)|pg||
nt|afulton: or at least the north south pair :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: in 5 deals China has 14 and australia 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15, 0+@D   [2@D opener = 0-10 4+@H & 4+@S]|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score battle|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When they go back with +200 maybe teammates will assume it is from 4 spades doubled :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N supposed to be 12-14|pg||
nt|sybarra: or all of the above|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|vugraphzre: 1nt=15-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the unorthodox 3@D by Lung preempted his side out of the making 3N|pg||
nt|bebechira: Texan Aces doing very very well 56-28 with 8 to go.....|pg||
nt|raghavan: well N makes Lead direction bid if Opp reach a contract|pg||
mb|p!|nt|ahollan1: Pass = 0-2@S  [support dbl with 3]|pg||
nt|rodal f: Waited 1NT and tr there, by 3@H as max|pg||
nt|jcwla: 21, the 3NT hand in here, W in OR threw in a junky 2@D overcall and played that doubled, but down 3 and only -500 to gain 3 for Australia.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Macau now leading after bidding the slam on board 4|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS will lose a lot in money|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nigel_k:  N will have deja-vu from board 6|pg||
nt|afulton: they forgot initial passes... |pg||
nt|rodal f: But an other system for NS I belive. 11 - 14 NT in white?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only makes his pard think of game|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  3H is Ogust showing a good hand and a bad suit|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura not very ambitious - 2DXX might have been fun|pg||
nt|afulton: yet, in spite of all the riches of the E-W pair, this is not a great hand for them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C is 16+, but not 20-21 bal [2N] or 25+ bal or game forcing hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: W does not like 2@C however has no where to go|pg||
nt|afulton: assume a @H lead... |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity telling all cards - EW will defend better now with information|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: yes:)|pg||
nt|westjava: so,better pass now|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never seen a Precision pair use 2@D as artificial Game Force opening |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that's what convention card says|pg||
mb|4C|nt|nigel_k:  Pass is a bit pessimistic with West, maybe 3H instead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like their chances for 2nd plus score of the set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard, drop the lifeboats|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Lots of work to do in 4H though|pg||
nt|mariner1: trump leads needed|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there is one|pg||
nt|patricck: NS have missed 4@H here|pg||
nt|woozle: Odd that he didn't even want to play game opposite hearts...from what we've seen of Hirata's weak twos it would probably be laydown|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 24, where Neill upgraded the 14 to 1NT, Ohno also opened it 1NT - as the top end of 11-14!  Over S's interference, West got his side out in 3@C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: @DK and switch to ??|pg||
nt|raghavan: What is there for W to think Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 7 imps gain to Japan   24 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: A@C being Ax helps|pg||
nt|afulton: as i said... not great hand for east-west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pass over 1@D probably 0-4 or trap|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: opening nebulous @D has the effect of pinning the suit if the opponents hold it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: holding trump Ace - very powerful for West|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a min 1 after the lead|pg||
nt|afulton: they will lose 2@h's 1@c and @s .. for -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was there inference that 3@H included @C?? |pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: E should X|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nigel_k:  A bit timid by E/W. West could have tried 3H or E a reopening double|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: rehi|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|afulton: but with all high @h played on trick 1... why not try to set up @s right away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great lead should be about 500 here for nothing|pg||

nt|westjava: x again by E better|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Missed opportunity for both teams|pg||
nt|mariner1: this could be an action hand|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3N has good play EW|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  An easy hand to get overboard on so may not be too bad for N/S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Another slam here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think both pairs playing upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|idblu: well then @S2 should have been his clue|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: yes looked like 3@D was gin others had chances|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tough one|pg||
nt|woozle: EW have a very possible (but inferior and failing) 4H, or an excellent 3NT available|pg||
nt|bebechira: I saw some good work on the bulletin...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|davidstern: Nice hand nobody has a fit here|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2@S DBL would please E|pg||
nt|rodal f: 50 and fin in my eys|pg||
nt|woozle: Which game EW play will probably depend on which of E and W makes the final decision|pg||
nt|afulton: one thing I noticed when I was watching USBF finals was that almost all of them opened the bidding extremely light|pg||
nt|bebechira: http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS in a pickle now|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@C 11-15 either 5@C + 4 or 6+@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|woozle: If Hughes had a support double available, he did well to ignore it|pg||
nt|afulton: and they bent over to overcall (particularly at favorable vul) extremely light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 11-15, 1+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this makes 6@S or 6@C|pg||
nt|westjava: they will|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7 in fact|pg||
nt|westjava: nice lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as good as 3@C was bad :)|pg||
nt|westjava: I always with 7 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no 7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 22 a push at 3NT-1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=0-10, 5+@H|pg||
nt|davidstern: I can say that the general consensus is that Asian (and Aus/NZ) Tournaments are among the friendliest in the world. There seem to be an ongoing number of  appeals here which never ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: happens in Asia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs play transfers over the takeout double - i think that is very effective treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even peeking at just EW cards, not sure where i'd want to be|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and should be bid|pg||
nt|westjava: key of K@C..!:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and west is sitting |pg||
nt|idblu: but after @DK and @H8....only suit left was @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  7C is a very good contract and may be reached if East uses 4NT key card now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody bringing it up so i'll mention 1@H for me rather than DBL|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: W is happy :)|pg||
nt|afulton: Hsien has made a very heavy 1N bid.. but South found SUPER lead!|pg||
nt|bebechira: Texan Aces getting closer and closer to the semis....+40 with 6 to go|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Grant steals it, this may not be pretty but only 50's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i can live with DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that wouldn't be true if @S & @H reversed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: @D lead will make declarer very nervous|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With canape you always feel like you want to rebid a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@C also drifted one off on 24, so the Lamaze class ("Push, push, push") continues.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: 7@C not reasonable missing a key|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on a double finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 @C precission? Ok to alert it for specs also:)|pg||
nt|idblu: vul on his side here|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again the substandard game is reached|pg||
nt|afulton: three rounds of @c and then @h thru... |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hans had a number of choices here.  Will be interesting to see how this one plays out at the two tables.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Jodan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Jordan|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  Very pushy by North|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: trump lead not really best here |pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes does very well to not cooperate in his Neill's investigations|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: actually @H lead troublesome too|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Might be ok if the Ace was not a singleton, eg AC instead of AD|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: director -- we were robbed|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think we missed a pass here|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls|pg||
nt|mariner1: well bid though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: ok 2 rounds and ht thru |pg||
nt|afulton: ok, i agree|pg||
pc|s2|nt|westjava: -3 now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: ggod night and thx for coming :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East needs West to have seven to the king at least plus an ace, which is optimistic|pg||
nt|woozle: Even if declarer errs and plays on hearts, this will still probably make|pg||
nt|afulton: they never found their @c fit on this hand|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On board 6 Macau made 4H at the other table in addition to making 2S at this table |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: @CA then try @DAK?|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to use @S to reach W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just playing north for @CK seems against the odds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there is no problem for 6@C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: that 2@H bid in N is a warning about possible @D splits|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: bd 7, other room didnt get to 6 @H either |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer should take two diamond ruffs now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Still not a bad game but nothing lying well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they had a coach he might be pointing out the fallacies in their methods|pg||
pc|s5|nt|afulton: welcome back Dr. Raghaven :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Japan managed to play game in their ten-card @S fit on 25 rather than 3NT, so they will...lose 1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm beginning to wonder if NS convention card is misprint and that 1N opening is 13-15 -- or really only good12-15|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: yes 6@C makes anyway|pg||
nt|westjava: stil have entry of J@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As it happens the QD comes down but cashing AK first is too risky|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Power failure|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok NOW @C finesse|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence by South. Left North on lead to ensure a heart switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tough I still belive 3NT are the best spot. But shallbe down|pg||
nt|raghavan: sorry|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i guess this is better than my play of @CA first|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Shirley, I was wrong|pg||

nt|rnmalik: this play earlier he would have made 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @C10 loses the contract if North began with @CK6  -- South 985 now takes trick|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I'm being swallowed by a boa constrictor, and I don't like it very much."|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|woozle: Making four, from the looks of things, and a good result for EW|pg||

nt|ahollan1: playing big club system   1M-(any)-4M is "wide range"|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is just an overbid here.  See if it will push west over|pg||
nt|shals: let's see if the opps bid 4s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nigel_k:  The 200 is unfortunately correct|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: possible 6@H here|pg||
nt|idblu: a quiet 4@H here|pg||
nt|westjava: NS just lost 3nt...|pg||
nt|afulton: after last hand, i am not surprised east didnt open|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will shake the hand of any pair who reach 6@H on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can be preemptive like in 2/1 system or opening hand with no slam ambition|pg||
nt|othered1: and now, has it also pushed north?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hard to reach|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It will be hard to interest North after a 1H opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has good play here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I did say can, expect them to reach 4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Wasnt in resp to your comment just a passing comment|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Yet another close game|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the lucky lead it's home.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S playing precision so South can safely pass the 1S opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura trots out Drury, from the looks of it, and I assume that Neill's double is a lead-direct|pg||
nt|shals: woops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Li Jin earlier 3@H stole EW @S [ok East should have opened  6] this time sounds like stealing but not really|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|sybarra2: this looks "easy"  |pg||
nt|woozle: 4H will be very difficult on a club lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nigel_k:  South must be worried about missing slam but his options over 1NT are not great|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H are 3 2 , K@D in pocker|pg||
nt|mariner1: pcoket|pg||
nt|mariner1: pocket :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes obeys orders and manages to avoid the temptation of his diamond holding|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting @C5 lead.|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think the South hand is strong enough to bid hearts and then spades or double on second chance|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michaels doesnt get across the playing strength|pg||
nt|davidstern: Give north doubleton spade and @DK and it is laydown|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here.....|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@S, 1@H and 2@C loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S back from W will end its hopes though|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @S can go on @D if no @S back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 = 3rd/lowest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't see Dawei doing anything other than @CAK and @S shift looking at dummy @D holding|pg||
nt|westjava: should be like that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and hoping that his p has A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Dawei ask what 2@S was|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: wondering because no @S lead then no @S singleton|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCruff AH|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D and 1 down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...surprised no exploration for a major.  @D lead would set the @H (Hans' @H) to racing.|pg||
nt|raghavan: David > get  ready to shake hands whatever the result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think West just needs to duck @HA once then play 3rd @H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nigel_k:  You probably wouldn't want to bid this one but the auction is very normal|pg||
nt|shals: no dble|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: maybe abandon @H now and ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|westjava: best line of defence...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think risky not to cash 2nd @C -- imagine North  3613|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@C now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- i'd like to retract that please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 = down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Dawei preserving @C really was very fine play|pg||
nt|westjava: that's why he was thinking a while|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E is still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: frustrating when player at table finds better play seeing only 2 hands than i found looking at all 4 :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, E thinking now at the scence|pg||
nt|westjava: E has to ask what was 2@S..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: S replied W 2@S = 3c+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is another case where holding trump Ace gives defender more choices|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,always think alot if you've A of trump|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Claim|pg||
pc|h7|nt|westjava: upss|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: E just asked N the same question about what 2@S was|pg||
nt|westjava: ty:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: same answer = 3+|pg||
nt|idblu: about time able to press the "Easy" button|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bit hard from here in Italy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: now sure how they found the @D back|pg||
nt|afulton: by the way, on last hand... if ew could have made 7@c/@d ... the score would have been 1440 |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: many moons ago Billy Eisenberg wrote a BOLS Bridge Tip that said "play low from dummy"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. @CJ gains nothing .... ever|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its funny how that works|pg||
nt|idblu: true....let the def guess|pg||
nt|woozle: 4H looking good now - Hughes can't continue diamonds profitably so the long spade will set up|pg||
nt|woozle: probably DQ next, playing neill for T7x|pg||
pc|h2|nt|westjava: a new leader now, 12 imps gain from   10, a double score 4@S here and 2@H there|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra2: for those of you joining us in the morning for european championships |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope now defense prevails with 3rd trummp|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra2:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: After ten bids, they ended in 6NT on the 7NT hand in the OR - so a big gain coming to Japan.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: give, take, give |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: E playing declarer for 3631|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so question shouldn't have been about 2@S but if 2@S=3 then how many @H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As it happens 3NT is the only makeable game|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: how many @H before trying @D?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|idblu: 1:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and back to defense|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|westjava: @C and finished...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now game certain|pg||
nt|idblu: @S now...the @C10 is protected|pg||

pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Actually that happens quite a lot :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|jcwla: Nice play by Hirata.|pg||

nt|sybarra2: that was the "easy" button right?|pg||

nt|afulton: well bid and well played by west |pg||
nt|woozle: Very soft bidding from Lavings at the other table...appears not to have even tried for seven|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may play in part H|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@H needs a diamond lead to have a chance to beat it and even then 50% or better on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did Ho believe auction or really not have a count?|pg||
nt|shals: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: a grand slam time|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW this time|pg||
nt|afulton: this hand will make 1@h e-w or 5@s n-s|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H cold N/A and 5@S pretty bad|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should double and N will bid 5H |pg||
nt|davidstern: If you divine the diamonds and they dont get a ruff -500|pg||
nt|davidstern: else -800|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand would require some handling by both sides|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: may be next time:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yet another part score|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 7 this time|pg||
nt|afulton: she wont play in partscore in @H if north has a say! |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mariner1: just needs to be sure to ruff a @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: let's we see how NS to get 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: odd?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: odds?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One this one South would prefer to defend a heart contract than play one|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sure|pg||
nt|woozle: East too strong for a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|afulton: double and then raise of 3@s to 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=art game force|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Neg X and on for fight bough pairs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: On Board 23, where Hans conservatively settled for defending 2@S and beating it 1, in the OR Fu has made 4@H on an intricate play in which the AK7 opposite Tx of trumps, with Q986 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: in one defender's hand, came into play.|pg||
nt|afulton: crossing fingers that partner isnt totally broke |pg||
nt|afulton: ah, she will make only 4, not 5|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H quite timid. I would have bid 4NT and over a minor bid 5@H to show values|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hoping partner doesnt think I just have 2 suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N can ask for exact shape or 3@H is natural game force|pg||
nt|othered1: A good style, especially with weak NT.  Makes some hand easier to bid than transfers.  This isn't one of them.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|westjava: 4 should be asking bid|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: well N has X ray eyes that there are 2 losers|pg||
nt|davidstern: So optimal spot on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: So the only big swing so far is 11 to China.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need a @D lead now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W are playing a strong NT so East's 1NT is 12-14 unless I am missing something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not THAT is a lead director 3rd seat 1@S opener :)|pg||
nt|woozle: 1S from Hirata an interesting choice... a bit weird that he didn't want to describe his hand in one bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: I think I would have bid 3@D over the DBL...... to jack the auction up a level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually people have some mechanism for showing majors over a strong club|pg||
nt|afulton: wow, conservative raise!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W needed to force here|pg||
nt|jcwla: All roads probably lead to a @S partial.  W might have forced them up a level with 3@C.|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes might have bid more, although 3C can be beaten a couple of tricks anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: Japan add their imps from   27|pg||
nt|sybarra: seen pard in action (balancing) before |pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S is ok|pg||
nt|afulton: but the 1@s bid could have been made without one of those aces|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I  would do more than raise|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but perhaps a 2@H bid might have given some juice to this auction|pg||
nt|woozle: With the cards lying well, 9 tricks look inevitable|pg||
nt|afulton: lucky diamond situation (i tell you guys, @d's are key to women's bridge!)|pg||
nt|shals: I don't really know this system at all..welcome your comments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=4234|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@C is down on @D lead, if you could find the spot, due to communications problems to get pitch on @SA.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: possibly 3@C just 4@S & 4@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: now W can pass info to E cheaply|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@C & 4@S both = cue bids|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One of those rare occasions where N can even show QC if they keep going|pg||
nt|sybarra: so many specs suggestion 2 @H as bid bye W |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and it isnt even a great poke hand |pg||
nt|sybarra2: misisng the inside card|pg||
nt|sybarra2: (for the straight)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: if West bidding twice -- i prefer 3@C first   but i think should pass 3@D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Rob,no use redbl|pg||
nt|westjava: no loser in @C,@D and @S,then...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's that chance :)|pg||
nt|afulton: (which would show LR +) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the hand with short @D needs honors to pull trump -- so really dislike 3@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: best to play cross ruff here|pg||
nt|westjava: on @H and @D, yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to be sure to cash the A@C in time|pg||
nt|westjava: dont forget to remember|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ruff cash @CA and A@H and cross ruff the best I can see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't south get to ruff high on 4th @H?|pg||
nt|afulton: South was probably sitting there saying unkind words to partner before dummy hit (and a few afterwards) but all will be well on this hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Best defence is third spade hope for promote perhaps|pg||
nt|shals: looks 3n  played well|pg||
mb|4C|nt|idblu: only 1 down...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF North overcalls 1N then does Shen still bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: The new leader,Indonesia...|pg||
nt|davidstern: But East will be hoping for a minor trick|pg||
mb|4D|nt|westjava: no problem...what can decl do..?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the other hand -- defense against 3@D is easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure why the pitch here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange:)|pg||
nt|westjava: a different plan...|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i dont know either why pitching...what's the line of play??|pg||
nt|mariner1: he did not pitch a loser so|pg||
nt|westjava: better 2@H (very good 3 card spade raise)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This should have been a routine 3NT or possibly 4S for E/W but clearly a wheel has come off|pg||
nt|othered1: North is bidding out his hand, not unreasonably.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 23 - 20 imps now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sad really|pg||
nt|afulton: probably best to take a @c finesse... not sure how many times she will be in south hand!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C very good single dummy - but yet another 40 break|pg||
mb|4H|nt|davidstern: Would be a great hand if West held @HQ x|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: claim|pg||
nt|westjava: I bid directly if only in 6@H:):)|pg||
nt|othered1: @H10 in south hand would make 6@C excellent|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|westjava: may be the answer is yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nz have got to 3@H by E here other room|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually not good to declare the same suit at both tables|pg||
nt|othered1: south likes his @C fit. Give north @SKx and @Dx and 6@C would score top in bidding contest.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|afulton: much better than a simple 2@s... which could be anything... |pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As spec told. Any lead. It makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: these are the kind of hands that when you play them, they take a while because you have to consider all of the variations |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ed mentions @H10 because after @D lead, win Ace, @S to King, no way back to @SA for @D discard|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sybarra: may miss the @D ruff if not careful |pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: EW must lead low from doubletons, otherwise E couldn't have read the position|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: E/W lead low-high from doubleton?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i like duck at trick 1 -- not clear what might happen, but seems crossruff only 8 tricks to worth a try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice auction -- extremely unlucky result |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: @HK are one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then maybe 2@S DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot -- |pg||
nt|ahollan1: WEST on lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|idblu: that's a little too fine|pg||
pc|s8|nt|afulton: :)|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|jcwla: thx|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: but then reverted back to crossruff anyway -- so it goes|pg||
nt|afulton: she must have heard you|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2@H NS|pg||
pc|c7|nt|westjava: again 9 imps to Japan   28, 6@C here and 3NT there +3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idblu: thats poss|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: Martin says with @H33 that slam makes even after @D lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes it does, simply by playing east for at least 3@H and all the trumps|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  There was some chance of making this double dummy but not easy. Good defence too.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: well done Hu!|pg||
nt|afulton: i dont think playing 2 rounds of trumps first was a good idea... since West had preempted, it was unusual that @s split so nicely... was very lucky as a matter of fact|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  Another sad looking +200 then|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wonder how play goes if trick 3 = @C|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  2S is 10-14 with 5 spades and a 4 card minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well can they stay out here? based on previous no|pg||
nt|westjava: a new leader,cant find game other room   10|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6@H on a backward finesse.|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I bet they don't find that Jordan :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Chinese may be happy Arline is not sitting  opp to them as S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is natural weak 2 -- how'd that get onto the convention card|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@H is unlucky with diamond ruff on opening lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|westjava: and...13 imps again to Japan,4@H-1 here and 4@H+2 there|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session is scheduled in 132 minutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is scheduled to be  Open  Thailand vs Indonesia|pg||
nt|idblu: here  comes the "weak" 2 again|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I do that X and pard leaps to 4 @H |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H not available to Gontha - that would be 6-10, 5+@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|sybarra2: well we are not playing 3 nt that is for certain |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 2@D WAS available to show weak 2@H/@S|pg||
nt|westjava: 5@H will come|pg||
nt|raghavan: will S jump to 3D to show extra values|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: some partnerships here open W hand 2@D both majors 5/5 minimum less than opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 3rd match of the day  Ladies  China vs New Zealand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very polite of E/W to refrain from interfering with the strong club auction|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes afraid so |pg||
nt|idblu: 5@H anyone|pg||
mb|3H|nt|westjava: dont know S pass after 2nt N other table...:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not  sure this slam is easy to bid|pg||
nt|idblu: Shen stuck it to them here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: pard makes that cockememe X  I bid 5 @H also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a comfy pass here|pg||
nt|woozle: Hirata makes a very retro-looking single raise...I don't like it at all|pg||
nt|afulton: leading the @cQ last hand catered to remaining stiff J and... and we all know Jacks dont like to be stiff :)|pg||
nt|afulton: why thanks Dr. Raghavan |pg||
nt|othered1: I hope 3@C shows extras in their methods (using 2N to start weak hands)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  N/S play weak NT so the 1NT rebid is strong|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,15-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx L a great job look forward to seeing you back|pg||
mb|4H|nt|westjava: 2nt minors|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like a candidate for a flat board to me, but I guess the splinter might change that theory|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 24, which ended in the no-chance 6@D in here, the same auction in the OR through 3NT, which Zhao passed.|pg||
nt|westjava: no action pls...|pg||
nt|westjava: too late|pg||
nt|marlowepi: P. U. |pg||
nt|sybarra2: really Marshal,  nothing comfy in this room |pg||
nt|idblu: getting into deep trouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gontha wants to go back and start with 2@D open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S had a flexible hand, he would not bid 5H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I let pard sit there |pg||
nt|marlowepi: double was available, and 4N was available|pg||
nt|sybarra2: (maybe they wont X)|pg||
nt|idblu: not @C's...@H's...yes|pg||
nt|woozle: Neill shouldn't bid here...last thing he wants to do is push opponents into 4H|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is another time landing in correct Club contract - |pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT obviously superior|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again David S has heard u and obeyed|pg||
nt|davidstern: If West was on lead you might score a diamond trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure why N in Open Room bid 2N in their auction, RED vs White|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room west 2@D open same as our 2@H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A promising start|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks perhaps 2-2-3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The contract is ok on the N/S cards and may make|pg||
nt|afulton: 3@c=Puppet? it was alerted|pg||
nt|jcwla: So that will be another large gain to China.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Saw the same earlyer by the night. A8xx - KJ9. Needed the same inv cut|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my question would be -- does North action describe 2 places to play?|pg||
nt|idblu: @H / 1H down 1...@S lead down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key  (2@S)-3@S|pg||
nt|idblu: @H /  @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if ask for @S stop for NT  OR  very good 1-suiter then South Pass looks wrong|pg||
nt|westjava: no dbl,he is lucky|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N was the practical bid over 2S. preempts work. 3N could turn out badly, but so could anything else. and you will not be able to have a confident auction if you double|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I dont like the X with out @h's |pg||
nt|sybarra2: something wrong with 3 @C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|idblu: too strong for 3@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it is more or less the same bid as pass|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its not perfect agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd match from PABF today is supposed to be  Seniors  Australia National vs Japan Yamada|pg||
nt|ahollan1: way too strong for 3@C|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'd prefer something like 3@H as a mixed raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes is tough........|pg||
nt|sybarra2: however,   now you are in this pickel|pg||
nt|idblu: only a 3 imp loss...very fortunate|pg||
nt|marlowepi: night all. Homeland Security finally caught up with me & i hafta go|pg||
nt|sybarra2: cu Mashall and thx|pg||
nt|idblu: bring out the handcuffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ciao Marshall|pg||
nt|jcwla: This will be 10 back to Australia to within 2.|pg||
nt|woozle: My estimate is that opposite shapely hands the fourth trump in dummy is worth about a trick and a half|pg||
nt|afulton: what would north have done if south jumped in @s?? |pg||
pc|s6|nt|afulton: 3@d=no 5 major but 4 card one or two... |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is the major N does not hold|pg||
nt|afulton: 3@d=ok, i have @s but not 1H|pg||
nt|afulton: sorry, 3@H= i have @s but NOT @h, right rob!|pg||
nt|jcwla: In both rooms the 0-4-4-5 hand was opened 1@D.  Even though the commentators there voted for 1@C, I agree with the 1@D bid.  |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The bad spade break will probably defeat 6C if they get there. It is a good contract on the N/S cards though|pg||
nt|afulton: I think if you bid with north hand, just bid @c!|pg||
nt|afulton: unless the double is something unusual, most players use it to show 4-card @s suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Another hand on which GIB will make 6, but nobody will get near it.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  West preferred his weaker minor that opponents opened. Turns out to be right though.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the clash at the top sees  1 give  2 a fair old lesson I'd say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW convention card does NOT mention lebensohl|pg||
nt|othered1: if south covers, west will join GIB |pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzre: nice lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what was 2 @H over 2 @C?  steps??|pg||
nt|afulton: 3@s=ok, i got 'em too|pg||
nt|raghavan: N doubles with 9 Points and lands in correct contract - esp Vul - I would not venture|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|afulton: maybe we hear 4@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got the inv finess free now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: 2NT was for minors probably and S passed|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes that may have been it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and here EW will wonder why they didn't bid 4@H :)   but only after taking 10 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: try to avoid any taipeigraphical errors|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: 4@D nice cue here|pg||
nt|afulton: oh, wimpy|pg||
nt|afulton: yes|pg||
nt|afulton: (sorry, forgot @s trumps)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam coming now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @h was 4-6 pts any |pg||
nt|afulton: NICE @c bid!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence by West. South will be short of entries to hand to draw trumps and play diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: XX coming|pg||
nt|sybarra: or skip it?|pg||
nt|afulton: XX would be perfect|pg||
nt|mariner1: REDBL my call|pg||
nt|mariner1: or just blow 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: XX says first round contol |pg||
nt|afulton: or maybe knows enough to just bid the slam now|pg||
nt|sybarra: but maybe just bid 6 sp  and hope for club lead? |pg||
nt|mariner1: holding A & Q @c S needs to know little else........|pg||
nt|mariner1: N can't have Q@S A@D AND Q@H so 7 a question|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant make seven on this layout can she?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 7 makes with @c hook|pg||
nt|idblu: gn Marshall|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hJ|nt|westjava: swing for Indonesia|pg||
nt|bebechira: Texan Aces 68-29 with 4 to go|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|afulton: south is trying to establish @d tricks ... so those @h losers go away|pg||
nt|raghavan: and 4S is on to EW|pg||
pc|s7|nt|westjava: S should be 3@C after 2nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: since @H are 3 3 too|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with S,    I dont need 7 |pg||
pc|s9|nt|nigel_k:  It's going to be two down but still worth competing nonvul. It would pay off if opponents were pushed to 3S.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but why no X|pg||
nt|mariner1: right 7 is not the best %|pg||
nt|afulton: but ... (and I am a woman) didn't Gail Greenberg yell at someone for bidding a grandie that wasn't 18 tricks in a women's event? |pg||
nt|sybarra: but Gail yells at many folks LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I love her dearly but....|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S ruff to save 2nd overtrick|pg||
nt|patricck: the lead gives Australia an imp|pg||
nt|afulton: best when you start a hand... to count both losers as well as winners... then try to figure out what you will do with your losers|pg||
nt|afulton: in this case, 2@h losers and 1@s loser|pg||
nt|raghavan: Counting losers too, N hand does not warrant a bid first time VUL|pg||
nt|afulton: regardless of return, south will ruff @s and lead last @d ... and wrap up 6|pg||
nt|afulton: Depends on style... many players use a sort of negative free bid ... shows suits, not HCP|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: may not play for 7 since only in 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 12 EW are in 6@D , N was silent|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Needs to unblock spades now before cashing the clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: indeed that -500 would hurt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good on ya|pg||
nt|westjava: 6@H here and 5@H only other room   14:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idblu: ?|pg||
nt|woozle: Neill did very well to not give NS another chance..but I guess he was diving in 5D over 4H|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|afulton: too bad that Yu Pei Wen didn't lead her own suit... or this hand would have gone down|pg||
nt|afulton: I wouldnt want to be in the ladies locker room when they discuss this hand later on!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nigel_k:  NS will be pleasantly surprised to gain 11 on 14 instead of losing 11|pg||
nt|bebechira: Zia down 36 with 6 to go|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hemay play C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: wow surprise|pg||
nt|westjava: so,11 imps more to Indo|pg||
nt|afulton: losing vul game swing is biggie|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nigel_k:  Done|pg||
nt|othered1: and we wind up with another doubel squeeze position on @D|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|raghavan: curtains |pg||
nt|bebechira: and new leader|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bebechira: for 2 seconds|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|westjava: first blood for Taipei|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen very solid set from Dawei Chen - Kazuo Furuta|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Al|pg||
nt|westjava: an anchor pair I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, solid set except no @C lead vs 6@S and overbid in 3@S|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but unless you can count a TON of tricks, is very risky to bid grand.... becasue if it doesnt make, you will lose 1530 ... or 780 ... if other room didn't even get to small ...|pg||
nt|afulton: slam|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Report from OR is that in the same 2@S contract as here on 26, Lavings took 12 tricks to gain 3.|pg||
nt|woozle: twelve is a lot|pg||
nt|woozle: how does he not lose the spade king and club ace?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks erroneous to me.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence and declarer did well to get out for 1 down|pg||

nt|afulton: i mean, we can see that the suits all break on this hand... but when you are playing, you don't have that luxury|pg||
nt|afulton: if ANYTHING doesn't work, the grandie wont work... |pg||
nt|sybarra: so  much easier for us |pg||

nt|sybarra2: tightens up the match |pg||
nt|idblu: didn't care for that line of play|pg||
nt|sybarra2: last hand here |pg||
nt|woozle: play record bears it out...West ducked two clubs and the third was pitched on a diamond prior to ruffing out the longclubs|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nope, it's true.  |pg||
nt|afulton: that @H ditch would have waited... too bad south rushed it (but i might have done same when i see big swing like that0|pg||
nt|raghavan: After 12 deals here, both are equal with 15 each - No quarters given|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Last board of this set. Time to give thanks, so-to-speak. Great job from our operator  Ben Lam [Hong Kong]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun working with fellow commentators  Ed Shapiro, Shirleys Laidlaw & Ybarra|pg||

nt|sybarra2: thx also to PABF and all the folks who helped to bring this to bbo |pg||
nt|afulton: ouch|pg||
nt|afulton: bidding 2x on same cards isn't usually a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: many thanks to our super operator!|pg||

nt|patricck: i agree, but maybe they were influenced by the splinter, thought they had to cut down the cross ruff|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting - game in @H's played in OR N/S, here only E/W bid @H's.|pg||
nt|patricck: i would be happy to have @DQJ to lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stolen contract I belive. @H are for 3|pg||
nt|jcwla: And as we know, in this set you always lead @D's against NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers world wide..!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx to to Liliek @H|pg||
nt|westjava: ty to our operator Lawrence Lau (Hongkong)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: back in an hour are we|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Thanks for watching everyone|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the other table South understandably bid 2NT immediately and they got too high in 3S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: most of all thanks specs for watching and giving us feedback|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N a forcing ask here?|pg||
nt|afulton: what is 2@d?  Majors? |pg||
nt|afulton: south has shown 9-11 ... possibly shapely hand|pg||
nt|othered1: if yo were defending the last hand double-dummy, would @D opening lead and continuation when in with @HA have stopped it?  Of course, west could have unblocked @C9 and guessed ...|pg||
nt|othered1: position in any case.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like it |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think 2@D was majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: could be just one major though|pg||
nt|afulton: nice hand... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: then later  Open  China vs Thailand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was busy rambling -- didn't notice :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tang thinking partner must really be broke to not overcall with 5+@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: more to follow tomorrow|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H in the open room was an aggressive contract, but a good one|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  12 tricks possible here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A terrible slam to bid though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many of the contestants have an opening bid to show 5+@H & 5+@S but only for less than opening strength|pg||
nt|westjava: ty vmuch Shirley, Al, Fred, Lawrence Lau (operator) and all spectators|pg||
nt|afulton: and with minimum, drives to game|pg||
nt|othered1: Avoiding 4@S by never bidding the suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|woozle: Very reasonable 6D available for EW here, and after this start they'll probably bid it|pg||
nt|afulton: Gary, Dr.Raghavan?   comments? |pg||
nt|raghavan: Please pass|pg||
nt|davidstern: This does have chnaces of making|pg||
nt|bebechira: do we know what happened on this board?|pg||
nt|othered1: if they also lead low from 4, west could lose a @H trick yet.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometmes pard holds @H's |pg||
nt|davidstern: chances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's the @H suit for declarer - now pick which minor trick to develop|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Best defence is to return a trump|pg||
nt|jcwla: We have a new leader - and Australia will paid their lead on 28, where Japan did end up in that 4@H contract with three trump losers and the @CA to lose.|pg||
nt|woozle: I've been known to open hands like West with 1NT...shows the count, permits investigation of different strains and doesn't drive too high opposite a bad responding hand|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes did very well on 28 to inhibit investigation of suit contracts|pg||
nt|woozle: Neill will still kick here...opposite a near-certain stiff heart, the hands fit like a glove|pg||
nt|jcwla: 11 to Australia and from a 12-point deficit to a 12-point lead in 3 comparisons.|pg||
nt|woozle: I fancy a direct 6D here, giving up on seven with the marginal fit and club misfit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot Li could play the @H8 :(|pg||
nt|othered1: but declarer doesn't know about @H position, does he, unless south gave something away at the table?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no broadcasts.|pg||
nt|levix: 3c also too high,may -2 against good defence|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On the layout declarer can run trumps and make the last three tricks in diamonds after a double squeeze|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He'll probably just cash out though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: appalling :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I was thinking of Pass 2NT|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, when you have the bottom range of a bid and partner invites... even though it is enticing, is probably best to take the low road|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||

nt|mariner1: this can be made or|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx all   |pg||
nt|idblu: gn :)  have fun|pg||
nt|sybarra2: cu in the 'morrow |pg||
nt|westjava: bye all..!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no switch to @D?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: Roland puts in a LOT of time and effort doing the scheduling here,,,,,, its a huge job|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anything by N/S is too high but hard to avoid after the preempt|pg||
nt|raghavan: X of 1C itself is questionable with a flat hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzre: if network steady, will try our best to help|pg||
nt|bebechira: good work... thx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice Monica|pg||
nt|shals: there you are..|pg||
pc|dK|nt|woozle: Neill goes more scientific...I think this is just natural, not minorwood or anything|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: This is cashout time and, in doing so, west will find an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- avoid the "marked finesse" gets overtrick :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tang can't get a count on declarer's shape -- neither can we :)|pg||
nt|othered1: There were various funny positions in @H, depending on which card south played to trick 1.  If Q, may later score 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Chan did great job of combining chances in minors so 4th @H trick not needed|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
pc|s8|nt|levix: yes|pg||
nt|woozle: A spade lead will finish the play very quickly...other leads will leave us in suspense|pg||
nt|jcwla: Last one in here.  Time to thank Kieran, Roland, our vg operator, and all specs.  Some great comments.|pg||
nt|woozle: Another nice swing here if 6D can be made|pg||
nt|afulton: well, sometimes when you pick up 14 hcp and rho opens the bidding, you want to DO something... |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: The 11 to China has come in from 24.  Now up by 17.|pg||
nt|woozle: From my perspective, it's nice to see Hughes/Neill playing quite well...they're on my team in two weeks|pg||
nt|woozle: lots of lines here...easier to choose if the opponents give lots of count or something|pg||
nt|raghavan: He has developped C as a first preference for later discards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Thanks all for watching, Traian, Ragha, David for your comments, thx to out excellent operator, Roland for organising and BBO for hosting|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: We'll be back tomorrow with more from this great event|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|afulton: i was going to say, @s off when @H appeared (but then corrected to @s)|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura has done well to avoid the spade lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I suggest 1N upgrade the 10's|pg||
nt|afulton: but many players forget... PASSING is doing something!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: no denying|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Rob, Al, Rashed, Rodal, Lawrence Lau and to all spect's|pg||
nt|rodal f: As the sits are by @H it's hard by 4 but a good one normaly|pg||
nt|raghavan: I endorse fully what Gary said - Tx to all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thx specs for your comments we do appreciate them|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nigel_k:  The Chinese declarer did well to take eight tricks in spades|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: thank you all and bye for now|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session in 120 minutes!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end, a big thank you to our operator and to Roland, Patrick, Rodal and all specs.  Some great comments.|pg||
nt|woozle: ruffing the fourth club and the third spade (after pitching two) works well, but relies on 4-4 clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ditto|pg||
pc|hA|nt|afulton: now @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the end South has to keep KH and north a top club, so each has only two diamonds and dummy three|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: who will get the odd VP here :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Will need to divine spades here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a very tight match|pg||
nt|bebechira: Dokic in trouble in the 1st round at Wimbledon|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: 8?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  All academic as he claimed 10|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's the last one so thanks for watching|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good win to Macau after steadier play|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Still chances for New Caledonia to reduce the deficit on the boards to play in the other room|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good evening|pg||
nt|woozle: it's either take two ruffs in dummy, or draw the last trump, ruff a club, and try to guess the spades at the end|pg||
nt|afulton: wow, north is going to bring this baby home from the hospital! |pg||
nt|raghavan: With flat hand no - wait, if Partner makes sound bid strong.|pg||
nt|afulton: oops|pg||
nt|afulton: or not|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d3|nt|afulton: even tho @d queen pops, still is @d loser|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: so making 3|pg||
nt|afulton: but @h doens't help still must lose 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we are claiming |pg||
nt|afulton: and 2@s losers|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  Defence has dropped a trick but still one down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: we are only in 3 |pg||
nt|jcwla: For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

pc|cA|nt|afulton: well done by north... if you are pushy bidder, you need to improve declarer skills|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cK|nt|woozle: I would have made it, but that's because from here I can see all the hands|pg||
nt|jcwla: A push on 29 and the 12 to Japan there and it's all down to the OR 30 - it was 2@S making 3 here and likely to be duplicated there.  Could end in a draw.|pg||
nt|woozle: A little unlucky...I can't quite decipher the auction at the other table|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'm going in there to watch - thanks again to all and for now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
