nt|mariner1: hi Liliek|pg||
mb|3H|nt|westjava: hi every one|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi welcome Jan Abel is not here so something is wrong|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi all|pg||
mb|4H|nt|westjava: Thailand (rank 7) vs Indonesia (rank 9)|pg||
nt|westjava: line up is wrong?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: http://www.pabf.org/ecscore/ec_ranking.asp|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: re Lililek|pg||
nt|westjava: re hi Nigel and Gary|pg||
nt|westjava: also Lau:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 2H is 5H and 4 minor 6-10|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Nigel|pg||
nt|westjava: Lau,operator,has followed the lineup sheet|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|s7|nt|nigel_k:  Operator, could you put in the correct player names?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: 2@C looks like something F-word-esque.|pg||
nt|nickf: 2C is weak both majors|pg||
nt|jcwla: Generally against such auctions, you "close your eyes and lead a trump."|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nigel_k:  If it is Christine and Jenna Gibbons 2H is 11-14 which seems more likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2@H =5@H + 4m, 10-14|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Charles |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice @S game here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|westjava: ty Lau|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Nick.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like North is taking South's opening bid seriously|pg||
nt|westjava: agressive bid from N|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|westjava: yes|pg||
nt|westjava: NS pair are Christine Gibbons and Jenna Gibbons.... Jan Abel was in team but became unwell and is still in new Zealand|pg||
nt|westjava: from Patrick,NZ ty:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|westjava: looks like prec for NS|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: N face really shown very seriously here|pg||
nt|nickf: hi Jordan, just here for a bit.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: this should not be a great challenge to declarer |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like eight tricks anyway|pg||
nt|westjava: Jemmy Bojoh,always like that,Lau...:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nickf: North South are Tony Nunn and Sartaj Hans|pg||
nt|super nova: In this room we have|pg||
pc|d7|nt|westjava: ty Lau for correction:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|allanr44: shall i handle closed?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: HI Shirley|pg||
pc|h2|nt|super nova: Sataj and Tony playing for Australia|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: Hi Rob,  welcome |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: you arrived on a rather boring hand |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With the favourable heart and club suits and South having only one spade, 12 tricks are possible here|pg||
nt|allanr44: Hi Nigel, specs  :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Allan|pg||
pc|s5|nt|super nova: sorry just came across from other room because people were asking me who was playing.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Jamie.|pg||
nt|super nova: Hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like OR is starting with 31 and 32 so they will get our comparisons.  I will do my best to keep you updated on what happened with our boards once we figuratively "passed ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: them" to the OR.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: so both pairs precision variants|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dT|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Always nice to start by making game on a "20-20" hand.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  maybe an overtrick now after he slipped the spade past North so they missed the diamond ruff|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|nt|mariner1: http://www.pabf.org/ecscore/ec_ranking.asp -  Running Scores (scores change|pg||
nt|mariner1: every 10 seconds - revolve events)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/index.html  -  Tournament Site|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam not really there,  just probably made an imp |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major here|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Shirley,hi Rob and all|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was hand we just played |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H more likely|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Nine tricks the limit as long as North plays low on the heart lead|pg||

mb|1H|nt|westjava: sry late:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: oh well I was right then :)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|nigel_k:  E/W play precision with a 15-17 1NT so the 1NT rebid after 1C will be 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: battle for part score now|pg||
nt|westjava: battle of part score now|pg||
nt|sybarra: you only missed a boring bde |pg||
nt|westjava: also re hi Lawrence Lau:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe an imp at stake |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H here also NS|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|westjava: dbl show strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2@D = good raise in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: all pairs for Chinese Taipei play Precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except  for one|pg||

nt|mariner1: Participants then click Flag under event to see convention cards)|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,where the prec system come from (CC Wei)...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 1NT rebid 18-19|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like N/S are going to steal it in 3H |pg||
nt|allanr44: how forcing is 3@D?  Anyone know?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Their card says 10-12 4 card support|pg||
nt|allanr44: then I imagine south can pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since transfer response to 1@C -- i believe EW are Chen-Furuta|pg||
nt|westjava: and looks like standard system from Japan pair|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5C may make on the layout but I doubt they'll bid that high|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: hard to bid:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: leaping to 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: (I think)|pg||
nt|allanr44: well done them!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nigel_k:  E/W have a good chance of making 3S at least but missed out when West didn't double|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzre: W wrote 1@C+1NT=18-20|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No good lead except a spade which is unlikely :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|westjava: right contract but not easy to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wasted values in @S's |pg||
nt|sybarra: got to love it |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Normal lead but unfortunately resolves the diamond suit for declarer so should make 9 tricks now without much trouble|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|westjava: wow,fly too high|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another nice stopping point for Australia.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: well 4@S is too much best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D rebid doesn't fit any of the descriptions in the convention card :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: win in hand, lead @c and its about done|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,EW fly too high|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|westjava: no way to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West is Dawei Chen   East is Kazuo Furuta|pg||
nt|sybarra: club up |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: doest matter now |pg||
pc|s6|nt|westjava: all lead advantage to decl:)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: anyway as the cards are it has good chance|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|westjava: 500 miles...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|westjava: hi Rashed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 10 via 4@S, 4@H, 2@D ruffs|pg||
nt|mariner1: don't see it has any chance really|pg||
nt|westjava: S has to cover@D and @C return|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi all |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes no cover and @c back was not best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes 2nd trick was the key|pg||
nt|westjava: first @D cover by K|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Depends on methods but I would be content with an immediate 3H on the South hand|pg||
nt|westjava: the right name of EW are Irne Karongkeng and Conny Sumampouw|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: good info Liliek|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|westjava: with @H 3-3,decl will go home now|pg||
nt|mariner1: now can ruff another @D, pull trumps and pitch a @c on @H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  More passive defence was required|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  Make declarer choose what to do with her 9H entry to dummy|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Good result for N/S there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: @h shirl & all|pg||
nt|patricck: a good board there for Australia, not only making an extra trick, but EW never found their club fit where they could take 10 tricks themselves|pg||
nt|allanr44: as predicted Nigel.  Hopefully some more challenging situato\ions ,,,Ah, here's one|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: expected 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: NS play 4cM - could be Canape|pg||
nt|westjava: 4 Cards on 3rd hand|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh,ty Lau for info|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no! always 4cM w/Canape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+ and another transfer response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some can rebid 1N to show 18-19|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i might go to the other room, there is my preferred whipable guy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Patrick, you like a t/o double by Zhuang there?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like 3S for N/S and 3C for E/W|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: that's a benefit of transfer responses|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes can be canape and 2C denies a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@S is normal contract for EW|pg||
nt|westjava: might be EW reach to 6@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4C splinter will not encourage East|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Brave reopening double from West|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: on the way...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: raising with 3 frisky then|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi again Henri|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, no other way to get into the auction|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: 4@H has an issue this time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|westjava: undo pls...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that treatment accept transfer = 2/3 support|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, 1NT would have found clubs but also lets opponents in|pg||
nt|westjava: EW with 23 hcp can do nothing...|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure @H's not friendly |pg||
nt|mariner1: we are not whipable? need remedial training?|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S, 2@H loser|pg||
nt|allanr44: must duck one round|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: Ru could have upgraded to 1N|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nigel_k:  This is probably asking for trump queen|pg||
nt|westjava: hard to lead @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we just have to find the spades cash  |pg||
nt|jcwla: For sure W's @H holding would preclude any possibility of being misconstrued as penalty.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|westjava: any thing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: but 4333 in E hand  np|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like EW using accept=exactly 3  so 1N rebid=bal with 2 in responder's major|pg||
nt|patricck: who would have pushed who how far after that would have been interesting|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
pc|sA|nt|westjava: and 2NT rebid show 18-19|pg||
nt|mariner1: careful play makes this|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, very hard |pg||
nt|westjava: may be @D lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W a bit lucky that JD is the twelfth trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|westjava: without a @H lead,yes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@D=ask @SQ+side K, 5@S=@SQ, no side K|pg||
nt|westjava: agree Gary|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: the more i see it, the more i like the treatment where 1N is used to show the "jump 2N" strength|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: N loving life at moment |pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: @C are very favourably placed|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|westjava: a balance might be I would passed with her hand |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14-17|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@S NS|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes -50 is very good for N/S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Another 8 card suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe there will be more bidding than yesterday's one :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores only here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard for east because he won't place partner with a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|allanr44: many tricks for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: perhaps the same other room|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kiwibridge: 41H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 41h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@h|pg||
nt|patricck: that was another 20 point game, but much more difficult to bid than board 1, and needed a little more luck to make as well|pg||
nt|allanr44: that is true|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: E migth saw this one off|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=1-suit  @H/@S|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|westjava: Thai leads the way now|pg||
nt|westjava: and 4@S N..!:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in a couple of @D I think|pg||
nt|patricck: aah, the first board, which was board 17 of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: A VIEW i wouldn't favour|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H/@S overcall would be 4M & 5+minor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North does have a good hand but slam is a long way off and the diamonds are a worry|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @S bid keeps S from balancing|pg||
nt|jcwla: The Duplimate has split the points between the pairs very evenly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: if not Capp or DONT,what's the name of 2@D by N..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I assume she was considering a heart slam not a spade game|pg||
nt|sybarra: rightly so |pg||
mb|3S|nt|westjava: all VUL and 1@S pass out|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead makes this easier|pg||
nt|westjava: a lovely lady of @H|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jcwla: Patrick, would 3@D over 1@D be your choice with Nunn's hand?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's been a while since I saw someone not open a balanced 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: as the card lie 2 and even 3@H has play NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 3 or 4 now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: win Q@H and lead @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: also not Brozel's|pg||
pc|hT|nt|patricck: it depends what it means in Tony's system|pg||
nt|patricck: I like to bounce the opponents around too, so if playing solid intermediate jumps, would make the bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Wow|pg||
nt|allanr44: 7 is on the hook.  depends on the trailing team|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: @H and a minor:)|pg||
nt|westjava: may be:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it looks a bit like Woolsey where 2@D="multi" but Kit's version DBL covers the 4M & 5+minor so 2M overcall = 5M+@C/@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: there are several NT defenses that use transfers|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|allanr44: strange|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: mmm helpful|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|westjava: different plan|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|westjava: I am using Brozel's with my pd, 2@D = @D and @H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|patricck: their system card just says intermediate jumps when vul....certainly was a good one, but needed to be with the hand partner had|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nigel_k:  Looking for a fourth trick I guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: needed to lead @c at trick 2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|westjava: sure,why not..?:)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|allanr44: It did not occur to me that the contract would be 4@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West should expect to take 12 tricks at least|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: for max result|pg||
pc|c5|nt|westjava: loser on loser|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good line and should be able to make three trump tricks now|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should win and lead @D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,before @D return from N|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: "we" are not doing so badly now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|allanr44: I hold west 100% responsible|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He can't just get rid of trumps and play winning clubs but he can use the clubs as a threat to stop opponents playing trumps while he crossruffs|pg||

nt|westjava: again, battle of part score|pg||
nt|allanr44: a serious loss, vul|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Possibly East denied both minor aces but looking at the West hand that is unrealistic|pg||
nt|allanr44: Give me AK A, and partners 2@C, there is no way short of slam|pg||

mb|2C|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW|pg||

mb|2S|nt|jcwla: A flat looking 3NT here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 6@S is too much with @c ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: 6@S down by @C lead:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to hope they do not WIN it|pg||
nt|allanr44: Maybe it is a home ground advantage?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true that contract is also there|pg||
nt|sybarra: fingers should not do the walking  obviously |pg||
mb|d|nt|nigel_k:  Are they playing uphill and into the wind in the first half?|pg||
mb|r|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not a fan of overcalling 2C on that sort of hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor me |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: here is same, never overcall this w/5332 and poor @C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: 3@D a nice nuetral spot for all|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: Thai gain 8 imps from   2, play only 3@H|pg||
nt|westjava: @D lead..??|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but probably a frustrating start for the chinese pair, they have already defended 4 making contracts in 4 boards, this is going to be the 5th|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: a good stop|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT not my choice to show this hand but nothing much matters here.|pg||
nt|patricck: what would you like Jordan?|pg||
nt|allanr44: In Wellington?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Into the wind in Wellington you'd be worried about game going down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcwla: You're right Patrick, defense is "a trick harder on every hand" and even if the boards are flat, it just doesn't "feel" great to defend making contract after making contract.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|allanr44: you'd be worrying about survival!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT.|pg||

pc|c8|pg||

nt|allanr44: For the specs:  Wellington NZ is known for its breezes   :)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|nigel_k:  Can she find KH now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: if trust E @ST, always @HK|pg||

pc|s7|nt|nigel_k:  Actually East will be squeezed|pg||

nt|allanr44: this is very ordinary ...|pg||

nt|allanr44: -3?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: an awful bid reaps its reward|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately East didn't play another spade so they'll have to settle for +300|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then continuing clubs would be correct and fall back on the heart finesse if clubs don't break|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
mc|5|nt|allanr44: yes|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: some times,over call with 4 cards|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: a welcome 11 to NZ there|pg||
nt|afulton: i have something i would say to that... but it might get deleted by BBO (or get me banned)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS this time.. not much to it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Different strategies possible with West|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|westjava: Japan, leads the way 1 imp from   19|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @C lead make 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what Dawei's plan was with 1@C opener if partner responded 1@H showing @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: just no real play for 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bid 1N ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: agree aholl view|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1NT is 14-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and fortunate cards 3N can't be beat|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: After @CQ @CJ @CA @C4, W suddenly called small @C from dummy, S claimed all tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: sry|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 1@D bid.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is a good spot that can be beaten with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He would enjoy the 3C response from East if there was one|pg||
mb|4S|nt|westjava: 4@H or 3NT EW is ok now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: but has strength for 1N opener so can't be that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not for interrupt but for interested persons: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
nt|allanr44: If west bid 7NT north may lead H   :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East could still try 6 now but it's a gamble|pg||
mb|5S|nt|vugraphzre: 3@D = Good Trump Bad Point explained by W|pg||
mb|6D|nt|westjava: 4@S on the way...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice treatment  Assume 2N is @S raise so DBL for takeout|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's a pretty good 3NT with the overcall though 5C is a bit better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2N puppet to 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: Arline, my guess is she meant to be talking to me |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Clubs don't break so 7NT is out :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: true|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North must bid 6S now|pg||
mb|6S|nt|westjava: August,I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|westjava: so,I dont like ur 3@C pd,S said...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or West's 1@C opening :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: good judgement|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,S will bid 4@S if his hand @CAxxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think i'd try @D3 lead - but don't really like any choices|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been hard by the 12 if S runned one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or if North had short @H then try 4@S|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Rodal:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yup it's Ogust, named after Harold Ogust|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: the 3NT tells Nunn there is stuff wasted in @H, but he has such a nice hard it is difficult to give up there|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: sry,Ogust:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Par contract achieved - well done|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Just behinde Lillik:)|pg||

nt|jcwla: Operation successful...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who hates leads away from Jack so much -- he complains even when it is right!!|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D isn't as good as 6@C, because the @D losers could have been discarded on AKQ@S, probably both were doomed tho|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: can either set up @c or use cross ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: previous board : 3@H was not so bad, super accepting can actually make slam bidding harder, since you dont hear partners natural bid|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No problem for declarer here. Certainly easier than 3NT so good judgment by East|pg||
pc|s5|nt|westjava: ahaaa...so do I Al|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Martin:)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|westjava: 1 imp gain to Japan   20|pg||
nt|mariner1: I too do not like those, especially low from a J if p did not bid or imply the suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence from East because her spade spots mean the suit can't be run if she switches and partner has an entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have used 4@C cue to show slam interest over 3@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: A much more competitive (sense a theme?) OR auction on 19 ended in the same place, 3@H making for a push.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nigel_k:  Best play is probably to start with KS as West is more likely than East to be void|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately it gives away the 12th trick here|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: 2nt=inv 3@D=suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Presumably 2NT is because West had thoughts of slam|pg||
nt|afulton: with my partners, i like an agreement where bid of 3@s = I have very positive accept + useful doubleton (in this case, probably ace) |pg||
nt|sybarra: not the "loviest" 5/5 |pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: The 2@H opening is too rich even for my blood, but it must be what South expected otherwise it would have been impossible to stop. A shame since game does make|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Not only South can ruff but declarer will be cut off from dummy's hearts after drawing trumps|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|nigel_k:  That's better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Was a free signal from N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difficult decision at trick 1 -- especially since declarer is supposed to hold 5@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Aint with u there Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think driving force should have been -- it looks like @C running |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i actually agree with call for @HJ|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,and what decl thinking about?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South should be curious about North overtake to return trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if singleton - why not try to promote partner's length, if doubleton, then must have control of @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer also thinks @C finesse not working??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1H|nt|nigel_k:  Interesting on board 8, at this table they invited game after a 2H opening and the other table passed a 3H opening|pg||
nt|westjava: Thai get 6 imps from   8,3@H only there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this 3@D going to get them to 4@S?|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  N/S doing well here to compete in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: next|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@S & 8-10|pg||
nt|westjava: I think so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and e/w might never find the @C suit |pg||
mb|3C|nt|nigel_k:  Ha|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: at least i think should be 8-10|pg||
nt|mariner1: S should bid game now....... dual fit and short @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt know about clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H a little timid I think|pg||
nt|afulton: played carefully, NS can make 5@H, losing only @d + @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another guess coming -- 3@H shows 2 top honors in @S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh the double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Ok the double was just to test us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prompted by?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Sorry no dbl, just tht all pass and press DK = dbl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I think East was looking for slam there actually :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  just a club guess for the overtrick|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,K of @C on side...|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick in the same 3@D contract earned China 1 IMP on 20.|pg||
nt|patricck: their cc does say 2@H can be 0-8, so maybe Nunn was scared it was even worse than that|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not enough from West unfortunately|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: had us excited operator|pg||
nt|westjava: not too late...|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does a good job|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nigel_k:  After QC wins declarer has to guess whether N has doubleton 10 or South has doubleton King|pg||
pc|sT|nt|westjava: will reach to 6..?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it they reach slam level it will be a tough play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unbelivebel friendly hand for NS, but hard to reach the max|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: W might have over taken and fired a @S back|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why not |pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard had ace of @S,  and ruff  next |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You'd actually want to be in slam with the E/W cards after South's double|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|westjava: so,be careful Hu|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c out beats 6@H and 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec asking for more guesses ---  4@C asks about @C holding  4@D=not 1st/2nd/3rd round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't explain why South asked in @C rather than @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @S were 3 2 this would have more play likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@H = 2 @S honor, so 6@S is very reasonable|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult contract tough to make|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D,that's S need...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one correct guess -- now how about 4@C??|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|westjava: @C asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confirmation of my guess about 4@C only counts if it comes from the table :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: it can be made now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With the KH wrong it would fail of course|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: suggest line of play to make|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|westjava: yes,just need 1 x @C ruff|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|westjava: now,need @D ruff:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trying to ruff hearts looked relatively safe but she's not taking any chances|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: remember to ruff 3rd round of @D|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: could have ruffed a @D  and finessed for J@S and home|pg||
nt|mariner1: at least it would have been a try :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|westjava: 12 imps for 6 boards,good match|pg||
nt|sybarra: so club, over take, ace of spade (if there) and ruff,  ace of @D  =down|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|allanr44: Needs @D lead (or club lead and @D switch) to hold it to 4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|nigel_k:  He should play three rounds of hearts now. When S doesn't follow the club position is clear|pg||

nt|westjava: x again by E better|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Missed opportunity for both teams|pg||
nt|mariner1: this could be an action hand|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3N has good play EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was well done by declerer.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  An easy hand to get overboard on so may not be too bad for N/S|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mariner1: this makes 6@S or 6@C|pg||
nt|westjava: they will|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: as good as 3@C was bad :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no 7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 22 a push at 3NT-1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even peeking at just EW cards, not sure where i'd want to be|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and should be bid|pg||
nt|westjava: key of K@C..!:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and west is sitting |pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  7C is a very good contract and may be reached if East uses 4NT key card now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W is happy :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: @D lead will make declarer very nervous|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With canape you always feel like you want to rebid a 5 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 7@C not reasonable missing a key|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on a double finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 @C precission? Ok to alert it for specs also:)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kiwibridge: again the substandard game is reached|pg||
nt|afulton: three rounds of @c and then @h thru... |pg||

nt|rodal f: Agree Jodan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Jordan|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Very pushy by North|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: trump lead not really best here |pg||
mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: actually @H lead troublesome too|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Might be ok if the Ace was not a singleton, eg AC instead of AD|pg||
mb|p|mb|7C|nt|mariner1: I think we missed a pass here|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls|pg||
nt|mariner1: well bid though|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok 2 rounds and ht thru |pg||
nt|afulton: ok, i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: -3 now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: ggod night and thx for coming :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East needs West to have seven to the king at least plus an ace, which is optimistic|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nigel_k:  On board 6 Macau made 4H at the other table in addition to making 2S at this table |pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: @CA then try @DAK?|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to use @S to reach W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just playing north for @CK seems against the odds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there is no problem for 6@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: that 2@H bid in N is a warning about possible @D splits|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 7, other room didnt get to 6 @H either |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer should take two diamond ruffs now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  Still not a bad game but nothing lying well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they had a coach he might be pointing out the fallacies in their methods|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 6@C makes anyway|pg||
nt|westjava: stil have entry of J@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As it happens the QD comes down but cashing AK first is too risky|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: ok NOW @C finesse|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence by South. Left North on lead to ensure a heart switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tough I still belive 3NT are the best spot. But shallbe down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: i guess this is better than my play of @CA first|pg||

mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Yet another close game|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the lucky lead it's home.|pg||

pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South must be worried about missing slam but his options over 1NT are not great|pg||

nt|mariner1: pcoket|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here.....|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@S, 1@H and 2@C loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S back from W will end its hopes though|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @S can go on @D if no @S back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 = 3rd/lowest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't see Dawei doing anything other than @CAK and @S shift looking at dummy @D holding|pg||
nt|westjava: should be like that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and hoping that his p has A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Dawei ask what 2@S was|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: wondering because no @S lead then no @S singleton|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCruff AH|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D and 1 down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...surprised no exploration for a major.  @D lead would set the @H (Hans' @H) to racing.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You probably wouldn't want to bid this one but the auction is very normal|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|pc|h4|nt|westjava: best line of defence...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think risky not to cash 2nd @C -- imagine North  3613|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@C now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- i'd like to retract that please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 = down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Dawei preserving @C really was very fine play|pg||
nt|westjava: that's why he was thinking a while|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E is still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: frustrating when player at table finds better play seeing only 2 hands than i found looking at all 4 :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, E thinking now at the scence|pg||
nt|westjava: E has to ask what was 2@S..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: S replied W 2@S = 3c+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is another case where holding trump Ace gives defender more choices|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Claim|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: odds?|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Neg X and on for fight bough pairs?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: On Board 23, where Hans conservatively settled for defending 2@S and beating it 1, in the OR Fu has made 4@H on an intricate play in which the AK7 opposite Tx of trumps, with Q986 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: in one defender's hand, came into play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4 should be asking bid|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: So the only big swing so far is 11 to China.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need a @D lead now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W are playing a strong NT so East's 1NT is 12-14 unless I am missing something|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I think I would have bid 3@D over the DBL...... to jack the auction up a level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually people have some mechanism for showing majors over a strong club|pg||
nt|afulton: wow, conservative raise!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W needed to force here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|westjava: Japan add their imps from   27|pg||
nt|sybarra: seen pard in action (balancing) before |pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S is ok|pg||
nt|afulton: but the 1@s bid could have been made without one of those aces|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I  would do more than raise|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but perhaps a 2@H bid might have given some juice to this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: now W can pass info to E cheaply|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@C & 4@S both = cue bids|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One of those rare occasions where N can even show QC if they keep going|pg||
nt|sybarra: so many specs suggestion 2 @H as bid bye W |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if West bidding twice -- i prefer 3@C first   but i think should pass 3@D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Rob,no use redbl|pg||
nt|westjava: no loser in @C,@D and @S,then...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's that chance :)|pg||
nt|afulton: (which would show LR +) |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: the hand with short @D needs honors to pull trump -- so really dislike 3@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: best to play cross ruff here|pg||
nt|westjava: on @H and @D, yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to be sure to cash the A@C in time|pg||
nt|westjava: dont forget to remember|pg||

nt|westjava: no problem...what can decl do..?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the other hand -- defense against 3@D is easy|pg||

nt|rnmalik: strange:)|pg||
nt|westjava: a different plan...|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i dont know either why pitching...what's the line of play??|pg||
nt|mariner1: he did not pitch a loser so|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: and...13 imps again to Japan,4@H-1 here and 4@H+2 there|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session is scheduled in 132 minutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is scheduled to be  Open  Thailand vs Indonesia|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: some partnerships here open W hand 2@D both majors 5/5 minimum less than opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 3rd match of the day  Ladies  China vs New Zealand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very polite of E/W to refrain from interfering with the strong club auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: dont know S pass after 2nt N other table...:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not  sure this slam is easy to bid|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nigel_k:  N/S play weak NT so the 1NT rebid is strong|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,15-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx L a great job look forward to seeing you back|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 2nt minors|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like a candidate for a flat board to me, but I guess the splinter might change that theory|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 24, which ended in the no-chance 6@D in here, the same auction in the OR through 3NT, which Zhao passed.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: not sure why N in Open Room bid 2N in their auction, RED vs White|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room west 2@D open same as our 2@H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A promising start|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The contract is ok on the N/S cards and may make|pg||
nt|afulton: 3@c=Puppet? it was alerted|pg||
nt|jcwla: So that will be another large gain to China.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Saw the same earlyer by the night. A8xx - KJ9. Needed the same inv cut|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: yes is tough........|pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: 3@d=no 5 major but 4 card one or two... |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is the major N does not hold|pg||
nt|afulton: 3@d=ok, i have @s but not 1H|pg||
nt|afulton: sorry, 3@H= i have @s but NOT @h, right rob!|pg||
nt|jcwla: In both rooms the 0-4-4-5 hand was opened 1@D.  Even though the commentators there voted for 1@C, I agree with the 1@D bid.  |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The bad spade break will probably defeat 6C if they get there. It is a good contract on the N/S cards though|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  West preferred his weaker minor that opponents opened. Turns out to be right though.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the clash at the top sees  1 give  2 a fair old lesson I'd say|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: nice lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what was 2 @H over 2 @C?  steps??|pg||
nt|afulton: 3@s=ok, i got 'em too|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|afulton: maybe we hear 4@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got the inv finess free now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: 2NT was for minors probably and S passed|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes that may have been it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and here EW will wonder why they didn't bid 4@H :)   but only after taking 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D nice cue here|pg||
nt|afulton: oh, wimpy|pg||
nt|afulton: yes|pg||
nt|afulton: (sorry, forgot @s trumps)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: slam coming now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @h was 4-6 pts any |pg||
nt|afulton: NICE @c bid!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence by West. South will be short of entries to hand to draw trumps and play diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: XX coming|pg||
nt|sybarra: or skip it?|pg||
nt|afulton: XX would be perfect|pg||
nt|mariner1: REDBL my call|pg||
nt|mariner1: or just blow 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: XX says first round contol |pg||
nt|afulton: or maybe knows enough to just bid the slam now|pg||
nt|sybarra: but maybe just bid 6 sp  and hope for club lead? |pg||
nt|mariner1: holding A & Q @c S needs to know little else........|pg||
nt|mariner1: N can't have Q@S A@D AND Q@H so 7 a question|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant make seven on this layout can she?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 7 makes with @c hook|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|westjava: swing for Indonesia|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|westjava: S should be 3@C after 2nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: since @H are 3 3 too|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with S,    I dont need 7 |pg||
pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  It's going to be two down but still worth competing nonvul. It would pay off if opponents were pushed to 3S.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but why no X|pg||
nt|mariner1: right 7 is not the best %|pg||
nt|afulton: but ... (and I am a woman) didn't Gail Greenberg yell at someone for bidding a grandie that wasn't 18 tricks in a women's event? |pg||
nt|sybarra: but Gail yells at many folks LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I love her dearly but....|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: @S ruff to save 2nd overtrick|pg||
nt|patricck: the lead gives Australia an imp|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: may not play for 7 since only in 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 12 EW are in 6@D , N was silent|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Needs to unblock spades now before cashing the clubs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: indeed that -500 would hurt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good on ya|pg||
nt|westjava: 6@H here and 5@H only other room   14:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  NS will be pleasantly surprised to gain 11 on 14 instead of losing 11|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: wow surprise|pg||
nt|westjava: so,11 imps more to Indo|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Done|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|westjava: first blood for Taipei|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen very solid set from Dawei Chen - Kazuo Furuta|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Al|pg||
nt|westjava: an anchor pair I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, solid set except no @C lead vs 6@S and overbid in 3@S|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but unless you can count a TON of tricks, is very risky to bid grand.... becasue if it doesnt make, you will lose 1530 ... or 780 ... if other room didn't even get to small ...|pg||
nt|afulton: slam|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence and declarer did well to get out for 1 down|pg||

nt|sybarra: pitching from wrong hand actually |pg||
nt|afulton: i mean, we can see that the suits all break on this hand... but when you are playing, you don't have that luxury|pg||
nt|afulton: if ANYTHING doesn't work, the grandie wont work... |pg||
nt|sybarra: so  much easier for us |pg||

nt|mariner1: 2N a forcing ask here?|pg||
