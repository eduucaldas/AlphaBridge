mb|p|mb|2S|nt|royhughes: Let's see if EW can stop at the safe 4-level|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@s by West was a relay|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ace of hearts may allow him to give North two heart ruffs.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1NT showed 4+ @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@c a relay|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@s at least 55 Majors|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2NT relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@d = equal length minors - i.e. 5611 or 6511|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Their system has put West on play in a spade contract, possibly allowing a singleton heart lead from North. |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  3@h = Relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@c = 6511 and 3 controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: Heart to the ace and @H9 (McKenney) to give the first ruff, asking for a diamond return rather than a club return.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @dK, because it is singleton, does not count as a control|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may choose to play in hearts.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so now West knows he's missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|royhughes: and that will work better|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: A kibitzer from the Netherlands tells me that Wijs means 'wise' in Dutch, so he is bound to choose hearts as trumps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, the guy was right.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  lol|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he wants his partner to play it, so he can relax :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: Bothe Fantoni and Nunes are asking..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|royhughes: Well done by EW|pg||
pc|d2|nt|royhughes: And thank you Rob for the explanations!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rhelle:  any time :)|pg||
pc|hA|mc|11|nt|brolucius: Two ruffs might have been possible in spades (with hearts as trumps) if the @SA was the missing major-suit ace. So, West could not really tell which suit was safer, it seems.|pg||
pg||

nt|othered1: Should east have found the defense?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what defense?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: Villas Boas says He saw West signaling @h therefore only singleton K@s would do|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: 6@S-1?|pg||
nt|leao: yes, dynamite board|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
mb|2C|an|forcing|nt|leao: amaral´s @h bid will slow figueiredo down, i guess|pg||
nt|leao: if marcelo bids his @h, that is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west has a problem, too few points for 2@H, some would solve problem with a jump to 3@H, some would ignore the points|pg||
nt|othered1: cash minors lead second @H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this will make, no entry to south|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S can make by forcing entry to dummy in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 1NT here is 19|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 18-20ish|pg||
nt|chick: must be a weak-2 only multi, not including the balanced 20-21|pg||
nt|henryb: And sensible people pass and wait for partner to reopen|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb: the most underused card in the bidding box: the green one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sampaio makes the ultimate fit jump, welcome Henry|pg||
nt|granguru: double dummy EW make 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: making 5 will be fine|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|leao: they´ll stop at game |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the deadly kokish convention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but amaral failed to get the email|pg||
nt|othered1: North south did bid like it was their hand and gave west quite a problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont agree with 5@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this will not be a challange - |pg||
nt|othered1: That said, 5@S is very pushy.  East on the other hand didn't know if west was bidding to make or saving, so didn't act over 5@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: really - ordinary hands so far|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 4@S says pick, i bid 4nt (no you pick)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: this should show hearts and clubs, the 3c rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: although kokish himself inverts the rebids|pg||
nt|othered1: West will get out for 100, not hateful insurance against what could have been a making 5@H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|sybarra2: hello all  |pg||
pc|dT|nt|leao: they bid the 3nt on board 3|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hi Martin |pg||
nt|henryb: Chagas makes sure of the setting trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but if you are always going to bid 4 then 5 when not vul, opponents can bait you with a raise to 5h|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: shirley :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now diamond|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: 5nt useless, you need third round club control|pg||
nt|henryb: Since 4@h is one down on best defense, this is sort of a phantom|pg||
pc|s7|mc|11|nt|sybarra2: this should roll home |pg||
nt|fabsayc: in his series on KCB, Kantar described the use of a side suit at six level as asking for third round control|pg||
pg||

nt|brolucius: Not surprisingly, 3NT was made at the other table, on the deal where Muller won the second club. A 12-IMP swing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14  5422 possible as I said earlier|pg||
nt|royhughes: Does Fantoni make any move towards game here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not 54 in the majors though|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rhelle:  possibly East will keep the bidding open if 2@d - 2@h comes back to him|pg||
nt|royhughes: I would -- how about anyone else?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fantoni will not rush to look for a thin game after his last effort in that direction.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I would too|pg||
nt|royhughes: Do Fantoni-Nunes sometimes superaccept over the transfer?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you read the West-East names together and quickly, some of you may guess why the E-W system is called Tarzan Club (but you need to be older than 16:))|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rhelle:  but I would be nervous ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: West's name is pronounced Weiss|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  I wonder of 2NT is some sort of Lebensohl?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: Presumably 2NT shows both minors. He cannot want to play there.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  showing a 5-card minor and minimum|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wouldn't think it has to do with range, after they have stopped|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: Wijs ask what was X after 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I think I'll stop guessing about the EW system -- Rob has it in hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: South might just have bid 3@D instead of 2NT. Obvious risk of North being 3-3 in the minors on that bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|royhughes: Is there any chance Wijs will compete to 3?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: Not now...|pg||
nt|royhughes: Oh, I missed the auction -- busy typing|pg||
pc|s9|nt|royhughes: It's hard for me to see not simply bidding the long suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: We will see how the maestros hand a 4-3 trump fit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: handle..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I think he'll lose 3 trumps and a @s|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW have lots of spades they can play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and make it on the nose|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: When the trumps are that flimsy, you usually set up the side suit. If you suffer a ruff, it will usually be with the longer trump holding.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed - I confidently predict the @d finesses now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, i remember confidently predicting that East would hold up in clubs, a few boards ago.|pg||
nt|royhughes: I agree with the prediction, but my confidence has long gone|pg||
nt|brolucius: I usually expect the great Italians to have met every possible play situation at least 100 times at the rubber bridge table and that they will never need to think. So, this is a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: surprise. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think Muller has calculated that he can afford to split|pg||
nt|rhelle:  EW play upside down count and attitude .. hence the @d 7|pg||
nt|brolucius: The ruffs comes from the four-card holding, so is not a problem.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  East knows about the doubleton @h from the bidding ...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he will have a pretty good idea about declarer's distribution now|pg||
nt|royhughes: Ace and a club does not work|pg||
nt|royhughes: declarer can set up the hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he judges that declarer is solid in the side suits, he may try another spade, but that does not seem to assist either.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rhelle:  of course, North is declarer, as is being pointed out :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think this may be the best try|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer knows that East started with A-J-10-x, or he would not have wasted the @C10 on the first round of trumps.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  for a humble partscore, this is certainly entertaining|pg||
nt|royhughes: much more interesting than if they had played in a longer trump suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: So perhaps declarer can ruff in the dummy and play diamonds. knowing that East will be ruffing with a trump winner.|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: very fast hand...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was bound to happen at some point. The closed room has overtaken us|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 segments of 14 boards in the Round of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One of the matches in the Round of 32 went to extra time (4 boards)|pg||
nt|brolucius: When a great player thinks for so long, it would be interesting to know what brain-processing is going on.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teaxas Aces against Poland (Texas won)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  de Universiteit van Brighton staat leeg in die periode, en ze verhuren studenten kamers|pg||
nt|rhelle:  oops - sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Free lesson in Dutch|pg||
nt|brolucius: I found it very interesting.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Something about some good-looking students this term?|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: Nunes is finally sleeping... |pg||
nt|royhughes: I have to remind myself that North is declarer (easy to think it is South as in columns)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Not at this pace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can only be Fantoni|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|royhughes: oh, ok|pg||
nt|rhelle:  interesting line of play !|pg||
nt|rhelle:  now the @cAce, and another @s?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but it will take Muller 10 minutes|pg||
nt|royhughes: The spade will stop declarer from ruffing out and enjoying the hearts|pg||
nt|rhelle:  well, he had time to think beforehand ... but he may not have predicted this line of play, of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With some luck this segment will be over by midnight|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c6|pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Well, it was great to see a top-class declarer tackling an awkward 4-3 trump fit. It would have been even better if he could have done it three times as quickly. |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|royhughes: I was just told there were enough tricks if Muller had cashed the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

nt|frankaus: another straight forward 3nT here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but a lucky one in down the same as 5@D|pg||
nt|henryb: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but if that was allowed to make is criminal|pg||
nt|othered1: File under category: Preempts Work|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|chick: 6N can be made on this hand, but not biddable I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: junka has a marginal double|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i filed under bad defense :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: pard can only take me so seriously |pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: @SQ and @HK both onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but it is do or dont, not think then do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble contributed little to describing aranha hand however|pg||
nt|othered1: I can see what north was thinking about.  Tough.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: strange hand, if north exits instead of cashing top spade the squeeze does not operate|pg||
nt|henryb: their dealing machine is in good form: 4@s might well go down and 6@d is beaten on the same bad spade break|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: if this is gerber, they might get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: pushy non-vul raise.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart jack on the lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra2: good hand? |pg||
nt|sybarra2: would you bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think i try to get them one higher with sampaio hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this real|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: instead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i always splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: wow, I wouldn't have believed it, but they did|pg||
nt|chick: some pretty aggressive bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: only making lines available IMO|pg||
nt|chick: yes, the only place he can find enough tricks is exactly the way the cards lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides redouble is support there (3 cards)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then no excuse for club shift|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: he is far from sure of setting 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: possibly, depending on style|pg||
nt|granguru: S needs to guess @HQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra2: we may see ace and a @S now |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||

nt|fabsayc: your down 62, time to get going|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|frankaus: 5@C 3@D 3@S @H|pg||
nt|henryb: the problem with not knowing partner's second suit is that when you have a fit for only one its hard to take good saves|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: Tend to agree, since @C shift is possible if you tout partner off @H.  Or do you give count there?  |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: the argument was that S didn t play @h 2 which would be switch for @c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: attitude first|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|d3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|leao: @c return...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  I think it was, if his partner had a trump higher than the 5|pg||
nt|royhughes: And Rob's prediction (9 tricks) was right, it just took a while|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kind of Fantoni to ensure that we will have comparisons from now until the end of eternity.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced, forcing. He has it all|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: North had to judge whether 3@H would be enough. He might have to bid 3@H on a hand that would normally be worth only 2@H, to shows a heart fit. For that reason he has stretched a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: bit to 4@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh dear, Muller on lead and Fantoni declarer. But this should be faster|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||

nt|royhughes: Yes -- there are 10 tricks when you see all the cards ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very good, Duccio!|pg||
nt|royhughes: Fantoni doesn't know the queen of diamonds is right for him|pg||
nt|brolucius: They played it the right way round, with the clubs protected from the opening lead. Otherwise a club lead (with both honours offside) might have been a problem.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Oh, neither.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|royhughes: It looks like Fantoni-Nunes simply believe that the opponents will do better if left alone to their system|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rhelle:  2@s = 10+, single suited with @d :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Sorry -- I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Psyching conventional or artificial opening bids is forbidden." - Conditions of Contest - so Nunes would not have done that|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so West knows, from the initial pass, a great deal about East's hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: A second consecutive big decision at the five-level.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  knowing that East hasn't got a 2nd suit makes the decision to be both easier and more difficult|pg||
nt|brolucius: This time vulnerable against not.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that is the hard bit ... otherwise just X and take the money|pg||
nt|royhughes: Rob, do you know what dbl and pass mean here?|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|rhelle:  I am not sure ... Steve and I would play pass = forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle:  X = penalties - as we're in a GF situation|pg||
nt|royhughes: Some players invert the meaning of pass and dbl, or do some other thing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Asking for partner's help cannot be a good option when you have those hearts and only two diamonds. What is partner meant to do? |pg||
nt|rhelle:  exactly, hence I'm not sure|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think here you don't mind going to the 5-level if partner has no strength in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: Both Fantoni and Nunes are asking the meaning of X (or pass) but i can't read|pg||
nt|royhughes: but you need a takeout bid to figure out what is trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a situation where a natural system has the edge. West has not shown a long suit yet|pg||
nt|royhughes: If East takes some time, presumably dbl suggested takeout|pg||

nt|vugraphztf: Fantpmo asked to nunes why he didn't bid 3@s and he sadi.. "because it was forcing"|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Fantoni has a choice of responses here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: One is 2@H, 5+ game-forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is true, as a kibitzer points out, that when 3@H is a transfer you can at least stop in 3@S if partner wants to. Whereas 3@S (natural) would be forcing.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He could also have responded 2@C which is game-forcing with clubs, or a balanced hand, or with spade support|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's interesting that Nunes cuebid 4@d even with bad wastage in clubs -- maybe a style difference|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nunes has bid with commendable restraint (holding so much in clubs, although he does have the @CA). |pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe to cuebid is automatic or almost so|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's hand is quite strong. He has club length opposite the splinter and can therefore score some useful ruffs.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|othered1: rare, nowadays, to get to open with a flat 13 in 4th seat.|pg||

nt|othered1: 7@D by a team that was being outplayed isn't surprising|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me would be 2 and void|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|henryb: Its a good thing that single imps are not crucial in this match since many boards are being misclaimed|pg||

nt|othered1: Is east's bidding natural?  Why 2@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i expect void to be irrelevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our East splintered with 3@S over 2@D |pg||
nt|othered1: Are they playing something like Blue Team Club, where the rebid of the 5-card suit was mandatory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so, but i might do it anyway to save space with aceless hand|pg||
nt|othered1: if 5@D is responding to key card ask, maybe excludes partner's secondary suit as a useful void.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: now was afraid 5@H to play, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S looks like ask @DQ|pg||
