mb|p|nt|frankaus: prescott has also represented Aus (paris 2001)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Woolsey and Robinson are two of my favourite players|pg||

nt|othered1: I can see what north was thinking about.  Tough.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: strange hand, if north exits instead of cashing top spade the squeeze does not operate|pg||

nt|henryb: the problem with not knowing partner's second suit is that when you have a fit for only one its hard to take good saves|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: Tend to agree, since @C shift is possible if you tout partner off @H.  Or do you give count there?  |pg||
