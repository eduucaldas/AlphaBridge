nt|brolucius: side-suit winner in dummy.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S from Poland against E-W from France|pg||

nt|pelu: decl can forca an entry in @c|pg||

nt|brolucius: Again declarer is back in overtrick territory because South did not dislodge the club entry. Perhaps he does not know the size of the club pips on the 4th round.|pg||
mc|9|nt|jcwla: Maybe the card gods didn't like the 2@H rebid.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course the overtrick was only there because the diamond were falling. Declarer did not know that., so played on spades instead.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/asp/totalpairs.asp?qtournid=718&qgroupno=1&qroundno=1  for standings after the first session|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I still can't see running scores after each round|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is a measure of the high quality of the event that the leaders from a field of 54 pairs have a score of only 56%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is standard in countries like Poland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, so surely that is possible in Italy too|pg||
nt|brolucius: In a field where the standard is variable, you would expect to need a score of around 65% to lead a 54-pair field.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm  to get to results from all series after session 1|pg||
nt|jallerton: They might be showing running scores at the venue, Roland, just not online|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'm afraid not, Jeffrey|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the days when I used to play, I was always very grateful if the organisers kept quiet about the scores.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and they dont update here I got from a spectator at the venue|pg||
nt|jallerton: The scores include a carry forward from the SF, so they are the equivalent of 3 sessions' bridge, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzth: top five positions after 16 rounds :Suwik-Radziak Brink-Drijver Fitzgibbon-Mesbur Westra-Ramondt Ratynski-Ohrysko|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can you encourage spectators to watch a pairs event if you don't give them instant results?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In my opinion it is boring to watch without comparisons|pg||
nt|brolucius: The comparisons only come after the actual play, so I don;t find them so valuable as in an IMPs match, when you can often see the other table's result before the play starts.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well, happy or not, E-W play the system *they* like|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's a bit pessimistic. West is only worth a game try, surely, opposite a 15-17 1NT and East has nothing to spare. |pg||
nt|jallerton: Roland is a great fan of 4-card majors, weak NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Queens and jack are overvalued by the 4-3-2-1 point-count system.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I invented it in 1931|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I was 29 then|pg||

nt|jcwla: Had S made a t/o X, N would have left it in.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well judged by North, who held a very uninspiring 9 opposite 14-16. In a pairs you cannot afford to say "Well, we might have 25 points."|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: -110 or +50 against 2@H was unlikely to be a good score for North-South, when they expected to make 1NT, so it was open to them to compete in some way.|pg||
