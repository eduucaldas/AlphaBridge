nt|westjava: yes Gary|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Liliek|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: hello again Liliek |pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: sry late:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: oh well I was right then :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nigel_k:  E/W play precision with a 15-17 1NT so the 1NT rebid after 1C will be 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: battle for part score now|pg||
nt|westjava: battle of part score now|pg||
nt|sybarra: you only missed a boring bde |pg||
nt|westjava: also re hi Lawrence Lau:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe an imp at stake |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H here also NS|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|westjava: dbl show strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2@D = good raise in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: all pairs for Chinese Taipei play Precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except  for one|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/index.html  -  Teams (click Particpants to see|pg||

nt|mariner1: Participants then click Flag under event to see convention cards)|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,where the prec system come from (CC Wei)...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 1NT rebid 18-19|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like N/S are going to steal it in 3H |pg||
nt|allanr44: how forcing is 3@D?  Anyone know?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Their card says 10-12 4 card support|pg||
nt|allanr44: then I imagine south can pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since transfer response to 1@C -- i believe EW are Chen-Furuta|pg||
nt|westjava: and looks like standard system from Japan pair|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5C may make on the layout but I doubt they'll bid that high|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: hard to bid:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: leaping to 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: (I think)|pg||
nt|allanr44: well done them!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  E/W have a good chance of making 3S at least but missed out when West didn't double|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzre: W wrote 1@C+1NT=18-20|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No good lead except a spade which is unlikely :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|westjava: right contract but not easy to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wasted values in @S's |pg||
nt|sybarra: got to love it |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Normal lead but unfortunately resolves the diamond suit for declarer so should make 9 tricks now without much trouble|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|westjava: wow,fly too high|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another nice stopping point for Australia.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: well 4@S is too much best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D rebid doesn't fit any of the descriptions in the convention card :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: win in hand, lead @c and its about done|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,EW fly too high|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|westjava: no way to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West is Dawei Chen   East is Kazuo Furuta|pg||
nt|sybarra: club up |pg||

nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East was endplayed and had to establish 10S or KC|pg||
nt|westjava: so,wd Ru|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well played |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Henri @H@H!|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good result for N/S there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ritong: @h shirl & all|pg||
nt|patricck: a good board there for Australia, not only making an extra trick, but EW never found their club fit where they could take 10 tricks themselves|pg||
nt|allanr44: as predicted Nigel.  Hopefully some more challenging situato\ions ,,,Ah, here's one|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: expected 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: NS play 4cM - could be Canape|pg||
nt|westjava: 4 Cards on 3rd hand|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh,ty Lau for info|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no! always 4cM w/Canape|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+ and another transfer response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some can rebid 1N to show 18-19|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i might go to the other room, there is my preferred whipable guy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Patrick, you like a t/o double by Zhuang there?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like 3S for N/S and 3C for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's a benefit of transfer responses|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes can be canape and 2C denies a major|pg||
mb|3C|nt|westjava: 4@S is normal contract for EW|pg||
nt|westjava: might be EW reach to 6@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4C splinter will not encourage East|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Brave reopening double from West|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: on the way...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: raising with 3 frisky then|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: hi again Henri|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, no other way to get into the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has an issue this time|pg||
mb|3S|an|.|nt|westjava: undo pls...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that treatment accept transfer = 2/3 support|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, 1NT would have found clubs but also lets opponents in|pg||
nt|westjava: EW with 23 hcp can do nothing...|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure @H's not friendly |pg||
nt|mariner1: we are not whipable? need remedial training?|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S, 2@H loser|pg||
nt|allanr44: must duck one round|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Ru could have upgraded to 1N|pg||
mb|3N|an|.|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  This is probably asking for trump queen|pg||
nt|westjava: hard to lead @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we just have to find the spades cash  |pg||
nt|jcwla: For sure W's @H holding would preclude any possibility of being misconstrued as penalty.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|westjava: any thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but 4333 in E hand  np|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: that is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like EW using accept=exactly 3  so 1N rebid=bal with 2 in responder's major|pg||
nt|patricck: who would have pushed who how far after that would have been interesting|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: and 2NT rebid show 18-19|pg||
nt|mariner1: careful play makes this|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, very hard |pg||
nt|westjava: may be @D lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W a bit lucky that JD is the twelfth trick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|westjava: without a @H lead,yes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@D=ask @SQ+side K, 5@S=@SQ, no side K|pg||
nt|westjava: agree Gary|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: the more i see it, the more i like the treatment where 1N is used to show the "jump 2N" strength|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|westjava: ok,ty Lau|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
mc|11|nt|nigel_k:  Good start for Thailand|pg||

nt|henryb: Hi Shirley, Vlad, Kibitzers|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not blaming west for the lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: No, I understand.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A push on 2.|pg||
nt|don paulus: See 4 @s EW - but NS may take out in a minor suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: è assurdoprovare interesse per te lo so ma questo è...........tu che didi?|pg||
nt|ady: well if 6@S is bid in OR   then a save|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are doubled in 5@H|pg||
nt|kurtove: 6 nt|pg||
nt|haans: i like 3@C 3rd hand|pg||
nt|kurtove: because q of spades double|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes - Declarer winng with DQ instaed of 10   later N ducking with DJ|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they cover the cards with their hand sorry sometimes I don't see at all|pg||
nt|haans: Mårten won swedish pairs championship three times running claiming luck|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Henry|pg||
nt|henryb: Hello all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Henry|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H overcall?|pg||
nt|haans: easy 4@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nice hand for south but a weak suit... interesting to see which level he opens the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H i think|pg||
nt|haans: may b 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here it seems|pg||
nt|rnc: Thx Massimiliano|pg||
nt|panja: the only counterpoint is, double dummy element in the commentary is a given.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kurtove: and kqj10 in club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|raghavan: Deal No 1 - Open room 4S bid and made so Welland gets7 IMP|pg||
nt|milton_se: decent 6C goes down|pg||
nt|raghavan: Henry > I hope u saw > Last deal was interesting |pg||
nt|jeanhari: hand has much potential|pg||
nt|haans: yes 1@H was an option|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@H not my choice|pg||
nt|haans: what is+|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but it will get a raise|pg||
nt|haans: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tiny.cc/eegFD  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|jeanhari: heart partscore for EW|pg||
nt|rnc: Now we know who is who|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N high enough here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Maybe too high|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they mistake plaing on the table and not on bbo|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4 of a major here after some interference by N/S probably.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 off for 500 n/s save some profit not the royal mint tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: neve wont be kept out|pg||
nt|kurtove: but 10 of diamonds cant go wrong|pg||
nt|milton_se: well, Cs won't affect it -- he has to get a C trick to succeed|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S possible EW|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: good board for England|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H  a great save|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be very light as we see here, even vulnerable|pg||
nt|haans: a now 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|raghavan: We are seeing Zia Mahmood as E and Welland as W  They represent USA 2 to world team championship @@ Brazil|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S for EW here but may be hard to reach|pg||
nt|mariner1: easy for E to get them too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Normal contract may be 4H by E|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Not quite right|pg||
nt|haans: many now double meaning 4+ spade|pg||
nt|daman: I like a 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good start though... 1@H p 1@S now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wwalter: she had 2@c+ 1@s as losers|pg||
nt|trotto: an be ,couse error of operator ,Joanna played ,in second trick , ce of  trumps ( and next @sQ) that's correct safety play|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the same imps :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@h= to justify N's choice :)|pg||
nt|trotto: Ace of  trumps*|pg||
nt|panja: Even 3@D might be too high here..|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no........ she claim sanding I give you 2@c 1@s and K@H|pg||
nt|xenya: another 4@H for EW|pg||
nt|don paulus: 5 now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wont encourage north to save|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pressure bid of 4@C opposite passed pd, well within Rule of 2-3-4 guidelines.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too many major suit losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c mandatory at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 3c at green|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh all pass|pg||
nt|raghavan: after 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Zia does, not Welland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Zia's partner is Hamman|pg||
nt|henryb: looks like a straightforward major suit of NT game|pg||
nt|jeanhari: saw a dutch player in the other match open 4@H|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be helpfull|pg||
nt|rnc: Easier now|pg||
nt|mariner1: RDBL a transfer to @c?|pg||
nt|davidstern: The weather here in Sanremo is a lovely 25-27 degrees with some humidity. It is an excellent seaside town to hold a bridge tournament. Lots of accommodation and food options|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N? Some bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: np grazie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I use D to show a 4-card suit in @s and a bid atleast a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now W has to guess|pg||
nt|davidstern: West is lucky he has the @C8|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @c lead does not really help|pg||
nt|davidstern: Godefory obviously subscribes to the 2NT can never be right|pg||
nt|rnc: And in Sweden it's (still) raining (:|pg||
nt|davidstern: @HA @HK and low heart will likely make|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: 3NT  can make  as A@C with North    but 5@C   the better contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he will not punish his pd for the overcall|pg||
nt|milton_se: NS playing 12-14 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: WHO ??????????????????? :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Roland|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult contract|pg||
nt|star6ija: always is dificult to win 3N when you have less points than opps :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Sid Ismail from South Africa|pg||
nt|newmoon: hello Roland, Hi all   :)|pg||
nt|haans: but east will bid 4@S he can count @H|pg||
nt|haans: but who is prempting|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and that´s why i don´t like D inn this sequence|pg||
nt|werge: This 2 @H is not my cup of coffee|pg||
nt|xenya: well not so hard :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: do u know that the X was? - some play that X = 4 card @S and 1@S = 5 card - but X as 5 card @S I have never seen before|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 4@S is criminal|pg||
nt|star6ija: but is very close|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could end here|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure is not a normal RDBL showing count|pg||
nt|daman: nah|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3-6 point less than 4 @d|pg||
nt|panja: either way, if there is no double dummy bias that is evident....we assume it makes single dummy sense|pg||
nt|haans: but it needs to be said sometimes|pg||
nt|rnc: true|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|panja: I guess this well need a trump lead to restrict to 11 tricks...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|haans: trumps lead not popular today do you agree?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: o course can bid 3n gambling if they play it to show this sort of preempt|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will try to find a CC for them|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4NT nat now?|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Sid|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N by South? strange call|pg||
nt|haans: yes all options BUT 2@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 13 tricks here, another 3 imps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|sommer: I would bid 2@H too|pg||
nt|werge: Which confirms my opinion|pg||
nt|mariner1: least not the 10+ .. maybe a neg count|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly, but he has an entry for a @H finesse...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north probably lead a diamond|pg||
nt|henryb: I think N-S are relaying|pg||
nt|daman: W might bid 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you get an error by clicking on that link, it's because there are too many hits at the moment. Try again later|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Massimilano so it is neg count|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has exactly one entry to dummy and nothing he does works|pg||
nt|panja: with only once Ace and a void, Balicki is not likely to bid more|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: they made one on 1|pg||
nt|milton_se: probably their way w GF hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Henry! I only can see it as forcing  for N to show his distribution|pg||
nt|henryb: South|pg||
nt|fann4: Isn't 4@S as 'shut out'ish as can be|pg||
nt|panja: a void in partner's suit...that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Yes N shall show his...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but for me it´s the reversed way|pg||
nt|henryb: presumably N now knows S is 5=5=0=3 with a minimum and 4 controls|pg||
nt|henryb: which makes his hand much less good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bud in my opinnion N has to downgrade his hand with @dAQxx|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would like to see their convention card - How can South proceed on cue bids without much information from N except game force.|pg||
nt|henryb: actually, once S showed 5-5 in the majors at least one of North's queens became wasted|pg||
nt|henryb: not cue bids; North is asking and South is telling|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: found their best spot|pg||
nt|haans: Hi all Welcome all kibitzers|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: First three in each group will qualify for Swiss A after 5 rounds Rest will play in Swiss B |pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: X = 4+ @ss - 1@S = max 3 card @S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sid :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h is in fact better than 4@s on S.|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure about N's 4@H though|pg||
nt|xenya: so probably down anyway |pg||
nt|xenya: but we shall see|pg||
nt|mariner1: W would have been better off ducking that @D to let E in|pg||
nt|mariner1: now W has Zugzwang'd himself a bit|pg||
nt|rnc: ...for a @S-shift|pg||
nt|xenya: a @S now beats it for certain|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: this was a sweet lead 4 declar :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Information.htm   only website I have |pg||
nt|xenya: is there a sure line for 10 tricks here? |pg||
nt|henryb: sure? I don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean without seeing NS's cards of course|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil NS going as you feared to 6C - The X oD will not discourage|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho maybe not third in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: depend on style|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like claim will follow quickly|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to play transfers after overcall so X= @s transfer|pg||
nt|henryb: He said: spades, spades and hearts, hearts at least 5, 5=5=0=3|pg||
nt|werge: Take a look at the bidding in OR - and you get one MORE reason NOT to bid 2 @H|pg||
nt|xenya: not much to the play here it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: N had to remain silent..then, E might not go for game|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably end up with 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dcbutler: 9 tricks for declarer on any lead with this layout|pg||
nt|haans: that has been mpore and more popular|pg||
nt|raghavan: X of D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The slam is roughly 50% and bid at many tables|pg||
nt|haans: what do you think about that lead?|pg||
nt|rnc: This works also, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: so does the @D, as it happens |pg||
nt|mariner1: now W has a real problem|pg||
nt|davidstern: North profile (assuming it is Godefroy) http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=6234 Fantun http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=20158|pg||
nt|rnc: East's @D7 is a good card|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers calling for W to chuck Q@H under AKh|pg||
nt|xenya: one pf the best, yes|pg||
nt|werge: Hi - a @C-lead would be a good start on this monday|pg||
nt|werge: Seems to end up with uninteresting 450|pg||
nt|haans: but would have still be a make|pg||
mc|11|nt|charles_l: helpful|pg||
nt|ritong: although he knows south has a @s top|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is not a good hand for those who subscribe to "always lead an ace against a slam"|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Sid|pg||
nt|haans: yes need clubs support to bid on|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Yes -50 is very good for N/S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Another 8 card suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe there will be more bidding than yesterday's one :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores only here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard for east because he won't place partner with a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|allanr44: many tricks for EW here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|westjava: perhaps the same other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 41H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 41h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@h|pg||
nt|patricck: that was another 20 point game, but much more difficult to bid than board 1, and needed a little more luck to make as well|pg||
nt|allanr44: that is true|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: E migth saw this one off|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=1-suit  @H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: Thai leads the way now|pg||
nt|westjava: and 4@S N..!:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in a couple of @D I think|pg||
nt|patricck: aah, the first board, which was board 17 of course|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: A VIEW i wouldn't favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H/@S overcall would be 4M & 5+minor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North does have a good hand but slam is a long way off and the diamonds are a worry|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @S bid keeps S from balancing|pg||
nt|jcwla: The Duplimate has split the points between the pairs very evenly.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|westjava: if not Capp or DONT,what's the name of 2@D by N..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I assume she was considering a heart slam not a spade game|pg||
nt|sybarra: rightly so |pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: all VUL and 1@S pass out|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead makes this easier|pg||
nt|westjava: a lovely lady of @H|pg||
nt|allanr44: hard to miss, with a 2@C opening|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Patrick, would 3@D over 1@D be your choice with Nunn's hand?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's been a while since I saw someone not open a balanced 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: as the card lie 2 and even 3@H has play NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 3 or 4 now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: win Q@H and lead @c|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|westjava: also not Brozel's|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: it depends what it means in Tony's system|pg||
nt|patricck: I like to bounce the opponents around too, so if playing solid intermediate jumps, would make the bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Wow|pg||
nt|allanr44: 7 is on the hook.  depends on the trailing team|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: @H and a minor:)|pg||
nt|westjava: may be:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it looks a bit like Woolsey where 2@D="multi" but Kit's version DBL covers the 4M & 5+minor so 2M overcall = 5M+@C/@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: there are several NT defenses that use transfers|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|allanr44: strange|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: mmm helpful|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|westjava: different plan|pg||
pc|c8|nt|westjava: I am using Brozel's with my pd, 2@D = @D and @H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|patricck: their system card just says intermediate jumps when vul....certainly was a good one, but needed to be with the hand partner had|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Looking for a fourth trick I guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: needed to lead @c at trick 2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,why not..?:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|allanr44: It did not occur to me that the contract would be 4@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West should expect to take 12 tricks at least|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: for max result|pg||
pc|s5|nt|westjava: loser on loser|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good line and should be able to make three trump tricks now|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should win and lead @D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,before @D return from N|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: "we" are not doing so badly now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|westjava: he will|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|allanr44: I hold west 100% responsible|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  He can't just get rid of trumps and play winning clubs but he can use the clubs as a threat to stop opponents playing trumps while he crossruffs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|sybarra: so only 5  |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mariner1: so making 5,,, hard to argue with success|pg||

nt|dcbutler: quiet 4 hearts here |pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   easy for e/w|pg||
nt|haans: M löfgren|pg||
nt|haans: weak 2 2 aces???????????|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3NT now is possible for NS|pg||
nt|werge: Was South afraid of NOT getting the @D Ace?|pg||
nt|xenya: seems communications were a bit awkward for declarer to take a safety play in @Ss|pg||
nt|davidstern: EW have to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK OK Finita I am told|pg||
nt|haans: wast have at least 18 (19) points|pg||
nt|werge: West played faster than I saw|pg||
nt|haans: yep speeeedy|pg||
nt|werge: He even made 650 against my 450...|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: the cards lie well for N-S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 2 - EW went to 3NT down 1 - So Welland got 5 IMP - now total 12|pg||
nt|jeanhari: speculative, too much lenght in clubs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but could be a winner|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Best chance to get into the bulletin|pg||
nt|haans: is H Welland Mr Welland?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Mr welland in west |pg||
nt|xenya: but i'm not sure|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 22 both went to 4s -1 push|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: hmmm CC says 14 -16 NT..|pg||
mb|p|nt|kurtove: 6 h or 6 cl or 6 nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: CC is from Pau, might have made changes since|pg||
nt|haans: not any more :))|pg||
nt|aupillon: 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be weak NT for the double by Nunes|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|milton_se: this should be 4H making|pg||
nt|milton_se: but S has to duck a S lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: they do play leb here|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@d also as well as 4@s|pg||
nt|newmoon: so probable 3D... or even 5D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 4), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting mix of cards here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not for sure, wellannd cant see through the cards didnt took the best line|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: new players now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|charles_l: 2@s in 4th maybe?|pg||
nt|panja: if a @C is not led, NS can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think you need 4@s together with 3 @h|pg||
nt|henryb: what would you respond with the S hand?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might make in W|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: bad lead mister|pg||
nt|haans: she was called henner in previous match|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she gave me her name :) Welland H.|pg||
nt|daman: do they play DONT?  or a version of same?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Need to get spade lead and sneak through a heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or get two hearts|pg||
nt|haans: polish clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes polish club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: 4@S  too high at the vulnerability for n/s   even if guessing the minor suits well|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont happen much on this deal either|pg||
nt|haans: no boring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 8 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|daman: Garner will get frisky here|pg||
nt|haans: board 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@c by S = ??????|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It is not this board|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome to misfit corner|pg||
nt|jcwla: Leslie likes this auction so far.|pg||
nt|ritong: won t happen|pg||
nt|aupillon: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play X= strength vs weak NT|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces now nowdays :)))|pg||
nt|rnc: And with spades 4-1 North would probably have tried to tap declarer by continuing hearts|pg||
nt|daman: with his @C void|pg||
nt|jeanhari: thats looks forcing to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: or @H lead and win 2@H with no @c shirt|pg||
nt|rnc: Will be hard to stay out from 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|charles_l: 2@c must be drury|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: in cl|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H my bid|pg||
nt|kurtove: 7 cl|pg||
nt|hedyg: vs strong double would be 5m+4M|pg||
nt|milton_se: easy now|pg||
nt|kurtove: and now its easy|pg||
nt|haans: none nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: if so they get too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: shift|pg||
nt|haans: sure fast|pg||
nt|werge: Now E/W look more dutch to me...|pg||
nt|werge: A fair 6 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm they may well miss their heart fit|pg||
nt|newmoon: took 4@S as a cue?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they yook wrong way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c for me|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s seems very conservative, but driving to 3@s seems like a lot|pg||
nt|raghavan: Will HQ be the lead?|pg||
nt|rnc: For sure - they are Polish :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: well brave effort by west with 7 count|pg||
nt|dcbutler: not at this vul|pg||
nt|ritong: now west has a serious problem|pg||
nt|ritong: his part showed a good limit raise |pg||
nt|dcbutler: wonder how much 2NT showed?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   looked enough with that collection|pg||
nt|ritong: agreed|pg||
nt|dcbutler: looks like a mixed raise (at best) to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oliver can you explain the bidding - I could not understand what is 2Club by S?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead in any case|pg||
nt|haans: we do not have their cc|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think they will make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes @H lead and it looks good|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: IT IS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I'll say, both aces on side, the qj of @H flopping |pg||
nt|xenya: VERY well, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: would this bid not show a stronger hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ady: east hoping for the best here  QJ spades look poor values on the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: was 4@H fast arrival (negative bid) ?|pg||
nt|haans: why not start with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: trouble:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pre empts creat problem - that is what is intended|pg||
nt|newmoon: makes sense, Hans  :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is matter of style, but...|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|davidstern: As long as declarer doesnt try a spade to then|pg||
nt|davidstern: ten|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S 2@H 4@D and it makes in no @c shift|pg||
nt|davidstern: But if declarer plays hearts straigh back there will be a smell in the air|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but it will not be clear to N what it is from|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer's best play @HK and low club to hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think win @H and play one back is it|pg||
nt|davidstern: That will certainly get a club ace shift I suspect|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bet not :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table finessed @S10 I am told|pg||
nt|mariner1: i n@@o 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: if declarer plays @Ds now, it shouldn't be difficult for N to work things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|rnc: If win and continue hearts, doesn't it looks like you have fast tricks? Just need a second @H-trick. Then the @C-shift is more likely to come|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pelu: tre other 3 hand = the bidding, but S??|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe South's 2@C shows both majors, but West doesn't care|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|pelu: or dont know? - if opp alert 2@C u dont exp both majors .)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: We had a problem at the begin, they switched Open and Closed Room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
nt|ritong: danger zone entered|pg||
nt|ady: yes    too high now|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@c is not possible because it is forcing to game (artificial in their methods)|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in trouble now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and he will make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I was away a minute|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it a weak opening in a Major?  and 2H by N is pass or correct?|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sounds like it|pg||
nt|xenya: i could make this contract|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now will he pas this dbl?|pg||
nt|daman: the 3@S bid was uncalled for|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must be|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: how about a @C?|pg||
nt|mariner1: thinking too long also gives them a signal|pg||
nt|fann4: Ew in 3NT in the CR, making on a @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|haans: 13 hcp for opps|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by S - also 5D makes but this 4H is a trial on way to 5D|pg||
nt|haans: but will it make?|pg||
nt|werge: Problem in 6 @H is, that you have "some" possibilities in the @S-suit, in 6 NT it´s easy play = double finesse|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Morning Hans x 2 and Martin|pg||
nt|haans: morning Roland|pg||
nt|werge: - and you go down in 6 NT, I think 6 @H makes easiily|pg||
nt|werge: Morning Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
nt|haans: yeah need only 1 ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: But all in all, the auction could have been considerably worse.  This spot is reasonable if perhaps not ideal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he didnt know he would find partner with 100 honours in dims|pg||
nt|haans: may be 10-12 nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: W not happy about the pull here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must know his partner has stretched|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may pass 4D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if E tries to reason out the cards it should show him W has a @c stack,,,,,,|pg||
nt|werge: I take every bet, that this board will be a swing - and I have NOT seen it played in OR!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|raghavan: a good lead 1H+3Spades + atleast 1 minor K|pg||
nt|rnc: Me too...|pg||
nt|sommer: like a walk in the park:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but normaly south should have some fit for bidding 3@S in second round|pg||
nt|daman: if you live by the sword you should be prepared to die by the sword and pass 4@C doubled|pg||
nt|haans: i do not bet against you here :)))|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: this should be a useful swing to Neve|pg||
nt|kurtove: do they play 2 club as gf?|pg||
nt|mariner1: same play here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still need club now though|pg||
nt|davidstern: North can divine that declarer is looking for ninth trick and might get aggressive|pg||
nt|xenya: can postpone that|pg||
nt|mariner1: now N knows W has the @H's|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think North will get this right|pg||
nt|davidstern: He knows declarer likely has 3 spades and four diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N in fact made on 3 so 7 imps to Herbst|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will give north due credit if he does it but I wouldnt think it is defence of the year material|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @S finesse looks a reasonable play|pg||
nt|mariner1: the other problem is if N plays A@C what are S's signals?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am betting @CA next|pg||
nt|xenya: at least it's the only legitimate chance to make -- or nearly so|pg||
nt|rnc: and this seems to go one off|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: S doesn't know that, of course -- from her perspectibe, contract mau be in real danger |pg||
nt|henryb: this is not worth a 15-17 1N (I do not know their range) and Jx is not a holding you particularly want to have as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5422 pattern  (yuck) |pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has already his 2 suiter hand If W still doubles, E must respect w decision|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Zia bidding immediatly as south|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: the spot is ok its just the layout which is savage of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|ritong: hello G|pg||
nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: looks like I missed some action already|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, first boards swinged|pg||
nt|daman: this will swing too    doomed|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not neutral either, rite|pg||
nt|daman: aggressive bidding by West opposite a passed hand   will pay the price|pg||
nt|rnc: And it's not the Jurassic one this time|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk5: The most notable fact is that Team Lavazza did not qualify for Swiss A and that they won't qualify for the knockout phase either. They are currently 28th in Swiss B|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: a classical way to only loose 1 @s trick. a small from the table to 7 and next @sQ pinning the @sJ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well I was half right but -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done Godefory|pg||
nt|davidstern: Godefroy|pg||
nt|mariner1: small @c works too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's good enough - 12 IMPs|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|xenya: sigh of relief from S|pg||
nt|xenya: now she will be quick to grab 11 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: W in 3N in Open Room here|pg||
nt|fann4: E must play 3 rounds of @H to promote West's @SK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: In the OR W passed the 2@C rebid and Hinden went -2 for -200.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Leslie knows that preventing spade ruffs more important than worrying about trump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: in most natral systems the ability to show heart suit in  a weak hand would not exist|pg||
nt|ampelman: my version is from july 2008|pg||
nt|hedyg: the players all had give in their CCs before play started, shame we have no access to them|pg||
pc|h9|nt|raghavan: 4 Spades, 5D making but did not stop|pg||
nt|sommer: but no overtrick with @Sshift|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: We dont know, but asume that West didnt know :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised to see they play 2@c as weak both majors as they are not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||
nt|haans: fantunes then did they make it?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|oliverc: Apparently, NS play Dwururka - the Little major like system developed by Pazur|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's going on?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: renonce by west director on table|pg||
nt|jeanhari: such dull board, operator must com into action !:)|pg||
nt|haans: i think Heller say 1 trick for @HK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kurtove: 2 cl not GF|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: can claim that now|pg||
nt|lestergold: good defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Mu sequence had been 1@s - 2@c 2@d - 2@s - P. 2@s had promised a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes nice swing here|pg||
nt|rnc: I have not read the conditions of contest, but if it's the same procedure as in the Mixed Teams there is an advantage in finishing on top since you have some choosing possibilities ...|pg||
nt|rnc: for the KO-match.|pg||
nt|panja: this might turn out to be a good sac against 3Nt|pg||
nt|haans: squeeze?|pg||
nt|haans: may be best play in 4nt|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes W squeezed in @D and @Ss|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: now the trump trick is still there!! and all the spades too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi yer  Bill|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of rebidding 1NT with the E hand.  Certainly reasonable to rebid 2@C (as both did) with nine cards in two suits, but 1NT would have worked like a charm here to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: allow E/W to drop dead in 2@H.|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill.|pg||
nt|milton_se: killing lead though|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: still one|pg||
nt|haans: and still a spade loser|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|don paulus: 2 off also ?|pg||
nt|ady: 7@HX  on board 16 should have been a save against a vul 6@S making    but the contract in open room was 5@HX|pg||
nt|daman: East assumed a Drury stance with 3433  9 count    not clever|pg||
nt|ritong: well it saved some anyways|pg||
nt|ritong: which is the target of sacrifices:)|pg||
nt|daman: some of those targets are pretty small|pg||
nt|ady: turned out an 11 imp loss rather than a possible 12 imp gain|pg||
nt|daman: Barry Crane used to say....."Only Jesus saves..."|pg||
nt|kurtove: so it is a bit hurry to bid 4 h now, i think|pg||
nt|davidstern: One thing that has impressed me in these championships is the very large number of young people at this tournament|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are right, Carl|pg||
nt|haans: is that not really at 2nt opening|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: D 10 ruff is begging|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Who would have thought this 1NT would take about an hour to play?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bet if W has won @H in hand and led one back this would have made|pg||
nt|Walddk5:  1 gets to choose first, then  2, and so on|pg||
nt|rnc: They are on their way to make it (3NT) in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Among 17-32|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cJ|nt|athene: West could bid 2@H natural non-forcing over 2@C as a passed hand, surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this could be flat with the defence taking 6 tricks unless endplayed which i think is do able now|pg||
nt|haans: endplaying W H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb: not quite yet|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but now @c ruffing was waiting in ambush|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|davidstern: Whenever I am in the corridors there are plenty of young players|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: Some rebid 1NT as a matter of course, some would do it if the stiff @S were an honor.  Matter of style.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oliverc:  "Dwururka" system: http://www.geocities.com/daniel_neill_2000/sys/Dwururka.txt|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|nt|henryb: most American pairs would bid 1@s-1N-2@d-3@s-P|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: psuedo squeeze only|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb: now|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Henry, i miscounted|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c9|nt|henryb: 1N would be a one round force and this would show a three card limit raise|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s7|nt|dcbutler: declarer needs both QJ of diamonds (or 4) in north|pg||
nt|haans: really good endplay|pg||

nt|westjava: brb|pg||
nt|westjava: best result,so wd|pg||
nt|westjava: the new leader with 1 imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost a BAM game |pg||
nt|westjava: again, battle of part score|pg||
nt|allanr44: a serious loss, vul|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Possibly East denied both minor aces but looking at the West hand that is unrealistic|pg||
nt|allanr44: Give me AK A, and partners 2@C, there is no way short of slam|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: EW in 4@S here I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who I vote for hee|pg||
nt|sybarra: *hrere|pg||
nt|sybarra: *here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  partscore swing to China on the second board - they made 2C at the other table and 2S here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcwla: A flat looking 3NT here.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: 6@S is too much with @c ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: 6@S down by @C lead:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to hope they do not WIN it|pg||
nt|allanr44: Maybe it is a home ground advantage?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rnmalik: true that contract is also there|pg||
nt|sybarra: fingers should not do the walking  obviously |pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Are they playing uphill and into the wind in the first half?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not a fan of overcalling 2C on that sort of hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor me |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: here is same, never overcall this w/5332 and poor @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@D a nice nuetral spot for all|pg||
nt|westjava: for -1, I think|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|westjava: Thai gain 8 imps from   2, play only 3@H|pg||
nt|westjava: @D lead..??|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but probably a frustrating start for the chinese pair, they have already defended 4 making contracts in 4 boards, this is going to be the 5th|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: a good stop|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT not my choice to show this hand but nothing much matters here.|pg||
nt|patricck: what would you like Jordan?|pg||
nt|allanr44: In Wellington?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Into the wind in Wellington you'd be worried about game going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: You're right Patrick, defense is "a trick harder on every hand" and even if the boards are flat, it just doesn't "feel" great to defend making contract after making contract.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|allanr44: you'd be worrying about survival!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|jcwla: 2NT.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|westjava: but enough tricks for decl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway 2NT here looks ok, concede a heart and make three hearts, three clubs, a spade and a diamond|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|mariner1: I was thinking small @c back hoping S has A@D and will cash and lead one|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: sets up the 1 trumptrick :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: For the specs:  Wellington NZ is known for its breezes   :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: One overtrick IMP to China in 4@S on 17.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nigel_k:  Can she find KH now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: if trust E @ST, always @HK|pg||
nt|patricck: close I guess, must be worth somewhere between 2 and 3 and it is a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcwla: Oh pd wants to be there as much as I do.  When we aren't there is the rare time we definitely don't want to be there.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, vwd|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: nice|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, easy nine tricks. Should be flat.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4H E/W has some chances but is very thin|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: next pl |pg||
nt|mariner1: 8@C asked for the @H switch which was also reasonable|pg||
pc|s9|nt|westjava: @S for @H loser now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|patricck: So you believe in conservative invitations because partner is an aggressive accepter?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Actually East will be squeezed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|westjava: yup:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  His best hope is partner with 9D|pg||
nt|westjava: making is enough,decl claim:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
nt|allanr44: this is very ordinary ...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  he does have a guess as North could have six spades and clubs 3-3|pg||

nt|henryb: more 4@h contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3 down sorry :)|pg||
nt|daman: easy @S game now   a breather|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 3 - again IMP to Welland - OPEN room bid 3NT made 5 |pg||
nt|oliverc: if one has say 4 + spades is suppose to bid 1 D - 2 below actual call :) So 1C = 4 +|pg||
nt|oliverc: H. So presumably 2@C was a weak 2 in Hearts|pg||
nt|werge: Solid game - bad slam, but both can make|pg||
nt|raghavan: deal 24 5 IMP to Welland - 2h made here, 1NT made by team mates|pg||
nt|mariner1: another misfit here|pg||
nt|davidstern: I bet not|pg||
nt|mariner1: sometimes thinking just alerts the opponents|pg||
nt|davidstern: Defence always wary when declarer plays to establish tricks in your suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would take your money David :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: BRB|pg||
nt|rnc: Did|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The 5 teams from the Swiss will be numbered 28-32|pg||
nt|mcarroll: For Squeeze needed to cash @Cs first|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see 3nt making here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: if east bids 6@S, Sabine had better lead the right ace!|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6C for EW|pg||
nt|aupillon: stop before 4 spades ? :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: sort of|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Swiss B that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: the push to 5@H on the last cost 10 big ones|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brgpro: looks like 12 tricks in @s for E. why? well, you tend to lead from your short AK....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so Badger's on the board with 3.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 down how come i missed something obviously|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@C/@D by EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: but not a good slam|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt good prempt|pg||
nt|aupillon: now minor slam in progress ...|pg||
nt|kurtove: 5 club|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely changed their system, last year this was 20-21|pg||
nt|aupillon: try 4 spades, a Splinter bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 23 here NS 3NT-2, in OR 4D made so welland gets 8 IMP|pg||
nt|newmoon: they should get to 6@H here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@D must show the majors here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: really he alerts pass ...............|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: but not when west has shown hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: the vulnerability should deter EW from sacrificing|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Bergen now?|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d would a tad pushy|pg||
nt|milton_se: doesn't look like that :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: only H lead sets 6C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that means that after  - alt least - 1@s opening it´s impossible to play 1nt|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to stop in 1N|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: as he now surely will|pg||
nt|ritong: be*|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in fact north pass :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S best contract|pg||
nt|haans: or 21D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For E/W anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@H looks the limit on good defense|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, 12 tricks in 4@S with a good view|pg||
nt|raghavan: D bid showing both majors |pg||
nt|mariner1: problem is N might think they need to guard over tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: very true, Rob, but N shouldn't be caught sleeping here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well as I said, thinking that long alerts the opponent that there is an issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok - maybe he won't get the chance|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I raise,  wonder if 2 @S or 3 H! is better |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H |pg||
nt|don paulus: ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The club layout might see this one home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here game to be bid but both 3n and 4h look precarious on thelayout|pg||
nt|pelu: 11-14 5-5 in m|pg||
nt|haans: not an easy make  4-1 in @H|pg||
nt|newmoon: Zia's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|haans: only @CK right|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h possible here, even though the trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bd 2 hot wines get 12   and Bd 3 - Zeleski get 10 IMP |pg||
nt|henryb: that is correct. its not my choice but it would be the most common over here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Running scores are back|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass might be 5-7 count|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will make on B15, but 4@H in 43 fit, yet again, might be a better spot a priori|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, W made an immediate 2@S wjo|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
nt|oliverc: Apparently 2@C was 4+5+ in the Majors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will bid 3 I presume|pg||
nt|jeanhari: too late for predictions :)|pg||
nt|haans: yes prepared to stretch|pg||
mb|2S|nt|davidstern: So Bessis on the board|pg||
nt|haans: icedlandic pecision perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men då kan jag påpeka att typ ägg typ inte är helt rätt...|pg||
nt|werge: or 2 of them...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Some play X as 5-7 and pass is <4|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might bid 2@S here..... and play in a Moysian a level lower|pg||
nt|panja: did they end up in 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: even less now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: trtue|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
mb|3D|nt|milton_se: the reasonable contract|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|aupillon: sure,clubs 2/2, diamonds 2/2....|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I am getting some tea|pg||
nt|ritong: showing @ds and @ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: very fat 2C -- may be hard to communicate|pg||
nt|jeanhari: should help enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: with limited access to dummy this helps solve one issue|pg||
nt|rnc: Zimmerman 16 VPs ahead of Apteker going into this round, 13 VPs ahead of 2nd (Jacob), so it's odds on for Zimmerman winning the Swiss A|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes, Helness jumped straight to 3NT|pg||
nt|werge: Better take your 300 against 2 @S X|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s would be an egregious overbid|pg||
nt|ritong: bergen style not popular in france|pg||
nt|daman: merci|pg||
nt|daman: quatre piques fait cing ici|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|daman: cinq*|pg||
nt|ritong: joli , G|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table North playing 3@D on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Precision is SO much easier to understand LOL|pg||
nt|newmoon: swop @H8 and @H7, and it gets difficult    :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: missed... 1@s overcall slightly misleaded them|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer shouldn't be given a chance to get a spade away from either hand on a long minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt must be lebesohl|pg||
nt|haans: leben|pg||
nt|raghavan: good lead |pg||
nt|milton_se: only +1 now|pg||
nt|raghavan: there are 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|newmoon: panel - response to 1@C?   1@D or 1@H ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: not to be|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: 3@H for me too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's one (of many) reasons why Meckwell usually play so fast|pg||
nt|mariner1: the VUL position makes this tough|pg||
mb|d|nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow saly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hans you havent seen commentators manual Page 4 Paragraph 7 - we save bandwidth and do not correct minor typos|pg||
nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: May lose 1-2-2-1|pg||
nt|davidstern: For -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H not played could have developped 1 more in D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks quite normal though -- and makeable|pg||
nt|panja: @ST or small lead?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But the temptation of the Vulnerable game is hard to resist|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - even 500 is easy to get|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if south didnt find a spade lead there is no way he wouldnt find the switch when in with Kc|pg||
nt|kurtove: if he entres the table|pg||
nt|davidstern: That lead looks helpful but if he puts up @CJ and finesses heart will prove a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D down in other room|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: common now  1@D transfer :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 9 top tricks - 1S + 4H +3D + 1c  more may come by CK finesse etc|pg||
nt|newmoon: Kib says "guess this is a good example for walsh even on a good hand."|pg||
nt|haans: i would show my hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sure west should show Hearts  |pg||
nt|newmoon: well... whatever, this match is based on "winning on the opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@d,3@s and jump (which King will be chosen?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: no takers :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: making 12 now|pg||
nt|haans: standard is to bid @D only with longer @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: @s Jack could be ducked now and black squeeze after that for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: nooo|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3@H does seem on|pg||
nt|mariner1: making is worth an imp|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: un autre pique|pg||

nt|daman: that's my frendh for today|pg||

nt|haans: good double|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: or dim if thats the way declarer plays it|pg||

pc|d3|nt|newmoon: kib says:  "looks quite normal to bid 2@h 5+@C and 4+@H "   I agree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: club now for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: -650 sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: still 6 tricks for the declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 13-11 to Lavazza after 4 bords |pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes ladies ALWAYS sit south or east in a mixed event|pg||
nt|henryb: -200 is habit forming for N-S|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScoresOWS.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, it's very 'crowdy' around that line - every VP is important|pg||
nt|davidstern: For this swiss http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=6|pg||
nt|davidstern: Herbst 39th with current score|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wwalter: can play a @s also|pg||
nt|davidstern: Perhaps 100 = 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have been worried about where all the @ss were|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb: it is a bad habit|pg||
nt|raghavan: a costly 1NT - If S passed they will be playing in a part score.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jeanhari: maybe south shouldnt have played diamond ace|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|brgpro: why shd I know....or what do I know...I am not a director...|pg||
nt|daman: c'est tout|pg||
nt|kurtove: maybe zone|pg||
nt|jeanhari: on the first two rounds|pg||
nt|sommer: 12..|pg||
nt|xenya: making 6 now|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match  Denmark 15  Harangozo 1  5 to score|pg||
pc|d5|nt|charles_l: @s also ok - can force a reentry|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|kurtove: sry|pg||
nt|henryb: not that costly. West would have balanced with 1N and east west tould play 1N or 2H|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 4 they also played in 3S-2 = Push|pg||
nt|haans: @D is called giving up|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|h4|nt|charles_l: now a bold @h|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps and play three rounds of diamonds now|pg||
nt|haans: precision 2@C opening in other table paid this time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 14 imp swing possible on this board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raghavan: Can you tell me as which countries these 2 pairs belong to?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D around sure looked right there,,,,,,|pg||
nt|raghavan: may play SA|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: hope someone has to lead away from @CK|pg||
nt|sommer: @H to 10 now...no:)|pg||
nt|werge: Not only possible, please|pg||
nt|haans: much has happened at bridge table|pg||
nt|werge: You very often can judge the "quality" of a contract, when you follow the speed, declarer plays in...  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes but now we see the Open result|pg||
nt|haans: only - 7 imps|pg||
nt|werge: A brave man would have paid the 500 long time ago - CLAIM|pg||
nt|haans: most of us do not do that|pg||
nt|werge: No comment...|pg||
nt|haans: QJ dubble in @H = only 200|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still hoping for less than 500 - if QJ @H doubleton it would be very interesting|pg||
mc|7|nt|werge: Regarding the @S-suit known, you cannot even put the other cards in a way, which make 3 NT, best would be @H Q-J doubleton for 200|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well to me 2NT is just this hand (or if you value it above that range then open it 2NT).  But as to invitations, yes, I don't like to play a level higher than I have to, so I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: prefer invitations to be one last chance to avoid game when we really don't want to be there; otherwise, we go.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: mirrored hands NS make any game tough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 1@C = 15+|pg||
nt|westjava: Conny Sumampouw (W), won 4 Gold Medal on Indonesia Multi Event 2008|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate that opening |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|westjava: some times,over call with 4 cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a corollary of playing 1@C=2+ for balanced hands is that 1@D can be 4+ and always unbal, but EW 1@D=3+ :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I like the overcall here|pg||
nt|mariner1: good cards and NV vs VUL position|pg||
nt|westjava: back to   3, also 6@S in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 1@H = 5+@H & 10+hcp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes apparently South has 15+ and North 10+|pg||
nt|sybarra: but probably a "must do" |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N NS has good play here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|westjava: 2@S - 3@S and pass out..?:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perhaps she can't count|pg||
nt|mariner1: if N uses disciplined 1N then S should bid 3N|pg||
nt|westjava: ladies team,woman pair,mixed pair and mixed team|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is a good call too|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The singleton honours don't count extra|pg||
mb|2H|nt|westjava: wow, 3nt..??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North and South will need to discuss the strength of 3D after this|pg||
nt|westjava: agree Nigel:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: N explain weak 3@D while S took as 8-11 from written explaination|pg||
nt|mariner1: stayman without out  a stopper Lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: yeah...|pg||
nt|westjava: ahaa...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: good pass |pg||
nt|mariner1: no easy entry to W might allow this|pg||
nt|patricck: this finally looks like a contract that EW can beat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|nigel_k:  4S is not too bad though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so you lower opening by 1 and raise response the both still lie? seems silly to me|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: some specs not happy with Berman opening pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S 3 3 and K @H and K@C on side assure the game|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|westjava: to return a @H...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2 imps to Ina from   2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: will lose 2 @S now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: what would cc wei think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2NT shd be 1 top honor in @S, explained by S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They do both have good playings strength, the problems will come when you have a misfit but are already committed to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s seemed to have arrived in best spot |pg||
pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  A possible 4H here for E/W. Unfortunately they sold out to 1S by South.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|westjava: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S can't beat 3H so no harm done as long as they get to play undoubled ...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|patricck: I know there are 16 points in the North hand, but the flat shape and poor pips would have kept me quiet against two bidding opponents|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: and now @c are only 1 loser|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  Small point but South should play 8H not 3H|pg||

nt|brgpro: easy 6@h?|pg||
nt|athene: or 6nt if you really want|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the idea is to have comparison of lad7 versus lady and gentleman versus the gentleman and...|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@s is good here|pg||
nt|charles_l: 7@s open cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry it is not easy to play with leslie that don't show cards :)|pg||
nt|daman: in North America   the @C Queen would be called an "elbow card"  you push it between the AKJ10 with your elbow and smile|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT    n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a typical points-shmoints hand|pg||
nt|aupillon: and this non 6 hearts ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: another makeable 6D|pg||
nt|pelu: so after 5 board only 1 swing - Angelini was close to lose 5 IMP, but had a gift: +10 |pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni will not pass|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak opening|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 4 a push - both 4H-1|pg||
nt|haans: apteker must try harder now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: That's the spirit!|pg||
nt|star6ija: chance to apteker to strike back - they strongly need it|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Try harder and you will succeed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t find any bid on S(!)|pg||
nt|raghavan: S must pass|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 9 tricks made|pg||
nt|haans: nor me|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s take a silent 3 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 segments of 16 in the final|pg||
nt|werge: I agree with the unlikely Q-J position in @H, but both of you had faound out long time ago - NEW BOARD|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Jos and discussed this earlier. We think it's against the EU rules if you took it that far|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H soon|pg||
nt|aupillon: After Ace @s lead and @s , no more 6 @d|pg||
nt|oliverc: I Suspect the NS pair are Polish|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx and EW ?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: another dull 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 5@HX in OR|pg||
nt|aupillon: weak but positive ...:)|pg||
nt|haans: can they find @D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here as in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: same in Sweden - I am told - so only the South-country discriminate .) - In Germany lady S and W!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That's not good enough, Murat. It's sexist|pg||
nt|wwalter: how 7?|pg||
nt|charles_l: sitff @hJ and dummy reverse|pg||
nt|wwalter: any play would lose 1@h|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H P 1@S 2@D P P now west has a bit of a decision|pg||
nt|davidstern: Over E/W 4@S|pg||
nt|aupillon: can one say 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|pelu: so the 5-level is max for both sides - will they fight on 6-level? :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW Turkish, apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk5: However, this is not about winning according to Pierre de Coubertin|pg||
nt|raghavan: a X bid is good for S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I must bid on S now i prefer D|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: easier if played in S but still makes|pg||
nt|davidstern: Cash 3 spades and a diamond and gain an IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on TOOLBAR|pg||
nt|mariner1: and then OPEN or CLOSED|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S lead on the auction in Open Room might be called for|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: that the screen partners on one side should be one lady and one gentleman|pg||
nt|athene: i know Sabine Auken doesn't like it - she complained about it in her book :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: interesting hand -- 5D makeable (but a bit double dummy)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil, Diamond bid is due from E |pg||
nt|raghavan: is N thinking of a penalty?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer seems to have 6 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: in a heart contract|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh..silent?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: N has single J|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder we've got a football (soccer) score in this set so far -- 2-1 -- the hands have been fairly routine |pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@D in both rooms|pg||
nt|kurtove: Not a good result for bessis in open|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 4NT|pg||
nt|aupillon: enfin. In fine...|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 6+@c +4@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: If E misses this chance, may not get again|pg||
nt|newmoon: 1@C alerted - Polish style?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: "The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well"|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|newmoon: previous hand Zia opened with unbalanced 17|pg||
nt|haans: zia has never bid polish|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a @h lead from S I vote for -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: a natural D lead is there - may shorten Declarer's trump holding|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: well E bids the @S here, so auction will be different|pg||
nt|mariner1: S may end up playing 3N now|pg||
nt|haans: and now an easy 1nt  (thats all)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|MolvaM: well I was talking about the general EBL rules :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes they both like their pure 6-4|pg||
nt|milton_se: not happy w spades bid by LHO...|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid now 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: although he will be disappointed to find the @sK offside|pg||
nt|raghavan: He will try to enter Dummy thru SK or CJ|pg||
nt|henryb: I am not sure that a @d is right. I was taught to lead trump when partner passes a 1 level double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|haans: but very close :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no it isnt... maybe it is after the lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After a club lead, it will certainly make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: small club?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On a spade lead, i wouldn't like to predict the outcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: might  beat 1nt   lead a spade    and switgch to clubs|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|haans: 8 trick for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, another dull 3NT|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 9 now :)|pg||
nt|sommer: can't it be set?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play NS, not easy|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: Spain : Lady N and E :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: sorry for the word Easy...nothing is easy in this game|pg||
nt|aupillon: but slam no way cause 2@c opening bid|pg||
nt|haans: 4 diamonds????????|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S by W now might make it pretty hard for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H shows a huge hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Say a woman wants to sit West and you tell her that she can't. Isn't that sexist? I am just asking|pg||
nt|xenya: but not this one?|pg||
nt|star6ija: one problem decided|pg||
nt|newmoon: tough for Gower to find a @H-lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: ok, if the result is correct, np|pg||
nt|fann4: Pretty pushy 3@D|pg||
nt|werge: Change the minor kings - and it´s an easy 3 NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wwalter: I see playing rederse summy, ruffing 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s looks making as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: if south had raised to 4@D i am sure west wld have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed not|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find who should play 4@H|pg||
nt|kurtove: must be worth trying 4 h with that hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: problem for Gromov heren, choose the right bid as the cards lie|pg||
nt|raghavan: that is the 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must take it though|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: this hand is not trivial if N-s play more @h|pg||
nt|kurtove: in North|pg||
nt|haans: play 1 @D get it claim|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprising|pg||
nt|fann4: If played constructively, even facing 6 of them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: huge dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 rounds of @d a @c shift and a @c discard on next @d|pg||
nt|sommer: small @S lead..and?|pg||
nt|werge: Down on the nnaturral @S-lead|pg||
nt|rnc: as predicted, 3NT from the South seat|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows S has a @S stopper so.............|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but south was + score|pg||
nt|sommer: then "noisy":)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: alsways down on 6-2 as defenders will switch to a spade|pg||
nt|xenya: well done, though i'm not sure how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
nt|haans: but that is pairs thinking|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|mariner1: migth see the @D switch now|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
nt|aupillon: and slowly, but surely, thry drew their plans agains us ( War of The Worlds)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland has to find @S Jack now|pg||
nt|werge: You have seen to many crimi´s in TV, when you think a @D-lead is good. North MUSThave been misinformed about the 3 @S-bid|pg||
nt|sommer: so it became (maybe) a great and lucky gain for the Americans|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but top @c ducked and then east is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: as it  turn o ut 2 hearts  or even 2@D  works better for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: luxemburg has done well this far|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match both in 3N, making 3 and 4|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ALL results on the board already recorded http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.06..795|pg||
nt|rnc: Prospect looks bad from West's point of view|pg||
nt|davidstern: Change that 006 for any other board number|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows E has to have something, and the only thing he can have is A@D or K@D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
nt|star6ija: now twelve tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 12|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: and would have passed with K@D|pg||
nt|rnc: West bought the contract, uncontested, in 1NT in the OR. North never mentioning the @Ds.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
nt|raghavan: Should play D and continue to shorten S in trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: defence will hav e to do the right thing though|pg||
nt|henryb: really? Is N trying to let this make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Defence is not on top|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: So on that board which required a club switch to beat 3NT http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=004.06..795|pg||
nt|mariner1: there goes the beer card|pg||
nt|davidstern: And you will see about half the field is beating it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
nt|newmoon: Will exit a @H after next trump|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|henryb: I take that back, but North's plays to tricks one and 2 seem strange|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: or 3rd|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes could be better|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 1nt|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: dont think can make now|pg||
nt|haans: killer|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: duck |pg||
nt|mariner1: E pitching @H conveys A@C is probably right|pg||
nt|jeanhari: reliefed to see two hearts go|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||
nt|newmoon: partial elimination|pg||
nt|star6ija: guess avoided|pg||
nt|newmoon: well played yes   :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: What a nice throw in|pg||
nt|newmoon: case for apteker to continue with a small @H second time|pg||
nt|newmoon: he could have got in with 3rd @H to punch @D8|pg||
nt|star6ija: Apteker's mistake... had to play @c after 1st ducking in @h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C 2 was a very safe exit |pg||
nt|rnc: Since N and E are on the same side of the screen, it seems odd if he got misinformed about the @S-bid|pg||
nt|fann4: Once again, EW are playing a contract in the other room - 1NT|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|panja: dummy reversal is an attractive line, ruff 3 @D in Dummy|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes and lose a @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: in hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead on the go, might have done but who would do that?|pg||
nt|henryb: If she ducks, declarer can just ram @d down her throat|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in trumps are too good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now N is caught to play from @sA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|don paulus: that would be 10 for badger|pg||
nt|haans: and next|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jeanhari: club now ans then 3 rounds of spades to get another trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 5@D here,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club K now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: @DA, @SQA..|pg||
nt|wwalter: the dummy has 1 @h losre, if the @h is not found|pg||
nt|wwalter: now should ruff some @d|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer has to worry about 4-1 trumps too|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb: a heart continuation would create enormous problems|pg||
nt|werge: For me, that was half a joke|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: i have to go now folks bye for now thx all|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lucky the loss is less than it could have been 7 instead of 11|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: @H finesse now?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wwalter: this is the best line to play|pg||
nt|don paulus: ty mike cu|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW won the Under 28 Pairs at Beijing in the Mind Sport Games|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N leads a small @S to K..and W let it hold, S MUST shift to a small @D!..to set it|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: north played for some blocking @c position|pg||
nt|ady: but discarding a heart and a diamond made the contract unmakeable|pg||
nt|ritong: unless @d 10 drops|pg||
nt|ritong: if a defender has a @c less, he has a @d more and then @d 10 can be short|pg||
nt|ritong: he/she, btw|pg||
nt|daman: should be a push then|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb: at trick 2. declarer plays a club and South wins and plays a third heart|pg||
nt|xenya: would be much better, yes -- still declarer can prevail i think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@D oke to|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|star6ija: A is correct line of play if N was with 5 clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb: but declarer did not read the position|pg||
pc|h7|nt|charles_l: i think the @h count is later known|pg||
nt|fann4: A plus is that the 3@D raise may shut the opponents out, but if pard bids on it may be a disappointing dummy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|ritong: but you were finally right, even with good news this defense beats it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|panja: not taking out trump at all thus far, is certainly a little risky|pg||
nt|raghavan: one more trick WD|pg||
nt|mariner1: Bessis stops the schneid|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so evident! play @c and watch on N|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry misclick|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphztg: the score is 1 down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: long winded   but still down 1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|charles_l: she is still ok though|pg||
nt|panja: if a @D is played now, decl will be a bit under pressure..|pg||
nt|panja: ruff high or not? where to place @SJ?|pg||
nt|wwalter: only one losing line, high ruff, than finess|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|panja: y, but from 13 tricks we have come to a point where a losing line is available|pg||
pc|h9|nt|don paulus: don't like 170 scores in imps count :(|pg||
nt|jcwla: Threading the needle loses again.  They pay 500 extra for vulnerable games.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: exiting the club there was 100% for the overtrick, no?|pg||
nt|athene: if you make 11, you persuade your partner to raise you next time it's close :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Neve had prime cards and two @S's for partner.  I love it when opponents try to judge that this will be the hand where they can only take nine tricks.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, for sure, it's much more restful defending 3major or 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: if you mess up and let an overtrick through - big deal :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: sorry,  only 6 |pg||

mb|1D|nt|nigel_k:  N/S doing very well at this table so far but currently behind in the match|pg||

nt|sybarra: right |pg||

nt|westjava: :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|an|.|nt|sybarra: does N move with super accept |pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=non-forcing stayman  2@D=game forcing stayman|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 18, where E/W here sold out quietly to 2@H, a highly competitive OR auction ended in a Moysian 3@S by Australia, on its way down some number.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: hard to get to this slam I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS do need to be care not to bid 7|pg||
nt|patricck: a good vulnerability there for Australia, but the Moysian @S fit doesn't play as well as @C|pg||
mb|r|mb|3C|nt|vugraphzre: 2NT = Grand @H, no 3c@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only over 4 @c or 4 @c |pg||
nt|jcwla: If 1NT is natural there, I'm delighted to bid it.  (I wouldn't play it that way but that's beside the point.)  As you say it's flat, but it's got some intermediates. |pg||
nt|patricck: Wang just LOVED having to bid 1@S, but you gotta do what you gotta do|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@C, cue or asking bid?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C agrees which suit is N's issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: here, North only interested in 4 card major, so 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H ok but he has 4 keys and Q@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: no cue by S?|pg||
nt|westjava: has change...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|westjava: whay N not to use 2@D..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South must be tempted to double|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: those H will be a disappointment|pg||
nt|westjava: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: missed opportunity |pg||
nt|jcwla: So 3@S went down only one, 3 to Australia on 18.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: acey hand in S,  and pard transfers to your 4 card suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Thin game here missed by E/W|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: I dont get being so pasive  |pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: when not looking for slam or starting to force in his own suit -- 2@D gives away extra information to opponents|pg||
nt|sybarra: (and I am criticized for "sitting on my hands")|pg||
nt|mariner1: needed to make a move over the transfer to 3@H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nigel_k:  Should be a straightforward 4H, losing a spade, club and trump|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|cJ|pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  2H by West a bit heavy but not unreasonable|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|westjava: from N,yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nigel_k:  Now it will be damage control mode|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  China made 4S on the last hand so now has a decent lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed 4@S did make and China race to a good lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S has to make the move somewhere|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: such as opener holding 5 card @C/@D|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think W shd take more blame|pg||

nt|raghavan: Bessis gets 1 IMP |pg||
nt|mariner1: J@D from W would be interesting if S is in 3N|pg||

nt|werge: 4 @s...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wwalter: is not so easy @@ the table, this is made by the great masters :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 3), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|jeanhari: saw dutch junior pair double 4NT, hoping for soma bad agreements... could have been costly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ended in 5@H|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like a @S-lead in OR - @h-lead works better|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: well, count of not, the only play available is to drop @HJ or Q stiff in 7@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: OR 4@H by SOuth|pg||

nt|star6ija: wild board|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: 1down |pg||
nt|mariner1: how to lead that I have no idea though|pg||
nt|haans: 2 @H ruffs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brgpro: and 3@s was sort of "on the way" cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: but if 3@H was only a mild slam try, then 3@S was showing west had a decent hand|pg||
nt|haans: 40 minutes late but still many specs|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 5 E made +2 in 3NT so Mc Leish gets 2 IMP |pg||
nt|milton_se: how do you respond to 2C with a solid 6-card major?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bid 3 of the major|pg||

mb|2S|nt|haans: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: oh no|pg||
nt|hedyg: not over 1@d|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showing Diamonds, perhaps? :)|pg||
nt|haans: double to follow|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s = 5+@s and a minor, less than an opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N takes his 2@d tricks and plays a @c there is -2|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb: 7@c is a good contract and cold on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt likely to come home here|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play strong @c, thus the 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: now S in 6@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Dael6 1NT -3 here, 1NT-1 in OR. so 5 IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now!|pg||
nt|pelu: over 5@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: he must X now|pg||

nt|oliverc: With a void in Partner's Hearts, though?|pg||
nt|haans: prempt from slam thinking|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont get to high this way|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid 3S |pg||
nt|panja: misfit will lead them overboard here..cards lying badly too|pg||
nt|werge: But 5 @C is a good sacrifica - which often puses N/S higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  looks the best shot|pg||
nt|raghavan: N will pass I think - May bid D if what charles said is correct - that 1S shows Diamonds by S|pg||
nt|murat: misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead a small @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is new minor I suspect or a forced relay|pg||
pc|h8|nt|raghavan: D J is natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: strong nt why 3nt?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks!|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S no make |pg||
nt|werge: No - but the bid it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: East "stole" it in 4@C in Open|pg||

pc|hA|nt|athene: 3@C super-accept|pg||
nt|panja: the bad break in @H will defeat this|pg||
nt|athene: there won't be much to go on regardigg @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: regarding|pg||
nt|raghavan: If that understanding is not there, he should pass - N has told his story - South must decide|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower did good, else 3@S gets whacked|pg||
nt|werge: Not with this lead...|pg||
nt|xenya: it may not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4th suit also possible|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: they will do well to bid 6 i think|pg||
nt|xenya: ah!|pg||
nt|henryb: a big chance for Hansen|pg||
nt|haans: @C and can go down|pg||
nt|haans: even with spades down possible|pg||
nt|oliverc: It seems to me as if all 4 players are bidding their hands without considering what|pg||
nt|april7: if 1@S shows @D then why didn't N bid @D, but now S did|pg||
nt|oliverc: opps and partner have bid|pg||
nt|henryb: here N-S missed a decent @s slam; an excellent one if played by North|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@c is a little bit agressive (politely said) in the OR|pg||

nt|ritong: @d jack could slip |pg||
nt|murat: they are still ok|pg||
nt|april7: S will start a crocss ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s lead makes the things difficult for declarer|pg||
pc|h7|nt|star6ija: @h also|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|werge: East stays to his @S-leads|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C better bid than 4th suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
nt|werge: Easy to play|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
nt|davidstern: This could get ugly|pg||
nt|haans: does east  havbe @HK?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf - we were talking about a better defense by NS In Open room same 1HX -1 Push!!!|pg||
nt|haans: yes he had already overbid a little :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing very important here|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might think S has @D cards on this auction,,,,,, the lead is not easy to find|pg||
nt|xenya: actually you just need to lead any @D here to beat it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but a @D lead is tough is it not?|pg||
nt|xenya: just lead the only unbid suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kurtove: thats a nice turn|pg||
nt|davidstern: Duck and a club ruff and another heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry club ruff and spade for -1|pg||
nt|haans: safer to play @HA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even if he wins this he can play a high spade honour they get a club ruff and then perhaps black suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|kurtove: its a problem to take the ace if east have the rest of the hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: So Heart Ace and seconbd trump then @SK win diamond ruff spade and ruff diamond and trump will nail West|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@D is a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can get C ruff|pg||
nt|newmoon: a very strange @HQ, if u count the points...|pg||
nt|haans: i assume 2nt was lebensohl so that was no option|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland know all the points, but the shape is also unfavourable|pg||
nt|star6ija: Slam reached at the Open Room|pg||
nt|star6ija: distance shortenned|pg||
nt|rnc: He did!|pg||
nt|mariner1: there it is,,,,, well done|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room the lead was a small @S|pg||
nt|panja: 6 tricks might be the limit for EW...but a couple of tricks in suspense|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|mariner1: the defense helps with the @D play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
nt|davidstern: oops|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: soade switch is awkward after cashing clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 13 precious IMPS back|pg||
nt|rnc: If taking care of this good start, it will bring Herbst back in business|pg||
nt|rnc: Other room stopped queitly in 2@S|pg||
nt|rnc: *quietly that is|pg||
nt|haans: may not have been an option for them many play 2@S as forcing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
nt|rnc: I must admit I would have passed 1NT without a thought|pg||
nt|xenya: me too|pg||
nt|sommer: gtg.. tnx and cu|pg||
nt|werge: But I do´nt like the blocking play, declarer has made in the @C-suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: defense needs to play spades|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|haans: never steel the contract when you  can steel suits|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
nt|raghavan: a D to KQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: SAK|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best set of board, in the other BBO-match the score is 7-0 after 8|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
nt|ritong: well played by east, a @d and it was over, since west would certainly play a @d back|pg||
nt|ritong: now on the surface, west has to duck the @d K|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal defense at this level|pg||
nt|dcbutler: that doesn't help, does it?|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that will not help|pg||
nt|ady: should make now   with diamond position favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: she might play a @d from hand right now|pg||
nt|kurtove: he was thinking that east never would have turned hearts without the king|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so much more to see here :)|pg||
nt|haans: :( may get better soon :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3N Open Room here,,, EW like to bid'em up in Open Room|pg||
nt|daman: not always the best sdtrategy but it worls like a charm on occasion|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: after the 2@D bid, 3@C, if NF is quite ok, isn't it?|pg||
nt|haans: many treat 6-4-hand as GF what you have to pay|pg||
nt|rnc: In OR West elected to bid 2@S (NF in their sys) after 1@S-21C;2@D. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
nt|kurtove: And I agree|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will be forced to take 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|werge: That should be 100 + 100 for US = 5 IMPs|pg||
pc|d8|nt|milton_se: +2|pg||
nt|raghavan: H9|pg||
nt|haans: now WH may miss playing @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would not bet on that|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry for NL|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
mc|9|nt|haans: they need 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs to Neth White House|pg||
nt|haans: still 10|pg||
nt|star6ija: possibly|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - not even vulnerable, I would try for game|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|rnc: *2@C|pg||
nt|panja: after the 2@D bid..the 4-length @H is not likely to be useful|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  This should be interesting|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  6D for E/W and a possible spade sacrifice for N/S|pg||
nt|allanr44: Indeed Nigel|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS in a @S partial likely here..............|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a welcome 11 to NZ there|pg||
nt|afulton: i have something i would say to that... but it might get deleted by BBO (or get me banned)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS this time.. not much to it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Different strategies possible with West|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|westjava: Japan, leads the way 1 imp from   19|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @C lead make 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what Dawei's plan was with 1@C opener if partner responded 1@H showing @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: just no real play for 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bid 1N ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: agree aholl view|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1NT is 14-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and fortunate cards 3N can't be beat|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: After @CQ @CJ @CA @C4, W suddenly called small @C from dummy, S claimed all tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: sry|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 1@D bid.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is a good spot that can be beaten with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He would enjoy the 3C response from East if there was one|pg||
mb|1H|nt|westjava: 4@H or 3NT EW is ok now|pg||
mb|2H|an|.|nt|ahollan1: but has strength for 1N opener so can't be that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not for interrupt but for interested persons: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
nt|allanr44: If west bid 7NT north may lead H   :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East could still try 6 now but it's a gamble|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzre: 3@D = Good Trump Bad Point explained by W|pg||
mb|4C|nt|westjava: 4@S on the way...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice treatment  Assume 2N is @S raise so DBL for takeout|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's a pretty good 3NT with the overcall though 5C is a bit better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2N puppet to 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: Arline, my guess is she meant to be talking to me |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Clubs don't break so 7NT is out :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: true|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North must bid 6S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: August,I think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|westjava: so,I dont like ur 3@C pd,S said...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or West's 1@C opening :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: good judgement|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,S will bid 4@S if his hand @CAxxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think i'd try @D3 lead - but don't really like any choices|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been hard by the 12 if S runned one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or if North had short @H then try 4@S|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Rodal:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yup it's Ogust, named after Harold Ogust|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|patricck: the 3NT tells Nunn there is stuff wasted in @H, but he has such a nice hard it is difficult to give up there|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|westjava: sry,Ogust:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Par contract achieved - well done|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Just behinde Lillik:)|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Operation successful...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who hates leads away from Jack so much -- he complains even when it is right!!|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D isn't as good as 6@C, because the @D losers could have been discarded on AKQ@S, probably both were doomed tho|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: can either set up @c or use cross ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: previous board : 3@H was not so bad, super accepting can actually make slam bidding harder, since you dont hear partners natural bid|pg||
mc|10|nt|nigel_k:  No problem for declarer here. Certainly easier than 3NT so good judgment by East|pg||

nt|newmoon: he didn't @CA operator?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Well, at the table it is some time difficult - where as we see all cards and decide|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but some moves are not that to complicated|pg||

nt|raghavan: wd Bessis|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this did not fit well for Open Room|pg||
nt|haans: stepping stone bridge|pg||
nt|werge: - now leading the matct - a close one|pg||
nt|werge: match|pg||
nt|werge: Lucky @C-slam|pg||
nt|werge: Game, I meant|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT or 5 @C, both making because of the poor @C King|pg||
nt|haans: odds are only part-score|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: coffee board coming up|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt would need a careful @C play..small to J first time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 6 - here went 2Down in 2S - Open -3D by E made so push|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6H by South making but not by North (D lead)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and what did you find out? -2?|pg||
nt|henryb: not the dummy you want opposite a 2N opener|pg||
nt|rnc: ...and succeded|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 5@C here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: a 3NT hand for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  -  Running Scores|pg||
nt|fann4: 6@H or 6@C here|pg||
nt|rnc: Finally there might be some action|pg||
nt|panja: nice hand, B18|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: yes, boring 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D opening, 1@H from sementa, 2@D - 2@H, 3@D - 3@H, 3@S - 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb: some danger of getting too high now, I would think|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes massi VuGr operator - your work is difficult - esp when they claim and close the hands|pg||
nt|henryb: except N got there first!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf there also 1HX -1 = 200|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N = both minors weak|pg||
nt|raghavan: S 10 is a stopper in Spade|pg||
nt|xenya: a srewd observation by a kibitzer -- perhaps NS were trying to match Meckwell's style|pg||
nt|werge: If they continue, they tale 1.430 here...|pg||
nt|werge: take|pg||
nt|xenya: *shrewd|pg||
nt|haans: EW have @S and @D|pg||
mb|d|nt|brgpro: we just wait and say NEXT later|pg||
nt|pelu: EW bidding|pg||
nt|charles_l: same in 5@c though|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is wild :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: E has some fun|pg||
nt|wwalter: did E open?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting "but not forcing to game" |pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: on Board 16 Versace found the lead of @SA and gave a ruff = 6@D -1 - but 12 IMPs for Salokin-team|pg||
nt|raghavan: May reach slam in H|pg||
nt|panja: 6@H 6@C for NS, but in 6@S...EW might not do badly...3 down for 500 instead of -1430?|pg||
nt|fann4: OR  2@C-2@D; 3@C-3@H; 6@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: yes Lauria bid only 1@H, not 3|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good result for EW open room|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScoresOWS.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panja: good to try something different|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by NS is best,but hard to reach|pg||
nt|raghavan: In ACBL tourneys, Convention cards are published in advance - Here I tried the website - could not go beyond the names of countries |pg||
nt|raghavan: will S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|murat: or Dbl maybe|pg||
nt|april7: if S bids 2NT then N will give him ofcourse the 3d|pg||
nt|murat: dbl would be no sense actually|pg||
nt|april7: the question also is whether N can have a 4card @S suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|charles_l: N must XX?|pg||
nt|panja: W is not very tolerant though, he wants to have his say in the matter|pg||
nt|athene: pretty boring 3nt here with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be unlikely to sell out to 2@S sitting East|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D now perhaps all end|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D looks negative one except you are forced to play the @DA|pg||
nt|haans: singel K again :)|pg||
nt|haans: more likely 4@S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|milton_se: but will Henner resist the spades?|pg||
nt|april7: now we hav e it|pg||
nt|werge: A BIG 2 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3N makes with @S 4 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may mean @D + 1 more|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: even so, I think two aces is too mich opposite 2@c not to be trying for if not driving to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: again, W's pass looks timid|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||
nt|ady: likely tgo end 3NT   or 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT shows 22/23 balanced|pg||
nt|raghavan: I feel VUL overcall of 2C should be good suit go for 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: not a really hilarious match |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@H can be beaten with a spade ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to late to bid @H now|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Welland Welland wont play there|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: payback time :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
nt|milton_se: now she should|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 2@d shows some values, they play 2@H as a double negative. Not that anything matters on this hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry my eyes did deceive me they were one board ahead of this table|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c is not so easy to defeat|pg||
nt|raghavan: Talf - I agree it should be more down Both rooms defense was noy perfecr|pg||
nt|rnc: It looks like the previous match, where down 3 was more or less an average result :)|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @S is sold for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=796&qphase=32&qroundno=1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: that would be law going too far|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR declarer played a spade towards the queen to create the entry to take the losing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c seems to be a transfer to @d|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h is down a lot, and with partner opening, South may double|pg||
nt|xenya: being pretty certain NS will bid game in OR|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  -  Swiss A Round 6 running scores|pg||
nt|mariner1: Denmark 17  Harangozo 2  3 boards to score in other match|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some here|pg||
nt|xenya: can't see how it can be made -- but quite a few variations here|pg||
nt|fann4: it seems clear to ask for aces.|pg||
nt|haans: i had expected EW to bid|pg||
nt|panja: South will have to take a shot, too much science might be counterproductive|pg||
nt|werge: So 130 for Nederland|pg||
nt|haans: yes i found a couple of aces |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@C a popular contract this match|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||
nt|wwalter: after this board will come a friendly chat on EW :)|pg||
nt|april7: 10 easy tricks ready for claim|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2NT wont make either...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: therefore trying 3NT :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S + 3@H + 2@D + 3@C = 9|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@D + 3aces = 6|pg||
nt|haans: you may seee it that way 2 :))|pg||
pc|s2|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Hauge now leads the other semifinal 60-50 with (i think) 5 boards to compare|pg||
nt|ritong: 3Nt = i do not like @ss|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|daman: A @C will|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am going to back Michel to make this one|pg||
nt|kurtove: he may try to get entry on qsp, but will go -1 then|pg||
nt|haans: looks natural|pg||
nt|henryb: everything|pg||
nt|star6ija: interesting case of misreading at page 20 of http://eurobridge.org/bulletin/09_1%20Sanremo/pdf/Bul_08.pdf|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so we need 15 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|werge: They WILL not - they allready did it...|pg||
nt|mariner1: transportation and a lack of winners is the issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: duck @c lead @c lead small @D helps, double dummy though it is|pg||
nt|rnc: South must be delighted (and surprised) seeing partner bid @Hs|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
nt|ady: lay down A@H    and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now no cue bid of Clubs so stopped probably|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a better contract than 4@c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||
nt|charles_l: lots down here|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is cold, but uptricks are heavy at that point  so she considers the best way to gather a max of tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: note that North's @CQ, @DK are useful, but hard to find in bidding|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this can be made|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is nice judgement... option for 6 IMPs back|pg||
nt|rnc: The @H-discard and the @H8 is telling bad news|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the 8@H does not warm E's heart much|pg||
nt|rnc: :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: not winning that @c in dummy also cost a trick in tempo|pg||
nt|xenya: it does look like a complex hand?|pg||
nt|fann4: There is talk that in the OR they may be playing control responses to 2@C - hence the leap to 6@H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead?|pg||
nt|pelu: they play a lot of tranfers after takeout X - so it looklike trandfer here also|pg||
nt|newmoon: good tenaces in dummy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same in Open|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: she might try leading @H9|pg||
nt|athene: or leading small to @H10|pg||
nt|athene: that still gives time to lead to @HK later|pg||
nt|wwalter: I hope the chairs will not fly :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment if you play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|milton_se: this needs some help -- doubt that he'll get it|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has nothing to discard on the 9@d when it becomes good|pg||
nt|hedyg: should lose 1@d, 1@c and 2@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how he can avoid it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What does E expect from his partner? the X over 3@c is silly with so bad majors|pg||
nt|henryb: he expects partner to have half the missing points|pg||
nt|werge: I would have "unblocked" the @D K from dummy, can´t hurt|pg||
nt|panja: well. N could have @SKQ |pg||
nt|rnc: There will be a quick claim soon|pg||
pc|c6|nt|don paulus: 1 @c strong - then ok|pg||
nt|henryb: which would be about 6 of them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only card from E is now @sQ |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now it´s expensive if N finds the @h shift|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in same spot here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb: Allix amazingly passive. I wonder what Neve would have done with the @dQ in addition|pg||
nt|athene: they probably play that you complete the transfer with any weak NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I hope they do not play odd even discards|pg||
nt|panja: and less @H's|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: hmm|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not this way but???|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: I win|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||
nt|athene: it gives up the legitimate play in the suit of @HQx / @HJx with east|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: this might give west time to get his long spade set up|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence take @CA, @S, three hearts|pg||
nt|haans: u sure do|pg||
nt|milton_se: if 1NT is 12-14, North is certainly worth 4C|pg||
nt|april7: preparing a squeeze which doesn't exist|pg||
nt|newmoon: who said a 10 counts for no points?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but Welland leading a spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: the defence can actually stop declarer ducking a club into east's hand with certainty|pg||
nt|athene: west goes in with @CJ if declarer leads low from hand and east plays @C10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: but of course everything works for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: she may have a nasty moment but she can't go down :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she's thinking about discard|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauri-Versace bid and maded 5@Cs on board 17 = +6IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: With this lead makes 6|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|jeanhari: oeps|pg||
nt|haans: i am right :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it|pg||
nt|haans: still long way|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|werge: Stiff @C King by North was tried - no lucky decision this time|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|jeanhari: south could know there was not much chance for north to have 3 spades, which he needs if switching to a spade|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but easy to see from the sidelines|pg||
nt|haans: south did not know they had 4-4 in hearts|pg||
pc|c5|nt|star6ija: no difference between 150 and 130|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|davidstern: With a spade through he would again have to cash the @DA|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d to cut the communications|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidstern: Claim -1?|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprise may be corrected|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so another 2 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can make it now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s8|nt|xenya: i think "strong but not forcing to game" means something lice Acol 2, Shirley -- in this case |pg||
nt|raghavan: He may A Heart |pg||
nt|xenya: is he about to make it now?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|milton_se: over now -- down|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace was actually on his way to slam but Lauria pulled the emergency brakes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To beat 4@d W has to lead a @d to duck|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @H pitch cost|pg||
nt|xenya: once he got a @D trick?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: not likely to either, given the 1@S bid from West. Even if on slim values, West likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: have either the J or Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: He rectified the count trying for 11 tricks instead of 10|pg||
nt|henryb: cash the @sA and exit the third club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still I think your analysis is correct - South should return a diamond|pg||
pc|d6|nt|april7: W might keep the @D Q10|pg||
nt|werge: That might cost 5 IMPs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: and as always better to play AFTER :))|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but west being balanced, not bidding @H (with 2@S/3@H)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: would u X on the Westhand or bid 2@S - D + 2@S gave East hope of game|pg||
nt|hedyg: now can go -2 with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for 2@S bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: as predicted|pg||
nt|athene: of course objectively this wasn't best because east "should" cover with @HJxx|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1100 and blood all over the carpet|pg||
nt|wwalter: Massimo pls tell us how is @@ the table now? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: @d now for 'only' 800, ty specs|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: E is like a fish out of water .............O look for a miracle :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ultimately he will|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree that Easts D over 3@d was not so good|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb: I think it is very hard to pass that hand over 3@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: pitching @S from hand on the third diamond has committed her|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry no she only needs one spade|pg||
nt|athene: she can still take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if scared that west has the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: @D2 (if honest) would indicate that|pg||
nt|athene: but i am sure west is good enough to falsecard there with @SK and NOT @CQJx|pg||
nt|haans: jean was correct yes was|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but his partner will take that for majors - or?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|newmoon: Gower claiming last 2|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: she will be very annoyed with herself to go down in this|pg||
nt|charles_l: 800 a bargain - could be 1400|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: she mentioned in her book how she woke at 3am one night realising she misplayed a hand even though she made it!|pg||
nt|athene: so this one will cause even more torment :(|pg||
nt|athene: it would be so nice to have that machine from the movie "Men in Black" to wipe one's memory after a misplayed bridge hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|dJ|nt|raghavan: ok curtains|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that immediate overcalls of 3@c and 3@d should be for the majors and double shows a strong balanced hand, the second double a stronger balanced hand|pg||

nt|westjava: nice to discuss...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 could be void @D|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: as was other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2nt=inv 3@D=suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Presumably 2NT is because West had thoughts of slam|pg||
nt|afulton: with my partners, i like an agreement where bid of 3@s = I have very positive accept + useful doubleton (in this case, probably ace) |pg||
nt|sybarra: not the "loviest" 5/5 |pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|patricck: The 2@H opening is too rich even for my blood, but it must be what South expected otherwise it would have been impossible to stop. A shame since game does make|pg||

pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  Not only South can ruff but declarer will be cut off from dummy's hearts after drawing trumps|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|mc|11|nt|rodal f: Was a free signal from N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difficult decision at trick 1 -- especially since declarer is supposed to hold 5@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Aint with u there Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think driving force should have been -- it looks like @C running |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i actually agree with call for @HJ|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,and what decl thinking about?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South should be curious about North overtake to return trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if singleton - why not try to promote partner's length, if doubleton, then must have control of @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer also thinks @C finesse not working??|pg||

nt|april7: E might bid @S over @H from N,but as I see S bids @S|pg||
nt|jeanhari: another chance here for some points|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|rnc: both tables open 1@D, the slight differens Rodwell did it as North|pg||
nt|xenya: i think EW may well get to 4@H now |pg||
nt|werge: The US-team opens 1 @D at both tables!!!|pg||
nt|xenya: and if they do, they are likely to make it|pg||
nt|rnc: Both teams were tied for 31th before the previous board|pg||

nt|haans: 6@S what does bid mean now|pg||
nt|fann4: This 4NT looks like ordinary Blackwood perhaps. Many would play it as quantitive.|pg||
nt|haans: not on the net i assure you|pg||
nt|fann4: 6@s dbled going for 1100|pg||
nt|panja: good idea, but there has to be something for Aces...also...E hasn't checked about Spade values....W could come up with !Kxx..and there would be no slam|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm sure that this EW pair know exactly what 4NT means in this sequence.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panja: 3Nt should be played from S hand here..to protect the @HK|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam on 21 in OR either|pg||

mb|3N|nt|ritong: good news for allix|pg||

nt|raghavan: It is nice to have a known person by our side|pg||
nt|oliverc: It's like watching Klingons bidding :)|pg||

nt|werge: Looks like only red aces for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u win 9 out of 10 .)|pg||
nt|april7: very odd bidding|pg||
nt|murat: i guess NS is a Polish pair which i know nothing about them|pg||
nt|henryb: it is a 5 or 7 hand on a club lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if not vulnerable, I had bid 1@d as W, but now - no|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H still a make|pg||
nt|star6ija: no, correct defense will defeat it|pg||
nt|raghavan: well that settles - S may pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: would you raise?|pg||
nt|ritong: or try no trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets guess ( nothing in CC) that 2NT asks for force|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Hedy / when 2@H ) GF / then 2NT forcing >(>(|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tobias - is this team in a chance for reaching SF > If u feel so, send me the file  Editor@@BridgeIndia.com  |pg||
nt|april7: a nice @C contract going down the drain|pg||
nt|jeanhari: and miss vuln game|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@C keeps them low but not in best spot|pg||
nt|fann4: Anyone know what 5@D means.|pg||
nt|fann4: Shows you what know:)|pg||
nt|haans: if 4nt quant 5@D natural|pg||
nt|panja: 4-card suit..|pg||
nt|panja: the pause suggests there is some gap in understanding|pg||
nt|haans: i have suggestions 4NT = nat or minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: strong club and negative - now is 1@H any 20+?|pg||
nt|panja: S made it very easy, ok if 1@S is limited|pg||
nt|charles_l: S shows she can psyche 1@d too|pg||
nt|panja: if 1@S could be stronger, NS could easily lose a 6@C slam|pg||
nt|athene: now Allerton gets a chance to make his second rebid :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Three bids on the 11 count?  No.|pg||
nt|athene: but he declines it|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't think 2@D shows extras in that position|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt sort of limited your hand?|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like a flat board|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d relay again|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play low|pg||
nt|milton_se: AD and D -- let them play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Develop a D trick may play A and small D|pg||
nt|haans: slam here is desperado bridge|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 27 - 4C down here OR 3S-2  gain of 5 IMP to Apteker|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5 or 7! with a @c lead  there is no slam|pg||
nt|aupillon: oui|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead agin helps declarer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: or perhaps 4+ hearts, forcing, á la Meckwell|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10 fast, but could be 11 :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 11 on this lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't like N's sequence here. |pg||
nt|ady: thats the winning bid by west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: 3NT is possible, don't think you have a raise|pg||
nt|ritong: well it is a matter of @d length with east, i think|pg||
nt|ritong: suppose east has two @ds, it probably will be better in @s|pg||
nt|ady: needs an accurate defence to beat 4 spades if leading clubs   msut not play 3rd club   or will later be end played  after trumps drawn and a diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming south does not hold six|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT is the logical contract|pg||
nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|haans: And I would also like to thank Dr. Raghavan, Momchil Aleksandrov and Sid Ismail my  co-commentator |pg||
nt|haans: And of course all you KIBITZERS  for watching We trust you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @d finess fails|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The failure to bid 4@H (on the same auction) at the other table is very surprising|pg||
nt|jeanhari: stronge comeback from Welland|pg||
nt|haans: looks well for game|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, the layout is friendly, but the bidding tells you that - the spade finesse will work, as will the clubs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding and lead in Open|pg||
nt|haans: this is a boring board|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: lots of tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showed Diamonds|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C? - who knows|pg||
nt|star6ija: no... this @h 8 with e is an obstacle|pg||
nt|daman: the pain of missing a vul game will not go away too quickly|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: and into the soup we go  |pg||
nt|henryb: Only one of the four pairs on vg managed to reach even 6@c|pg||
nt|dcbutler: but doesn't E rate to be short in diamonds?|pg||
nt|raghavan: we both thought the same|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 7 with the @d finesse working, 5 otherwise unless the clubs are 6-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: They  are heading for slam|pg||
nt|daman: N was almost worth a xx|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hans one more deal is there apart from this |pg||

nt|newmoon: thx all, and hope the kibs enjoyed this session.   Motto: "Capitalize on opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: with S*|pg||
nt|haans: yes good trumps :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: ok 1@H natural F1 by the look of it|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light opener, ok.  1NT rebid, the misdescription starts.  Passing 2@C carries the connotation you're fine defending that, again, not my cup of tea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 4 imps for Neve|pg||
nt|athene: should make this even if he tries to drop @CKx with north|pg||
nt|star6ija: let us see anyway|pg||

nt|jeanhari: play still interesting...|pg||

pc|d7|nt|murat: i'm having some informations.. Polish pair was a part of Polish Bermuda Bowl team last year..|pg||
nt|raghavan: which finess to take|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, South leapt straight to 6@S, but that was after his pard bid 3@S over 1@C, not a strong NT.|pg||
nt|haans: do u think all do u know?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: then everything else natural|pg||

nt|raghavan: It is so 6-1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: what finesse to take after being in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: well another swing to Herbst, they are on a roll|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - such boards schould be cancelled|pg||
nt|haans: talk about that very long ago|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They certainly played it fast in Open|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|pelu: they have all cards / but missing 2 Aces / so they will stop|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s was Blackwood, 5@d is two key cards without the @hQ|pg||
nt|daman: unless 3@C shows this hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brgpro: she went down...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spades I would think|pg||
nt|rnc: The only good thing for NS is that 4@C is making while 3NT wasn't. |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dcbutler: fortunate the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|milton_se: y and E has to play 10|pg||

nt|sybarra: and e/w might never find the @C suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Ha|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: at least i think should be 8-10|pg||
nt|mariner1: S should bid game now....... dual fit and short @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt know about clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H a little timid I think|pg||
nt|afulton: played carefully, NS can make 5@H, losing only @d + @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another guess coming -- 3@H shows 2 top honors in @S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh the double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Ok the double was just to test us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prompted by?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Sorry no dbl, just tht all pass and press DK = dbl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I think East was looking for slam there actually :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  just a club guess for the overtrick|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,K of @C on side...|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick in the same 3@D contract earned China 1 IMP on 20.|pg||
nt|patricck: their cc does say 2@H can be 0-8, so maybe Nunn was scared it was even worse than that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: had us excited operator|pg||
nt|westjava: not too late...|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does a good job|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  After QC wins declarer has to guess whether N has doubleton 10 or South has doubleton King|pg||
pc|s8|nt|westjava: will reach to 6..?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it they reach slam level it will be a tough play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unbelivebel friendly hand for NS, but hard to reach the max|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: W might have over taken and fired a @S back|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why not |pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard had ace of @S,  and ruff  next |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|westjava: so,be careful Hu|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c out beats 6@H and 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec asking for more guesses ---  4@C asks about @C holding  4@D=not 1st/2nd/3rd round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't explain why South asked in @C rather than @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @S were 3 2 this would have more play likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@H = 2 @S honor, so 6@S is very reasonable|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult contract tough to make|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D,that's S need...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one correct guess -- now how about 4@C??|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|westjava: @C asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confirmation of my guess about 4@C only counts if it comes from the table :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: it can be made now|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: suggest line of play to make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: has to play E for Jxxx @S though|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then what  (as martin said)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|westjava: yes,just need 1 x @C ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: might have been wise to ruff some @H's|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|westjava: now,need @D ruff:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trying to ruff hearts looked relatively safe but she's not taking any chances|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: remember to ruff 3rd round of @D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: could have ruffed a @D  and finessed for J@S and home|pg||
nt|mariner1: at least it would have been a try :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|westjava: 12 imps for 6 boards,good match|pg||
nt|sybarra: so club, over take, ace of spade (if there) and ruff,  ace of @D  =down|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  He should play three rounds of hearts now. When S doesn't follow the club position is clear|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah|pg||
nt|mariner1: looking good|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Immaterial if South helps by covering, though S was still trying to beat the contract|pg||
mc|11|nt|westjava: so,wd Hu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice result|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well played|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: nice bid and play|pg||

nt|mariner1: last board this session now.............|pg||
nt|panja: sometimes the pause is also to reconfirm what one thought the meaning was the first time...a good idea in high level matches..|pg||
nt|fann4: I can't believe that E meant 4NT as quant there. Whatever is was, it was something else.|pg||
nt|fann4: So 6imps heading to ZIMM, |pg||
nt|haans: as you have no gerber i say B|pg||

mb|p|nt|kurtove: possible to gain some imps here for Benassi|pg||

nt|milton_se: can they avoid 3NT?|pg||
nt|milton_se: no game here w best def|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S by N will go down on a @H ruff by W|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS may normally reach 4S  |pg||
nt|haans: And of course all you KIBITZERS  for watching We trust you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx so much :)|pg||
nt|haans: and a kib have also  said "THANK  Roland Wald 2"  so I do (rightly so)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And well done to Hans and Jean for the perceptive comments|pg||
nt|haans: And our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|mariner1: seems best defense can beat 4@H here, so 5@C was a phantom..... though it could|pg||
nt|mariner1: have made too|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, operator can check if there is an opportunity...|pg||
mb|d|nt|kurtove: 5 sp is 3 down with best def|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|raghavan: This  of NS has not helped them now - they lost 5IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Massimiliano (Italy), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Jean Harings|pg||

nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|haans: we are 14 is right|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: yes, that might have been a good play, but Bocchi didn't need it|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S  - an unklikely contract|pg||
nt|haans: but does 4@H mean single spade|pg||
nt|haans: changed times |pg||
nt|pelu: so last board 5 IMP for Angelini = 16-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed, 30 minutes earlier than i announced, sry|pg||
nt|haans: first time 10 then 11:40 13:20 17:30 19:10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 8  here 4H made 5 Open 6H -1 so MC Leish picks up 11 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: this board can be bloddy|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C = both majors?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no possibilities to go wrong in @c|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably north will have some instrument to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||

nt|werge: Here a very UNlucky 4 @S E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: note that 3N is cold for NS on the last board|pg||
nt|pelu: do u like the X from S? - 2@H or 2@S (Michael) in my book|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 5@C - strong @C-suit and no @Hs ?????|pg||
nt|milton_se: that opening bid might help NS to stay low|pg||
nt|jeanhari: doesnt look like that...|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the European Bridge League (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Massimo Ortensi), and all the generous sponsors and organizers for helping BBO|pg||

mb|p|nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@s without @h lead|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that @D8 in trick 1 ask for @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: but will have to guess the position of @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: CC says it's a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thank you all. see you on next session|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank Henry - sorry i missed him|pg||

nt|jeanhari: good typing Rob, tx to you too|pg||
nt|daman: N shd double|pg||
nt|fann4: A tough re-opening decision for South. He wants to act, but the @h suit is so bad.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no no was that|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C|pg||
nt|werge: - with 5 @H N/S...|pg||
nt|haans: corrected to 5@H|pg||
mb|5C|nt|haans: elu said|pg||
nt|haans: 30 min pelu siad|pg||
nt|jeanhari: best not to pas here|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
nt|haans: and spade to short :))|pg||
nt|fann4: Trouble is, without a 3rd @S he has to plunge in with @H or stay out.|pg||
nt|haans: little action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: corrected on our website|pg||
nt|raghavan: George N heard you|pg||

nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: welland indeed gaining 13 on 9|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|daman: can this be t/o?  no way|pg||
nt|mariner1: I pass it anyway|pg||
nt|daman: Garner got caught speeding|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I would play it as to|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may pull to 3C? of course not sure of number of clubs with E|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C not alerted so presumably improvisation|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@C natural or...?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D an underbid and 3nt not really very good|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but not alerted|pg||
nt|athene: actually i think a simple 3@D wld have been OK|pg||
nt|star6ija: and take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: s'alright. I am easily missed|pg||
nt|haans: you and we will be kick out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I am going to rule that 30 minutes = "around 15 minutes"|pg||
nt|werge: This board is against the rule: The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: yes, nice Morton's Fork possibility here|pg||
nt|brgpro: seems there was an misunderstanding of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: by playing @c4 he set up "mortons fork" - if West take @CA the 2 discards - if not: the @C-trick go away|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather unfortunate...W has sort of "Nat" @hK lead...|pg||
nt|charles_l: S might suggest it over 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: but N bids 4@h|pg||
nt|wwalter: a manly bid :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: real men bid game :) (and try to make it)|pg||
nt|panja: not an easy lead, but @C is safe|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 22 the other room reached to high in 6 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *too |pg||
nt|jcwla: Should work like a charm here if natural.|pg||
nt|athene: but west perhaps just wants to stop the club lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: it didn't|pg||
nt|henryb: N is relaying again|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Gomerov still not satisfied|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|rnc: It has been an interesting match|pg||
nt|rnc: Herbst making a huge rally from 7-21 to 40-21 in five consecutive boards - never give up!|pg||
nt|fann4: Same seq in the OR, but S gave up over 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: he made LOL|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it difficult to bid game in S and make it - 2 Club losers Da - will D  belead |pg||
nt|jeanhari: for sure Dubinin has a fast pas if this was not t/o|pg||
nt|daman: I think maybe Weinstein held up the auction|pg||
nt|panja: risky 3@H bid..isn't this one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: has there been a misunderstanding here? Sabine knows that 3NT isn't solid diamonds...|pg||
nt|haans: only brits play 5@C as slam invite|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that the X = @h + minor - so S has shown his hand!|pg||
nt|kurtove: diamond lead, ruff and small heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=0-11, 4@hs|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes will have to drop QC, since he can't afford E having the trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@d acts as 4sf here?|pg||
nt|april7: @D lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South is not thrilled - although he does have a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: in IMP as rare pen double|pg||
nt|haans: or is it not?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could be yes|pg||
nt|haans: he is worth a well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|henryb: "The Fat Lady is Singing"|pg||
nt|ritong: north went for the practical bid|pg||
nt|ritong: a second cue wouldn t have scandalized me|pg||
nt|ady: north right gave up once south shows some heart values|pg||
nt|daman: has to duck 1 @H and maybe more|pg||
nt|daman: pitching @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding has maded it easy'er for N to play @Cj|pg||
nt|haans: and this was board 10 welcome back in 40 minutes! |pg||
nt|raghavan: Will E signal his D Ace now?|pg||
nt|milton_se: Welland can't expect more than one ace w East, so D is mandatory|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a tricky 3nt! 5 and 6@c is easier, but not longer|pg||
nt|haans: :) they did right :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: next round (3rd from Swiss Open Teams) starts tomorrow 10:3- CET|pg||
nt|mariner1: well right defense just not in game|pg||
nt|werge: 750|pg||
nt|haans: they are the opps :)))|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open playing in 5@C Dbl also, so @H fit never found|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wwalter: 4 wich pair? :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: maybe will fines the @h :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: he has not made it yet......|pg||
nt|wwalter: it sould be simple now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a grand with 2-2 in @s|pg||
nt|raghavan: another 7 in Hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: or spades or NT|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably :)|pg||
nt|daman: draw trumo|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: And he might have just turned a huge plus into a small minus|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS do better not drawing here I think|pg||
nt|panja: and now, there is a promotion possibility|pg||
nt|werge: - if not playing for another stiff @C K|pg||
nt|werge: Same play - @H / @C|pg||
nt|haans: @H has been found but longer clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brgpro: Bocchi thought pd denied @d control|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can finesse in @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: but now it's over|pg||
nt|milton_se: 11 tricks probably|pg||
nt|haans: trust we will see team salokin again|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 4S down  so ew making 4 will get them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx to all Kibitz, co commentators Hans, Malik,sid,Momchil, Vu GR operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all kibitzers, we are waiting all of you here for the next round|pg||
nt|haans:  and thats was board 10 welcome back 17:30 (italian time) |pg||
nt|henryb: S has now presumably shown 5-5-1-2, minimum|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all commentators, to EBL and to Roland Wald|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can call it an action double.: partner, I'm still not satisfied until now...|pg||
nt|haans: but still +|pg||
nt|haans: wrong - score|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wwalter: made|pg||
nt|wwalter: or not LOL|pg||
nt|charles_l: he may be preserving his options to misguess @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now way south could see passing was best|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 Spades,HA,DA and (a club)  minimum losers|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a violation of Burn's Law (RULES)|pg||
nt|haans: may go down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|murat: he goes down now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Terence Reese had a pithy comment for South's 3@S ....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brgpro: @c i meant|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2 x A from S - have a bet? :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: no|pg||
nt|raghavan: Automatically spade honours fall - no need for worry, |pg||
nt|jeanhari: but depending on what de dbl over 1NT ment|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he said only points|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "He was happy to defend 3@H when it was bid, but not prepared to defend it when partner doubled!"|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|wwalter: if he plays @s could come a problewm :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: it was a good pass by S, although 4@S is an execellent contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: Friends- We thank all great Kibitz, co commentators, VuGr operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|henryb: 4N probably agrees spades for the moment, since N is most interested in the @sQ|pg||

pc|cA|nt|kurtove: that was bad play|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: the same problem in @s or @h. If he want to check @sQ he cannot find @hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session after a short break, not sure how long|pg||

pc|d5|nt|raghavan: club again|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|werge: I was asked, whether to cover or not - but with the @C 10, there might be a very small chance, that decl finnesses the @C 10 by East|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: no sorry |pg||

nt|ady: club lead could have been nasty|pg||

mb|p|nt|charles_l: 3N plus a few depending on the lead|pg||
nt|trotto: sorry all,   wrong widow:)|pg||
nt|daman: depends upon who plays it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|charles_l: 6@c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good result here for Badger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is invitational?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: 4@H from north now?|pg||
nt|panja: not a bad idea, two key cards missing though|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N bid and made on 23|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|werge: But the second @H-honour might help|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: N can make 6@c but EW has a vul. save in 6@h, 800|pg||
nt|athene: looks a bit heavy for that|pg||
nt|athene: east has too much defence and is too vulnerable to consider saccing, surely?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brgpro: he can X 4@h now but i doubt W will save|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to save in 6@H for loads and find pd was going to lead stiff @D against 6@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: S has a rather heavy 3@c , she will pass now|pg||
nt|brgpro: showing some interest |pg||
nt|panja: that must be N|pg||
nt|don paulus: shows 3crd @h ?|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need support doubles when partner has shown 5+ in the suit, i wouldn't have thought|pg||
nt|athene: i wld just bid 4@H with west's hand|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps X is game-try in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if they have that agreement it suits the hand perfectly|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is a bit wet and 4@H a bit pushy|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT doesn't work?|pg||
nt|ady: almist certainly south|pg||
nt|haans: he has two chances to play @CK|pg||
nt|werge: EW 4 @S, naturally|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 2@d is 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|jcwla: At a low level, sometimes it's a free roll to tell partner whether the fit is 8 or 9, but here I agree it wouldn't seem to apply.|pg||
nt|daman: now from the wrong side|pg||
nt|ady: not wrong side   better for north to play|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry problrm on bbo |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I lost bidding we wait for the score|pg||
nt|ady: only a spade lead and club switch could be awkward|pg||
nt|ritong: what is final contract pls?|pg||
nt|ady: not finsished bidding yet|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt|pg||
nt|ritong: grazie|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: By S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: the 3NT where Bocchi found the @S shift: Semanta won 3NT - he won on and endplay against N! |pg||
nt|athene: well if East bids 4@C or 3@S or 3NT now, west can bid 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: bizarre|pg||
nt|ady: wrong   tht south would open 2NT|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a 2NT opening would be artificial|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: gone all haywire|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dcbutler: Hauge is ahead 89-50 with one board to score, so will make the final|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @H9 should restrict to 3|pg||
nt|charles_l: hard to lead @h though|pg||
nt|wwalter: who would lead that? :)|pg||
nt|panja: it is a fair choice, even single dummy|pg||
nt|daman: a lot of good teams have fallen by the wayside|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: ......|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and this will be made also|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice 10 of @D in W hand |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: declarer had just better not play @SAKJ throwing @D3 :) she runs into a nasty accident in clubs if she does that|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: if N wins the ace now, declarer might not need @Cs to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but N ducks correctly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|brgpro: with 6@c, Bochi doesnt care as even if they are without @cK pd must have @cAQ 6 times|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, @D to the Ace and a @C-discard on @H King is not directly stupid|pg||
nt|haans: as a speak say only one chane|pg||
nt|haans: spec|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|brgpro: a quick claim|pg||
nt|athene: could draw trumps with the @C4 :)|pg||
nt|athene: just to be cute|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|panja: the thinking should be E did not overcall 1@S, nor did she dbl 2@D..so is unlikely to hold enough to defeat the contract in any of those suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 3@C maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W is happy :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: @D lead will make declarer very nervous|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With canape you always feel like you want to rebid a 5 card suit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: 7@C not reasonable missing a key|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on a double finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 @C precission? Ok to alert it for specs also:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: again the substandard game is reached|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: trump lead not really best here |pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: actually @H lead troublesome too|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Might be ok if the Ace was not a singleton, eg AC instead of AD|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|mariner1: I think we missed a pass here|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls|pg||
nt|mariner1: well bid though|pg||

pc|dK|nt|westjava: -3 now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: ggod night and thx for coming :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East needs West to have seven to the king at least plus an ace, which is optimistic|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA then try @DAK?|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to use @S to reach W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just playing north for @CK seems against the odds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there is no problem for 6@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: that 2@H bid in N is a warning about possible @D splits|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: bd 7, other room didnt get to 6 @H either |pg||
pc|sT|nt|nigel_k:  Still not a bad game but nothing lying well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they had a coach he might be pointing out the fallacies in their methods|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|mariner1: yes 6@C makes anyway|pg||
nt|westjava: stil have entry of J@S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: ok NOW @C finesse|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence by South. Left North on lead to ensure a heart switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tough I still belive 3NT are the best spot. But shallbe down|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess this is better than my play of @CA first|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: extract the max :)|pg||

nt|athene: not impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Canape is a style of bidding wherein longer suit is bid on second round|pg||
nt|panja: so here, W has 5 Clubs and 4 Hearts, he opened 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yet another straightforward 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: hard when partner didn't double any artficial diamond bids, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't expect opps to have so many diamonds that a ruff is likely|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C sign off?|pg||
nt|ritong: don t think 2@c was|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|xenya: but yes, they might try for bigger things|pg||

pc|sA|nt|athene: interesting 2@S rather than 2NT rebid from east|pg||
nt|pelu: they open 4 card major|pg||

nt|pelu: B24 NS in 6@S - played by N! - so diff to find the @H-lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: still, have to guess @cA|pg||
nt|athene: strong @C or a shaded 2NT opener?|pg||

nt|haans: desperado bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As Spec says witholding @DK a good move|pg||
nt|haans: hard to understand what is happening|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: best chance is that East lead her singleton @D = she cant have an A when she lead a singleton!!|pg||

nt|henryb: inspired*|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: yes :))|pg||
nt|athene: if north has announced strong balanced, east should be able to avoid the @CA lead|pg||

nt|brgpro: i've seen people leading singleton against a grand...so...|pg||

nt|charles_l: +1 here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This looks like closing it out forNL with only 2 boards to go|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: declarer is under no pressure here - although if south had @SK107 left, a diamond back wld be nasty|pg||
nt|pelu: the 4. slamswing: NS in 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: 96 imps changed hands in 11 boards|pg||
nt|haans: most likely 1@D did never happen|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: that's what we like to see!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: so all kibs - stay for tha last 2 boards!|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|brgpro: the last 2 bds will be pairs or BAM ( board a match)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: and hoping that his p has A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Dawei ask what 2@S was|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: wondering because no @S lead then no @S singleton|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCruff AH|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D and 1 down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...surprised no exploration for a major.  @D lead would set the @H (Hans' @H) to racing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  You probably wouldn't want to bid this one but the auction is very normal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|westjava: best line of defence...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think risky not to cash 2nd @C -- imagine North  3613|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@C now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- i'd like to retract that please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 = down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Dawei preserving @C really was very fine play|pg||
nt|westjava: that's why he was thinking a while|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E is still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: frustrating when player at table finds better play seeing only 2 hands than i found looking at all 4 :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, E thinking now at the scence|pg||
nt|westjava: E has to ask what was 2@S..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: S replied W 2@S = 3c+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is another case where holding trump Ace gives defender more choices|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,always think alot if you've A of trump|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Claim|pg||
pc|c2|nt|westjava: upss|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: E just asked N the same question about what 2@S was|pg||
nt|westjava: ty:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: same answer = 3+|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: now sure how they found the @D back|pg||
nt|afulton: by the way, on last hand... if ew could have made 7@c/@d ... the score would have been 1440 |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: E playing declarer for 3631|pg||

nt|daman: 2 boards  14 IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: 3 imps for badger|pg||
nt|daman: to tie|pg||
nt|ritong: not much to that one, apparently|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: well there were @Ss to deal with too |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not  a hand to be in 6 ...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: nederland seams to have made it ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 6@D has possibilities here|pg||
mb|2N|an|transf|nt|charles_l: will E dbl 2@d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|transf|mb|p|nt|brgpro: if 6@h is played by W, it is easier to find @d lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: E wont pass this...|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that Bocchi-Auken are exp that they are on lead - only 1 bad board - the 3NT-1|pg||
mb|3S|nt|charles_l: pass=2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yessssssssssss|pg||
nt|daman:  3NT here   has chances to go down, but not many|pg||
nt|daman: zero in fact|pg||
nt|ady: South needs to avoid a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but all W's cards in the minors were "right", so perhaps his final raise was not too unreasonable -- though somewhat inconsistent with the cuatious style he had dispalyed before|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR just finished (and not on a good note for Badger), so welcome to all those who have come here from the OR.|pg||
mb|4C|an| |mb|p|nt|xenya: sorry for bad typing|pg||
nt|xenya: so it might be 13 imps for the trailing team |pg||
nt|henryb: not enough boards left|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|pelu: no @D stop = stop!|pg||
nt|charles_l: should always make - @d sets up for a loser discard|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: a nice scientific auction, asking NS to lead diamonds, please|pg||
nt|xenya: but the gap is already too wide to overcome, true |pg||
nt|daman: up Simba|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: could be an important imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume they VIP it |pg||
mb|5D|nt|panja: EW could either play a third @D for W to ruff small|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|ady: nees to play a hearft to the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if EW just blast into the slam, i think it's far from obvious to lead a diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: at risk now|pg||
nt|ritong: this @d 3 was not a jewel|pg||
nt|daman: another @D by South|pg||
nt|ritong: i think @d J would have been much more helpful|pg||
nt|daman: un autre carreau par Sud|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, when declarer has K9x, it looks bad|pg||
nt|ritong: but anyways, north is not on lead soon|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the other room, declarer played a heart toward the queen|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ko immediato?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: The quiet before the (mild) storm of 14.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could choose to draw trumps and exit @SA and another here|pg||
nt|athene: then eventually the defence have to open diamonds or give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|ritong: a better move imho|pg||
nt|werge: This is in fact a very poor slam, even with the @C King on-side, it´s not extremely good|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, i agree|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: undo! :)|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: kib asked  is east Frances Hinden?|pg||
nt|daman: he/she would be on lead if South played another @D|pg||
nt|ady: thx kibs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I was wondering how it might make but this lead certainly helps|pg||
nt|haans: i am now corrected KO after 2x 14 boards|pg||
nt|werge: Surprising, that North did NOT just lead a small @D|pg||
nt|werge: So - come-on, how does he make this double-dummy?|pg||
nt|haans: so stay on 12:30 (italy time) for next part|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: of course nothing matters with both diamonds right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb: probably down one. no problem :)|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe down 2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East is indeed Frances Hinden, one of our regular commentators (Finch)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a busy poster on BBO forums|pg||
nt|daman: this contract was going down had S played a @D and not a @H   still may go down|pg||
nt|ady: not an unreasonable line |pg||

nt|werge: Honestly: North had 4 suits for his choce - and all three seems more "normal" than this @H-Queen|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: odds?|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Neg X and on for fight bough pairs?|pg||
mb|4S|an|.|nt|jcwla: On Board 23, where Hans conservatively settled for defending 2@S and beating it 1, in the OR Fu has made 4@H on an intricate play in which the AK7 opposite Tx of trumps, with Q986 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: in one defender's hand, came into play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4 should be asking bid|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C|pg||
mb|5C|an|.|nt|jcwla: So the only big swing so far is 11 to China.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need a @D lead now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I think I would have bid 3@D over the DBL...... to jack the auction up a level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually people have some mechanism for showing majors over a strong club|pg||
nt|afulton: wow, conservative raise!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W needed to force here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|westjava: Japan add their imps from   27|pg||
nt|sybarra: seen pard in action (balancing) before |pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S is ok|pg||
nt|afulton: but the 1@s bid could have been made without one of those aces|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I  would do more than raise|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but perhaps a 2@H bid might have given some juice to this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: now W can pass info to E cheaply|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@C & 4@S both = cue bids|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One of those rare occasions where N can even show QC if they keep going|pg||
nt|sybarra: so many specs suggestion 2 @H as bid bye W |pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if West bidding twice -- i prefer 3@C first   but i think should pass 3@D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Rob,no use redbl|pg||
nt|westjava: no loser in @C,@D and @S,then...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's that chance :)|pg||
nt|afulton: (which would show LR +) |pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: the hand with short @D needs honors to pull trump -- so really dislike 3@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: best to play cross ruff here|pg||
nt|westjava: on @H and @D, yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to be sure to cash the A@C in time|pg||
nt|westjava: dont forget to remember|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ruff cash @CA and A@H and cross ruff the best I can see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't south get to ruff high on 4th @H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: The new leader,Indonesia...|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: no problem...what can decl do..?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the other hand -- defense against 3@D is easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure why the pitch here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange:)|pg||
nt|westjava: a different plan...|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i dont know either why pitching...what's the line of play??|pg||
nt|mariner1: he did not pitch a loser so|pg||

nt|athene: putting her partner with the @DA|pg||
nt|ritong: after the strict fourth best lead|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: mistakes |pg||

nt|jcwla: final segment is scheduled for the top of the hour, so stay tuned.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows 3+ and is forcing. It denies 4 and a minimum|pg||
nt|werge: I think, that West has NO slam-ambitions here - knowing probably 6-5 by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i didnt envisage stayman there|pg||
nt|panja: y, Major suits..so more equal|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: only one think please Massimiliano or Max not Massimo :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  thx for thoughts and comments,  we appreciate them @H@H  hope you enjoyed |pg||
nt|henryb: and to the BBO staff who make this available to them and you all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a little scary|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Roland in particular who herds us cats (sometimes called commentators)   He works very hard to make this run smoothly  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: simple 3NT |pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: Whats for lunch Massi |pg||
nt|henryb: probably down 1. declarer will take the @c finesse, and a @h shift will sink the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: May be a sandwich or a salad.........very light however I could sleep on 3° tournment :)|pg||

nt|charles_l: Max is shorter to type :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: in the meantime 2@h is not going to be fun...|pg||
nt|athene: are you sure 1@S promises 3 spades? an earlier board suggested NS play 1@S = any weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it won't go 8 down which is what's needed to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she both asked and looked at the convention card|pg||
nt|haans: but he has a slammy honors|pg||
mb|5C|nt|panja: bye|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has 3 1Ss, 2@Ds and 3 @Cs -- unless she is clairvoyant|pg||
nt|athene: and now east's 2@S bid suggests the same|pg||
nt|werge: They might loose all here - North is ready with a DOUBLE|pg||
nt|haans: passing time now|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt is that Turbo?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: if she makes this she will gain 10 IMPS   a day late and a dollar short|pg||

nt|dcbutler: is there a playoff for third, or do both semifinal losers get bronze?|pg||
