nt|vasanti: followed by 4d music to ears|pg||
nt|oosmanb: nothing to be ashamed of in the west hand, infact the preempt makes you sit up just a bit more|pg||
nt|vasanti: or 4 @C if that is the style|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I guess he felt 3@c and 1/2 @d losers to cover|pg||

nt|oosmanb: ppp +1 is the problem|pg||
