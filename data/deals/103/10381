nt|Walddk2: Yes, and declarer took the right view in diamonds, helped by South's pre-empt|pg||

nt|doctorone: True Roland|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Arend Bayer|pg||
nt|doctorone: and, eventually, over 3N, the pair needs to have clear agreements to continue these types of auction|pg||

nt|cherdano:  well over 3NT, East has a slam force too i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, can bid 4@C over 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then they will likely get to 6@D which requires the same: a diamond guess|pg||
