mb|p|nt|frankaus: prescott has also represented Aus (paris 2001)|pg||

pc|sT|nt|frankaus: this will not be a challange - |pg||

nt|henryb: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but if that was allowed to make is criminal|pg||
nt|othered1: File under category: Preempts Work|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 6N can be made on this hand, but not biddable I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: junka has a marginal double|pg||
nt|sybarra2: nv,  think I might |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i filed under bad defense :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: pard can only take me so seriously |pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: @SQ and @HK both onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but it is do or dont, not think then do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble contributed little to describing aranha hand however|pg||
nt|othered1: I can see what north was thinking about.  Tough.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: strange hand, if north exits instead of cashing top spade the squeeze does not operate|pg||
nt|henryb: their dealing machine is in good form: 4@s might well go down and 6@d is beaten on the same bad spade break|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if this is gerber, they might get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: pushy non-vul raise.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart jack on the lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra2: good hand? |pg||

nt|fabsayc: i think i try to get them one higher with sampaio hand|pg||

pc|dA|nt|sybarra2: instead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i always splinter|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: wow, I wouldn't have believed it, but they did|pg||
nt|chick: some pretty aggressive bidding|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|frankaus: only making lines available IMO|pg||
nt|chick: yes, the only place he can find enough tricks is exactly the way the cards lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides redouble is support there (3 cards)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then no excuse for club shift|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: he is far from sure of setting 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: possibly, depending on style|pg||
nt|granguru: S needs to guess @HQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra2: we may see ace and a @S now |pg||

nt|fabsayc: your down 62, time to get going|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|frankaus: 5@C 3@D 3@S @H|pg||
nt|henryb: the problem with not knowing partner's second suit is that when you have a fit for only one its hard to take good saves|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: Tend to agree, since @C shift is possible if you tout partner off @H.  Or do you give count there?  |pg||

nt|fabsayc: but i hate auctions like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: and @S 4/4 how lucky can you be?|pg||
nt|granguru: All for EW here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb: I use 3@c to start auctions where I have only four hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: so this shows 4-5|pg||
nt|henryb: I have responder show, not ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many ways to play a hand like this|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: but reversing the dummy is attractive |pg||
nt|henryb: Other partnerships use transfers: 3@d would transfer to 3@h, and then 3@s would show 4-5; 3@h would transfer to @s and show 4+ and by inference either 4-4 or 5-6 in the majors|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|leao: agree... suit contract MUCHO better|pg||
nt|othered1: If I were east, @S are 5-3 and led.  I never get lucky when I keep my long suit out of the auction.  Chagas obviously has has different experience.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this is not one of the ways|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|othered1: rare, nowadays, to get to open with a flat 13 in 4th seat.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the other table  East responded 5N to 4N ask -- probably showing 1-KeyCard + void|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@D by a team that was being outplayed isn't surprising|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me would be 2 and void|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|henryb: Its a good thing that single imps are not crucial in this match since many boards are being misclaimed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: trump Q gets lost in the shuffle, so I really don't like the choice of 5N|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: would you rebid west's hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd be in the minority (it says here) and pass 1@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|othered1: yesterday I played with my only partner (and a long-standing one at that) who insists 5N is one plus a void|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: of course if responses to 4N KeyCard are 0314 then maybe worried 5@D gets passed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 1 ace if 5@D, i can see why you might avoid that|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: something mysterious about this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's fine agreement if you're sure void will help|pg||
nt|othered1: Is east's bidding natural?  Why 2@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i expect void to be irrelevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our East splintered with 3@S over 2@D |pg||
nt|othered1: Are they playing something like Blue Team Club, where the rebid of the 5-card suit was mandatory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so, but i might do it anyway to save space with aceless hand|pg||
nt|othered1: if 5@D is responding to key card ask, maybe excludes partner's secondary suit as a useful void.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|fabsayc: now was afraid 5@H to play, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S looks like ask @DQ|pg||
nt|othered1: That's looking for @DQ, I presume, guaranteeing all keys|pg||
nt|henryb: here I was just thinking that if n bid 3N they would probably make it tince West really could not lead a @d|pg||
