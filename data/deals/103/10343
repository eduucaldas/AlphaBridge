nt|petergill: Once East didn't play @D2 suit pref at Trick 1, from declarer's point of view the chance of a club switch and a ruff by a singleton @D in West was reduced. |pg||

nt|charles_l: good morning Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning/afternoon|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|kaz08833: hi all i joined here|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I understand what Banno means by 3NT now, but this is perhaps not the hand for it|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N doesnt seem right with 9 of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Peter Gill|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Hi Roland, Charles|pg||
nt|charles_l: hi Peter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 4@C whatever it means|pg||
nt|kaz08833: but it's hard to find alternative rebid by W... 2H (reverse)?|pg||
nt|charles_l: even Ger***?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should work out OK - East can tell that West must have solid clubs with either @HK or @HA.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Yes, in my methods I can jump to 2@H which does not necessarily show hearts|pg||
nt|charles_l: i call it rkc in opener's suit|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H cue bid showing 1st or 2nd round @H control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you need a special agreement. The Italian top pairs have that 2@H gadget|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Now 4NT RKCB for @C?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: from E's point of view the solidity of W's club suit is the problem|pg||

nt|petergill: Roland's warning that 3NT was an inappropriate rebid have turned out to be correct.|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West was worried that 4NT was quantitative, non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Next slam|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|petergill: Kaz is right - 4@H was a problem too|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6NT is safest|pg||

nt|petergill: NS CC http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/convention/Damayanti-Riantini.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 5@D now to ask for @SQ|pg||
nt|kaz08833: N wud better rebid 3@c instead of 3@s|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|charles_l: good point - KJx is good support when you've denied 4 with 2@s|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|petergill: I think North chose 3@S over 3@C due to the ideal texture of the spades QJ109|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kaz08833: after all S bid 6S blindly not knowing N had C!K and J|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't argue with success, but 6@S is a little lazy. 1. North migh have  J10xxxxx - 2. 6NT could therefore be a better spot|pg||
mc|12|nt|charles_l: back to 1 for comparisons with the closed room|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S is a good slam - the danger of a spade ruff in 6@C must be as high as the danger of a club ruff in 6@S|pg||
