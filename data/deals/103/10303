mb|1C|an| |mb|p|nt|athene: it never goes P P P these days :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Rashed|pg||
nt|athene: now we see if the sandwich 1NT is natural|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ty I hope we have a good match|pg||
nt|athene: many people play it so, given the light openings and (more especially) the very light responses|pg||
nt|athene: which are common these days|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|hedyg: double is natural :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok - 1nt was probably t/o for Ginossar|pg||
nt|athene: so he has to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not really ideal|pg||
nt|athene: it might encourage partner to bid spades|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well, you can get to dummy in spades and run the @C10|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that's seven tricks i suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: north doesn't have much but he does have two aces|pg||
nt|hedyg: a trick just grew|pg||
nt|rnc: The layout is indeed friendly here for West|pg||
nt|athene: balanced 11-counts with no aces are just rubbish|pg||
nt|athene: with one ace - they are mediocre|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: with two aces they are ok, if you are a happy enthusiastic sort of bidder :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: especially if as per agreements you open all 11+ hands|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: dummy has only one entry |pg||

pc|d5|nt|hedyg: Gino has a vivid imagination|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: he might be planning a cute @C5 lead from hand|pg||
nt|athene: trying to sneak past @CQxxx in north|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW won the Open European championships 2 years ago 4handed with Bessis father and son|pg||
nt|athene: the problem for the defence, always, in hands like this|pg||
nt|athene: is to avoid having to help declarer|pg||
nt|athene: either to reach stranded winners in dummy or take finesses|pg||
nt|athene: you need to make sure you don't get used as a stepping-stone|pg||
nt|athene: so north does best to cash aces and exit|pg||
nt|rnc: North is somewhat endplayed. Best is probably to cash both aces an return @H10|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise he will get endplayed with them|pg||

nt|athene: various slips on the hand but declarer made the final error, misreading the position|pg||

nt|athene: then he would be home unless north could win both trumps and put a diamond through each time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there was a possibility to play @S from the table and misdefense could result in 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: or @cs 3 3 |pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: you might switch to clubs and try to get diamonds away|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3-3 clubs he could still make it|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|athene: also you might try leading spades from dummy and trying to induce north to split from @SHHx|pg||
nt|hedyg: no you couldnt with just 1 sure entry to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: he might not want to give away a tempo if he is scared you can start running clubs - he might want to keep a small trump to ruff one|pg||

nt|athene: welland asking about the E-W defence to 1nt?|pg||
nt|athene: this is something that people often overlook|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|athene: just because E-W passed throughout doesn't mean their system can't tell you a lot|pg||
nt|athene: for example|pg||
nt|vugraphzth: yes.. also lead style, ruturn style.. hair style :)|pg||
nt|athene: knowing whether east had a penalty double available might well be very useful|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||

nt|rnc: and then you might have missed a 'cold' game :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: well, if you defend 1nt and the other room doesn't, you lose about 3-4 imps on average, from all the hands i have analyzed|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hedyg: ty Duccio :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: just what Welland wanted to hear|pg||
nt|rnc: exactly|pg||
nt|athene: heart length in Zia's hand is a good thing for his playing strength in a spade contract|pg||
nt|athene: he knows he can ruff hearts in dummy with no fear of an over-ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: too much to pass..|pg||
nt|athene: (assuming partner has the courtesy to have some trumps :) )|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: Pachtmann helping his opps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: zia knows that welland only has 2 hearts at most on the bidding, with 2 for west and 5 for east|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so was hoping for a few spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: CR had a lively auction to 4@D EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland thinking: can there really be 60 hcps in this board?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: E-W disagreeing here on the nature of 3@D, perhaps|pg||
nt|hedyg: decided no and passed|pg||
nt|athene: playing standard methods, with no intervention, transfer-then-3@D = GF|pg||
nt|athene: people often just happily bid the same thing in competition with nothing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but partner might take you seriously|pg||
nt|rnc: Those 60 HCP-decks are quite common nowadays|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: when you have all the HCPs and singleton in pd's suit leading it rarely good|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: can only hope pd will not take 3@d for gf after all the bidding by opps and understand it is shape|pg||

nt|athene: you can claim, saying "keep drawing trumps as long as necessary"|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: notice the pass by N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: now he is considering a double but is scared they have a million diamonds as a trick source|pg||
nt|hedyg: close..|pg||
nt|athene: but boards 24 and 25 have shown|pg||
nt|athene: just because EW bid game|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't mean they have any justification for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if opps keep going three down, eventually you decide you really have to double them|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: thats the one they make then?|pg||
nt|rnc: and all of a sudden they have cards for it :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course there is also the issue of whether 3@D is forcing|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: this situation is tailor-made for transfer advances|pg||
nt|athene: so instead of 2@S being the raise|pg||
nt|athene: you play 2@S = clubs, 3@C = diamonds, 3@D = the raise|pg||
nt|athene: then you can play new suits as forcing AND non-forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: so that S can double 3@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: give him a free bid?|pg||
nt|athene: well, this is true of any transfer bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnc: This might as well be another 3-down-board for EW|pg||
