nt|justin c: might pass this out|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Hi all and welcome, will be interesting to see the Hackett brothers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Typical modern light opening here and we will probably see a landing in 3NT.|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D    south?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David |pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no room for -en in Christiansen, so we will see Christians|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: not so light - 6 losers - ok opening|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  a make for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think n/s play a club system, however I find 1 @D an unusual opening |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C = diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play transfer advances|pg||
nt|justin c: or not|pg||
mb|2H|an|.|nt|sybarra: http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: e/w  can save in 6@H for -800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told they have some canape elements in their system |pg||
nt|justin c: north cue bidding to show a good @C raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@h good raise in @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Justin :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Please repeat the bidding...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy, Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to asses value of e/w hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: y, they are both imaginative players, and very nice guys|pg||
nt|werge: Here|pg||
nt|ady: be interesting to know what 3@C showed|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hans |pg||
nt|roswolf: hi shirley|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Shirley of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Welcome to this match from group Q, leading Apteker (74 VPs) vs Welland third (53 VPs)|pg||
nt|werge: I´ve seen worse 4 @H-contracts|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome to this match between two teams in the qualifying positions at the moment, but close enough to the cut off line that a loss here could be a serious blow|pg||
nt|werge: The lead is safing trick number 7 for East - can´t misguess the @S-suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland, Shirley, Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|patricck: EW can make 3NT, but bidding it isn't certain|pg||

nt|nubmaster: 3nt by south at the other table|pg||
nt|werge: Should lead to 3 NT with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like at least one off, even after this lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: pleasant lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nubmaster: yes it is :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4-2 fit played very well in the other room|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rnc: The Apteker team is a mixed of South Africa and Sweden|pg||
nt|justin c: so angelini going minus in both rooms|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: But there might be a danger - only give away ONE red trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jean |pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to get @ds going for a @s discard|pg||
pc|d5|nt|werge: The job is easier with North as declarer|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jean|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we know what the 3 @C was?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: vProoyen-Verhees play an Italian based strong club with canape opening bids|pg||
nt|patricck: the play shouldn't take long, 2 imps to harangozo|pg||
nt|andyv:  Roland, did W have 1@S available or was that also a transfer?|pg||
nt|patricck: 1 imp sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice quick auction:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk3: Hello Calle and Avram|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Ciao a tutti, hello everyone and welcome back to Sanremo in Italy for the 4th European Open Bridge Championships. Open Teams, Round of 32, last segment of 14 boards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: I prefer the OR auction.  There, N rebid 3@C over 2@H and S bid the 3NT.|pg||
nt|werge: East knows, that South has 9 easy tricks|pg||

nt|hantveit: Now south will be pushed to make it. He must take the diamond finesse. I cannot see other ways to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: No other way |pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe south could go wrong if east ducked the heart lead?|pg||
nt|werge: No - he would just fines in @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C would be transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: name for west is STEGAROIU.... BBO nick is pisoy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: either W plays S having the ace of @H or might endplay N to lead away from K of @S, I thing he will choose the later|pg||
nt|athene: north couldn't really double, even though he knows the hearts are no good|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wc all co commentators|pg||
nt|athene: E-W might have a million tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, though declarer is surely doomed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: E I mean |pg||
nt|chmitty: Seems that the strong Zimmermann team has had some problems during the first half|pg||
nt|chmitty: Trailing by 55 Imp's|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Pierre, Justin and Bill|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: good shift|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: Verhees only in 5 so he could take the club finesse |pg||
pc|s4|nt|hantveit: he definately should do that :)|pg||
nt|ady: showing long diamonds   - but undefined strength?|pg||
nt|sybarra: which was off |pg||
nt|sybarra: East |pg||
nt|andyv:  E pretty aggressive with 11 count and void in pd's suit|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has a good hand if there's any fit at all in diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: A club shift is needed that too C 10 preferably|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... and got stuck over 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: east would rather south were on lead|pg||
nt|athene: because south might find it harder to attack clubs, leading up to the concealed hand|pg||
nt|athene: but he wants to duck the first diamond to keep his entries fluid|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nubmaster: yes but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: Hi all|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am trying to make our operator correct the typo in South's name|pg||
nt|Walddk4: m  instead of  h|pg||

pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|chmitty: Well done :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: No, 1@S would be natural|pg||
nt|athene: @H5 = "clubs are nice" :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: - and to win|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a 1-round force|pg||
nt|chmitty: That's a difficult name|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But since Jens is that strong, he can afford to show his longer suit first|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Martin Wüst from Germany|pg||
nt|werge: In closed, East - a bridge teacher of good reputation! - bid 1 @D over ! C. (BON appetit!)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT would show clubs|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer shows out in a suit, the defence can use it for suit-preference right away|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: declarer playing to make, but now the roof falls in|pg||
nt|athene: he's lucky north doesn't have @h8 or @h7 :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: North is Rajesh Tiwari and South is Honey Prabakar both from India|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  process of elimination...6@s lead probably not 4th best:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Even H from South is good|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|chmitty: But for a great player|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to William Frisby|pg||

nt|raghavan: wc back all|pg||
nt|athene: amusing layout here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|werge: This double - just what East was hoping for|pg||
nt|werge: East has 13 loosers|pg||
nt|justin c: if this is a penalty double it looks quite aggressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: No majors call by E.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S is a 40% chance that doesn't make today, however the imp chart for teams encourages you to bid vulnerable games, even at those odds|pg||
nt|hantveit: Welcome to closed room Match A. |pg||
nt|chmitty: East is also Desmoulins and not Desnoulins|pg||
nt|justin c: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4@h for sure|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: NS have a club control - they just don't realise it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: on careful defence S should go down in 4@H losing 2@S and 2 @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 1NT, 2NT, 3@C?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C it is|pg||
nt|haans: nothing is really good|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make up to 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: north should surely pass this|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|werge: What has South showed - to me it can just as well go for a 15-17 as for 12-14|pg||
nt|andyv:  choice of games|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of points for n/s but need to stay quietly in game|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of points and hard to find a contract...probably will end up at 3N |pg||
nt|Walddk4: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|athene: of course the defence can take the first five|pg||
nt|athene: if they don't, it gets interesting|pg||
nt|athene: normal play with this sort of hand is cash one AK and try to drop the Q|pg||
nt|athene: then fall back on the finesse in the other suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||

nt|Walddk4: There it is|pg||
nt|andyv:  upside down n:)|pg||
nt|patricck: need to stay in 4@H, both 3NT and 5@D would be unlucky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they stop in game I wonder|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I like the pas from East - 5-5 in major, but too weak - 2@D (Michael) only help opp to find the right play|pg||
nt|bobholl: but in 2nd seat :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry no explanation of 2NT in the CC|pg||
mb|3S|nt|werge: I learned: In the middle = 14-16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Hungarians did in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems to be a general gf bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: East has an easy defence here|pg||
nt|pelu: to bid 2@D = hi opp - can I help u .)|pg||
nt|ady: with K@C onside  had they been breaking 3NT would have made |pg||
mb|4D|nt|hantveit: Looks like 3nt can be made EV Hans? 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades and one heart. |pg||
nt|patricck: nicely done|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes judged to a T|pg||
nt|andyv:  quality of E @h suit made bidding on precarious|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Opposite some partners you would worry about losing 4 trump tricks or so|pg||
nt|athene: NS might play Gazzilli here - 1NT or 2@C artificial with strong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: yes, in pairs you ca be more agressive but no reason to act here...|pg||
nt|werge: West ducks the @H-lead, and best for defence will now be a @S-shiftm killing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe not |pg||

nt|andyv:  E didn't even bother to cue @ss|pg||
nt|patricck: should be routine not to finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Søren Christiansen always takes his time. He is a very competent declarer. Was in the Danish team that won the bronze medal at the Olympoics in Rhodes in 1996|pg||
nt|patricck: but position of A@C would mean declarer is safe in any case|pg||
nt|hantveit: Monaco came 16th with 116 points in Swiss A, while Zimmerman won with 142 points.|pg||
nt|bobholl: with Q of @D tumbling down 6 is easy :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: Yes, how to reach 6 on this hand?|pg||
nt|bobholl: a protective micheals is somewhat undefined in strength i suppose :)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2NT isn't needed as big balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: he bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: i believe Bocchi-Duboin played it as 6-4 with 15+ hcp|pg||
mb|4S|nt|werge: If North continues @H, 9 tricks look safe|pg||
nt|hantveit: and south is not overtaking, he might overtake with K|pg||
nt|werge: Sout´s hesitation shows West, that she has K-x|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, that is a problem.|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good 4/5 club bid took away room for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: In you unblock the King, West is home|pg||
nt|ady: but that would have beden a lucky make|pg||
nt|werge: They just start bidding board 1 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: yes, good point. And his partner...|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes hard to govdown here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|werge: Over now 400 E/W|pg||
nt|werge: What´s problem - with @H 4-3 yoy just loose 4 red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: you|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: the 2@D in Open = 2@HX by East!|pg||
nt|jcwla: I paid my entry fee, I am in there helping them out at these colors. :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR east plays 2@hx|pg||
nt|andyv:  re hi|pg||
nt|athene: a fairly typical contrast in styles between the two sides here - West in the other room bid 3@C over 1@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|werge: Sorry - 5...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|nubmaster: just after a cue-bid showing M's|pg||
nt|justin c: very aggressive bid with that @C suit|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wouldn't have made :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 2@c not enough|pg||
nt|athene: but it wasn't really possible for NS to get their hands on 3@CX|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess that is why Brink chose 2NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: perhaps 2@c wass conventional by EW...?|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding the double - you have an open bridge-book for playing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: At the other table W plats 1NT doubled|pg||
nt|nubmaster: plays|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, the @S Jack is saving a lot for E/W|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: rather easy to see that there are 2 tricks in @d|pg||
nt|werge: But home now|pg||
nt|werge: claim|pg||
nt|hantveit: The contract can always be made, if south is not overtaking the hearts, dec can take the first trick and play diamonds. THAT wuold be a prize play :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|werge: First trick very interesting in this 3 NT...|pg||
nt|patricck: these two teams are tied for 14th=, but just 3 victory points ahead of the cut line|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: there was just no good bid to show the S hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Jens Auken was also in the team, but they were not partners|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D opener didn't stop east leading his 5-card suit in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps they play a strong club, so 1@D was nebulous?|pg||
nt|athene: that was weird|pg||
nt|athene: he really went up with the @CA??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) on Monday. Five more rounds of Swiss tomorrow|pg||

nt|hantveit: Interesting hands NS|pg||
nt|werge: I open 1 @H - the "less bad"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You will see them practise a lot on BBO, not least in the JEC mathes. Usernames are sac and jauken|pg||
nt|Walddk4: matches  even|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 8 didn't promote ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: not quite|pg||
nt|chmitty: don't think so|pg||
nt|athene: one thing worth mentioning is:- many people ask "is it right to bid 3@C with west or not?" |pg||
nt|athene: because passing and bidding 3@C are two actions so different, people think one must be much better than the other|pg||
nt|athene: but that isn't true|pg||
nt|athene: your expectation might be nearly the same|pg||
mb|1N|an|weak|nt|athene: sometimes 3@C gains big and sometimes it loses big|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: and easy 4@s here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ironic i think :) they were lucky... 5 or 10 out seemed more reasonable|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for 1@H here?|pg||
nt|werge: But in France no 1 @H-opening, I thins|pg||
nt|sybarra: very strong field in the tourney |pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting EW hands.|pg||
nt|chmitty: NS badly need swings|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hantveit: South has a 5 loser hand. North a 6 loser|pg||
nt|athene: NS in other room might play a strong @C, i thought, so 1@D only 2+ or something|pg||
nt|athene: then diamond lead much more attractive, of course|pg||
nt|athene: if one style was clearly inferior, it would have been weeded out by now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT=9-12 in 1st favorable..|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: That´s why he should have won the @c trick earlier and not be squeezed on the @d|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks for e/w  in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The most notable fact is that Team Lavazza did not qualify for Swiss A and that they won't qualify for the knockout phase either. They are currently 28th in Swiss B|pg||
nt|bobholl: could have been 6 |pg||
nt|justin c: not shy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s=nf natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok for me, but I have a passed partner, |pg||
nt|ady: sorry 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I am sure they are having a wonderful time as well as great bridge |pg||
nt|bobholl: only 5 or so in 14 :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: now a@C lead beats 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The rooms are not linked after the open room crash I'm afraid. We need our operator in this room to shut down and reconnect|pg||
mb|3S|nt|desert: not really.....Being vul and facing a passed pd i prefer pass|pg||
nt|hantveit: I agree Hans, I prefer IH also. The hand is too strong to open 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 6), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead impossible to find|pg||
nt|athene: 12 tricks is a lot|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 3NT went down1 so Texan gets another 12 IMP|pg||
nt|athene: did declarer set up the clubs, or manage to get 3 ruffs in dummy?|pg||
nt|hedyg: how should S find a @c lead?|pg||
nt|athene: well, if 2@S showed clubs, that's a hint|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eugenio?|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: very straightforward and correct bidding, but not a pleasant spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They stopped in 1NT next door after a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S transfer :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: it showed @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please be quiet for a second|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't you see that I am trying to say something to the operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The rooms are not linked after the open room crash I'm afraid. We need our operator in this room to shut down and reconnect|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nubmaster: 3NT by north after showing @s support in the OR...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: showing 3c support?|pg||
nt|hantveit: West has a 6 loser hand, East 7, East will push to game but no more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and even that contract did not make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Same lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  may be forced to play hearts correctly for this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But declarer will likely use his entry to dummy to finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT can be made double dummy, but only double dummy, declarer is very unlikely to play for Qxx of hearts offside and AQ of spades with a doubleton diamond |pg||
nt|athene: the former, on a trump lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: will be heading for slam in S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West looking for a major suit fit - 2NT was his alternative|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  @d spots make leaving entry tempting|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be they will bid 6 now |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, no double, no trouble|pg||
nt|chmitty: may be a small one here. Seems that EW could make 2NT but not 3 @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: no polish NT :)|pg||
nt|justin c: given the scoreline, South might have doubled this|pg||
nt|chmitty: he was probably hoping another bid by West after the cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Seems, that West (and East) have overbid their hands|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 hearts is checking if partner has a max hand..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh well, it's only going to go down 1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: N can't imagine such a weak hand with his partner|pg||
nt|pelu: dont push to hard - u risk to push op in ¤@s - making :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: weak nt opening by E and 3@S the contract in OR|pg||
nt|patricck: very aggressive by East in particular, game is not good, though we have all seen worse....  not even close to making on this layout of course|pg||
nt|bobholl: serious 3 nt ??|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnc: South is not so interested in 3NT with this weak hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Balicki Zmudzinski in 6@D on board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A discouraging spade perhaps, the 8 or the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a "correct way to play @H's? if so its now |pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder what 2@h was about since no alert.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: not that great a contract   need spade break plus only to lose 1 diamond trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no but the easthand wont pas any invitation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I know Søren too well|pg||
nt|hantveit: And then 4H: I have done enough.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would seem that you need to play for Qxx in order to have a chance|pg||
nt|athene: well, if 2@C was not GF, 2@H might just be 4th suit forcing to set up GF|pg||
nt|athene: even if no alert|pg||
nt|athene: or it might be garozzo-type auction where 2@C = clubs or balanced; 2@D = 11-15 without 4 hearts; 2@H = asking|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be... I'd still expect an alert:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This will be a push since OR also no slam 4S+2|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead looks very likely in here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|werge: I find Wests transfer-bid worse of all - he has nothing but his good health|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has been  employed at my bridge centre for 16 years|pg||
nt|athene: the only slight danger with trump lead is something like @SKJx in dummy and @SAxxxx in declarer's hand|pg||
nt|athene: partner doesn't usually thank you for finding his trump queen at trick 1|pg||
nt|raghavan: william and Andy - could 2H be 4th suit forcing twlling there is game?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Yes, 3nt there would work. But would you bid it with a flat 7 loser hand?|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't finesse i suppose|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: West will start in his BEST minor|pg||
nt|werge: Oh no...|pg||
nt|hantveit: Probably not. If D 2 is single, and south club AQ then you are down.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: not sure why the @C shift..tap might have been better (not that it matters) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I'm not familiar enough with the partnership style to assign blame  :)  but certainly someone overbid |pg||
nt|werge: Worse is, that minus 2 will take several minutes to reach|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hantveit: We are all waiting for the next hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: telling|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  finesse only works if qxxx is with E....if Qxx, doesn't matter who has that holding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As a spectator rightly points out, the Danish declarer in the other room had a certain route to 7 tricks, but had a blind spot|pg||
nt|patricck: finessing the J works against Qxx and Qxxx with East, while AK and small only works against Qxx in either hand, I think that gives the finesse an 8% edge|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks now, 2@hs, 3@ss 2@cs, 2@ds|pg||
pc|s7|nt|werge: A clever spec: Only @S-lead beats & NT by North|pg||
nt|werge: Double-dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 4), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @S passed out in OR|pg||
nt|patricck: might take 9 tricks with a safety play in trumps, but if you are in 4@H you can't take that line|pg||
nt|patricck: and still too difficult to dispose of diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx William|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: Lead @SK from hand and you can't be prevented from taking 7 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: X of 2@S probably showed weak spades (in context)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chmitty: Helness tried to double 4@h next room board 16 ... not a success|pg||

nt|justin c: y, north trying to suggest a non-@S lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes as in pls dont lead @ss|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|patricck: i was thinking the first two boards looked like a couple of pushes to get the match off to a quiet start......i obviously know nothing, the score is already 7-6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
