nt|Walddk2: 6@H is a fine contract, but it can't make on a club lead|pg||

nt|odysseus69: criticism of the Cavendish -just a difference in the format|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But with 27 tables in play delays are unavoidable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I missed the start of the last round- I suspect most would bid 3C with North - at pairs I dont believe it was right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wladow originally from Bulgaria, Elinescu from Romania|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sabine Auken has been living in Denmark for about 16 years|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even if you pass 2@D, it's hard to avoid balancing with 3@C when 2@H is passed back to you|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And white versus red ... this is not like board 4 earlier|pg||
nt|josj: 2NT OK of course :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So one would expect East to take the push here|pg||

nt|bjacobs: You could argue it, but what is wrong with 2@H?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble about 1S is that if oppo get busy the level may be uncomfortable to support hearts later|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Precisely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fallenius - Fredin    from Sweden .... well Fallenius has been living in USA for many years, but he is eligible to play for Sweden again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 x Ivanov from Bulgaria|pg||
