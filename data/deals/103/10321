mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bas Drijver - Sjoert Brink a long time successful partnership although they are still rather young. Isn't that so, Frank?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H    for n/s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lml: I like getting the cards when I am leading|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: correct! sjoert is 28 (19 febr 1981) and bas is 29 (1 april 1980 i guess)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|burry1975: they used to play together in the juniors, then sjoert played a few years with Erik Oltmans and Ricco van Prooijen|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me see if I can find a CC|pg||
nt|burry1975: Bas with Simon de Wijs (who is playing at the other table) and Maarten Schollaardt|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: this auction is clearly not natural|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf  for Fantunes|pg||
nt|burry1975: 2s is a relay I think|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C   another relay?|pg||
nt|lml: I am looking at the convention card and 2@C was a GF relay|pg||
nt|ady: should just lose the 2 aces     west can enter  to p lay a club and spades will be set up|pg||
nt|lml: after that I am guessing that 2@H showed the second suit |pg||
nt|lml: do you think 2@S asked shape?|pg||
nt|lml: shape and range maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's touch and go as to who will get the comparisons in this set. Fantoni here, Muller in the other room. 50-50 shot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muller may have the edge|pg||
nt|lml: the WBF convention card does have more|pg||
nt|lml: 2@H showed 4+@h|pg||
nt|burry1975: Lauria versace already in 5h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which will survive because East has all entries, but it's uncomfortably high|pg||
nt|burry1975: but bidding not over yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You think they will bid slam off two aces?|pg||
nt|lml: I am writing a series of blogs related to that|pg||
nt|burry1975: I'm not sure whether they are aware that they miss two aces else they'd pass 5h quickly|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: but with all these relays you would think they can check controls|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   rkc?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|burry1975: could be kickback indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H seems to confirm that, 2 with @HQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: north has nice shape   but with no aces  I would have tht would pass 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: well this is not a gimme|pg||
nt|ady: its ok as they lay|pg||
nt|lml: there is some guessing to do|pg||
nt|burry1975: but you sure don't feel comfortable once the dummy is down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah, he is not going to finesse @S9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is no guess really|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: apparently Nystrom did finesse the @S9|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: you could also try the diamond finesse if you prefer it|pg||
nt|lml: after spades don't come|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|burry1975: another board where NS feel they won't lose imps so they'll feel more comfortable by the board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ady: yes    but if you have drawn trumps  and play a spade  and east wins  he will likely shoft to a diamond to take away that option|pg||
nt|ady: shift|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All 1-level openings (suit) are forcing for E-W. 2-level openings show 10-13. 1NT is 12-14 in all positions, 6322, 5422 and 4441 possible. Not 5-4 in the majors though|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT  15-17  balanced|pg||
nt|burry1975: 3NT will be interesting to see|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S   seems a mystery   with no suit agreed?|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid makes 3NT a little more attractive but I guessed a balanced 8 was not enough|pg||
pc|s4|nt|burry1975: after a spade lead for the queen NS have two chances to play diamonds. but not necessary now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shows club suport, opener will only rebid them if he has 5+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if he has 15+ balanced he will rebid NT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 2@S is safe opposite 14+|pg||
nt|ady: but it seems paush on those values   is not 1NT enough especially as east does not guarantee 4 clubs?|pg||
nt|ady: pushy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not pushy, David. Either opener has clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You won't get too high regardless|pg||
nt|lml: in the worst case you wind up in 2NT with about 24 or 25 high|pg||
nt|ady: it seems you have reached 2NT rather than 1NT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: that is the worst case which can cost rarely I supppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, but you can't double when you don't have hearts|pg||
nt|burry1975: interesting to know that the dutch teams are not playing like they play in the dutch competition|pg||
nt|ady: what is wrong with 1NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It shows 12-14|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I explained that earlier|pg||
nt|ady: as responder?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|burry1975: drijver brink play for the Onstein with Bakkeren Bertens while their current teammates play for the Lombard|pg||

nt|burry1975: with Westra Ramondt|pg||

nt|burry1975: those other two pairs are now playing in Netherlands Red that beat the ORourke team earlier today|pg||
nt|lml: the cards are pretty friendly so this is not going to be much of a challenge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT in the other room was 12-15|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: Fantoni gave it a lot of thought before playing a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: minors are splitting well  eithersie may regret being above 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: this is a tough hand to play and to defend|pg||
nt|lml: with diamonds splitting I think Fantoni has 2 more diamonds, 2 hearts and a club and I think Brink will have to give him the dummy for the spade|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|lml: unless he does something strange in clubs -1 I think|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a different philosophy. The less trumps I have, the more partner has|pg||
nt|lml: its just that partner can get endplayed and other nasties when you can't lead one through ever|pg||
nt|Gerben42: that's the optimist... the less I have, the more dummy will haein 25-1 wo zumindest ein 25-3 gereicht hättee|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the more dummy will have|pg||
nt|ady: might have been -2  with a 2nd heart  if declarer went wrong on a club switch|pg||
nt|lml: -2 can come if they can get a trump promotion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a different ballgame if you make a negative double after 1NT (2@H). Then you must prepared for a pass by partner and he will usually only have four|pg||
nt|lml: best to play spades now and remove that possibility|pg||
nt|burry1975: now drijver needs to play trumps urgently before the ten promotes|pg||
nt|lml: but he is worried about the fourth club|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|ady: win Ace|pg||
nt|ady: then 2nd heart|pg||

nt|lml: Fantoni knows his partner has the Queen|pg||
nt|ady: we might be back to -2|pg||

nt|jtr: Oh he doubled! I wonder why?|pg||
nt|lml: it was a bit unfortunate for Brink that his diamonds weren't that useful on defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 IMPs now, what a finish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|burry1975: not a toilet finish as we once had in Monaco, but it's getting close:-)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C natural or bal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if I lost as a result of the previous board, it would haunt me|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lml: it is hard to tell what the exact match score is but Brink was very hungry to double 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: if it is a poor contract then his side already got a good result with their bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|burry1975: no good pips....west will pass this for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 3@H may be too high|pg||
nt|lml: there is that lure of a vulnerable game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: de Wijs plays 12-15 NT, so probably just 2@H there|pg||
nt|lml: I have felt it many times|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but he has no excuse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: confirmed by a spec|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Monaco down 18 with 1 to play now...|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Villa Fabbriche conceded a single IMP over 28 boards. Amazing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: heh same before with Meckwell I guess :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|burry1975: absolutely|pg||

nt|fabsayc: club lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lose @S finesse, ruff @C, @HA, ruff @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok not so hard|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: amaral for his 3@H bid was minimum, hence no cue bid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: but still greedy|pg||

pc|h4|nt|henryb: perhaps they play that 3N would be a serious slam try, and 4@c is a courtesy cue bid|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Gerben42: the other Dutch team won 10 on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: a slam here|pg||
nt|burry1975: 6D for NS or 6NT by south|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D vs 4@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 6@D is obviously the slam you want to be in|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@D it is in the other room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In the event of a tie, there will be a penalty shoot-out. Not sure who has the best goalkeeper|pg||
nt|burry1975: well no revoke and they're safe|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: South had a great hand for 4@C with controls everywhere and a source of tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|jtr: de Wijs looks as though he would be a good goalkeeper|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 5 tricks, lol|pg||
nt|Walddk5: only 5 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: well, 4 anyway|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1st to 1 nt?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|othered1: rare, nowadays, to get to open with a flat 13 in 4th seat.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the other table  East responded 5N to 4N ask -- probably showing 1-KeyCard + void|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@D by a team that was being outplayed isn't surprising|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me would be 2 and void|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb: Its a good thing that single imps are not crucial in this match since many boards are being misclaimed|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: trump Q gets lost in the shuffle, so I really don't like the choice of 5N|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: would you rebid west's hand?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd be in the minority (it says here) and pass 1@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|othered1: yesterday I played with my only partner (and a long-standing one at that) who insists 5N is one plus a void|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course if responses to 4N KeyCard are 0314 then maybe worried 5@D gets passed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 1 ace if 5@D, i can see why you might avoid that|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: something mysterious about this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: that's fine agreement if you're sure void will help|pg||
nt|othered1: Is east's bidding natural?  Why 2@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i expect void to be irrelevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our East splintered with 3@S over 2@D |pg||
nt|othered1: Are they playing something like Blue Team Club, where the rebid of the 5-card suit was mandatory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so, but i might do it anyway to save space with aceless hand|pg||
nt|othered1: if 5@D is responding to key card ask, maybe excludes partner's secondary suit as a useful void.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: now was afraid 5@H to play, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S looks like ask @DQ|pg||
nt|othered1: That's looking for @DQ, I presume, guaranteeing all keys|pg||
nt|henryb: here I was just thinking that if n bid 3N they would probably make it tince West really could not lead a @d|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|idblu: gn Larry :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: ok this auction looks fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well deserved pickup|pg||
