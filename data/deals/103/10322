mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: North could open 1C with her 16 HCP, but I agree with her choice of 1D followed by a 3C jump|pg||
nt|gracelin: she downgraded her hand to 14-15 pts with these wasted Q in major suits.|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes easier to show both suits this way|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: remember they are playing Precision with limited opening.  So if south returns to 3D it will be NF|pg||
nt|patricck: If South bid 3@S then North would be nervous about bidding 3NT on @HQ10, so 3@H was a good bid by South |pg||
nt|gracelin: unlike in natural bidding system where a jump shift is already GF|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, she could also visualize north having either a singleton or void in spade.|pg||
nt|gracelin: since 3C showed 5-5 and 3NT showed at least a doubleton heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|gracelin: south is evaluating whether 3NT or 5D will be the right contract.|pg||
