nt|bgn: This is the 10th day of competition, and there is a trip to the Bermuda Bowl at stake, so the players are likely to be feeling the pressure|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|gracelin: 6C by south is making but don't thk that a contract worth bidding.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|gracelin: Chinese Taipei is only fielding four players for the 10 whole days.  The 5th player Mr. Yeh back home on first day of play  and the 6th player Chihua Chen  is without a partner.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|bgn: Wow - they have done really well then|pg||
nt|gracelin: north has a good hand if south is interested in a club slam.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|gracelin: either DA or a spade lead will make 6C rather easy to play, ruff one heart and hope both H/C break.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bgn: horrible opening lead problem against 6@C. @C probably best, but @CJ makes that very scary|pg||
nt|gracelin: The gap will be within 3 imps if Karwur make this (which I am sure he will).  |pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, my guess is either DA or a low spade.  Both make life easy for declarer|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|gracelin: DA is better than a low spade, since after the ruff, declarer maynot have enough entry to ruff and enjoy his long heart.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|yr: strong @c here too|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|yr: E will have to find a @d lead against the expected 3NT|pg||
