nt|sssvablue: Hi AL|pg||
nt|sssvablue: This might have been a Wolff variant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i thought i'd sneak in quietly :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: Yes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|westjava: I prefer to bid 2nt by N and all pass|pg||

nt|mrbig01:  well bid it seems, I guess we saw GF Stayman here|pg||
nt|sssvablue: what if west shifts to a @H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when that holds -- attack @C|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: if it loses -- things still look very good|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sssvablue: then east flies ace of clubs, puts another heart through|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mrbig01:  It helps that there is no duplication in hearts|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcwla: I agree with you Liliek.  N has seemingly forced to game.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|westjava: @D finess not working|pg||
nt|westjava: yes by 2@H bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if @C 2-2 she would be claiming on the lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Indonesia made 3NT on the nose on 17, so 2 to China.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sssvablue: now you are in danger of losing @d 2h 2c|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: true -- but duck seems to gain in all other situations -- and looking at that dummy - how likely is @H switch?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: I was just checking, hard to find|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but your concern about @H probably why Nakamura took so long before playing to trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but probably overwhelming case is win trick 1 loses so many times when @D 52|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what's up now?|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sybarra: at this pace, we may finish by sunday?|pg||

mb|5D|nt|kiwibridge: overboard again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with the 4@C raise - easy defense for South to lead @HA then underlead @C for ruff|pg||

nt|jcwla: BTW the 1@D opening with the 2-4-5-2 11 count was duplicated on 23, though it may not have had quite the same meaning.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: North doesn't know about 7th @S - so will get to 7@S instead of 7N|pg||

mb|7S|nt|jcwla: 25 saw N/S take 11 tricks in 1NT (7 in here), so 3 more to China.|pg||
