mb|1C|nt|lml: Gill almost didnt score in the first segment so it would be nice to get something on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugrapha3: they don't play standard minor openings|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: but sure , this depends from agreements about 3@C opening, may be they play destructive preempts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Page well wourth to bookmark. Then u always get the web pages for the turneys at BBO: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: the clubs did look kind of attractive but I would lead a heart myself|pg||
nt|buffytvs: normal lead, but not one that will strike fear into the heart of declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: heart lead is Trick 7 right there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And we have the two top ranked team at the finale as I can see. Look at: http://www.nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2009&dir=congress/nssc&E=0&R=3&T=I|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: are Burgess-Prescott playing a natural system??|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|kastan88: watching from here, from Dark side of Earth (Estonia), seems that Australians opening all 10-11 points hands usually :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: think this always makes in fact|pg||
nt|lml: I think after he ducked the club he might have gone done|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both have long history with Moscito -- Prescott has his own Modified Polish -- so the settled on Acol|pg||

nt|rodal f: And here u are the web for this turney: http://www.northshore.bridge-club.org/|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|buffytvs: yes -- diamond shift then.  Tough to find|pg||
nt|lml: yes but the duck by declarer was a mistake|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lml: maybe thats harsh|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||

nt|lml: South needs to cash to hold the uptrick |pg||
nt|lml: if he counts East he knows he has to|pg||
nt|lml: Burgess has the @sA/K for sure|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: a slam?  I think game may have problems here...|pg||
