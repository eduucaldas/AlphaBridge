mb|p|mb|1S|nt|leao: hi all, good evening|pg||
nt|othered1: Wonder if they're exact or if they prevent a tie in any case?|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Leao!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a good joke, psychic redouble|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the easiest contract to find|pg||
nt|granguru: or 6NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Pretty solid raise by east.|pg||
nt|granguru: specially when you dont bid the suit|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@D would m|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could bid 4@D now|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@D would not mean the suit anyhow in this sequence|pg||
nt|granguru: but 6@D|pg||
nt|granguru: now ?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|frankaus: both jedi & prescott originally from NZ but now live and play in sydney|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hhi, everyone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: need some kind of suit preference signals on the trump leads|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 13 tricks in hearts, but hard to find auction where you can be sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Can they find 7 on what looks like a quantitative auction?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|othered1: If east has a chance,he might see solid @D tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: perfect|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, some bid|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@H shows a strong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess he was hoping for one spade opposite|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: possibly 10 and low to show spade card|pg||

pc|dK|pg||

mb|1C|nt|granguru: ANOTHER 6@d?|pg||

mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: i am still trying to figure out how NS scored 460 on board 33|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: Just 5|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: 2@D presumably multi|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra2: welcome leao @H|pg||
nt|othered1: ON EW cards alone, there is play for 4@H (less for 5@C). But they haven't gotten into the auction yet|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H could be iffy on @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H is presumably a transfer cue bid|pg||
nt|granguru: as @C are bad distributed|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: prescott has also represented Aus (paris 2001)|pg||
mb|p|nt|leao: ty Shirley :))|pg||
nt|othered1: They play Smolen (jump in shorter suit when 4-5 in the majors)|pg||
nt|leao: 3nt seems unbeatable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sampaio not thrilled with his options|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt might be a very silly looking contract|pg||
nt|leao: nope, but he´ll be a happy ca,per when the dust settles|pg||
nt|leao: ca,per=amper|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|leao: oops|pg||
nt|othered1: Smolen is OK, but it does take up a lot of room without much other information imparted|pg||
nt|othered1: regardless, this is a steal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: helps to know your playing it also|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: I would say 3@H is a psiquic bid|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|frankaus: this is R9 of 10 round swiss  - no final|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: to what purpose, i dont get it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: double 1nt perhaps, but not without risk|pg||
nt|othered1: That @S bid behind him is a good reason to take pause|pg||
nt|leao: Bermuda Bowl 2009 www.brazilbridge2009.com.br|pg||
nt|othered1: On the other hand, NS are pretty aggressive with openings, so east did have something to think about.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|granguru: I am corrected 3@H means @D suit and it is FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if it was a psyched figuerdo would raise hearts|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: 3nt might have gone down on a neutral lead such as a heart|pg||

nt|othered1: Should east have found the defense?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what defense?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: Villas Boas says He saw West signaling @h therefore only singleton K@s would do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@S-1?|pg||
nt|leao: yes, dynamite board|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
mb|2C|nt|leao: amaral´s @h bid will slow figueiredo down, i guess|pg||
nt|leao: if marcelo bids his @h, that is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west has a problem, too few points for 2@H, some would solve problem with a jump to 3@H, some would ignore the points|pg||
nt|othered1: cash minors lead second @H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this will make, no entry to south|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S can make by forcing entry to dummy in @S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: 1NT here is 19|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 18-20ish|pg||
nt|chick: must be a weak-2 only multi, not including the balanced 20-21|pg||
nt|henryb: And sensible people pass and wait for partner to reopen|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb: the most underused card in the bidding box: the green one|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|leao: they´ll stop at game |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the deadly kokish convention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but amaral failed to get the email|pg||
nt|othered1: North south did bid like it was their hand and gave west quite a problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont agree with 5@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this will not be a challange - |pg||
nt|othered1: That said, 5@S is very pushy.  East on the other hand didn't know if west was bidding to make or saving, so didn't act over 5@H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: really - ordinary hands so far|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 4@S says pick, i bid 4nt (no you pick)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: this should show hearts and clubs, the 3c rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: although kokish himself inverts the rebids|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|sybarra2: hello all  |pg||

nt|sybarra2: hi Martin |pg||
nt|henryb: Chagas makes sure of the setting trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but if you are always going to bid 4 then 5 when not vul, opponents can bait you with a raise to 5h|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: 5nt useless, you need third round club control|pg||
nt|henryb: Since 4@h is one down on best defense, this is sort of a phantom|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this should roll home |pg||
nt|fabsayc: in his series on KCB, Kantar described the use of a side suit at six level as asking for third round control|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|othered1: Absolutely, and they're pushing you around and you have favorable vul!  But west is at the table, and we aren't and this isn't a standard situation|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but a lucky one in down the same as 5@D|pg||
nt|henryb: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but if that was allowed to make is criminal|pg||
nt|othered1: File under category: Preempts Work|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chick: 6N can be made on this hand, but not biddable I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: junka has a marginal double|pg||
nt|sybarra2: nv,  think I might |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i filed under bad defense :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra2: pard can only take me so seriously |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: @SQ and @HK both onside|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: but it is do or dont, not think then do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble contributed little to describing aranha hand however|pg||
nt|othered1: I can see what north was thinking about.  Tough.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: strange hand, if north exits instead of cashing top spade the squeeze does not operate|pg||
nt|henryb: their dealing machine is in good form: 4@s might well go down and 6@d is beaten on the same bad spade break|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: if this is gerber, they might get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: pushy non-vul raise.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart jack on the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: good hand? |pg||
nt|sybarra2: would you bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think i try to get them one higher with sampaio hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra2: instead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i always splinter|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: wow, I wouldn't have believed it, but they did|pg||
nt|chick: some pretty aggressive bidding|pg||
pc|c6|nt|frankaus: only making lines available IMO|pg||
nt|chick: yes, the only place he can find enough tricks is exactly the way the cards lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides redouble is support there (3 cards)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then no excuse for club shift|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: he is far from sure of setting 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: possibly, depending on style|pg||
nt|granguru: S needs to guess @HQ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we may see ace and a @S now |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|henryb: and if partner's minor is diamonds?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: your down 62, time to get going|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@C 3@D 3@S @H|pg||
nt|henryb: the problem with not knowing partner's second suit is that when you have a fit for only one its hard to take good saves|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|othered1: Tend to agree, since @C shift is possible if you tout partner off @H.  Or do you give count there?  |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: the argument was that S didn t play @h 2 which would be switch for @c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: attitude first|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|leao: @c return...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club was the only plan with any hope|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2 is not enough|pg||

mb|4D|nt|henryb: Its important to have methods that distinguish between 4-4 in the majors and 4-5 in these auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|leao: wow : ))|pg||
nt|granguru: Aces are bad distributed...|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and for most of us this auction shows 44|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but i hate auctions like this|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra2: and @S 4/4 how lucky can you be?|pg||
nt|granguru: All for EW here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: I use 3@c to start auctions where I have only four hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: so this shows 4-5|pg||
nt|henryb: I have responder show, not ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many ways to play a hand like this|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but reversing the dummy is attractive |pg||
nt|henryb: Other partnerships use transfers: 3@d would transfer to 3@h, and then 3@s would show 4-5; 3@h would transfer to @s and show 4+ and by inference either 4-4 or 5-6 in the majors|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|leao: agree... suit contract MUCHO better|pg||
nt|othered1: If I were east, @S are 5-3 and led.  I never get lucky when I keep my long suit out of the auction.  Chagas obviously has has different experience.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|leao: as soon as they stop with @s fandango, there are 10 tricks for the taking|pg||

pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: this is not one of the ways|pg||

nt|fabsayc: Kaplan inversion is standard, but now we find out not so by a passed hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: standard in brazil|pg||
nt|othered1: Standard?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: general plan was to force an entry to partners hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart shift|pg||

nt|othered1: wouldn't 1S shift (to 8) have worked better?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: several ways to beat, none particularly obvious|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 1 more to d'orsi for pretending to own spade ace|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes once he pitched a heart, just 2 hearts and 2 clubs|pg||

nt|yuki: boards.... both rooms are being transmitted, but they are not concatenated at this yime|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|othered1: Might east have made it easier by unblocking @HK when given the chance to keep off lead?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: perhaps, but I still think it's the 3rd worst lead in bridge :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: that was one of them|pg||

nt|yuki: due to technical problems we have experienced earlier today|pg||

mb|3H|nt|othered1: This is a lucky position rfor EW to escape with their lives|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|vugrapha3: the bidding is correct |pg||
nt|chick: 1@S could be either some agreement we don't know, or a psyche to prevent a spade contract|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|othered1: rare, nowadays, to get to open with a flat 13 in 4th seat.|pg||

nt|othered1: 7@D by a team that was being outplayed isn't surprising|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me would be 2 and void|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: Its a good thing that single imps are not crucial in this match since many boards are being misclaimed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: trump Q gets lost in the shuffle, so I really don't like the choice of 5N|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: would you rebid west's hand?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course if responses to 4N KeyCard are 0314 then maybe worried 5@D gets passed|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: something mysterious about this auction|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: that's fine agreement if you're sure void will help|pg||
nt|othered1: Is east's bidding natural?  Why 2@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i expect void to be irrelevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our East splintered with 3@S over 2@D |pg||
nt|othered1: Are they playing something like Blue Team Club, where the rebid of the 5-card suit was mandatory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so, but i might do it anyway to save space with aceless hand|pg||
nt|othered1: if 5@D is responding to key card ask, maybe excludes partner's secondary suit as a useful void.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: now was afraid 5@H to play, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S looks like ask @DQ|pg||

nt|fabsayc: back tomorrow same start time for segments 3 and 4|pg||
nt|henryb: and our last board of this set|pg||
nt|yuki: 1 imp to dorsi|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so last bd now |pg||
nt|sybarra: are we back to night ? |pg||
nt|leao: next set of hands to begin in 15 min|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so by continuing diamonds he would force declarer to take a premature pitch|pg||
nt|yuki: total tally is 11 in this session|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuki: for gabriel|pg||
mb|1S|nt|leao: 16 more|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|henryb: good night all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator, good work|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the other table is a few boards behind|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: eschewing a 2-suited bid, if available|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and thanks to shirley (sybarra), who got blown off the net by a local storm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play will continue after a short break with 16 more boards today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2nt for all?|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on opening standards, maybe the question is 2@D for all?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is one suit i would not rebid (2@H)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: 2@S seems to tell more|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well north to me has a clear 3h rebid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: and to al and ed for joining at the end|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: this auction not possible for most of us :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yuki: 2@s made at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume they are playing for fun, because the two pairs on the Chagas team are N-S in both rooms|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tables are not linked for a start|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: of at least not without shouting and screaming|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: even if my analysis was double dummy WRONG?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree as to north's rebid.  And if I were to start south with 2 GF @D, I'd rebid 2N, too.  Or maybe with 2 non-GF @D, too.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|othered1: this isn't a bad start at all for south in 2@H.  Keeping the nature of his hand relatively unknown helped a bunch.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: more spectator comments would be appreciated , was a silent bunch till chagas table closed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit - i'm a long time Chagas fan too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is a character, i kibitzed him in 1984 in Seattle, combating the new zealand "fert" bids|pg||
nt|othered1: south wondering did they put me here to make a losing @D play?  But all will be well|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose i am a minority, but to me this is a 2@s rebid over 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: less commital bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Not me.  But that has to do with how far 2@D uis forcing, etc.|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye for now.|pg||
nt|leao: ty all for now|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok back in some time,  remember we have Macau comiing also   |pg||
mc|7|nt|yuki: 5 more for chagas,,, 16 imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: players are seated correctly, simply that other table has the colors of teams backwards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you want to see any action, i suggest you move to open room, they have 4-5 boards to play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are done here until the comparisons|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for the golf fans, ricky barnes leads us open by 3 strokes|pg||
pg||
