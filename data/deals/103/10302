nt|werge: I´ve seen worse 4 @H-contracts|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome to this match between two teams in the qualifying positions at the moment, but close enough to the cut off line that a loss here could be a serious blow|pg||

nt|hantveit: Now south will be pushed to make it. He must take the diamond finesse. I cannot see other ways to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: No other way |pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe south could go wrong if east ducked the heart lead?|pg||
nt|werge: No - he would just fines in @D|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: either W plays S having the ace of @H or might endplay N to lead away from K of @S, I thing he will choose the later|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: Verhees only in 5 so he could take the club finesse |pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nubmaster: south will be looking for slam here, dont you think? nice cards though|pg||
nt|sybarra: Lets try that website instead of PABF   (sorry)|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|an|.|nt|werge: This double - just what East was hoping for|pg||
nt|werge: East has 13 loosers|pg||
nt|justin c: if this is a penalty double it looks quite aggressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: No majors call by E.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S is a 40% chance that doesn't make today, however the imp chart for teams encourages you to bid vulnerable games, even at those odds|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|april7: on careful defence S should go down in 4@H losing 2@S and 2 @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 1NT, 2NT, 3@C?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C it is|pg||
nt|haans: nothing is really good|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make up to 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: north should surely pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: What has South showed - to me it can just as well go for a 15-17 as for 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: Zimmerman is ranked  1 and WH is tied for second at moment |pg||

mb|3H|nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: I like the pas from East - 5-5 in major, but too weak - 2@D (Michael) only help opp to find the right play|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: I learned: In the middle = 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: East has an easy defence here|pg||
nt|pelu: to bid 2@D = hi opp - can I help u .)|pg||
nt|ady: with K@C onside  had they been breaking 3NT would have made |pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: Looks like 3nt can be made EV Hans? 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades and one heart. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|nubmaster: yes, in pairs you ca be more agressive but no reason to act here...|pg||
nt|werge: West ducks the @H-lead, and best for defence will now be a @S-shiftm killing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe not |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|h4|nt|werge: If North continues @H, 9 tricks look safe|pg||
nt|hantveit: and south is not overtaking, he might overtake with K|pg||
nt|werge: Sout´s hesitation shows West, that she has K-x|pg||
pc|h9|nt|werge: In you unblock the King, West is home|pg||

nt|sybarra: very strong field in the tourney |pg||

nt|jeanhari: keeps it to 9 tricks, otherwise 10|pg||
nt|werge: But E/W in @D seems fair enogh|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|nubmaster: 1 level is ok here.. |pg||
mb|3C|nt|werge: Should we repeat the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tiny.cc/eegFD  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt think Versace would go quietly |pg||
nt|patricck: radulescu licking his lips|pg||
nt|sybarra: (of course S just loved that call) |pg||
nt|sybarra: E likely to bid again|pg||
nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a question |pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: aI open a lot of 11 HCP-hands - but this time closer to pass - bad suit - no Aces and problems to show the good @Cs|pg||
nt|werge: Sure East will bid NOW|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, much to West's disappointment|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may get the @D lead now |pg||
nt|werge: Must be FORCING|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: and 3!nt is better than 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Marty Bergen believes, "Virtually any hand that is worth opening will contain at least two quick tricks."|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: I think they play that 2@C is either natural and GF or a 9-13 @S raise|pg||
nt|nubmaster: He has showed 9-13 3c support and 5c @c|pg||
nt|justin c: presumably 2@D asked and 2@S showed the good raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: did they forget to check aces in CR?|pg||
nt|hantveit: No need, I checked the spectators - no Danish :)|pg||
nt|haans: the use 1@C-1@S as a relay bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: I see the first 8 tricks for West -let´s see|pg||
nt|patricck: the cards are friendly for EW|pg||
nt|werge: Lucky, that South has the 8...|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c8|nt|ady: looks llike diamond lead|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: q of @D lead looks a lot more interesting from W  |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or to W I should say |pg||
nt|jeanhari: sorry, 10|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nubmaster: good lead|pg||
nt|werge: Why keep the @D-entry in North - South is short of entries|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|werge: Might bring him 8 tricks, if he plays @c immediately|pg||
nt|jcwla: West might also have handled this hand differently.  An action double instead of 3@S would be my preference having bid 2@S on the previous round.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR south bid 1NT showing @hs and a m and thet were in 3@h but east bought the contract there with 3@s.. another push here?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: now N shall play @dK or continue with @s|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, that was a bit sleepy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: now or never, ace of @H|pg||
nt|werge: VERY sleepy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: Will normally cost the first IMP in this match|pg||
nt|ady: can relax while this is played|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|pc|d9|nt|nubmaster: Q of @c now|pg||
nt|ady: might still make only 9 as cant aford to play a spade  till taking 9 tricks   depends on the discards from east|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|patricck: it felt as though the K@H might have been a good card at trick 2, but that needs the 9@H to come down, which doesn't happen either|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hantveit: agree, but I a was trying to be nice for a change|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of frozen out of both hands  |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|jeanhari: will he play for spade ace in west (no overcall) or take his tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|hantveit: heart ace and a new heart and still a flat board|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|werge: Seemed to work also, East assisted with the @C-finesse|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dT|pc|s4|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|nubmaster: difficult|pg||

nt|jeanhari: not 10?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: will want to stay as low as possible here i'd think|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nubmaster: are they playing strong @c? So 1@d is nat or 11-13 NT ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: careful play needed, ruffing @S twice in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: South has 8 losers, I would bid 2H - pd passed first, now way there is a game on.|pg||
nt|werge: On a good day, South might get 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hantveit: no way|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: No action here.. 1NT at the other table with west as declarer.|pg||

nt|werge: OH - back again|pg||
nt|werge: Oce upon...|pg||
nt|werge: Once|pg||
nt|patricck: Versace buys a better dummy than he might have feared, the Q@H is a welcome sight as the @HKJ7 looked a bit sick under Easts majors|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: odd bidding again|pg||
nt|hantveit: good start for dec.|pg||
nt|werge: I would like to play this contract - if I might now and then play from the South hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: no safely in game |pg||
nt|haans: some chance to make +2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hantveit: I think it generally is a bad idea to lead single when you have 4 trumps. Better to attack dia.|pg||
nt|werge: South has only ONE problem - she has no tricks...|pg||
nt|hantveit: lol, a well known problem to us all|pg||
nt|werge: Could have been worse!|pg||
nt|ady: could make 12 tricks  if getting hearts right   but a terrible slam|pg||
nt|haans: sorry @CK wrong|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: finess in @c and crossruff  with so solid @h|pg||
nt|rnc: I think 1@C is 17+ and 1@H a fairly balanced hand (no 5c M/6+m/55 m). East gave room for West to show his handtype|pg||
nt|april7: hi shirley, neither do I|pg||
nt|patricck: that will be the difficulty :)|pg||
nt|werge: The only entry is best used for @c to the 10, I think|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: hi all,  just dropping by, |pg||
nt|rnc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: I did not understand the pass over 1 @S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe we used up all the action boards in the last match.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jeanhari: probably will get hearts right|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: hello Shirley|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: oh, I see|pg||
nt|april7: E bid 1@S not N|pg||
nt|sybarra: or if N bid 1 sp,  1 @H was gf, and pass was forcing is what on spec suggested |pg||
nt|april7: if W plays on @C with the finesse then its easier to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now they will bid 6@h|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|desert: ;)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: duplication in diamonds   on a bad day could go down in 4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hantveit: should unblock club 6 there, in case it is an endplay later.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|werge: @C-ruff and a trump - still I only see 7 tricks, but you might do better|pg||
nt|patricck: double dummy that is certainly true|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|april7: its better to take @C finesse first, because even if it works, has to make @C finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|april7: if @S finesse works W has to take @C finesse anyway|pg||
nt|rnc: Remains to play it cautiously|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead for the defence is @h9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|hantveit: when you know the spade honors are behind the king - play low from the king.|pg||
nt|hantveit: I cannot see how now. Maybe ruff a dia and play low spade from K, but too late now. Vest will play spade J and Game over|pg||
nt|werge: When I was a child, we just ruffed and plaued the @H 10 - but that´s long time ago|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - born during second world war...|pg||
nt|hantveit: So, you are still semi-young|pg||
nt|werge: West, please - it´s my lunch-time we are playing with now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|nt|april7: then @C finesse @C@Cruff ace of @D @C ruff and pull trumps and so on|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|werge: Fast and easy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: don´t play on @c too early. S will discard a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after this lead W must have a good count on N|pg||
nt|april7: if 9 of @H fourth with S then its more difficult, but  S will play for 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: Ace or King first|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|werge: Does this 10 really show the Jack?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hantveit: spade T??|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnc: This board will bring Apteker back in the match|pg||
nt|april7: ruff @C, Q of @H, K of @H and again @C ruff high and to ace of @D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hantveit: Now at least - spade J|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No @s discard!|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes|pg||
nt|werge: Looks now like 5 IMP´s for Nederland|pg||

mb|3H|nt|werge: 1 @H Doubled...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|patricck: very lively scoring, every board trades at least 5 imps|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @D here - if you can guess the @C-suit, which the bidding might make easier|pg||
mb|d|nt|hantveit: 12+13 EV, but no fit in majors. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@C ok, 3NT in danger?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: not clear yet, Nick at east still's thinking|pg||
nt|nubmaster: or 3NT directly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no 11 trick in clubs, sorry|pg||
nt|haans: overcall make them find 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 10 tricks in clubs   I wonder if they will try 3NT    which is likely to fail|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S X with his spades?|pg||
nt|patricck: North more likely to bid 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: most X saying no spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes hence my question |pg||
nt|sybarra: and can N a spade agst 3 nt? (next question) |pg||
nt|ady: playing reverse system   double says no help?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: he passed, same contract at both tables|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 12 points and a good 5 card suit?|pg||
nt|haans: what better lead does he have?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A Roland slam here.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not in teams, they have to investigate the @s's|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 12-14 - and open for bidding by pd if he is very strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: a @H lead sees declarer home, the defence does better to play spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what does E lead?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hantveit: and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|sybarra: true,  not much |pg||
nt|sybarra: thats impresive!|pg||
nt|patricck: I lead a @H and watch them chalk up 9 tricks, thats why stegariou is playing and not me :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *impressive |pg||
nt|werge: His longest (side)suit|pg||
nt|patricck: Stregaroiu sorry....must watch that spelling :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: even without a spade lead   could still go down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hantveit: are they playing pass system?|pg||
nt|hantveit: That makes more sence|pg||
nt|jeanhari: if declarer reads spade well he can make this|pg||
nt|haans: how does South  enter to lead @S|pg||
nt|ady: White house missed the close 4 spade game on board 13|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|desert: This board doesnt look very exciting, too....|pg||
nt|werge: What is the E/W system . Jump to 3 NT...?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting contract, there are ways to reach 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess is that they play some kind of pass system Hans.|pg||
nt|werge: EaST HAS APPARENTLY OPNENED 1 @c !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ady: yes   duck first won and take 2nd|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|justin c: this looks like it is going to be very close|pg||

nt|werge: Now East can enjoy two @C-tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nubmaster: nice lead though, only 11 trick now|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

pc|cA|nt|jeanhari: Verhees thinking which spade to return?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: 3@C,3@D,6@H and 1 @S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @d lead at the other table so we keep the average, another imp to NS :)|pg||
nt|werge: This should end up with at least 9 tricks - |pg||
nt|haans: why take first spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can beat it,  with another low spade from N |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hantveit: hmm, now vest has no entry to the diamons if defence play hearts.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|pelu: u are almost right - but East can just play up @D 2x - so not a standard "fork"|pg||
nt|werge: It would be nice to turn back to the flat boards - the big swing in board 5 was tuff|pg||
nt|hantveit: must take the dia finesse now, |pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, hard to play when all those imps are running out...|pg||
nt|werge: We would like mto se South duck another @S...|pg||
nt|werge: to see|pg||
nt|hantveit: diamond to Q and K, and a new spades that is ducked?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: would be right to take 1st spade if jack was with north|pg||
nt|patricck: mustn't cash the J@H, switch back to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he should cash |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: 1H4 smith?|pg||

nt|sybarra: I can see 8 tricks where is 9th?|pg||
nt|haans: mamy always said pass with 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: difficult to bid against a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|werge: Should be a standard 650 - or so|pg||
nt|nubmaster: west doubled 2@h at the other table, easy 680 there|pg||
nt|nubmaster: and i'm not "that" old :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: when you were young, they had a different dbl table...|pg||
nt|hantveit: so not 800 :)|pg||
nt|ady: escap a heart lead and 3NT can make|pg||
mb|3S|nt|patricck: West has a very big hand considering how much everyone else is bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: The double of 2 @H ist very clever - for opponents|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the other dutch team high in the rankings lost exactly the same big swings on board 1 and 4|pg||

nt|jeanhari: only 8 after a heart lead so good bidding..|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|ady: on the heart switch may be worried to take 2nd diamond finesse   may settle for 8 tricks|pg||

nt|haans: 4|pg||

nt|jeanhari: so zimmermans discard (spade or heart) will make a two trick difference in a way|pg||

nt|jeanhari: k|pg||
nt|haans: spade K has been played|pg||
nt|jeanhari: think zimmermann discarded spade first|pg||
nt|haans: only 1 imp to fuss about|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they were in 3 nt in the other room making|pg||
nt|jeanhari: v prooijen must be ALMOST sure de Q is on his left|pg||
nt|ady: going to lose imps whatever   in game making OR|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|haans: even if he is wrong he may still get @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Zmu-Balicki lucky in 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: spade lead there also |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so this two trick problem is reduced to only one imp|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|aupillon: certainly not . ( i was unsked not to underlead King by that time)|pg||

nt|hantveit: both major kings are on for EW. 4H will make|pg||
nt|werge: I vote for West, 4 @H, 620|pg||
mb|d|nt|chessmaste: 7NT is also easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: perfect distribution for 12 tricks if played accoringly and helping lead from E|pg||
nt|werge: Yes N/S!|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes always easy with 14 high cards but I think they will stop in 6@d or @h|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think Walsh 4@h bid in OR was a "little" underbid...|pg||
nt|werge: One more of these doubles - and here red against green, so no play E/W|pg||
nt|justin c: at the other table they didnt look for slam NS|pg||
nt|nubmaster: What is RD by Justin?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: like this on|pg||
nt|josj: can you ask?|pg||
nt|patricck: looked to me as though declarer only lost 4 tricks 2@S, 1@H and 1@D, East discarded a club to let declarer take all the club tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Flat board|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|werge: Who is E/W - maybe indiscrte, but their family names are hidden|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@D overcall would have led to a different contract.|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, West has an abvious 4H bid with only 5 losers and south giving away the spade K.|pg||
nt|werge: In a match like this, a 7 IMP victory deserves an award|pg||
nt|aupillon: next ( that's Joey silver phrase)|pg||
nt|hantveit: Well, it has not been many interesting hands. Very difficult to get lost|pg||
nt|werge: South opened 2 @S in OR - good luck|pg||
nt|aupillon: Gimme a break : Soulet - Lebel didn't call THE GAME in ! h ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: hearts*|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would pass 3H also. |pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 points and 9 losers - why would I bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be a success for W |pg||
pc|d9|nt|chessmaste: Adrian Thomas - Wales - Gay Keavney - Ireland|pg||
nt|nubmaster: lucky for NS the @ds break 4-3|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|nubmaster: another "support opp's" double... what's the meaning by doubling here...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|werge: 2 @S = 0-10 with clubs - so Easts best card was devaluated |pg||
nt|aupillon: eventually i play in San remo, teams. And vulnerable i go for the bonus :(|pg||
nt|hantveit: West might play heart ace and another hearts, afraid of the spade ruff.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: last hand no @S-stop - this time no @D-stop - but @D 4-3 = 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: West is Thomas, East Keaveney, Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@H = the @HQ, but no outside kings, so S knows the @DK is missing|pg||
nt|justin c: Jason seems to be giving 7 a look regardless|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not 5@s to show K of @s?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|patricck: Versace will be feeling happy, defending a doubled contract with 6 trumps is always nice|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: he doesn't believe in luck|pg||
nt|april7: only @c lead might hinder|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs are saying this is a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|justin c: this depends on the lead, on a non-@C lead 6 could be right|pg||
nt|werge: After West double it´s not a 5 or 7, @C-lead is out of question|pg||
nt|hantveit: I have learned one thing from my father. Look at your cards, ask if you should bid again, if the cards says no, take a green bidding pad that says PAS and put it on the table.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N will be suprised that pard has J of clubs|pg||

mb|2C|an|.|nt|nubmaster: hahaha... but they needed that one though... could be 13 imp here|pg||

mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Are they playing lebesohl here?|pg||

mb|2D|an|.|mb|p|nt|april7: he even herd me|pg||
nt|brolucius: With spades agreed, instead of hearts as in the other room, N-S will surely identify that the queen of trumps is missing.|pg||
nt|werge: Bad luck to pay 13 IMP here - maybe|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|rnc: Bye and thanks|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play the @SK and the @SJ or @SQ falls from East, you can follow Restricted Choice by finessing the @S10, which increases your chances slightly from that of a 2-2 break. |pg||
