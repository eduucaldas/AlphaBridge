mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: A heavy 3@s opener|pg||
nt|serhat: I would open 4@S this hand|pg||
nt|serhat: and then imagine N. 5h or 6h or what?|pg||
nt|petergill: NS are not a regular partnership, so North does not know if 5@H focusses attention on spade control|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|petergill: North at the other table did well to bid only 5@H after 4@S - X|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|serhat: 5h should mean 2 looser @S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||

nt|serhat: thank you|pg||
nt|petergill: A lack of partnership experience cost NS the match on that hand|pg||
nt|serhat: byee|pg||
nt|petergill: Would your own regular partnership know what 5@h meant in that auction?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. I'm off to San Remo (via BBO) in 40 minutes. |pg||

nt|petergill: This is Australia's "number two" Seniors team|pg||
nt|charles_l: we start with 31-32. after 32, we will go back to 17 for comparisons with the closed room|pg||

nt|charles_l: hello|pg||

nt|petergill: Qx in RHO's suit (a three card holding, which is not good) is another bad factor for the 2@D overcall. |pg||
