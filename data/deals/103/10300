mb|1D|nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all |pg||
mb|2H|nt|nubmaster: Hi all and welcome, will be interesting to see the Hackett brothers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Typical modern light opening here and we will probably see a landing in 3NT.|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D    south?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David |pg||
mb|3C|an|.|nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: not so light - 6 losers - ok opening|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  a make for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think n/s play a club system, however I find 1 @D an unusual opening |pg||
mb|4S|an|.|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w  can save in 6@H for -800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told they have some canape elements in their system |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|justin c: y, they are both imaginative players, and very nice guys|pg||
nt|werge: Here|pg||
nt|ady: be interesting to know what 3@C showed|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Welcome to this match from group Q, leading Apteker (74 VPs) vs Welland third (53 VPs)|pg||
nt|werge: I´ve seen worse 4 @H-contracts|pg||

nt|nubmaster: 3nt by south at the other table|pg||
nt|werge: Should lead to 3 NT with 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nubmaster: yes it is :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|rnc: The Apteker team is a mixed of South Africa and Sweden|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|werge: But there might be a danger - only give away ONE red trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jean |pg||
pc|c4|nt|werge: The job is easier with North as declarer|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jean|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we know what the 3 @C was?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: vProoyen-Verhees play an Italian based strong club with canape opening bids|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk3: Hello Calle and Avram|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi Roland and Avram|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jcwla: I prefer the OR auction.  There, N rebid 3@C over 2@H and S bid the 3NT.|pg||
nt|werge: East knows, that South has 9 easy tricks|pg||

nt|hantveit: Now south will be pushed to make it. He must take the diamond finesse. I cannot see other ways to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: No other way |pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe south could go wrong if east ducked the heart lead?|pg||
nt|werge: No - he would just fines in @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C would be transfer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|april7: either W plays S having the ace of @H or might endplay N to lead away from K of @S, I thing he will choose the later|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: Verhees only in 5 so he could take the club finesse |pg||
mc|11|nt|hantveit: he definately should do that :)|pg||

nt|ady: cant see the problem of playing on spades first|pg||
nt|sybarra: E returned a club |pg||
mb|1D|nt|nubmaster: south will be looking for slam here, dont you think? nice cards though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|werge: This double - just what East was hoping for|pg||
nt|werge: East has 13 loosers|pg||
nt|justin c: if this is a penalty double it looks quite aggressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: No majors call by E.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|april7: on careful defence S should go down in 4@H losing 2@S and 2 @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 1NT, 2NT, 3@C?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C it is|pg||
nt|haans: nothing is really good|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make up to 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: north should surely pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: What has South showed - to me it can just as well go for a 15-17 as for 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: Zimmerman is ranked  1 and WH is tied for second at moment |pg||

pc|d4|nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||

pc|dT|nt|werge: I learned: In the middle = 14-16|pg||

nt|werge: East has an easy defence here|pg||

nt|ady: with K@C onside  had they been breaking 3NT would have made |pg||
pc|d2|nt|hantveit: Looks like 3nt can be made EV Hans? 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades and one heart. |pg||
pc|d7|nt|nubmaster: yes, in pairs you ca be more agressive but no reason to act here...|pg||
nt|werge: West ducks the @H-lead, and best for defence will now be a @S-shiftm killing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: If North continues @H, 9 tricks look safe|pg||
nt|hantveit: and south is not overtaking, he might overtake with K|pg||
nt|werge: Sout´s hesitation shows West, that she has K-x|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|werge: In you unblock the King, West is home|pg||
nt|ady: but that would have beden a lucky make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hantveit: yes, good point. And his partner...|pg||

nt|werge: you|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: the 2@D in Open = 2@HX by East!|pg||
nt|jcwla: I paid my entry fee, I am in there helping them out at these colors. :)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|nubmaster: just after a cue-bid showing M's|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nubmaster: perhaps 2@c wass conventional by EW...?|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding the double - you have an open bridge-book for playing|pg||

nt|nubmaster: plays|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, the @S Jack is saving a lot for E/W|pg||

nt|ralfwil: rather easy to see that there are 2 tricks in @d|pg||
nt|werge: But home now|pg||
nt|werge: claim|pg||
nt|hantveit: The contract can always be made, if south is not overtaking the hearts, dec can take the first trick and play diamonds. THAT wuold be a prize play :)|pg||

mb|1S|nt|werge: Should we repeat the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tiny.cc/eegFD  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: aI open a lot of 11 HCP-hands - but this time closer to pass - bad suit - no Aces and problems to show the good @Cs|pg||
mb|2C|an|.|nt|sybarra: may get the @D lead now |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and 3!nt is better than 5@d|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcwla: Marty Bergen believes, "Virtually any hand that is worth opening will contain at least two quick tricks."|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: I think they play that 2@C is either natural and GF or a 9-13 @S raise|pg||
nt|nubmaster: He has showed 9-13 3c support and 5c @c|pg||
nt|justin c: presumably 2@D asked and 2@S showed the good raise|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: did they forget to check aces in CR?|pg||
nt|hantveit: No need, I checked the spectators - no Danish :)|pg||
nt|haans: the use 1@C-1@S as a relay bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: looks llike diamond lead|pg||

nt|sybarra: or to W I should say |pg||
nt|jeanhari: sorry, 10|pg||

nt|werge: Why keep the @D-entry in North - South is short of entries|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|werge: Might bring him 8 tricks, if he plays @c immediately|pg||
nt|jcwla: West might also have handled this hand differently.  An action double instead of 3@S would be my preference having bid 2@S on the previous round.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR south bid 1NT showing @hs and a m and thet were in 3@h but east bought the contract there with 3@s.. another push here?|pg||

nt|nubmaster: difficult|pg||
nt|hantveit: 12+10 ns. How fast can they stop?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not 10?|pg||
nt|ady: how only 9?|pg||
nt|haans: wrong claim!|pg||
nt|ady: not possible to make 9 at that point which ever order of play|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|april7: here we have a nice @H slam|pg||
nt|haans: it is you say 'i make game'|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: 2@s by north at the other table... |pg||
nt|nubmaster: dont like 1nt with 5-2 in M, atleast not in teams|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcwla: will want to stay as low as possible here i'd think|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: are they playing strong @c? So 1@d is nat or 11-13 NT ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: careful play needed, ruffing @S twice in dummy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hantveit: South has 8 losers, I would bid 2H - pd passed first, now way there is a game on.|pg||
nt|werge: On a good day, South might get 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hantveit: no way|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: No action here.. 1NT at the other table with west as declarer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: odd bidding again|pg||
nt|hantveit: good start for dec.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no safely in game |pg||
nt|haans: some chance to make +2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hantveit: I think it generally is a bad idea to lead single when you have 4 trumps. Better to attack dia.|pg||
nt|werge: South has only ONE problem - she has no tricks...|pg||
nt|hantveit: lol, a well known problem to us all|pg||
nt|werge: Could have been worse!|pg||
nt|ady: could make 12 tricks  if getting hearts right   but a terrible slam|pg||
nt|haans: sorry @CK wrong|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: finess in @c and crossruff  with so solid @h|pg||
nt|rnc: I think 1@C is 17+ and 1@H a fairly balanced hand (no 5c M/6+m/55 m). East gave room for West to show his handtype|pg||
nt|april7: hi shirley, neither do I|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all,  just dropping by, |pg||
nt|rnc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: I did not understand the pass over 1 @S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe we used up all the action boards in the last match.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jeanhari: probably will get hearts right|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: hello Shirley|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: oh, I see|pg||
nt|april7: E bid 1@S not N|pg||
nt|sybarra: or if N bid 1 sp,  1 @H was gf, and pass was forcing is what on spec suggested |pg||
nt|april7: if W plays on @C with the finesse then its easier to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now they will bid 6@h|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|desert: ;)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: duplication in diamonds   on a bad day could go down in 4|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hantveit: should unblock club 6 there, in case it is an endplay later.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c3|nt|werge: @C-ruff and a trump - still I only see 7 tricks, but you might do better|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|april7: its better to take @C finesse first, because even if it works, has to make @C finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|april7: if @S finesse works W has to take @C finesse anyway|pg||
nt|rnc: Remains to play it cautiously|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead for the defence is @h9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|hantveit: when you know the spade honors are behind the king - play low from the king.|pg||
nt|hantveit: I cannot see how now. Maybe ruff a dia and play low spade from K, but too late now. Vest will play spade J and Game over|pg||
nt|werge: When I was a child, we just ruffed and plaued the @H 10 - but that´s long time ago|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - born during second world war...|pg||
nt|hantveit: So, you are still semi-young|pg||
nt|werge: West, please - it´s my lunch-time we are playing with now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|april7: then @C finesse @C@Cruff ace of @D @C ruff and pull trumps and so on|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|werge: Fast and easy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: don´t play on @c too early. S will discard a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after this lead W must have a good count on N|pg||
nt|april7: if 9 of @H fourth with S then its more difficult, but  S will play for 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: Ace or King first|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|werge: Does this 10 really show the Jack?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hantveit: spade T??|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rnc: This board will bring Apteker back in the match|pg||
nt|april7: ruff @C, Q of @H, K of @H and again @C ruff high and to ace of @D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hantveit: Now at least - spade J|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: No @s discard!|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes|pg||
nt|werge: Looks now like 5 IMP´s for Nederland|pg||

nt|jcwla: Same in OR.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: y, average 1 imp/board, kinda action :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Both pairs well done in the bidding to stay at the one level.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|werge: 1 @H Doubled...|pg||
nt|justin c: all pass?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt - 1@D - 2@C - 2Nt - 3 NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hantveit: 12+13 EV, but no fit in majors. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@C ok, 3NT in danger?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nubmaster: not clear yet, Nick at east still's thinking|pg||
nt|nubmaster: or 3NT directly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no 11 trick in clubs, sorry|pg||
nt|haans: overcall make them find 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 10 tricks in clubs   I wonder if they will try 3NT    which is likely to fail|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S X with his spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: most X saying no spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes hence my question |pg||
nt|sybarra: and can N a spade agst 3 nt? (next question) |pg||
nt|ady: playing reverse system   double says no help?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nubmaster: he passed, same contract at both tables|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 12 points and a good 5 card suit?|pg||
nt|haans: what better lead does he have?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A Roland slam here.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not in teams, they have to investigate the @s's|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 12-14 - and open for bidding by pd if he is very strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|sybarra: true,  not much |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: even without a spade lead   could still go down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hantveit: are they playing pass system?|pg||
nt|hantveit: That makes more sence|pg||
nt|jeanhari: if declarer reads spade well he can make this|pg||
nt|haans: how does South  enter to lead @S|pg||
nt|ady: White house missed the close 4 spade game on board 13|pg||
pc|sK|nt|desert: This board doesnt look very exciting, too....|pg||
nt|werge: What is the E/W system . Jump to 3 NT...?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting contract, there are ways to reach 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess is that they play some kind of pass system Hans.|pg||
nt|werge: EaST HAS APPARENTLY OPNENED 1 @c !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ady: yes   duck first won and take 2nd|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|justin c: this looks like it is going to be very close|pg||
nt|werge: Bad defence, better @D Ace and a @C through|pg||
nt|werge: Now East can enjoy two @C-tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nubmaster: nice lead though, only 11 trick now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: one|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jeanhari: Verhees thinking which spade to return?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: 3@C,3@D,6@H and 1 @S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @d lead at the other table so we keep the average, another imp to NS :)|pg||
nt|werge: This should end up with at least 9 tricks - |pg||
nt|haans: why take first spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can beat it,  with another low spade from N |pg||
pc|cA|nt|hantveit: hmm, now vest has no entry to the diamons if defence play hearts.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: u are almost right - but East can just play up @D 2x - so not a standard "fork"|pg||
nt|werge: It would be nice to turn back to the flat boards - the big swing in board 5 was tuff|pg||
nt|hantveit: must take the dia finesse now, |pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, hard to play when all those imps are running out...|pg||
nt|werge: We would like mto se South duck another @S...|pg||
nt|werge: to see|pg||
nt|hantveit: diamond to Q and K, and a new spades that is ducked?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: would be right to take 1st spade if jack was with north|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: 1H4 smith?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: down now |pg||
nt|ady: its just a guess|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: New trouble will arrive for N/S|pg||
nt|haans: @H4 neg @D4 neg = spade|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk3: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after this round. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|werge: It´s called end-play|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|werge: North should have taken the first trick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wd by defense|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: a small ! is not so bad from N|pg||
nt|Walddk3: After this round there will a long break before the Swiss begins. Restart at 17.30 Paris, 4:30 pm London, 8:30 am Los Angeles, 11:30 am New York|pg||
nt|hantveit: I forgot the bidding in hand 2. East did open pass with a pass hand, so pass system was out the window. :-)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnc: And these two teams will qualify for Swiss A, if only nothing big happens.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|werge: But the @s-duck is not subject to a TEAM-match|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: sorry - kibs asked about 6@c - almost a "mortons Fork" play|pg||
