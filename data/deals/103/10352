nt|xenya: not yet Willem|pg||
nt|raghavan: Since it is pair event - boards and players have to move - so there will be short breaks after every 2 Boards|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|an|.|nt|xenya: well it normally doesn't pay to bid slam missing an ace and trump king|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Probably strong by E . |pg||
nt|xenya: so they will probably stop in time|pg||
mb|3H|nt|raghavan: This 2S means what, Vladir?|pg||
nt|mrbig01:  Specialized positive response. It used to be HHxxxx of spaeds and out|pg||
nt|mrbig01:  spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: blackwood would be a simply solution here|pg||
mb|3S|an|.|mb|p|nt|mrbig01:  3S, minimum no support?|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|raghavan: ah ah ah|pg||
nt|mrbig01:  This will be bad for EW|pg||
pc|s6|nt|raghavan: The special bid of 2Spades has taken lot of space|pg||
nt|mrbig01:  even if they don't find the lead, they' get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|xenya: E tried for a maximum score in a NT contract -- what he will get is a near bottom probably|pg||
nt|raghavan: I think he will play towards Hj|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrbig01:  I guess 3sp is the problem here. For a hand with minors (which I thik 2s was) Jx is excelent support|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

pc|d3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|xenya: well of course there is always a human factor...|pg||
mc|12|nt|raghavan: I think it is claim time|pg||
nt|xenya: yes they will|pg||
nt|mrbig01:  Other table 3N + 2 is a very strange result. Either you switch clubs (result 1 off) or you dont (result + 3)|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps S would have done better if he'd ducked 1st @H to get some signal from partner on the next round|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mrbig01:  Difficult for W|pg||
nt|xenya: but he doesn't|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mrbig01:  Pass is mousy, bidding is taking a gamble.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: although it is considered a crime to sell out at the 1 level, the reopening by W is doubtful|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mrbig01:  but N must not let a club slip through|pg||
nt|xenya: his partner is probably short @Ss -- if so, he has a weakish hand as he didn't double for takeout|pg||
nt|raghavan: How is S going to show is DK? Entering S with DK and S playing S - then only 1 down.3spades+1H+2D+1C=7|pg||
