nt|andyv:  Hi and welcome everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all |pg||
mb|1H|nt|nubmaster: Hi all and welcome, will be interesting to see the Hackett brothers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Typical modern light opening here and we will probably see a landing in 3NT.|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D    south?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David |pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no room for -en in Christiansen, so we will see Christians|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: not so light - 6 losers - ok opening|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  a make for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think n/s play a club system, however I find 1 @D an unusual opening |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C = diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play transfer advances|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: e/w  can save in 6@H for -800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told they have some canape elements in their system |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Please repeat the bidding...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ciao again Eugenio :)|pg||
nt|werge: hi from here also|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy, Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to asses value of e/w hands|pg||
mb|3C|nt|justin c: y, they are both imaginative players, and very nice guys|pg||
nt|werge: Here|pg||
nt|ady: be interesting to know what 3@C showed|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hans |pg||
nt|roswolf: hi shirley|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Shirley of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Welcome to this match from group Q, leading Apteker (74 VPs) vs Welland third (53 VPs)|pg||
nt|werge: I´ve seen worse 4 @H-contracts|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome to this match between two teams in the qualifying positions at the moment, but close enough to the cut off line that a loss here could be a serious blow|pg||
nt|werge: The lead is safing trick number 7 for East - can´t misguess the @S-suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland, Shirley, Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|patricck: EW can make 3NT, but bidding it isn't certain|pg||

nt|pelu: hi Jordan and Urban - US - Sweden- Denmark - good cocktail :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3nt by south at the other table|pg||
nt|werge: Should lead to 3 NT with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: yes it is :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4-2 fit played very well in the other room|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rnc: The Apteker team is a mixed of South Africa and Sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: But there might be a danger - only give away ONE red trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jean |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: The job is easier with North as declarer|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jean|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we know what the 3 @C was?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: vProoyen-Verhees play an Italian based strong club with canape opening bids|pg||
nt|patricck: the play shouldn't take long, 2 imps to harangozo|pg||
nt|andyv:  Roland, did W have 1@S available or was that also a transfer?|pg||
nt|patricck: 1 imp sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice quick auction:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk3: Hello Calle and Avram|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi Roland and Avram|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|jcwla: I prefer the OR auction.  There, N rebid 3@C over 2@H and S bid the 3NT.|pg||
nt|werge: East knows, that South has 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=3  for standing and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|hantveit: Now south will be pushed to make it. He must take the diamond finesse. I cannot see other ways to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: No other way |pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe south could go wrong if east ducked the heart lead?|pg||
nt|werge: No - he would just fines in @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C would be transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: name for west is STEGAROIU.... BBO nick is pisoy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|april7: either W plays S having the ace of @H or might endplay N to lead away from K of @S, I thing he will choose the later|pg||
nt|athene: north couldn't really double, even though he knows the hearts are no good|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wc all co commentators|pg||
nt|athene: E-W might have a million tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, though declarer is surely doomed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: E I mean |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: Verhees only in 5 so he could take the club finesse |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hantveit: he definately should do that :)|pg||
nt|ady: showing long diamonds   - but undefined strength?|pg||
nt|sybarra: which was off |pg||
nt|sybarra: East |pg||
nt|andyv:  E pretty aggressive with 11 count and void in pd's suit|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has a good hand if there's any fit at all in diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: A club shift is needed that too C 10 preferably|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... and got stuck over 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: east would rather south were on lead|pg||
nt|athene: because south might find it harder to attack clubs, leading up to the concealed hand|pg||
nt|athene: but he wants to duck the first diamond to keep his entries fluid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nubmaster: yes but difficult to bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should tell the whole story for the defence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, 1@S would be natural|pg||
nt|athene: @H5 = "clubs are nice" :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|werge: - and to win|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a 1-round force|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: But since Jens is that strong, he can afford to show his longer suit first|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Martin Wüst from Germany|pg||
nt|werge: In closed, East - a bridge teacher of good reputation! - bid 1 @D over ! C. (BON appetit!)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT would show clubs|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer shows out in a suit, the defence can use it for suit-preference right away|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: declarer playing to make, but now the roof falls in|pg||
nt|athene: he's lucky north doesn't have @h8 or @h7 :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: North is Rajesh Tiwari and South is Honey Prabakar both from India|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  process of elimination...6@s lead probably not 4th best:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Even H from South is good|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|desert: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: @H6 saves declarer another 50|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 tricks for defence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg: North-South convention card available at http://tinyurl.com/mrkrj7 (PDF)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|werge: Closed for France is Ph. Soulet. M. Lebel|pg||
nt|hantveit: The right club play ther was to play club to q, and a new club. picking up Jxxxx by west|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Hi Martin.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|nubmaster: hi Martin|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: assuming he has been following the spot cards of course|pg||
nt|athene: and covers this|pg||
nt|raghavan: It comes to 4 down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Ralf Willquist|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnc: Looks like a good start for Apteker, 11 IMPS|pg||
nt|athene: whoops|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: he missed the fall of the @H87|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sT|nt|hantveit: if west had Jxxx, south could play diamond to A and finesse the club J|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: hello all|pg||

nt|rnc: hi Ralf|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|werge: How often do we see and end-play - making 90 out of 70|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and Avram|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt again - but some work|pg||
nt|ady: cant see the problem of playing on spades first|pg||
nt|sybarra: E returned a club |pg||
nt|werge: Oh - even 110|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is something wrong with the spelling of North's name. I'll find out how|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: south will be looking for slam here, dont you think? nice cards though|pg||
nt|sybarra: Lets try that website instead of PABF   (sorry)|pg||
nt|raghavan: wc back all|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|werge: This double - just what East was hoping for|pg||
nt|werge: East has 13 loosers|pg||
nt|justin c: if this is a penalty double it looks quite aggressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: No majors call by E.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S is a 40% chance that doesn't make today, however the imp chart for teams encourages you to bid vulnerable games, even at those odds|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|april7: on careful defence S should go down in 4@H losing 2@S and 2 @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 1NT, 2NT, 3@C?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C it is|pg||
nt|haans: nothing is really good|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make up to 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: north should surely pass this|pg||
mb|1N|nt|werge: What has South showed - to me it can just as well go for a 15-17 as for 12-14|pg||
nt|andyv:  choice of games|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of points for n/s but need to stay quietly in game|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of points and hard to find a contract...probably will end up at 3N |pg||
nt|Walddk4: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|athene: of course the defence can take the first five|pg||
nt|athene: if they don't, it gets interesting|pg||
nt|athene: normal play with this sort of hand is cash one AK and try to drop the Q|pg||
nt|athene: then fall back on the finesse in the other suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: 14-16|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hegedus|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There it is|pg||
nt|andyv:  upside down n:)|pg||
nt|patricck: need to stay in 4@H, both 3NT and 5@D would be unlucky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they stop in game I wonder|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I like the pas from East - 5-5 in major, but too weak - 2@D (Michael) only help opp to find the right play|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: I learned: In the middle = 14-16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Hungarians did in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: East has an easy defence here|pg||
nt|pelu: to bid 2@D = hi opp - can I help u .)|pg||
nt|ady: with K@C onside  had they been breaking 3NT would have made |pg||
pc|c7|nt|hantveit: Looks like 3nt can be made EV Hans? 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades and one heart. |pg||
nt|patricck: nicely done|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes judged to a T|pg||
nt|andyv:  quality of E @h suit made bidding on precarious|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nubmaster: yes, in pairs you ca be more agressive but no reason to act here...|pg||
nt|werge: West ducks the @H-lead, and best for defence will now be a @S-shiftm killing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe not |pg||

nt|andyv:  E didn't even bother to cue @ss|pg||
nt|patricck: should be routine not to finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Søren Christiansen always takes his time. He is a very competent declarer. Was in the Danish team that won the bronze medal at the Olympoics in Rhodes in 1996|pg||
nt|patricck: but position of A@C would mean declarer is safe in any case|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: If North continues @H, 9 tricks look safe|pg||
nt|hantveit: and south is not overtaking, he might overtake with K|pg||
nt|werge: Sout´s hesitation shows West, that she has K-x|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|werge: In you unblock the King, West is home|pg||
nt|ady: but that would have beden a lucky make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hantveit: yes, good point. And his partner...|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes hard to govdown here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk3: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|werge: Over now 400 E/W|pg||
nt|werge: What´s problem - with @H 4-3 yoy just loose 4 red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: you|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: the 2@D in Open = 2@HX by East!|pg||
nt|jcwla: I paid my entry fee, I am in there helping them out at these colors. :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR east plays 2@hx|pg||
nt|andyv:  re hi|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|werge: Sorry - 5...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nubmaster: just after a cue-bid showing M's|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nubmaster: perhaps 2@c wass conventional by EW...?|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding the double - you have an open bridge-book for playing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: At the other table W plats 1NT doubled|pg||
nt|nubmaster: plays|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, the @S Jack is saving a lot for E/W|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather easy to see that there are 2 tricks in @d|pg||
nt|werge: But home now|pg||
nt|werge: claim|pg||
nt|hantveit: The contract can always be made, if south is not overtaking the hearts, dec can take the first trick and play diamonds. THAT wuold be a prize play :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: First trick very interesting in this 3 NT...|pg||
nt|patricck: these two teams are tied for 14th=, but just 3 victory points ahead of the cut line|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jens Auken was also in the team, but they were not partners|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D opener didn't stop east leading his 5-card suit in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps they play a strong club, so 1@D was nebulous?|pg||
nt|athene: that was weird|pg||
nt|athene: he really went up with the @CA??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) on Monday. Five more rounds of Swiss tomorrow|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not so good communication here, 9 of @d solves the problem|pg||
nt|athene: playing low guarantees you nine tricks doesn't it?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|werge: Yes - a lot of possibilities|pg||
nt|werge: Faster this way - 140|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They lost in the semi-final against Indonesia after 8 extra boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d3|nt|raghavan: Yes but could have easily got a club trick|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you do want to make that sort of play|pg||
nt|athene: rise Axx with KJx in hand|pg||
nt|athene: if you want to persuade the defence to continue their first line of attack|pg||
nt|andyv:  too advanced for me... prefer to take the tricks defence gives me|pg||
nt|athene: but not here, when playing low gives you 9 on top|pg||
nt|athene: and the heart finesse risks them winning and taking the diamonds|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|werge: Looks like a little more than 379|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|nt|athene: hmmm we seem to have a lot of lag here |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|raghavan: Texan has got 5 IMP in Bd 11|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: not the best defense against 2@hX - only down 3 (500) and not -5 (1100)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: duck for 600, otherwise 630|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes, EW were lucky there|pg||

nt|werge: OK 7 IMPS then|pg||
nt|nubmaster: well played|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 well deserved IMPs there :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 deserved? - for the 2@D bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in 6 vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 10, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: most don't. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|werge: Flat boards now and then means = good bridge|pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting hands NS|pg||
nt|werge: I open 1 @H - the "less bad"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You will see them practise a lot on BBO, not least in the JEC mathes. Usernames are sac and jauken|pg||
nt|Walddk4: matches  even|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|nubmaster: and easy 4@s here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ironic i think :) they were lucky... 5 or 10 out seemed more reasonable|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for 1@H here?|pg||
nt|werge: But in France no 1 @H-opening, I thins|pg||
nt|sybarra: very strong field in the tourney |pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: South has a 5 loser hand. North a 6 loser|pg||
nt|athene: NS in other room might play a strong @C, i thought, so 1@D only 2+ or something|pg||
nt|athene: then diamond lead much more attractive, of course|pg||
mb|2C|an|forcing|nt|ralfwil: That´s why he should have won the @c trick earlier and not be squeezed on the @d|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks for e/w  in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The most notable fact is that Team Lavazza did not qualify for Swiss A and that they won't qualify for the knockout phase either. They are currently 28th in Swiss B|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok for me, but I have a passed partner, |pg||
nt|ady: sorry 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I am sure they are having a wonderful time as well as great bridge |pg||
mb|2D|nt|desert: not really.....Being vul and facing a passed pd i prefer pass|pg||
nt|hantveit: I agree Hans, I prefer IH also. The hand is too strong to open 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 6), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead impossible to find|pg||
nt|athene: 12 tricks is a lot|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 3NT went down1 so Texan gets another 12 IMP|pg||
nt|athene: did declarer set up the clubs, or manage to get 3 ruffs in dummy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: very straightforward and correct bidding, but not a pleasant spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They stopped in 1NT next door after a strong 1@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nubmaster: 3NT by north after showing @s support in the OR...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: showing 3c support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and even that contract did not make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Same lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  may be forced to play hearts correctly for this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But declarer will likely use his entry to dummy to finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT can be made double dummy, but only double dummy, declarer is very unlikely to play for Qxx of hearts offside and AQ of spades with a doubleton diamond |pg||
nt|athene: the former, on a trump lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: will be heading for slam in S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  @d spots make leaving entry tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Seems, that West (and East) have overbid their hands|pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: N can't imagine such a weak hand with his partner|pg||
nt|pelu: dont push to hard - u risk to push op in ¤@s - making :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: weak nt opening by E and 3@S the contract in OR|pg||
nt|patricck: very aggressive by East in particular, game is not good, though we have all seen worse....  not even close to making on this layout of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: South is not so interested in 3NT with this weak hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Balicki Zmudzinski in 6@D on board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A discouraging spade perhaps, the 8 or the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a "correct way to play @H's? if so its now |pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder what 2@h was about since no alert.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not that great a contract   need spade break plus only to lose 1 diamond trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no but the easthand wont pas any invitation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I know Søren too well|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it would seem that you need to play for Qxx in order to have a chance|pg||
nt|athene: well, if 2@C was not GF, 2@H might just be 4th suit forcing to set up GF|pg||
nt|athene: even if no alert|pg||
nt|athene: or it might be garozzo-type auction where 2@C = clubs or balanced; 2@D = 11-15 without 4 hearts; 2@H = asking|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be... I'd still expect an alert:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This will be a push since OR also no slam 4S+2|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead looks very likely in here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|werge: I find Wests transfer-bid worse of all - he has nothing but his good health|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has been  employed at my bridge centre for 16 years|pg||
nt|athene: the only slight danger with trump lead is something like @SKJx in dummy and @SAxxxx in declarer's hand|pg||
nt|athene: partner doesn't usually thank you for finding his trump queen at trick 1|pg||
nt|raghavan: william and Andy - could 2H be 4th suit forcing twlling there is game?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|werge: West will start in his BEST minor|pg||
nt|werge: Oh no...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: not sure why the @C shift..tap might have been better (not that it matters) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I'm not familiar enough with the partnership style to assign blame  :)  but certainly someone overbid |pg||
nt|werge: Worse is, that minus 2 will take several minutes to reach|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hantveit: We are all waiting for the next hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: telling|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  finesse only works if qxxx is with E....if Qxx, doesn't matter who has that holding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As a spectator rightly points out, the Danish declarer in the other room had a certain route to 7 tricks, but had a blind spot|pg||
nt|patricck: finessing the J works against Qxx and Qxxx with East, while AK and small only works against Qxx in either hand, I think that gives the finesse an 8% edge|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: A clever spec: Only @S-lead beats & NT by North|pg||
nt|werge: Double-dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 4), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @S passed out in OR|pg||
nt|patricck: might take 9 tricks with a safety play in trumps, but if you are in 4@H you can't take that line|pg||
nt|patricck: and still too difficult to dispose of diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx William|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: Lead @SK from hand and you can't be prevented from taking 7 tricks|pg||

nt|andyv:  academic now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|patricck: i was thinking the first two boards looked like a couple of pushes to get the match off to a quiet start......i obviously know nothing, the score is already 7-6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||

nt|ady: good result for Zimmerman|pg||
nt|werge: Some fun coming up, I see|pg||
nt|sybarra: even looking at all 4 hands  not sure who should play where|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 IMP to Texan since OR made +2|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP to Rosenovo on 3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 13 even.|pg||
nt|werge: More or less sure NOT to play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you get an error by clicking on that link, it's because there are too many hits at the moment. Try again later|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Five top losers in 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: the battle of the black suits here|pg||
nt|andyv:  10@s lead in OR created extra entry to dummy to set up clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: :) will probably not be a lot of action here. |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks routine for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead best|pg||
mb|1C|nt|april7: 4@S and also 5@D is possible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: witn that lucky @d split - 3nt on NS|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4@h by NS here... but they wont find it?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like this 1@S opening?|pg||
nt|ady: will have time for an overtrick of a diamond lead    but could be held to 3 on a sspade lead|pg||
nt|haans: but kind of boring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: keeps it to 9 tricks, otherwise 10|pg||
nt|werge: But E/W in @D seems fair enogh|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 segments of 16 in the final|pg||
mb|3S|nt|raghavan: 23 points to EW vs 17 to NS Ns has both Majors ket us witness bidding|pg||
nt|athene: E-W shouldn't allow N-S to play 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: but big club fits have a habit of falling by the wayside these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: 1 level is ok here.. |pg||
nt|patricck: how to stay out of game with 25 points, or how to steal a 9th trick in hearts if you do bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: fantastic result for EW in the closed room!|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting 4N in OR|pg||
mb|4S|nt|werge: Should we repeat the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tiny.cc/eegFD  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt think Versace would go quietly |pg||
nt|patricck: radulescu licking his lips|pg||
nt|sybarra: (of course S just loved that call) |pg||
nt|sybarra: E likely to bid again|pg||
nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a question |pg||
nt|patricck: oops, only 3 spades, need 2 hearts :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: If 4S, killing lead from E to be a Diamond and W shifting to H and getting a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing majors allowed east to get that critical 3@C bid in|pg||
nt|athene: which made all the difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: aI open a lot of 11 HCP-hands - but this time closer to pass - bad suit - no Aces and problems to show the good @Cs|pg||
nt|werge: Sure East will bid NOW|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, much to West's disappointment|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may get the @D lead now |pg||
nt|werge: Must be FORCING|pg||
nt|athene: west will surely lead a big club|pg||
nt|athene: east can't be happy about passing this out|pg||
nt|athene: but if he is going to double now, why not earlier? - and 5@C is just a wild stab in the dark, if 1@C might be only two cards in a balanced hand, for instance|pg||
nt|raghavan: where is entry to S ?|pg||
nt|athene: you are right - even on @CA lead, the defence have time to get west's heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: as declarer can't get to hand fast to draw trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and 3!nt is better than 5@d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: Marty Bergen believes, "Virtually any hand that is worth opening will contain at least two quick tricks."|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West passed in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who can lead for aqx of club? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The fact that Jens opened 1@C may persuade North never to lead them|pg||
nt|patricck: nice intermediates in the West hands, but too many honours in short suits....I like the pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has two chances though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|justin c: I think they play that 2@C is either natural and GF or a 9-13 @S raise|pg||
nt|nubmaster: He has showed 9-13 3c support and 5c @c|pg||
nt|justin c: presumably 2@D asked and 2@S showed the good raise|pg||
nt|raghavan: I doubt > William N has no entry to S so may not make 4 S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: did they forget to check aces in CR?|pg||
nt|hantveit: No need, I checked the spectators - no Danish :)|pg||
nt|haans: the use 1@C-1@S as a relay bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: S has to start wildly signaling clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jens will surely return a heart at trick 2, then hope|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He won't get the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: S never in |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but they will have the chance to switch when in with the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another option, and a losing one, is to enter dummy with a diamond and finesse @S10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is a legitimate chance|pg||
nt|patricck: that is what happened in the other room|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: I see the first 8 tricks for West -let´s see|pg||
nt|patricck: the cards are friendly for EW|pg||
nt|werge: Lucky, that South has the 8...|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i was playing it upside down :) but all the same considerations apply|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|ady: looks llike diamond lead|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: q of @D lead looks a lot more interesting from W  |pg||
nt|andyv:  can always hope @c blocks|pg||
nt|roswolf: the psychological attempt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jens opting for the deceptive line|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jeanhari: so looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or to W I should say |pg||
nt|jeanhari: sorry, 10|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|nubmaster: good lead|pg||
nt|werge: Why keep the @D-entry in North - South is short of entries|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|raghavan: H shift|pg||
pc|hA|nt|werge: Might bring him 8 tricks, if he plays @c immediately|pg||
nt|jcwla: West might also have handled this hand differently.  An action double instead of 3@S would be my preference having bid 2@S on the previous round.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR south bid 1NT showing @hs and a m and thet were in 3@h but east bought the contract there with 3@s.. another push here?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now N shall play @dK or continue with @s|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, that was a bit sleepy|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has to cash HQ and give a ruff lat us see|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C would be an interesting contract|pg||
nt|athene: for example @DJ lead you could duck|pg||
nt|athene: then draw trumps, @DA, three hearts throwing spade, ruff heart, endplay north with the @SA|pg||
nt|andyv:  re|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: now or never, ace of @H|pg||
nt|werge: VERY sleepy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: after all it's difficult to switch to a club into declarer's suit|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|werge: Will normally cost the first IMP in this match|pg||
nt|ady: can relax while this is played|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now run for home|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking looks more like a mp play than an imp one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|athene: but he could cover the first heart and block them|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|nubmaster: Q of @c now|pg||
nt|ady: might still make only 9 as cant aford to play a spade  till taking 9 tricks   depends on the discards from east|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|d2|nt|patricck: it felt as though the K@H might have been a good card at trick 2, but that needs the 9@H to come down, which doesn't happen either|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, but I a was trying to be nice for a change|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of frozen out of both hands  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|jeanhari: will he play for spade ace in west (no overcall) or take his tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|raghavan: West has played in 4NT in OR. that means Texan gains again though going down here|pg||
mc|9|nt|hantveit: heart ace and a new heart and still a flat board|pg||

nt|ady: not possible to make 9 at that point which ever order of play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Texan gets another 9 IMP|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S overcall from west, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: you don't have much else but those spades are really nice|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  ratio was 13-1... playing A@h and A@c might have cost 1 imp but would not have lost 13|pg||

nt|haans: it is you say 'i make game'|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not ideal with @SAxx|pg||
nt|athene: partner might have @SJxx or @SQx and you want him to play 3nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least you can hold up 3 times:)|pg||
mb|2H|an|fit|nt|Walddk4: 2@H is weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps his only chance |pg||
nt|athene: double not ideal either with only 75% of the hearts you would lik|pg||
nt|athene: like|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nubmaster: 2@s by north at the other table... |pg||
nt|nubmaster: dont like 1nt with 5-2 in M, atleast not in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point andy|pg||
nt|patricck: always easier to find a logical reason when you can already see the answer, but since the KQ@S and KQ@D are both in dummy the logic seems sound|pg||
nt|athene: interesting...east treats that hand as a "good" 2@S bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand not ideal but 3N probably will end up there.|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ducking 2 times, N will make 3 NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: will want to stay as low as possible here i'd think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Normally a little less than a standard weak two opening|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nubmaster: are they playing strong @c? So 1@d is nat or 11-13 NT ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: They will be in 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The advantage of playing weak jump shifts is that a 2@H rebid becomes invitational and a jump to 3@H game-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: the "good raise" bid is actually useful for NS|pg||
nt|athene: it suggests that east, not west, has the entry|pg||
mb|4C|nt|april7: careful play needed, ruffing @S twice in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  2@H     1@H  3@H|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is more appealing|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: South has 8 losers, I would bid 2H - pd passed first, now way there is a game on.|pg||
nt|werge: On a good day, South might get 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hantveit: no way|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is ok|pg||
nt|athene: now north is worried about trying 4@H because it sounds as though 3@S was just making a slam try in hearts :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|nubmaster: No action here.. 1NT at the other table with west as declarer.|pg||
nt|werge: One upon a time, this war for penalty|pg||
nt|werge: OH - back again|pg||
nt|werge: Oce upon...|pg||
nt|werge: Once|pg||
nt|patricck: Versace buys a better dummy than he might have feared, the Q@H is a welcome sight as the @HKJ7 looked a bit sick under Easts majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: odd bidding again|pg||
nt|hantveit: good start for dec.|pg||
nt|werge: I would like to play this contract - if I might now and then play from the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another advantage is that it takes room away from the opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: this just has the obvious 5 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree R,  weak jumps (everywhere) makes like easier |pg||
nt|patricck: 4 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: well it is also a good makeable contract|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: no safely in game |pg||
nt|haans: some chance to make +2|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: I think it generally is a bad idea to lead single when you have 4 trumps. Better to attack dia.|pg||
nt|werge: South has only ONE problem - she has no tricks...|pg||
nt|hantveit: lol, a well known problem to us all|pg||
nt|werge: Could have been worse!|pg||
nt|ady: could make 12 tricks  if getting hearts right   but a terrible slam|pg||
nt|haans: sorry @CK wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok he wont lose 3 spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  into the abyss|pg||
nt|athene: this all stems from the double of 1@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|athene: does it PROMISE four hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-advised to bid 2@D over 1@S, i think|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner thinks that a negative double promises 4 hearts here exactly 100% of the time|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ralfwil: finess in @c and crossruff  with so solid @h|pg||
nt|rnc: I think 1@C is 17+ and 1@H a fairly balanced hand (no 5c M/6+m/55 m). East gave room for West to show his handtype|pg||
nt|april7: hi shirley, neither do I|pg||
nt|patricck: that will be the difficulty :)|pg||
nt|werge: The only entry is best used for @c to the 10, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi all,  just dropping by, |pg||
nt|rnc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: I did not understand the pass over 1 @S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe we used up all the action boards in the last match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: probably will get hearts right|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N bid 2@s over 1@s overcall... that seems a bit more descriptive|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: Goes 1 down with a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S over 1@S is possible too|pg||
nt|raghavan: N played in 5Clubs and made in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  always play for the revoke|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: hello Shirley|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: oh, I see|pg||
nt|april7: E bid 1@S not N|pg||
nt|sybarra: or if N bid 1 sp,  1 @H was gf, and pass was forcing is what on spec suggested |pg||
nt|april7: if W plays on @C with the finesse then its easier to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now they will bid 6@h|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|desert: ;)|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone in favor of overcalling 1@s with S hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: duplication in diamonds   on a bad day could go down in 4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hantveit: should unblock club 6 there, in case it is an endplay later.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|werge: @C-ruff and a trump - still I only see 7 tricks, but you might do better|pg||
nt|patricck: double dummy that is certainly true|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|april7: its better to take @C finesse first, because even if it works, has to make @C finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|april7: if @S finesse works W has to take @C finesse anyway|pg||
nt|rnc: Remains to play it cautiously|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead for the defence is @h9|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hantveit: when you know the spade honors are behind the king - play low from the king.|pg||
nt|hantveit: I cannot see how now. Maybe ruff a dia and play low spade from K, but too late now. Vest will play spade J and Game over|pg||
nt|werge: When I was a child, we just ruffed and plaued the @H 10 - but that´s long time ago|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - born during second world war...|pg||
nt|hantveit: So, you are still semi-young|pg||
nt|werge: West, please - it´s my lunch-time we are playing with now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|april7: then @C finesse @C@Cruff ace of @D @C ruff and pull trumps and so on|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|werge: Fast and easy|pg||
mc|11|nt|ralfwil: don´t play on @c too early. S will discard a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after this lead W must have a good count on N|pg||
nt|april7: if 9 of @H fourth with S then its more difficult, but  S will play for 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: Ace or King first|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would say - South has told his story club suit + Hsuit opening hand . He has no extra strength. N should be the captain and his %C to be passed|pg||
nt|athene: well, yes, unless 5@C was a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: his 5C to be passed|pg||

nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have a monster heart raise with everything except a diamond control"|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c is hard to read but holding xx in diamonds, i'd have to agree with pass|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|patricck: very lively scoring, every board trades at least 5 imps|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @D here - if you can guess the @C-suit, which the bidding might make easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  just seemed like N/S were reading different books|pg||
nt|raghavan: 5 Diamond contract as I see all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hantveit: 12+13 EV, but no fit in majors. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@C ok, 3NT in danger?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: not clear yet, Nick at east still's thinking|pg||
nt|nubmaster: or 3NT directly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no 11 trick in clubs, sorry|pg||
nt|haans: overcall make them find 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 10 tricks in clubs   I wonder if they will try 3NT    which is likely to fail|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S X with his spades?|pg||
nt|patricck: North more likely to bid 3NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: most X saying no spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes hence my question |pg||
nt|sybarra: and can N a spade agst 3 nt? (next question) |pg||
nt|ady: playing reverse system   double says no help?|pg||
nt|athene: even seeing all hands you lose @DA and two spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: he passed, same contract at both tables|pg||
nt|hantveit: Pass on 12 points and a good 5 card suit?|pg||
nt|haans: what better lead does he have?|pg||
nt|patricck: you would persuade me to overcall 1@S at a different vulnerability, but that looks a bit too rich for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical punt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: A Roland slam here.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not in teams, they have to investigate the @s's|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 12-14 - and open for bidding by pd if he is very strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: a @H lead sees declarer home, the defence does better to play spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what does E lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|sybarra: true,  not much |pg||
nt|sybarra: thats impresive!|pg||
nt|patricck: I lead a @H and watch them chalk up 9 tricks, thats why stegariou is playing and not me :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *impressive |pg||
nt|werge: His longest (side)suit|pg||
nt|patricck: Stregaroiu sorry....must watch that spelling :(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade close to being s success for the defence, but no cigar, only four traicks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tricks even|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Christiansen is an obedient citizen. He leads partner's suit|pg||
nt|athene: borderline rebid decision for north|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade goes in H - if S is not led|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: even without a spade lead   could still go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  easier to win the post mortems that way|pg||
nt|athene: raise the major with 3 and a ruffing value, or repeat your trick source|pg||
nt|andyv:  i like 3 card raises but not whenI have a 6 card suit to rebid.|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer 2@D with that north hand, yes|pg||
nt|athene: if partner has 5 hearts, then 2@D will still be OK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hantveit: are they playing pass system?|pg||
nt|hantveit: That makes more sence|pg||
nt|jeanhari: if declarer reads spade well he can make this|pg||
nt|haans: how does South  enter to lead @S|pg||
nt|ady: White house missed the close 4 spade game on board 13|pg||
nt|andyv:  if pd can move over 2@d, then I have a terrific hand for him.|pg||
nt|athene: but if partner has only four hearts, 2@D will almost always be much better|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes 2 D is correct but N has ruffing value - his small trumps can win tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|desert: This board doesnt look very exciting, too....|pg||
nt|werge: What is the E/W system . Jump to 3 NT...?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting contract, there are ways to reach 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|hantveit: My guess is that they play some kind of pass system Hans.|pg||
nt|werge: EaST HAS APPARENTLY OPNENED 1 @c !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ady: yes   duck first won and take 2nd|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like it is going to be very close|pg||
nt|werge: Bad defence, better @D Ace and a @C through|pg||
nt|werge: Now East can enjoy two @C-tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, but first you need to know if you have game values|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nubmaster: nice lead though, only 11 trick now|pg||
nt|andyv:  with A@d, tempting to lead spades anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|werge: In OR, West never got his  @C-Ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 rounds of @D's  and ugh |pg||
nt|andyv:  since E only has one heart|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: one|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Verhees thinking which spade to return?|pg||
nt|raghavan: S has correctly decided it is not so pass 2H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: 3@C,3@D,6@H and 1 @S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @d lead at the other table so we keep the average, another imp to NS :)|pg||
nt|werge: This should end up with at least 9 tricks - |pg||
nt|haans: why take first spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can beat it,  with another low spade from N |pg||
pc|dA|nt|hantveit: hmm, now vest has no entry to the diamons if defence play hearts.|pg||
nt|patricck: the spades are so bad though, both @S and @H look unlikey to succeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe, but 3NT did not promise three stoppers. Could have been one and a solid club suit. Then perhaps @SKx and a spade gives the contract|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: u are almost right - but East can just play up @D 2x - so not a standard "fork"|pg||
nt|werge: It would be nice to turn back to the flat boards - the big swing in board 5 was tuff|pg||
nt|hantveit: must take the dia finesse now, |pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, hard to play when all those imps are running out...|pg||
nt|werge: We would like mto se South duck another @S...|pg||
nt|werge: to see|pg||
nt|hantveit: diamond to Q and K, and a new spades that is ducked?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: would be right to take 1st spade if jack was with north|pg||
nt|patricck: mustn't cash the J@H, switch back to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he should cash |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's so much easier with all cards in view|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: 1H4 smith?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: down now |pg||
nt|ady: its just a guess|pg||
nt|werge: Still West will be endplayed|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|werge: New trouble will arrive for N/S|pg||
nt|haans: @H4 neg @D4 neg = spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk3: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after this round. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B ...|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|werge: North should have taken the first trick|pg||

nt|werge: Naturally he shoud´nt take the @H Jack - but makes anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: a small ! is not so bad from N|pg||
nt|Walddk3: After this round there will a long break before the Swiss begins. Restart at 17.30 Paris, 4:30 pm London, 8:30 am Los Angeles, 11:30 am New York|pg||
nt|hantveit: I forgot the bidding in hand 2. East did open pass with a pass hand, so pass system was out the window. :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: imp is an imp |pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnc: And these two teams will qualify for Swiss A, if only nothing big happens.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: But the @s-duck is not subject to a TEAM-match|pg||
nt|athene: now can cash @HAK and run diamonds through east|pg||

nt|jeanhari: the other dutch team high in the rankings lost exactly the same big swings on board 1 and 4|pg||

nt|andyv:  marshall miles must be playing:)|pg||
nt|athene: but neither defender knows that|pg||
nt|athene: each defender thinks that his partner has a yarborough :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: some work for the coaches :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 opposite 10 and a misfit, amazing|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes one wonder how they missed slam|pg||
nt|athene: north could have doubled 2@H perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: if he had done that, then *maybe* south would hit 3nt - but still unlikely|pg||
pc|h9|nt|aupillon: Hello all. Tks Roland|pg||
nt|hantveit: Hi Andrei|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - no 800, 1.100|pg||
nt|sybarra: start clubs or @H's? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: They often pass with 9 or less because the opening is limited to 15. Also, they have a 2@C gadget for invitational hands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many different hand types|pg||
nt|patricck: still need to knock out @C first, so as to have enough entries to lead spades up twice|pg||
nt|sybarra: and so fascinating to see them all in action!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a risk of going down if you play for diamonds to be 4-4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and spurn the @SKJ onside chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nubmaster: it wont be anything else but another push, third in a row|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hard to assess this, but it should go at least 2 down|pg||
nt|andyv:  some auctions are best left alone....dbl of 2@h may have warned E/W to stay low.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: for sure no X from me - I would wait and X 5@C :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @c now and decl has 3 @d loosers|pg||
nt|desert: Fat chance....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you consider the 3@H advance to be game forcing?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: one on @s but still 2...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: almost gameforcing but they know N has up to 16|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The poor young lady has no tricks|pg||
nt|athene: you normally set up the long suit in the hand with entries|pg||
nt|athene: but here, NEITHER hand has entries :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|werge: Should be forbidden|pg||
nt|nubmaster: for us specs yes :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: thinking exactly the same Jean |pg||
nt|andyv:  spade lead in OR made this hand much easier for declarer (W dbld a 2@S bid by S)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i suppose you go for diamonds and lead to the @D9 maybe|pg||
nt|athene: or just duck a spade and hope for 33|pg||
nt|raghavan: He will try 33 Spades with OPP so give 2 tricks, 2Hearts, 2 Diamond =6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Irene Baroni|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: nice defense|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  nice play|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|ady: 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe @D4 now is too revealing|pg||
nt|patricck: absolutely, declarer very likely to go down. In the other room an artificial 2@S was doubled by West so they got off to the wrong lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They lead 4th against NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: first @S finesse coming |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|desert: hmmm|pg||
nt|aupillon: If 2 women play like men, these French ladies does|pg||
nt|raghavan: S8 is another check |pg||
nt|athene: now @HA and @HQ, to show the diamond (not club) entry?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|werge: Board 8, pls|pg||
nt|athene: or he might just play passively|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: no extra trick but still nice|pg||
nt|andyv:  not if declarer had 109x|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: @D9 or 10 would have been deceptive, but then again from K109x Christiansen would likely have led the 10|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  coded !9D lead would have made it harder to read|pg||
nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
nt|patricck: excellent declarer play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: -2 and next!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes very well done|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: he knows declarer is ducking from two spades hoping for 3-3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: -3|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: does he finesse @D again?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: only 8 after a heart lead so good bidding..|pg||
nt|athene: and so clearly has no tricks :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: on the heart switch may be worried to take 2nd diamond finesse   may settle for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|jeanhari: he will count the hearts still left|pg||
nt|haans: 4|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will finesse if 3|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so zimmermans discard (spade or heart) will make a two trick difference in a way|pg||
nt|haans: play @HJ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: taking his time|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|patricck: and the reward for that excellent play?   LOSE 2 imps  :(|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d5|nt|patricck: the @C discard was crucial|pg||
nt|roswolf: twas ever thus|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days are like that |pg||
nt|athene: declarer would have gone for clubs if he had any chance of bringing those in|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: or diamonds similarly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade, DA and D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Irene is a woman|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: rehi|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not much happened|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|jeanhari: cant see him tae the finesse|pg||
nt|jeanhari: k|pg||
nt|haans: spade K has been played|pg||
nt|jeanhari: think zimmermann discarded spade first|pg||
nt|haans: only 1 imp to fuss about|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they were in 3 nt in the other room making|pg||
nt|jeanhari: v prooijen must be ALMOST sure de Q is on his left|pg||
nt|ady: going to lose imps whatever   in game making OR|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|haans: even if he is wrong he may still get @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Zmu-Balicki lucky in 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: spade lead there also |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so this two trick problem is reduced to only one imp|pg||
nt|ady: yes  just a toss up   spade or h eart|pg||
nt|andyv:  better than the other "reward":)|pg||
nt|athene: so i think north can probably put his partner with @DA|pg||

nt|jcwla: If W's cards weren't aces might have been uglier.|pg||
nt|aupillon: 2 hearts by E/W ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 more bds for the decision |pg||
nt|sybarra: andy did your mother play duplicate?>|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope, canasta|pg||
nt|sybarra: or even rubber bridge?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The trick for E-W here is to avoid 4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a pretty score|pg||
nt|andyv:  E/W should stay away from  3N:)|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S must be cheap here|pg||
nt|athene: if you work out that NS really do make their slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|strong|nt|justin c: 2NT all pass?|pg||
nt|hantveit: what about 3nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think Auken will insist after he shows 6 of them shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see if EW enter the bidding|pg||
nt|raghavan: BD 17 OR Texan played in 2S= so Texan gains another 6 IMP|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nubmaster: in OR Nick opened strong @c, south bid 1@s, pass, pass, Nick jumped to 2NT and south bid 3@h, all pass...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 3), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - with 8 or 9 tricks, depending on the eventual @C-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: E-W never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|athene: now it gets interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: in my youger days...:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Let us view how NS reach slam bidding method|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 7@H, knowing they will take the "safe" sacrifice|pg||
nt|andyv:  @ss were never bid in OR|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nubmaster: pass? |pg||
nt|hantveit: oh my God - two of them...|pg||
nt|athene: after all, you might have a spade void|pg||
nt|athene: and if so, 7@S has to be right|pg||
nt|ritong: kind of blackmailing|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2D+2C losers in 7S|pg||
mb|5C|nt|patricck: 3NT looks difficult as well, even though it made in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is forcing for them. It is not for many players|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pelu: strange pass from W - but maybe only East have the right to overcell :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: you both are talking about younger days... :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why 5@s?|pg||
nt|athene: north could have bid 3@H over 2@S perhaps|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|patricck: probably no big swing here, playing for the overtricks|pg||
nt|athene: along the lines of "bidding my suit before the auction reaches the 8-level"|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: why 2@C???|pg||
nt|werge: East unblocks and has an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|werge: Why not @S Queen.....?|pg||
nt|werge: That´s sleepy bridge - take it or leave it|pg||
nt|werge: North has minors, so S should find the @c-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, he bid 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it does but the defence are forced to open up suits because of the distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: How would you bid the N hand over 1NT?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Ducked by N|pg||
nt|aupillon: eventually|pg||
nt|werge: Problem is, we cannot remember what is going on now - only the past|pg||
nt|sybarra: need an early @D hook |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a very delicate hand to play and I can assure you that it will take time|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm still not past trick one|pg||
nt|roswolf: are there enough tricks i can see how 8 may be made but not 9 - it may take a defensive error|pg||
nt|patricck: I think that 3NT would be dead on a small @S lead and continuation, but yes, the defence has problems if they start with a club|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should be able to win trick and ask S to lead again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: where there is 8.....|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 6@s immediately gets the job done|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: E slightly surprised now?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Rule of 11 revealed that North has no card higher than the 7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: 11-7 = 4   Christiansen can see all 4 in his and partner's hand. Accordingly, North can't beat the 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It is not often that this rule comes into play, but here is an example|pg||
nt|andyv:  revealing @h discard|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the 8 of spades may come to declarer's rescue but it is nip and tuck|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I should have said  11-6 = 5   and declarer can see all 5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or even 11-5 = 6  and he can see all 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Doesnøt matter. The thing is that North can't beat the 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hantveit: The other table played 3H -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sorry all,  my time just got crunched ...see you at the PABF  tonight |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|werge: Poor South - his last entry|pg||
nt|jcwla: This will not take the Romex award.|pg||
nt|athene: heart back not hard to find|pg||
nt|athene: go Irene :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|pelu: a small @S - but still a danger of blocking the suit|pg||
nt|nubmaster: more action in OR, there W bid 2@d over 1NT (multi), N doubled and west 3@d (preempt in M). south doubled and west bid 3@s and Smirinov as south bid 4@d by a long thought and North ...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ended it all by 4@h|pg||
nt|aupillon: depends on the ruff in clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec tells me gib says -1 well that might well be the case but i wouldnt put my life savings on that result happening in real life|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Shirley|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: but not here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You read about those underleads in books, but you rarely see them at the table|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: usually when you try this in real life, declarer wins @SK stiff in dummy and has a sure side loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And if you do, they are often unsuccessful|pg||

nt|ritong: always impressive to see them play as if they had the whole hand in view|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|raghavan: another baby slam in H|pg||

nt|aupillon: asked*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Moysian fit was not successful next door|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes good bidding by defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: there's a slight danger this 5@H might be taken as advance saccing in some situations|pg||
nt|athene: but not after strong NT, pre-emptive overcall AND at unfavourable|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: game in 4@h|pg||
nt|hantveit: both major kings are on for EW. 4H will make|pg||
nt|werge: I vote for West, 4 @H, 620|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 5@c a bit saner|pg||
nt|patricck: the lucky spade position will allow 5@C to make, but because EW can force in @H it isn't enough to allow 4@S to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it's obviously better than 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 7NT is also easy|pg||
nt|raghavan: S does not want to bid 5S only to push them to 6|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps west thought 5@H was asking for spade control|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, very possible|pg||
nt|athene: she is probably still preoccupied with writing down the previous hand|pg||
nt|athene: to show to her friends|pg||
nt|andyv:  bid is confusing since W is looking at A@h|pg||

nt|raghavan: and made|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: perfect distribution for 12 tricks if played accoringly and helping lead from E|pg||
nt|werge: Yes N/S!|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes always easy with 14 high cards but I think they will stop in 6@d or @h|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think Walsh 4@h bid in OR was a "little" underbid...|pg||
nt|werge: One more of these doubles - and here red against green, so no play E/W|pg||
nt|justin c: at the other table they didnt look for slam NS|pg||
nt|nubmaster: What is RD by Justin?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C has a shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: more than a shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: it's rigid|pg||
nt|patricck: %@C needs @SQ10 in the pocket, and there they are :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|april7: like this on|pg||
nt|josj: can you ask?|pg||
nt|patricck: looked to me as though declarer only lost 4 tricks 2@S, 1@H and 1@D, East discarded a club to let declarer take all the club tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  or Q@D to drop:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: Flat board|pg||
nt|roswolf: or @D Q singleton or doubleton|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, the spade isn't needed because of the diamond dropping|pg||
nt|andyv:  lovely hand for S to hear 4@d:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is 4@D  rkcb I wonder, or a splinter in hearts?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keycard ask I am told|pg||
nt|roswolf: might even consider exploring a slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  when I hold these hands, after I gave pd a raise, I just want them to place the contract so I can go back to sleep|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|werge: Who is E/W - maybe indiscrte, but their family names are hidden|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@D overcall would have led to a different contract.|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, West has an abvious 4H bid with only 5 losers and south giving away the spade K.|pg||
nt|werge: In a match like this, a 7 IMP victory deserves an award|pg||
nt|aupillon: next ( that's Joey silver phrase)|pg||
nt|hantveit: Well, it has not been many interesting hands. Very difficult to get lost|pg||

nt|sybarra: this may not be a success for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah then has south forgotten?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hegedus knows that 5@C does not exist by looking at his cards, so he also knows that partner did not take 4@D as rkcb|pg||

mb|1S|an|.|nt|april7: 3@S I propose|pg||
nt|hantveit: there it is, 2nt -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: but on this hand it was |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now. Many thanks to Eugenio, our splendid operator in Sanremo. Well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@s on previous board over 6@h might only go down 1100 as one spec points out|pg||
nt|ritong: it did in an other romm|pg||
nt|athene: ok last board now|pg||
nt|ritong: room*  helness finished the hand hooking the @s J|pg||
mb|d|nt|werge: OK - let´s see it this way. Do´nt bid too GOOD at this board|pg||
nt|werge: 2 NT? Do they play 18-20...?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Shirley Ybarra, Andy Vinock, Patrick Carter and Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to our operator Eugenio, and also the EBL and FIGB for bringing us this event|pg||
mb|4C|nt|april7: otherwise N might pass|pg||
nt|rnc: He took your advise!|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you |pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 2S made +2 =170|pg||
nt|buddyshah: make or break?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: hahaha... but they needed that one though... could be 13 imp here|pg||
nt|hantveit: A desperate invite?|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, but West must at least have considered a double instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Are they playing lebesohl here?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe X was better |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north could just have bid 2@C over 1@S, showing a good heart raise, surely?|pg||
nt|andyv:  good brakes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: he even herd me|pg||
nt|brolucius: With spades agreed, instead of hearts as in the other room, N-S will surely identify that the queen of trumps is missing.|pg||
nt|werge: Bad luck to pay 13 IMP here - maybe|pg||
nt|justin c: the trouble with agreeing @S is that you get to find out the @SQ is missing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: obviously not...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Finally, our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match today in about 25 minutes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|rnc: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right there|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Hans and  Patrick.  Great fun guys and thanks for  important insights on these hands. |pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
nt|patricck: a pleasure, very interesting set|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph!  (he has to herd us cats ---commentators I mean) |pg||
nt|andyv:  6@s?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|nubmaster: a good convention to be used at this board, then south maybe can go further with 4@c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnc: Bye and thanks|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play the @SK and the @SJ or @SQ falls from East, you can follow Restricted Choice by finessing the @S10, which increases your chances slightly from that of a 2-2 break. |pg||
nt|patricck: This will drop Romania out of the qualifying places, but they still have time to recover..... Angelini should be able to breathe easy for the last two qualifying matches after this ...|pg||
nt|patricck: win|pg||
nt|buddyshah: loos like this board will hurt texas the most  along with 6@C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|werge: IF  E/W has a 3 NT here - then East has NOT a 1 NT-opening!|pg||
nt|ady: no problems here  J@S  down in 2   and K@D laying well|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  we got our wish... no push boards:)|pg||
nt|ritong: with diego and irene at the same table, push boards are as rare as snow in springtime|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|pelu: why not? - even oif N has a semi-positiv hand, there are long way to 5@C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: might have had been more difficult with clubs 4-3 and the 8 with west|pg||
nt|Walddk4: we have snow in april|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, it's on the cusp both ways.|pg||
nt|athene: Denmark exports snow to other european countries who need it|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, so your scorebaords often look like 6/4 with 20 bgoards played|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: scheduled time is 7:15 am Los Angeles, 10:15 am New York, 16.15 Paris, 3:15 pm London, 12:15 am Monday Sydney|pg||

nt|nubmaster: thanks for now... see you in a while again|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: 46% chance of making 5 spade tricks ... which would increase to 57% if one of them held the @sJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nubmaster: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: extra entr disappeared however |pg||
nt|ady: can make 10 now|pg||
