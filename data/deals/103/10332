nt|ady: 4@H   easy for e/w|pg||
nt|haans: M löfgren|pg||
nt|haans: weak 2 2 aces???????????|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3NT now is possible for NS|pg||
nt|werge: Was South afraid of NOT getting the @D Ace?|pg||
nt|xenya: seems communications were a bit awkward for declarer to take a safety play in @Ss|pg||
nt|davidstern: EW have to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK OK Finita I am told|pg||
nt|haans: wast have at least 18 (19) points|pg||
nt|werge: West played faster than I saw|pg||
nt|haans: yep speeeedy|pg||
nt|werge: He even made 650 against my 450...|pg||
nt|sybarra: S likes his hand |pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4@h bid and made by an overtrick in OR so it was a push|pg||
nt|haans: aim still taking about last deal|pg||
nt|haans: but new deal now|pg||
nt|panja: oh sorry Haans|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|haans: hansen take the lead :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: an imp may be at stake here |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 |pg||
nt|april7: must have been an endplay, leading awy from K of @S|pg||
nt|danilo1: should be automatic for every good player (he has been fast enough) ... 1/1000 is still better than 0 :)|pg||
nt|haans: i am corrected|pg||
nt|haans: no score from this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: the cards lie well for N-S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 2 - EW went to 3NT down 1 - So Welland got 5 IMP - now total 12|pg||
nt|jeanhari: speculative, too much lenght in clubs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but could be a winner|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Best chance to get into the bulletin|pg||
nt|haans: is H Welland Mr Welland?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Mr welland in west |pg||
nt|xenya: but i'm not sure|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 22 both went to 4s -1 push|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: hmmm CC says 14 -16 NT..|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kurtove: 6 h or 6 cl or 6 nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: CC is from Pau, might have made changes since|pg||
nt|haans: not any more :))|pg||
nt|aupillon: 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be weak NT for the double by Nunes|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|milton_se: this should be 4H making|pg||
nt|milton_se: but S has to duck a S lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: they do play leb here|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@d also as well as 4@s|pg||
nt|newmoon: so probable 3D... or even 5D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 4), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting mix of cards here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not for sure, wellannd cant see through the cards didnt took the best line|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: new players now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: last deal|pg||
nt|werge: When North bid @H´s - East keeps silent|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead in the other room |pg||
nt|don paulus: another 3 nt NS|pg||
mb|1H|nt|charles_l: 2@s in 4th maybe?|pg||
nt|panja: if a @C is not led, NS can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think you need 4@s together with 3 @h|pg||
nt|henryb: what would you respond with the S hand?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might make in W|pg||
nt|april7: but making a slam try|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: bad lead mister|pg||
nt|haans: she was called henner in previous match|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she gave me her name :) Welland H.|pg||
nt|daman: do they play DONT?  or a version of same?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Need to get spade lead and sneak through a heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or get two hearts|pg||
nt|haans: polish clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes polish club|pg||
nt|haans: NS can be boody here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: And Meckstroth-Rodwell got to 3NT last deal with K single to Axxxxx in @c...|pg||
nt|sharkey: they usually don't underbid|pg||
nt|afulton: i knew i woke up too early... this is either dream or nightmare! |pg||
nt|sybarra: (from the xxx hand)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 4@S  too high at the vulnerability for n/s   even if guessing the minor suits well|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont happen much on this deal either|pg||
nt|haans: no boring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 8 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|daman: Garner will get frisky here|pg||
nt|haans: board 4|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|sybarra: X pls|pg||
nt|werge: o children at this table now, pls|pg||
nt|werge: No|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is pass forcing |pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe north might have passed with a stiff in his pard suit and a 3 count|pg||
nt|panja: 4@h will be interesting on B18|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 @c asking for 5crd major ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: 2@c by S = ??????|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It is not this board|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome to misfit corner|pg||
nt|jcwla: Leslie likes this auction so far.|pg||
nt|ritong: won t happen|pg||
nt|aupillon: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play X= strength vs weak NT|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces now nowdays :)))|pg||
nt|rnc: And with spades 4-1 North would probably have tried to tap declarer by continuing hearts|pg||
nt|daman: with his @C void|pg||
nt|jeanhari: thats looks forcing to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: or @H lead and win 2@H with no @c shirt|pg||
nt|rnc: Will be hard to stay out from 3NT|pg||
nt|werge: 3 X @S - ouf|pg||
nt|werge: I think we are waiting for West, nor South!|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 2@c must be drury|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: in cl|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H my bid|pg||
nt|kurtove: 7 cl|pg||
nt|hedyg: vs strong double would be 5m+4M|pg||
nt|milton_se: easy now|pg||
nt|kurtove: and now its easy|pg||
nt|haans: none nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: if so they get too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: shift|pg||
nt|haans: sure fast|pg||
nt|werge: Now E/W look more dutch to me...|pg||
nt|werge: A fair 6 @H|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt has been on the agenda for 80 years but strong nt still more popular|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt or 5@C|pg||
nt|haans: no spade lead in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: no spade from South|pg||
nt|ronpa: so the indian team has started this set very well|pg||
nt|ronpa: not missing 9876|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm they may well miss their heart fit|pg||
nt|newmoon: took 4@S as a cue?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they yook wrong way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c for me|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s seems very conservative, but driving to 3@s seems like a lot|pg||
nt|raghavan: Will HQ be the lead?|pg||
nt|rnc: For sure - they are Polish :)|pg||
nt|werge: not South|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well brave effort by west with 7 count|pg||
nt|dcbutler: not at this vul|pg||
nt|ritong: now west has a serious problem|pg||
nt|ritong: his part showed a good limit raise |pg||
nt|dcbutler: wonder how much 2NT showed?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   looked enough with that collection|pg||
nt|ritong: agreed|pg||
nt|dcbutler: looks like a mixed raise (at best) to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oliver can you explain the bidding - I could not understand what is 2Club by S?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead in any case|pg||
nt|haans: we do not have their cc|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think they will make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes @H lead and it looks good|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphztg: IT IS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I'll say, both aces on side, the qj of @H flopping |pg||
nt|xenya: VERY well, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: would this bid not show a stronger hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ady: east hoping for the best here  QJ spades look poor values on the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: was 4@H fast arrival (negative bid) ?|pg||
nt|haans: why not start with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: trouble:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pre empts creat problem - that is what is intended|pg||
nt|newmoon: makes sense, Hans  :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is matter of style, but...|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|davidstern: As long as declarer doesnt try a spade to then|pg||
nt|davidstern: ten|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S 2@H 4@D and it makes in no @c shift|pg||
nt|davidstern: But if declarer plays hearts straigh back there will be a smell in the air|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but it will not be clear to N what it is from|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer's best play @HK and low club to hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think win @H and play one back is it|pg||
nt|davidstern: That will certainly get a club ace shift I suspect|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bet not :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table finessed @S10 I am told|pg||
nt|mariner1: i n@@o 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: if declarer plays @Ds now, it shouldn't be difficult for N to work things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|rnc: If win and continue hearts, doesn't it looks like you have fast tricks? Just need a second @H-trick. Then the @C-shift is more likely to come|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Guess there will be some talk here|pg||
nt|sybarra: the tap will start on trick one, I thought |pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 @d = 1 4crd major - no 5crd|pg||
nt|haans: danilo u here?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@C Polish ... 1@H Polish upgrade (looks like 4@S) |pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: tre other 3 hand = the bidding, but S??|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe South's 2@C shows both majors, but West doesn't care|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|pelu: or dont know? - if opp alert 2@C u dont exp both majors .)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: We had a problem at the begin, they switched Open and Closed Room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in the Open. This match is from the women's event although the banner reads Open Teams|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT you should always bid - and beat. 5 @C is easy - without the @S-lead, which Easts 1 @S-bid has avoided|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
nt|ritong: danger zone entered|pg||
nt|ady: yes    too high now|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@c is not possible because it is forcing to game (artificial in their methods)|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in trouble now|pg||
nt|werge: Less than 1100 seems to deserve the commentaire: WELL played |pg||
nt|panja: establishment bias....|pg||
nt|haans: perhaps|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|pelu: and he will make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I was away a minute|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it a weak opening in a Major?  and 2H by N is pass or correct?|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sounds like it|pg||
nt|xenya: i could make this contract|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now will he pas this dbl?|pg||
nt|daman: the 3@S bid was uncalled for|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must be|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: how about a @C?|pg||
nt|mariner1: thinking too long also gives them a signal|pg||
nt|fann4: Ew in 3NT in the CR, making on a @S lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E is going to hate this|pg||
nt|werge: But 3 NT by East OK|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|haans: hi|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Crash seems to have deleted most of the scores|pg||
nt|haans: not much is happening|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: crash sistem on bbo :) wait a second please|pg||
mc|9|nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|haans: 13 hcp for opps|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by S - also 5D makes but this 4H is a trial on way to 5D|pg||
nt|haans: but will it make?|pg||
nt|werge: Problem in 6 @H is, that you have "some" possibilities in the @S-suit, in 6 NT it´s easy play = double finesse|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Morning Hans x 2 and Martin|pg||
nt|haans: morning Roland|pg||
nt|werge: - and you go down in 6 NT, I think 6 @H makes easiily|pg||
nt|werge: Morning Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
nt|haans: yeah need only 1 ruff|pg||
nt|panja: there are a lot of trade barriers etc. in bridge, too|pg||
nt|werge: West|pg||
pg||

nt|westjava: official web site : http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/|pg||
nt|westjava: brb|pg||
nt|westjava: best result,so wd|pg||
nt|westjava: the new leader with 1 imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost a BAM game |pg||
nt|westjava: again, battle of part score|pg||
nt|allanr44: a serious loss, vul|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Possibly East denied both minor aces but looking at the West hand that is unrealistic|pg||
nt|allanr44: Give me AK A, and partners 2@C, there is no way short of slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we have potential for double game swing|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,4@S was a very good save|pg||
nt|westjava: and make..!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Assume partner's better holding is a not-great holding in your worse suit and if the contract might be ridiculous, don't suggest it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here @H's would be ridiculous - if could suggest @D's and @S's at the 2 level (DONT or some such), maybe, but even then I don't think it computes to an interfering hand.|pg||
nt|woozle: quite often, 2 of your best fit will make, as will 1NT...it's just a question of whether you;ll find your best fit|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 2 a push = both 3NT made 3|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be a part score deal |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW in 4@S here I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who I vote for hee|pg||
nt|sybarra: *hrere|pg||
nt|sybarra: *here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  partscore swing to China on the second board - they made 2C at the other table and 2S here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: doesnt it make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=0-10, 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A flat looking 3NT here.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: 6@S is too much with @c ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: 6@S down by @C lead:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to hope they do not WIN it|pg||
nt|allanr44: Maybe it is a home ground advantage?|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@S loose only 1@H and 2@C, is'nt it??|pg||
nt|woozle: Hirata with a very fine hand, but 3NT may still be a bit of work|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 18, where E/W here played 4@S down 2, they stopped in all of 3@C - which had the virtue of making - 5 more to Japan.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true that contract is also there|pg||
nt|sybarra: fingers should not do the walking  obviously |pg||
mb|2D|nt|nigel_k:  Are they playing uphill and into the wind in the first half?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not a fan of overcalling 2C on that sort of hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor me |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: here is same, never overcall this w/5332 and poor @C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: 3@D a nice nuetral spot for all|pg||
nt|westjava: for -1, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra2: someone has to have a @H stop |pg||
nt|westjava: first blood to Indonesia from   1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very nice bid from Bojoh|pg||
mb|3H|nt|westjava: Thai gain 8 imps from   2, play only 3@H|pg||
nt|westjava: @D lead..??|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but probably a frustrating start for the chinese pair, they have already defended 4 making contracts in 4 boards, this is going to be the 5th|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: a good stop|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT not my choice to show this hand but nothing much matters here.|pg||
nt|patricck: what would you like Jordan?|pg||
nt|allanr44: In Wellington?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Into the wind in Wellington you'd be worried about game going down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 tricks the limit here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jcwla: You're right Patrick, defense is "a trick harder on every hand" and even if the boards are flat, it just doesn't "feel" great to defend making contract after making contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|allanr44: you'd be worrying about survival!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Fred welcome |pg||
nt|idblu: ge all :)|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C might be defeated, and 4S had excellent play...I know which way I'd rather go|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agreed.|pg||
nt|woozle: Anyway, back to the current hand...apparently Hughes leads third best from this holding|pg||
nt|jcwla: W is not going to have fun discarding here|pg||
nt|woozle: Declarer has eight easy tricks (two clubs, four diamonds, two hearts) and may or may not find a ninth|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2NT.|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS gets a game board - 3NT makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: but enough tricks for decl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway 2NT here looks ok, concede a heart and make three hearts, three clubs, a spade and a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Yes Gary |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: I was thinking small @c back hoping S has A@D and will cash and lead one|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Fred:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: sets up the 1 trumptrick :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: For the specs:  Wellington NZ is known for its breezes   :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|woozle: two discards (small spades) are easy...the third discard is harder; heart is best - declarer might not pick it|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcwla: One overtrick IMP to China in 4@S on 17.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  Can she find KH now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: if trust E @ST, always @HK|pg||
nt|patricck: close I guess, must be worth somewhere between 2 and 3 and it is a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: Oh pd wants to be there as much as I do.  When we aren't there is the rare time we definitely don't want to be there.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, vwd|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: nice|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, easy nine tricks. Should be flat.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4H E/W has some chances but is very thin|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: next pl |pg||
nt|mariner1: 8@C asked for the @H switch which was also reasonable|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|westjava: @S for @H loser now|pg||
mc|9|nt|patricck: So you believe in conservative invitations because partner is an aggressive accepter?|pg||
pg||

nt|henryb: more 4@h contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3 down sorry :)|pg||
nt|daman: easy @S game now   a breather|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 3 - again IMP to Welland - OPEN room bid 3NT made 5 |pg||
nt|oliverc: if one has say 4 + spades is suppose to bid 1 D - 2 below actual call :) So 1C = 4 +|pg||
nt|oliverc: H. So presumably 2@C was a weak 2 in Hearts|pg||
nt|werge: Solid game - bad slam, but both can make|pg||
nt|raghavan: deal 24 5 IMP to Welland - 2h made here, 1NT made by team mates|pg||
nt|mariner1: another misfit here|pg||
nt|davidstern: I bet not|pg||
nt|mariner1: sometimes thinking just alerts the opponents|pg||
nt|davidstern: Defence always wary when declarer plays to establish tricks in your suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would take your money David :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: BRB|pg||
nt|rnc: Did|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The 5 teams from the Swiss will be numbered 28-32|pg||
nt|mcarroll: For Squeeze needed to cash @Cs first|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see 3nt making here|pg||
nt|sharkey: possibly Hans|pg||
nt|werge: No 1400 here, maybe 400|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i thing the swing will be bigger than  the hangman's rope|pg||
nt|werge: Ups - no slam|pg||
nt|haans: bye|pg||
nt|haans: :( it was that close :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and now............toilette break....................|pg||
nt|werge: A shaky 6 @S here|pg||
nt|haans: 2 finesses = 25% |pg||
nt|werge: It´s slightly better, 37,5 or so|pg||
nt|haans: always  a little below|pg||
nt|werge: One finesse is a "double" one|pg||
nt|haans: tell me sometimes what is 'double' on (not now)|pg||
nt|haans: one|pg||
nt|ronpa: so lengy scores his first 2 imps of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Buddy Shah|pg||
nt|april7: E should haqve known that W has no point|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if east bids 6@S, Sabine had better lead the right ace!|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6C for EW|pg||
nt|aupillon: stop before 4 spades ? :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: sort of|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Swiss B that is|pg||
nt|haans: sweden closing |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: the push to 5@H on the last cost 10 big ones|pg||
nt|werge: In OR, they were caught by their RKC-1430 or so|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi buddy wlc|pg||
nt|buddyshah: great start by Herbst|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: looks like 12 tricks in @s for E. why? well, you tend to lead from your short AK....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so Badger's on the board with 3.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 down how come i missed something obviously|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@C/@D by EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: but not a good slam|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt good prempt|pg||
nt|aupillon: now minor slam in progress ...|pg||
nt|kurtove: 5 club|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely changed their system, last year this was 20-21|pg||
nt|aupillon: try 4 spades, a Splinter bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 23 here NS 3NT-2, in OR 4D made so welland gets 8 IMP|pg||
nt|newmoon: they should get to 6@H here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@D must show the majors here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: really he alerts pass ...............|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S a novel biddding|pg||
nt|buddyshah: hi Avram|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt also|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: but not when west has shown hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: the vulnerability should deter EW from sacrificing|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Bergen now?|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d would a tad pushy|pg||
nt|milton_se: doesn't look like that :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: only H lead sets 6C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that means that after  - alt least - 1@s opening it´s impossible to play 1nt|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to stop in 1N|pg||
nt|werge: Board 18 was perfect for playing behind screens|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S as a weak bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as he now surely will|pg||
nt|ritong: be*|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in fact north pass :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S best contract|pg||
nt|haans: or 21D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For E/W anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@H looks the limit on good defense|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, 12 tricks in 4@S with a good view|pg||
nt|raghavan: D bid showing both majors |pg||
nt|mariner1: problem is N might think they need to guard over tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: very true, Rob, but N shouldn't be caught sleeping here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well as I said, thinking that long alerts the opponent that there is an issue|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - found out too late 2 Keycards missing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: ok - maybe he won't get the chance|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I raise,  wonder if 2 @S or 3 H! is better |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H |pg||
nt|don paulus: ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The club layout might see this one home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here game to be bid but both 3n and 4h look precarious on thelayout|pg||
nt|pelu: 11-14 5-5 in m|pg||
nt|haans: not an easy make  4-1 in @H|pg||
nt|newmoon: Zia's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|haans: only @CK right|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h possible here, even though the trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bd 2 hot wines get 12   and Bd 3 - Zeleski get 10 IMP |pg||
nt|henryb: that is correct. its not my choice but it would be the most common over here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Running scores are back|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass might be 5-7 count|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will make on B15, but 4@H in 43 fit, yet again, might be a better spot a priori|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, W made an immediate 2@S wjo|pg||
nt|lesrays: it was a donation, not a score|pg||
nt|ronpa: will north dbl for lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
nt|oliverc: Apparently 2@C was 4+5+ in the Majors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will bid 3 I presume|pg||
nt|jeanhari: too late for predictions :)|pg||
nt|haans: yes prepared to stretch|pg||
nt|werge: NOW Wests hand nis very BIG...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Tomorrow we will be showing the Open final + either the Women's or Seniors' (depending on score)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|davidstern: So Bessis on the board|pg||
nt|haans: icedlandic pecision perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men då kan jag påpeka att typ ägg typ inte är helt rätt...|pg||
nt|werge: or 2 of them...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Some play X as 5-7 and pass is <4|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might bid 2@S here..... and play in a Moysian a level lower|pg||
nt|panja: did they end up in 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: even less now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: trtue|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|werge: 480 - flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: the reasonable contract|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|aupillon: sure,clubs 2/2, diamonds 2/2....|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some|pg||
nt|werge: Because of @H Queen|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR they bid and made 4H in deal 18 so Sweeden got 10 IMP It is 35 against 36 - tough fight|pg||
nt|rnmalik: after DBL 1@S could be only 4+|pg||
nt|april7: S took away W's bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|daman: I am getting some tea|pg||
nt|ritong: showing @ds and @ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: very fat 2C -- may be hard to communicate|pg||
nt|jeanhari: should help enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: with limited access to dummy this helps solve one issue|pg||
nt|rnc: Zimmerman 16 VPs ahead of Apteker going into this round, 13 VPs ahead of 2nd (Jacob), so it's odds on for Zimmerman winning the Swiss A|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes, Helness jumped straight to 3NT|pg||
nt|werge: Better take your 300 against 2 @S X|pg||
nt|haans: adrenaline high now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levin/Hamson need to forget the last and regroup|pg||
nt|sybarra: W transfering back to @H's|pg||
nt|ronpa: missed his chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s would be an egregious overbid|pg||
nt|ritong: bergen style not popular in france|pg||
nt|daman: merci|pg||
nt|daman: quatre piques fait cing ici|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|daman: cinq*|pg||
nt|ritong: joli , G|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table North playing 3@D on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Precision is SO much easier to understand LOL|pg||
nt|newmoon: swop @H8 and @H7, and it gets difficult    :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: missed... 1@s overcall slightly misleaded them|pg||
nt|lestergold: but w wont forget it in a hurry|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer shouldn't be given a chance to get a spade away from either hand on a long minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt must be lebesohl|pg||
nt|haans: leben|pg||
nt|raghavan: good lead |pg||
nt|milton_se: only +1 now|pg||
nt|raghavan: there are 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|newmoon: panel - response to 1@C?   1@D or 1@H ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: not to be|pg||
nt|werge: Has´nt West not just a 4 @H over 2 @H - 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another imp available here|pg||
nt|afulton: the double would have gained them an imp! |pg||
nt|april7: best is if S passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3@H for me too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's one (of many) reasons why Meckwell usually play so fast|pg||
nt|mariner1: the VUL position makes this tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow saly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hans you havent seen commentators manual Page 4 Paragraph 7 - we save bandwidth and do not correct minor typos|pg||
nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: May lose 1-2-2-1|pg||
nt|davidstern: For -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H not played could have developped 1 more in D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks quite normal though -- and makeable|pg||
nt|panja: @ST or small lead?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But the temptation of the Vulnerable game is hard to resist|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - even 500 is easy to get|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if south didnt find a spade lead there is no way he wouldnt find the switch when in with Kc|pg||
nt|kurtove: if he entres the table|pg||
nt|davidstern: That lead looks helpful but if he puts up @CJ and finesses heart will prove a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D down in other room|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: common now  1@D transfer :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 9 top tricks - 1S + 4H +3D + 1c  more may come by CK finesse etc|pg||
nt|newmoon: Kib says "guess this is a good example for walsh even on a good hand."|pg||
nt|haans: i would show my hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sure west should show Hearts  |pg||
nt|newmoon: well... whatever, this match is based on "winning on the opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@d,3@s and jump (which King will be chosen?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s|pg||
nt|haans: specs have that nowt so far?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get dicey |pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: salam|pg||
nt|haans: may be sad when he finds out no extra @H-trick|pg||
nt|danilo1: E will probably make at least a little slam try (not just 4@S) |pg||
nt|haans: if E pass 3nt be very nervous if @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: to late :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|charles_l: no takers :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: making 12 now|pg||
nt|haans: standard is to bid @D only with longer @D|pg||
nt|nubmaster: make now...|pg||
nt|sharkey: not anymore Shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the old days we led fourth best from north's holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: now we block the suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: life just got better for sure|pg||
nt|buddyshah: looks like -1 on 8@C lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|star6ija: @s Jack could be ducked now and black squeeze after that for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: nooo|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3@H does seem on|pg||
nt|mariner1: making is worth an imp|pg||
nt|werge: But here, the "right" hand is asking|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: un autre pique|pg||
nt|daman: un carreau est faible|pg||
nt|daman: that's my frendh for today|pg||
nt|daman: French*|pg||
nt|haans: weak jump increase @CA in east|pg||
nt|haans: good double|pg||
nt|haans: yes but old days never morre|pg||
nt|sybarra: but declarer doesnt know that |pg||
nt|april7: trump is best now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dim if thats the way declarer plays it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H by E would have been relay|pg||
nt|milton_se: in fact 2 (J dropping)|pg||
nt|haans: ame squeeze|pg||
nt|haans: sme|pg||
nt|haans: same|pg||
nt|star6ija: still possible, yup|pg||
nt|lestergold: new days that old guys like me dont understan that well|pg||
nt|haans: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer did well to grab it|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt need a spade switch of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the good old black will save another slam before it sinks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@H problem solved now EW will play 5@H|pg||
nt|werge: - which will bring 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|aupillon: aha|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: yes ruff 3x@c disc @D - ruff @D ruff @h and u will have 12 tricks in the end|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: with the @SJ in the S hand, this is foolproof |pg||
nt|rnc: And Herbst needs them badly for qualifying|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=796&qphase=32&qroundno=1|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - 500 in instead of out looks reasonable|pg||
nt|werge: Declarers 1st trick - come on...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Meckwell in 4@hx EW last deal...|pg||
nt|raghavan: No problem for 1 NT = 5C+ HA+SA |pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk3: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=16  for running scores|pg||
nt|brgpro: one spec. asked me if the ladies have sit S or E in this event, i guess yes|pg||
nt|athene: -450 can't surely be bad for NS|pg||
nt|brgpro: but i dont know for sure|pg||
nt|wwalter: @d than @h|pg||
nt|ritong: "my grand gin card" allix thinks|pg||
nt|kurtove: and 2 imps to bessis|pg||
nt|davidstern: and there you go|pg||
nt|davidstern: As do both teams - running 31st with 2 qualifying|pg||
nt|rnc: So, we have the same contract - on a longer auction though|pg||
nt|lestergold: betterunclock hearts and duck a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: unvlock|pg||
nt|lestergold: unblock sorry|pg||
nt|buddyshah: -3  gib says|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib says:  "looks quite normal to bid 2@h 5+@C and 4+@H "   I agree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: club now for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: we get it|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to be doing the club first |pg||
nt|lestergold: im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: id have done hearts first|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications slightly awkwar on this han|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - some communications problems now|pg||
nt|haans: @D blocked|pg||
nt|sybarra: but "unclock" may work also on N |pg||
nt|MolvaM: in real life 5 lavel contracts fail quite frequently. not here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: real life = my life|pg||
nt|werge: A french player tells me, that East could just have passed to 5 @S!!!|pg||
nt|werge: That is 2 down, but would often make|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @H is NOT making very often|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: -650 sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: still 6 tricks for the declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead and diamond underlead to get a ruff would be interesting|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but not today|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now he can make 6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: 13-11 to Lavazza after 4 bords |pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes ladies ALWAYS sit south or east in a mixed event|pg||
nt|henryb: -200 is habit forming for N-S|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScoresOWS.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, it's very 'crowdy' around that line - every VP is important|pg||
nt|davidstern: For this swiss http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=6|pg||
nt|davidstern: Herbst 39th with current score|pg||
nt|haans: rare to pass and not transfer|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wwalter: can play a @s also|pg||
nt|davidstern: Perhaps 100 = 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have been worried about where all the @ss were|pg||
nt|rnmalik: likely|pg||
nt|don paulus: so 1st imps to Texan Aces ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense by E|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|henryb: it is a bad habit|pg||
nt|raghavan: a costly 1NT - If S passed they will be playing in a part score.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C now|pg||
nt|lestergold: one way or the other cant be broken now|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you declarer can go wrong|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jeanhari: maybe south shouldnt have played diamond ace|pg||
nt|sharkey: may have to guess @S now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now i bet he wished hed unblocked the pesky hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|haans: im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: frankly a surprising error for cardplay at thislevel|pg||
nt|haans: @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looked autonatic to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: and should have been Mike |pg||
nt|sybarra: (imo )|pg||
nt|haans: may b because last board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as Haans mentioned the adrenaline may be running high for EW which may explain some|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its a verylong tourney i suppose hard for them all to play at the top of their form|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brgpro: why shd I know....or what do I know...I am not a director...|pg||
nt|daman: c'est tout|pg||
nt|kurtove: maybe zone|pg||
nt|jeanhari: on the first two rounds|pg||
nt|sommer: 12..|pg||
nt|xenya: making 6 now|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match  Denmark 15  Harangozo 1  5 to score|pg||
pc|h6|nt|charles_l: @s also ok - can force a reentry|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|kurtove: sry|pg||
nt|henryb: not that costly. West would have balanced with 1N and east west tould play 1N or 2H|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 4 they also played in 3S-2 = Push|pg||
nt|haans: @D is called giving up|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|charles_l: now a bold @h|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps and play three rounds of diamonds now|pg||
nt|haans: precision 2@C opening in other table paid this time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 14 imp swing possible on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably quite hot in san remo in mid june|pg||
nt|werge: This overtrick only is good for your health - still 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT pass should not be in consideration despite 4-3-3-3 ... hand with controls (Aces and Kings) .. I have expected 4@C over 3NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|raghavan: Can you tell me as which countries these 2 pairs belong to?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D around sure looked right there,,,,,,|pg||
nt|raghavan: may play SA|pg||
nt|lestergold: wish i was there|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: hope someone has to lead away from @CK|pg||
nt|sommer: @H to 10 now...no:)|pg||
nt|werge: Not only possible, please|pg||
nt|haans: much has happened at bridge table|pg||
nt|werge: You very often can judge the "quality" of a contract, when you follow the speed, declarer plays in...  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes but now we see the Open result|pg||
nt|haans: only - 7 imps|pg||
nt|werge: A brave man would have paid the 500 long time ago - CLAIM|pg||
nt|haans: most of us do not do that|pg||
nt|werge: No comment...|pg||
nt|haans: QJ dubble in @H = only 200|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still hoping for less than 500 - if QJ @H doubleton it would be very interesting|pg||
pc|hA|nt|werge: Regarding the @S-suit known, you cannot even put the other cards in a way, which make 3 NT, best would be @H Q-J doubleton for 200|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|nubmaster: a @s guess now|pg||
nt|lestergold: not playig bridge  i mean on beach|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: too fast |pg||
nt|afulton: sorry, i not following this defense or line... they give up 1 trick on opening but east gives it back but south says NONO you take it and east insists!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidstern: If he can manage -160 would be 2|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks now - well done|pg||
nt|afulton: from first hand experience, I can tell you... when the players start to go in lightening mode, it is very dificult to follow! |pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@S|pg||
nt|april7: now only 2 down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: what|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levin missed it....|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh, 9th trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they (defense) are not helping him |pg||
nt|haans: really|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: time to unblock that @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: ah of course it doesn't help :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScoresOWS.htm|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davidstern: That will make one Dane who is watching happy no doubt|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|davidstern: Duck to get club through|pg||
nt|xenya: strange -- how could a @H to the 10 be worse?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: Levin had to return @S to test declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: unbelieveable what we are seeing a ping pong of errors of a type we might see in some remote location second rate tourney not in this sort of match|pg||
nt|haans: lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll|pg||
nt|nubmaster: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heat and the 1400 a fatal cocktail for levin maybe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: always? that depend on country - not in denmark! - no discrimination - free sitting !|pg||
nt|sommer: show-up squeeze may come|pg||
nt|sommer: it is for sure better|pg||
nt|haans: i agree with you why pass (not even hamman pass)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jeanhari: was there really e spade discard?|pg||
nt|haans: Been really exiting match this far |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|josj: OK Denmark!|pg||
nt|raghavan: We thought -2 But now??many more |pg||
nt|davidstern: Making this will gain 1 imp for Herbst|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 down|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Claim , next |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|haans: good question|pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: suicidal play|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well to me 2NT is just this hand (or if you value it above that range then open it 2NT).  But as to invitations, yes, I don't like to play a level higher than I have to, so I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: prefer invitations to be one last chance to avoid game when we really don't want to be there; otherwise, we go.|pg||
nt|westjava: wd Bojoh|pg||
nt|idblu: was a great call|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 2@S opener too?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably another push board there|pg||
nt|raghavan: I agree rhey are Random - But in comparison to hand dealt, there more hands with voids and singletons|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: mirrored hands NS make any game tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes because hand dealt are not properly shuffled|pg||
nt|raghavan: This W hand is from book - bid stayman and pass any bid ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly|pg||
nt|raghavan: So Those players who practise with computer hands have better experience than the have nots  |pg||
mb|2N|nt|idblu: not in Canada|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 1@C = 15+|pg||
nt|westjava: Conny Sumampouw (W), won 4 Gold Medal on Indonesia Multi Event 2008|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate that opening |pg||
nt|woozle: NS will reach some game here...both 4H and 3NT are cold|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@H heading down in OR on 19 also - so a push there.|pg||
nt|raghavan: This X is penalty - I hopw that is their understanding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now fit is found|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|westjava: some times,over call with 4 cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a corollary of playing 1@C=2+ for balanced hands is that 1@D can be 4+ and always unbal, but EW 1@D=3+ :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I like the overcall here|pg||
nt|mariner1: good cards and NV vs VUL position|pg||
nt|westjava: back to   3, also 6@S in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 1@H = 5+@H & 10+hcp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes apparently South has 15+ and North 10+|pg||
nt|sybarra: but probably a "must do" |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N NS has good play here|pg||
mb|3D|an|1 major|nt|westjava: 2@S - 3@S and pass out..?:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perhaps she can't count|pg||
nt|mariner1: if N uses disciplined 1N then S should bid 3N|pg||
nt|westjava: ladies team,woman pair,mixed pair and mixed team|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is a good call too|pg||
nt|westjava: Taipe take over by 5 imps from   3|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2H is H and a minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ahh|pg||
nt|raghavan: If the minor is not C, S will bid Diamond - also agreeable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the hand I'd be coming in on|pg||
nt|raghavan: W must pass I suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these days it seems almost mandatory to bid over 1NT on anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The singleton honours don't count extra|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred, their card says  2M=0-10, 5+suit  so anything seemed possible|pg||
nt|woozle: A missed opportunity for Japan, but they still lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same hand|pg||
mb|3H|an|!s|nt|westjava: wow, 3nt..??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North and South will need to discuss the strength of 3D after this|pg||
nt|westjava: agree Nigel:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: N explain weak 3@D while S took as 8-11 from written explaination|pg||
nt|mariner1: stayman without out  a stopper Lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: yeah...|pg||
nt|westjava: ahaa...|pg||
nt|jcwla: I prefer 3@H over 2@C here to show this suit.|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe he needs a better hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: good pass |pg||
nt|mariner1: no easy entry to W might allow this|pg||
nt|patricck: this finally looks like a contract that EW can beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Yes Gary|pg||
mb|4C|nt|idblu: if thats systemic,,,,then he violated system :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I don't like the 4H bid much - this is a great dummy for 3NT - but he'll make it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|nigel_k:  4S is not too bad though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so you lower opening by 1 and raise response the both still lie? seems silly to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: If ruff is tried H loser will go|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: some specs not happy with Berman opening pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S 3 3 and K @H and K@C on side assure the game|pg||
mb|5C|nt|afulton: isnt this a similar theme to last hand? |pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: to return a @H...:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2 imps to Ina from   2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1st big swing to China with 3N bid and made board 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: will lose 2 @S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: what would cc wei think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2NT shd be 1 top honor in @S, explained by S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They do both have good playings strength, the problems will come when you have a misfit but are already committed to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s seemed to have arrived in best spot |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the @C leads are cutting the ruffs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it is the last hand :)|pg||
nt|afulton: don't they bother to reshuffle? ;)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nigel_k:  A possible 4H here for E/W. Unfortunately they sold out to 1S by South.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|westjava: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S can't beat 3H so no harm done as long as they get to play undoubled ...|pg||
nt|idblu: unless they don't do it on 5-5 hands|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|patricck: I know there are 16 points in the North hand, but the flat shape and poor pips would have kept me quiet against two bidding opponents|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20 also a push at 1NT/S making 2.|pg||
nt|raghavan: QMay enter in CQ and discard 2 clubs on H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: and now @c are only 1 loser|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Small point but South should play 8H not 3H|pg||
nt|westjava: very nice @H return|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S thru for another @C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: operator, we just had this one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 3N rolled in for 11 to China|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: or vul vs not means 6, or, or, or|pg||
nt|idblu: thats prob more like it...vul w2rong|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
pc|c2|nt|idblu: wrong|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great def and down they go|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: having proved that 14 + 9 is not always game|pg||
mc|10|nt|nigel_k:  -150 and +140 is a push :)|pg||
nt|westjava: exactly:)|pg||
pg||

nt|brgpro: easy 6@h?|pg||
nt|athene: or 6nt if you really want|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the idea is to have comparison of lad7 versus lady and gentleman versus the gentleman and...|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@s is good here|pg||
nt|charles_l: 7@s open cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry it is not easy to play with leslie that don't show cards :)|pg||
nt|daman: in North America   the @C Queen would be called an "elbow card"  you push it between the AKJ10 with your elbow and smile|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT    n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a typical points-shmoints hand|pg||
nt|aupillon: and this non 6 hearts ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: another makeable 6D|pg||
nt|pelu: so after 5 board only 1 swing - Angelini was close to lose 5 IMP, but had a gift: +10 |pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni will not pass|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak opening|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 4 a push - both 4H-1|pg||
nt|haans: apteker must try harder now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: That's the spirit!|pg||
nt|star6ija: chance to apteker to strike back - they strongly need it|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Try harder and you will succeed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t find any bid on S(!)|pg||
nt|raghavan: S must pass|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 9 tricks made|pg||
nt|haans: nor me|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s take a silent 3 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 segments of 16 in the final|pg||
nt|werge: I agree with the unlikely Q-J position in @H, but both of you had faound out long time ago - NEW BOARD|pg||
nt|nubmaster: And Meckwell in 3NT, @s lead from south|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S get it|pg||
nt|nubmaster: last deal|pg||
nt|werge: By some luck, the opponent with @D Ace waould NOT be on lead|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: israel|pg||
nt|haans: to weak for 3nt |pg||
nt|werge: In Open, East and West did´nt play the same system here. East opened a weak 2 - and West drove on to 3 NT...|pg||
nt|afulton: and they don't make a point of allowing the VG operator to see|pg||
nt|lesrays: On board 18 where declarer here made 10 of the 12 tricks, Welland raised Zia's 1NT to 3 and they led a heart...|pg||
nt|haans: but it would not be wrong to have a little talk with p|pg||
nt|danilo1: AK is correct play ... wins vs 3-3 any any Hx ... 10 wins only ve Hx or Hxx at North|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt again|pg||
nt|danilo1: may be 1@C (Polish)|pg||
nt|haans: yeah|pg||
nt|danilo1: depends on NT steps agreement|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C-1@S-2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Jos and discussed this earlier. We think it's against the EU rules if you took it that far|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H soon|pg||
nt|aupillon: After Ace @s lead and @s , no more 6 @d|pg||
nt|oliverc: I Suspect the NS pair are Polish|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx and EW ?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: another dull 3NT?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|davidstern: 5@HX in OR|pg||
nt|aupillon: weak but positive ...:)|pg||
nt|haans: can they find @D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here as in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: same in Sweden - I am told - so only the South-country discriminate .) - In Germany lady S and W!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That's not good enough, Murat. It's sexist|pg||
nt|wwalter: how 7?|pg||
nt|charles_l: sitff @hJ and dummy reverse|pg||
nt|wwalter: any play would lose 1@h|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H P 1@S 2@D P P now west has a bit of a decision|pg||
nt|davidstern: Over E/W 4@S|pg||
nt|aupillon: can one say 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|pelu: so the 5-level is max for both sides - will they fight on 6-level? :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW Turkish, apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk5: However, this is not about winning according to Pierre de Coubertin|pg||
nt|raghavan: a X bid is good for S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I must bid on S now i prefer D|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: easier if played in S but still makes|pg||
nt|davidstern: Cash 3 spades and a diamond and gain an IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on TOOLBAR|pg||
nt|mariner1: and then OPEN or CLOSED|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S lead on the auction in Open Room might be called for|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm |pg||
nt|werge: West has the fastest pass, I have seen for years!!!|pg||
nt|haans: well done passs more often :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|MolvaM: that the screen partners on one side should be one lady and one gentleman|pg||
nt|athene: i know Sabine Auken doesn't like it - she complained about it in her book :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: interesting hand -- 5D makeable (but a bit double dummy)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil, Diamond bid is due from E |pg||
nt|raghavan: is N thinking of a penalty?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer seems to have 6 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: in a heart contract|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh..silent?:)|pg||
nt|haans: i know polish 2 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: N has single J|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder we've got a football (soccer) score in this set so far -- 2-1 -- the hands have been fairly routine |pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@D in both rooms|pg||
nt|kurtove: Not a good result for bessis in open|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 4NT|pg||
nt|aupillon: enfin. In fine...|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 6+@c +4@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: If E misses this chance, may not get again|pg||
nt|newmoon: 1@C alerted - Polish style?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: "The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well"|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|newmoon: previous hand Zia opened with unbalanced 17|pg||
nt|haans: zia has never bid polish|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a @h lead from S I vote for -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: a natural D lead is there - may shorten Declarer's trump holding|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: well E bids the @S here, so auction will be different|pg||
nt|mariner1: S may end up playing 3N now|pg||
nt|haans: and now an easy 1nt  (thats all)|pg||
nt|werge: In OR, thay mus have an agreement NOT to lead a @S against NT|pg||
nt|werge: they must|pg||
nt|werge: North is wondering about the game here|pg||
nt|april7: again 2 down|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: well I was talking about the general EBL rules :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes they both like their pure 6-4|pg||
nt|milton_se: not happy w spades bid by LHO...|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid now 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: although he will be disappointed to find the @sK offside|pg||
nt|raghavan: He will try to enter Dummy thru SK or CJ|pg||
nt|henryb: I am not sure that a @d is right. I was taught to lead trump when partner passes a 1 level double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|haans: but very close :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no it isnt... maybe it is after the lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After a club lead, it will certainly make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: small club?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On a spade lead, i wouldn't like to predict the outcome|pg||
nt|haans: easier for N to enter now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nicely bid in Open|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans - what do u think - 1D-1NT will S try 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jim Hay|pg||
nt|haans: now they may bid 3nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: might  beat 1nt   lead a spade    and switgch to clubs|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|haans: 8 trick for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, another dull 3NT|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 9 now :)|pg||
nt|sommer: can't it be set?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play NS, not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may keep n/s out of the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be a kind of multi?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has done them a favour as they cant make ZIP|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 or 3 @D maybe |pg||
nt|MolvaM: interesting that the other room east did not reopen after 1nt came to him|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|werge: Very passive indeed|pg||
nt|haans: i open 1nt|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: Spain : Lady N and E :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: sorry for the word Easy...nothing is easy in this game|pg||
nt|aupillon: but slam no way cause 2@c opening bid|pg||
nt|haans: 4 diamonds????????|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S by W now might make it pretty hard for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H shows a huge hand here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: could it be the Zia factor?|pg||
nt|ahh: hi all |pg||
nt|afulton: vg should be = "Very good" |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Say a woman wants to sit West and you tell her that she can't. Isn't that sexist? I am just asking|pg||
nt|xenya: but not this one?|pg||
nt|star6ija: one problem decided|pg||
nt|newmoon: tough for Gower to find a @H-lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: ok, if the result is correct, np|pg||
nt|fann4: Pretty pushy 3@D|pg||
nt|werge: Change the minor kings - and it´s an easy 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: But he was right. 2 @S is NOT a winner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leading yr longest suit on vugraf is a bit old fashioned|pg||
nt|werge: So put the 200 into your pocket|pg||
nt|werge: Problem is: 3 @C is a good contract - BUT: South will not pass|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Peter Eidt|pg||
nt|petere: good morning together|pg||
nt|werge: As West, I would lead a @D|pg||
nt|haans: 5 down still + score|pg||
nt|rnmalik: What EW are playing as defense to 1NT-DBL single suit?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wwalter: I see playing rederse summy, ruffing 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s looks making as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: if south had raised to 4@D i am sure west wld have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed not|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find who should play 4@H|pg||
nt|kurtove: must be worth trying 4 h with that hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: problem for Gromov heren, choose the right bid as the cards lie|pg||
nt|raghavan: that is the 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must take it though|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only 2 |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d maybe not 3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well they will certainly lead @S here|pg||
nt|werge: It´s not the LONGESTR - @d just as long...|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play 3 nt here |pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: this hand is not trivial if N-s play more @h|pg||
nt|kurtove: in North|pg||
nt|haans: play 1 @D get it claim|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprising|pg||
nt|fann4: If played constructively, even facing 6 of them.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: when everyone bids at the table people get suspicious and tend to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D or 3@H|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Jim|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|haans: very close|pg||
nt|haans: nyström has nothing in @H or @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: huge dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 rounds of @d a @c shift and a @c discard on next @d|pg||
nt|sommer: small @S lead..and?|pg||
nt|werge: Down on the nnaturral @S-lead|pg||
nt|rnc: as predicted, 3NT from the South seat|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows S has a @S stopper so.............|pg||
nt|buddyshah: m+M  m longer|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but south was + score|pg||
nt|sommer: then "noisy":)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: alsways down on 6-2 as defenders will switch to a spade|pg||
nt|xenya: well done, though i'm not sure how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
nt|werge: 550 out through is no PLUS-score, Haansf|pg||
nt|haans: yes they play togther RIGHT|pg||
nt|werge: through the window, I meant|pg||
nt|petere: but 550 in is one :)|pg||
nt|haans: good double lead now :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: puppet, unpleasynt Dble ... but North has no options except 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: no|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I wonder why double for the lead when you are going to be on lead?|pg||
nt|haans: we all mhave seen it|pg||
nt|haans: i once did!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: did not lead it !!|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably very rite, Martin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
nt|haans: decl finessed against me!|pg||
nt|haans: i had nothing in the suit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
nt|haans: but that is pairs thinking|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 top losers without the option|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Perhaps it should stand 2@d there... just an error...|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes sense - 2@S showing @H fit|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Usually 2@s is for play against a 2@d opening showing weak major and you have to 3@h if opener had @hs|pg||
nt|werge: I am told, that they led a @S in Open - then they must have covered the @D Queen - or?|pg||
nt|haans: they called TD|pg||
nt|haans: TD told me NOW BUT NEVER AGAIN|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|mariner1: migth see the @D switch now|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@s from north and 3nt?|pg||
nt|raghavan: good |pg||
nt|haans: and well done|pg||
nt|ahh: will be easy on @S lead |pg||
nt|mcarroll: should be no problem in the play|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless a @H lead is found|pg||
nt|ahh: @H lead  makes it more difficult|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
nt|aupillon: and slowly, but surely, thry drew their plans agains us ( War of The Worlds)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland has to find @S Jack now|pg||
nt|werge: You have seen to many crimi´s in TV, when you think a @D-lead is good. North MUSThave been misinformed about the 3 @S-bid|pg||
nt|sommer: so it became (maybe) a great and lucky gain for the Americans|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S+2@H+2@C=?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but top @c ducked and then east is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: as it  turn o ut 2 hearts  or even 2@D  works better for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: luxemburg has done well this far|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match both in 3N, making 3 and 4|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ALL results on the board already recorded http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.06..795|pg||
nt|rnc: Prospect looks bad from West's point of view|pg||
nt|davidstern: Change that 006 for any other board number|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows E has to have something, and the only thing he can have is A@D or K@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: 6D+1C+2S and 1H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: at most|pg||
nt|sybarra: now on to 4 @S |pg||
pc|dT|nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
nt|star6ija: now twelve tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 12|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: and would have passed with K@D|pg||
nt|rnc: West bought the contract, uncontested, in 1NT in the OR. North never mentioning the @Ds.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: y, sorry Carl... repeat here :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: took the short cut|pg||
nt|ronpa: only @H lead will beat this|pg||
nt|afulton: this might not fare well on @H lead|pg||
nt|werge: But we saw earlier, that double-leads are not popular|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
nt|raghavan: Should play D and continue to shorten S in trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@H is not an error. Shows 5-6 spades and 3-10 hcp|pg||
nt|MolvaM: to a minus score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but you never know|pg||
nt|werge: What´s this game called?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S has already shown a @S stop so straight to the NT game|pg||
nt|haans: @C was not a winner|pg||
nt|raghavan: He should immediately play S|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|afulton: they decided to go for it|pg||
nt|ronpa: wow|pg||
nt|lesrays: well done, @d Q must have been tempting|pg||
nt|afulton: So, 2@H's, ruff and the ace of @s |pg||
nt|sybarra: played from the other side at the OR |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: Now to see if it can be made|pg||
nt|MolvaM: name of the game is "bid 3nt and see what happens"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought 3@D was a good pass but trouble:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Was not but became a winner|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: defence will hav e to do the right thing though|pg||
nt|henryb: really? Is N trying to let this make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Defence is not on top|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: So on that board which required a club switch to beat 3NT http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=004.06..795|pg||
nt|mariner1: there goes the beer card|pg||
nt|davidstern: And you will see about half the field is beating it|pg||
nt|haans: a board to talk about|pg||
nt|ronpa: thats a viugraph error|pg||
nt|haans: yes WHY|pg||
nt|haans: and why did he tell me Now but never again|pg||
nt|danilo1: but now ... if I already Dbled (would not) and also if I did not Dble .. I would NEVER lead @D ... neutral in strong NT ... since looks like North has @H ... guess I would choose ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C down in OR|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Netherlands/bakkeren-bertens.pdf|pg||
nt|haans: nortway has invented 2@H meaning werak 2 in either M|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ok, then this is settled :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H multii do not think that is allowed here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Sure it is if it shows both majors|pg||
nt|danilo1: Dble on 3@D worked fine in OR :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|afulton: >>|pg||
nt|afulton: ??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
nt|newmoon: Will exit a @H after next trump|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|henryb: I take that back, but North's plays to tricks one and 2 seem strange|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Many play that|pg||
nt|petere: at the (milk-) bar|pg||
nt|april7: very good lead, it kills the @C suit|pg||
nt|buddyshah: was supposed to be puppeting to 2@C but JM willing to play in 4-3 spades  for a shot at Game|pg||
nt|don paulus: J@c favourable|pg||
nt|april7: but this doesn't help E|pg||
nt|don paulus: not enough - comm probl|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: or 3rd|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes could be better|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: of course|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: dont think can make now|pg||
nt|haans: killer|pg||
nt|werge: I know another game - one pair at the table can always make 3 NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was an interesting lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: no no double|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: duck |pg||
nt|mariner1: E pitching @H conveys A@C is probably right|pg||
nt|jeanhari: reliefed to see two hearts go|pg||
nt|ahh: play in other room strange if   record is right |pg||
nt|raghavan: there also 10 tricks so may be a push|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||
nt|newmoon: partial elimination|pg||
nt|star6ija: guess avoided|pg||
nt|newmoon: well played yes   :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: What a nice throw in|pg||
nt|newmoon: case for apteker to continue with a small @H second time|pg||
nt|newmoon: he could have got in with 3rd @H to punch @D8|pg||
nt|star6ija: Apteker's mistake... had to play @c after 1st ducking in @h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C 2 was a very safe exit |pg||
nt|rnc: Since N and E are on the same side of the screen, it seems odd if he got misinformed about the @S-bid|pg||
nt|fann4: Once again, EW are playing a contract in the other room - 1NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @C to the K@C and Q@D|pg||
nt|buddyshah: really?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought so:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|panja: dummy reversal is an attractive line, ruff 3 @D in Dummy|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes and lose a @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: in hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead on the go, might have done but who would do that?|pg||
nt|henryb: If she ducks, declarer can just ram @d down her throat|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in trumps are too good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now N is caught to play from @sA|pg||
nt|werge: De må have følt sig hjemme, jeg kender personalet|pg||
nt|haans: nothing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|don paulus: that would be 10 for badger|pg||
nt|haans: and next|pg||
nt|haans: not both any|pg||
nt|werge: Which means, that the 150 from OR was not enough|pg||
nt|danilo1: kidding :)|pg||
nt|haans: kidding njet|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jeanhari: club now ans then 3 rounds of spades to get another trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 5@D here,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club K now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: @DA, @SQA..|pg||
nt|wwalter: the dummy has 1 @h losre, if the @h is not found|pg||
nt|wwalter: now should ruff some @d|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer has to worry about 4-1 trumps too|pg||
nt|werge: Sry, privat...!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb: a heart continuation would create enormous problems|pg||
nt|werge: For me, that was half a joke|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: i have to go now folks bye for now thx all|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lucky the loss is less than it could have been 7 instead of 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: As long as at least one suit is known, it's permitted|pg||
nt|haans: norway have invented many things|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The Multi is an exception to that rule, by the way|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's allowed anywhere in Europe|pg||
nt|sharkey: I haven't seen this one in Norway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: but here's no one known...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Unlike North America|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi = either M not allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Of course there is, it shows spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Isn't it "any" of the M's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: USA no multi except in "big" events|pg||
nt|haans: spade or hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and sometimes not even there|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But this shows spades only|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ok, then it was easy...|pg||
nt|haans: norway has it showing either M|pg||
nt|nubmaster: let's comment the play now :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: @H finesse now?|pg||
nt|haans: do they still play :))|pg||
nt|werge: The safe way to 100|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wwalter: this is the best line to play|pg||
nt|don paulus: ty mike cu|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW won the Under 28 Pairs at Beijing in the Mind Sport Games|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N leads a small @S to K..and W let it hold, S MUST shift to a small @D!..to set it|pg||
nt|buddyshah: this defense is relly thinking good :) |pg||
nt|don paulus: best def @d now ?|pg||
nt|werge: @H is OK also|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|werge: No sprint-prize for this board|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: north played for some blocking @c position|pg||
nt|ady: but discarding a heart and a diamond made the contract unmakeable|pg||
nt|ritong: unless @d 10 drops|pg||
nt|ritong: if a defender has a @c less, he has a @d more and then @d 10 can be short|pg||
nt|ritong: he/she, btw|pg||
nt|daman: should be a push then|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in all Open matches|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb: at trick 2. declarer plays a club and South wins and plays a third heart|pg||
nt|xenya: would be much better, yes -- still declarer can prevail i think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@D oke to|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: as cards lie cant go of|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the closed room, the defence established their spades but failed to cash them|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No EW silent throughout|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|star6ija: A is correct line of play if N was with 5 clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H shows weak 2@S, FG three suiter or strong NT|pg||
nt|werge: Claim|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb: but declarer did not read the position|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have said this many times on vugraph,  I played in NL at many clubs etc,  everyone (including the grannies) had defense to multi |pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi??????????????????|pg||
nt|don paulus: made 2 @s in OR|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|h4|nt|charles_l: i think the @h count is later known|pg||
nt|fann4: A plus is that the 3@D raise may shut the opponents out, but if pard bids on it may be a disappointing dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: how come|pg||
nt|sharkey: on their CC|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|MolvaM: ok ok open room  :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we have alert kibitzers thanks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: but you were finally right, even with good news this defense beats it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: not taking out trump at all thus far, is certainly a little risky|pg||
nt|raghavan: one more trick WD|pg||
nt|mariner1: Bessis stops the schneid|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so evident! play @c and watch on N|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry misclick|pg||
nt|april7: but 2 down here|pg||
nt|werge: We can never be sure, if they MADE it - often defence gives it away, and VERY GOOD defence here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphztg: the score is 1 down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: long winded   but still down 1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|charles_l: she is still ok though|pg||
nt|panja: if a @D is played now, decl will be a bit under pressure..|pg||
nt|panja: ruff high or not? where to place @SJ?|pg||
nt|wwalter: only one losing line, high ruff, than finess|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|panja: y, but from 13 tricks we have come to a point where a losing line is available|pg||
mc|10|nt|don paulus: don't like 170 scores in imps count :(|pg||
nt|jcwla: Threading the needle loses again.  They pay 500 extra for vulnerable games.|pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong discard (@S) on @DQ .. otherwise, progressive squezze for 11 tricks|pg||
pg||

nt|mariner1: 6N NS?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S slightly overestimated his values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS us original Precision NT opening of 13-15|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: having to face team mates with "if onlys"|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think that last one is a game you would want to bid, just with a different auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 @h anyone?|pg||
nt|westjava: slam time now|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry,  only 6 |pg||
nt|mariner1: is a nice slam|pg||
nt|idblu: i 2nd the motion|pg||
nt|woozle: looks like a game for EW, 3NT or 4S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S here for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  N/S doing very well at this table so far but currently behind in the match|pg||
mb|1N|nt|westjava: 12 tricks already|pg||
nt|westjava: first blood for Indonesia from   4, 9 imps|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@S cant go any where:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: even makes 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt look close enough at first |pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: all in favour?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15, 0+@D |pg||
nt|westjava: seems like 3nt NS now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: deja vu all over again :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I told VuGraph operator |pg||
nt|afulton: but was it rotated? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so are we not live then Ragha?|pg||
nt|raghavan: shouldstop in part|pg||
nt|afulton: north has no bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|!s|nt|sybarra: does N move with super accept |pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL transfer to @H??|pg||
nt|idblu: redbl?  psychic?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=non-forcing stayman  2@D=game forcing stayman|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 18, where E/W here sold out quietly to 2@H, a highly competitive OR auction ended in a Moysian 3@S by Australia, on its way down some number.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: hard to get to this slam I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS do need to be care not to bid 7|pg||
nt|patricck: a good vulnerability there for Australia, but the Moysian @S fit doesn't play as well as @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: ah:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzre: 2NT = Grand @H, no 3c@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only over 4 @c or 4 @c |pg||
nt|jcwla: If 1NT is natural there, I'm delighted to bid it.  (I wouldn't play it that way but that's beside the point.)  As you say it's flat, but it's got some intermediates. |pg||
nt|patricck: Wang just LOVED having to bid 1@S, but you gotta do what you gotta do|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe says "get me out of here"|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you,Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfers over opponent takeout double is very useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@C, cue or asking bid?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C agrees which suit is N's issue|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: here, North only interested in 4 card major, so 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H ok but he has 4 keys and Q@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: no cue by S?|pg||
nt|westjava: has change...|pg||
nt|idblu: with the E hand, i would rather the opps played the hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in big club context - they probably have a bid that shows both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: whay N not to use 2@D..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South must be tempted to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: those H will be a disappointment|pg||
nt|westjava: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: missed opportunity |pg||
nt|jcwla: So 3@S went down only one, 3 to Australia on 18.|pg||
nt|idblu: @D's play very well for W|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even 4@H -- but 4@S it is. |pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes' rebid is a style thing...apparently 2S is acceptable with this shape...and Neill wastes no time in bidding game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like the 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: acey hand in S,  and pard transfers to your 4 card suit |pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  Thin game here missed by E/W|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@H ask the stopper|pg||
nt|afulton: for a sleepy auction, this started to get going|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: I dont get being so pasive  |pg||
nt|westjava: I am sure that other room, Fera Damayanti - Riantini will reach to six|pg||
nt|idblu: nice lowball hand|pg||
nt|westjava: will down on @D lead|pg||
nt|idblu: 34567|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will W find it?|pg||
nt|idblu: will have time to switch after @CA|pg||
nt|westjava: has to check first by A lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it required?   doesn't @HJ work|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer only seems to have 8 tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: thats true as well Al :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kiwibridge: deserves about -3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when not looking for slam or starting to force in his own suit -- 2@D gives away extra information to opponents|pg||
nt|sybarra: (and I am criticized for "sitting on my hands")|pg||
nt|mariner1: needed to make a move over the transfer to 3@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  Should be a straightforward 4H, losing a spade, club and trump|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|nt|afulton: if west leads another @H and east ruffs with Q, would have been a good play.. how do you tell you partner to do this? |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  2H by West a bit heavy but not unreasonable|pg||
nt|afulton: and should they figure this out?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: boy on mans errand sgould play Q@C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: upside down count|pg||
nt|westjava:   3, 4@H other room and 10 imps|pg||
nt|sybarra2: needs to cash soon |pg||
nt|afulton: this is ladies championship.... should have sent in the Queen! |pg||
pc|s3|nt|westjava: from N,yes|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Now it will be damage control mode|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  China made 4S on the last hand so now has a decent lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed 4@S did make and China race to a good lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S has to make the move somewhere|pg||
nt|westjava: hands up|pg||
nt|idblu: I give|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: such as opener holding 5 card @C/@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: I was advised a dictum  - when you ruff - ruff high and when you gollow the suit play low Here CQ ruff is needed|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|raghavan: folloe|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|raghavan: follow|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nigel_k:  This will be one or two down depending on whether South can get a club trick set up|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  New Zealand made 2H on this board so is headed for a pickup|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Glenis Palmer rebid just 2H with West which is conservative but reasonable|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|patricck: throwing clubs on diamonds and ruffing a club with the 6@S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|westjava: claim and next board|pg||
pc|s9|nt|woozle: I'm told that on board 21 the other room opened 2NT and played there..winning imps with a 28-point partscore|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N gets away with a gross bid :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: well makes with cross ruffs|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think W shd take more blame|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H showed a strong slam try and demanded control-bid then 3@S didn't promise any extras|pg||
nt|brgpro: his 2@h rebid might not have shown 6|pg||
nt|athene: in which case maybe west should do more|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right.  Pressure at all times.|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons to come|pg||
nt|aupillon: nice hands !|pg||
nt|pelu: in Op 1@C - 1@H - 2@D .. here NS has found the @D-suit|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat Anter|pg||
nt|murat: hello all..|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: okay|pg||
nt|raghavan: Massi what is the correct result |pg||
nt|haans: this look more fun|pg||
nt|jeanhari: open room stopped in time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bessis gets 1 IMP |pg||
nt|mariner1: J@D from W would be interesting if S is in 3N|pg||
nt|werge: A very flat 4 §S here|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @s...|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer had 6 tricks and had to come to the two spades sitting over the q??|pg||
nt|werge: Another 6 to Welland|pg||
nt|raghavan: Jim what was played?|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looks playable|pg||
nt|ahh:  given play is unlikely      i think  dec played on @S in other room and @C never played |pg||
nt|ahh: started well wiith 2 rounds of @H |pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Jim|pg||
nt|haans: picked you clean|pg||
nt|petere: mmmh what about @H6 ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|petere: hi Martin :)|pg||
nt|haans: hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: is not so easy @@ the table, this is made by the great masters :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 3), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|jeanhari: saw dutch junior pair double 4NT, hoping for soma bad agreements... could have been costly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ended in 5@H|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like a @S-lead in OR - @h-lead works better|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely contract was made|pg||
nt|april7: with this hand 1 NT, thats really odd|pg||
mb|1C|nt|panja: well, count of not, the only play available is to drop @HJ or Q stiff in 7@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: OR 4@H by SOuth|pg||
nt|milton_se: also 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: wild board|pg||
nt|raghavan: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1down |pg||
nt|mariner1: how to lead that I have no idea though|pg||
nt|haans: 2 @H ruffs|pg||
nt|raghavan: wether to pre empt 4S - N must be thinking |pg||
nt|werge: Has a difficult bid after 1 H - 1 S|pg||
nt|werge: But 2 @C should be ocay|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: and 3@s was sort of "on the way" cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: but if 3@H was only a mild slam try, then 3@S was showing west had a decent hand|pg||
nt|haans: 40 minutes late but still many specs|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 5 E made +2 in 3NT so Mc Leish gets 2 IMP |pg||
nt|milton_se: how do you respond to 2C with a solid 6-card major?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bid 3 of the major|pg||
nt|oliverc: expect 1 1@D Opening from North, showing Spades|pg||
nt|murat: E is Civginer actually|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||
nt|murat: was E aware of North's heart ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Looks like Flannery reversed > 4H and 5S |pg||
nt|murat: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: swing board|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4@c|pg||
nt|ahh: 4@S looks normal opener 1st in hand |pg||
nt|haans: 4nt soon|pg||
mb|1S|nt|charles_l: i only can when i am commentating, not at table :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: double|pg||
nt|raghavan: ultimately end in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: wellands do well her|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks 3@H would not hve been forcing...?|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score heree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ew open in 3NT..|pg||
nt|mcarroll: An opportunity for gain here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by W - reach 5D|pg||
nt|haans: both minors or @D+@H|pg||
nt|afulton: this could be semi-painful|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: Massi,   didnt he make that?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no 1 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play for 4@H|pg||
nt|petere: in the OR West miscounted (?) and passed in 2nd seat but EW found 3 SA|pg||
nt|haans: a miracle?|pg||
nt|haans: a he did not pass 2nt sorry|pg||
nt|petere: the good (?) news is, they didn't managed to fullfill|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in the Open. This match is from the women's event although it reads Open Teams on the banner|pg||
nt|werge: To open - as in OR - the East hand after 3 x pass - deserves a doping-control|pg||
nt|haans: lets try Ms for all|pg||
nt|afulton: with @H fit, but suit breaking badly|pg||
nt|sybarra: think they get to same place |pg||
nt|sybarra: however we have seen S pass before |pg||
nt|lesrays: not this time|pg||
nt|afulton: Ron, how is the weather there in Sanremo? |pg||
nt|haans: opps to enter???|pg||
nt|haans: will give them 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director on the table for bord 20 .........problems beetwen the players|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @H would have been discarded .. E should keep 4@S .. than cashing 3 Spades ending in dummy, West would be squezzed @H-@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: oh no|pg||
nt|hedyg: not over 1@d|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showing Diamonds, perhaps? :)|pg||
nt|haans: double to follow|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s = 5+@s and a minor, less than an opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N takes his 2@d tricks and plays a @c there is -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: how?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe a 3@h response to the transfer would work?|pg||
nt|ronpa: today weather is nice, yesterday was raining like hell :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably gorgeous!|pg||
nt|ronpa: but I sure prefer the rain and the israeli teams winning like yesterday!|pg||
nt|afulton: For more information click http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 7@c is a good contract and cold on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt likely to come home here|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play strong @c, thus the 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: now S in 6@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Dael6 1NT -3 here, 1NT-1 in OR. so 5 IMP|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the open room I mean|pg||
nt|haans: witgh u there|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: now!|pg||
nt|pelu: over 5@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: he must X now|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauria 8East) in box - 6@D making on @H-lead|pg||
nt|murat: Sen has enough values to balance the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Zia may come to life|pg||
nt|newmoon: belated x by Zia may lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: action begins|pg||
nt|ahh: will be pleased when p bids @D not @C |pg||
nt|haans: or strong @H+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: most of us :)|pg||
nt|ritong: this will go fast|pg||
nt|oliverc: With a void in Partner's Hearts, though?|pg||
nt|haans: prempt from slam thinking|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont get to high this way|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid 3S |pg||
nt|panja: misfit will lead them overboard here..cards lying badly too|pg||
nt|werge: But 5 @C is a good sacrifica - which often puses N/S higher|pg||
nt|haans: best is @D 3-0 against|pg||
nt|ahh: 6 @D makes on the lie |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: west said 4NT three suites |pg||
nt|ahh: well he has a void so it is accurate |pg||
nt|raghavan: usually 2 suit - still more likely lower 2 unbid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he said 2 sometimes 3 :)|pg||
nt|haans: ok with u|pg||
nt|buddyshah: will JM find a Spade lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  looks the best shot|pg||
nt|raghavan: N will pass I think - May bid D if what charles said is correct - that 1S shows Diamonds by S|pg||
nt|murat: misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead a small @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is new minor I suspect or a forced relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: New leader after this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: D J is natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: strong nt why 3nt?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks!|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S no make |pg||
nt|werge: No - but the bid it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: East "stole" it in 4@C in Open|pg||
nt|werge: Flat for one down, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: claim declared 1 down |pg||
nt|lestergold: piano hand fo a change 11 tricks next case please|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi see http://www.geocities.com/gerben47/bridge/|pg||
nt|lestergold: claimed one off??|pg||
nt|haans: ?|pg||
nt|haans: not fighting|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|raghavan: or a low D|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh sorry N on lead|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wise pas from mr Welland|pg||
nt|werge: In Turkey: 23 HCP = game|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be too high -- or...?|pg||
nt|sommer: MA lead for 6 imps one or the other way|pg||
nt|haans: and rightly so|pg||
nt|petere: find one minor J ... that's the task here|pg||
nt|afulton: WOW! Lengy let them off the hook|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That certainly came out of the blue|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: 3@C super-accept|pg||
nt|panja: the bad break in @H will defeat this|pg||
nt|athene: there won't be much to go on regardigg @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: regarding|pg||
nt|raghavan: If that understanding is not there, he should pass - N has told his story - South must decide|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower did good, else 3@S gets whacked|pg||
nt|werge: Not with this lead...|pg||
nt|xenya: it may not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4th suit also possible|pg||
nt|ronpa: he felt bad after last hand and thought good chance for fit when partner is known for @H shortness|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: they will do well to bid 6 i think|pg||
nt|xenya: ah!|pg||
nt|henryb: a big chance for Hansen|pg||
nt|haans: @C and can go down|pg||
nt|haans: even with spades down possible|pg||
nt|oliverc: It seems to me as if all 4 players are bidding their hands without considering what|pg||
nt|april7: if 1@S shows @D then why didn't N bid @D, but now S did|pg||
nt|oliverc: opps and partner have bid|pg||
nt|henryb: here N-S missed a decent @s slam; an excellent one if played by North|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@c is a little bit agressive (politely said) in the OR|pg||
nt|star6ija: running scores at http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes it needs a superaccept to get S to move again after 1NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible massive fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes several kibitzers tell me that 2NT response would have been even better|pg||
nt|MolvaM: because it seems many people bit 3H even with a minimum opening if they hold 4card support for pd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anyway 2@h seems a bit too conservative|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dcbutler: good idea by south - can she make it?|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   showed I believe showed 5 hearts and 4 spades and forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: mrs hinden has a tough switch to make|pg||
nt|ritong: @d jack could slip |pg||
nt|murat: they are still ok|pg||
nt|april7: S will start a crocss ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s lead makes the things difficult for declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 10 imp loss for this board must be billed to welland apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does declarer have a problem?|pg||
nt|werge: Dream-position in @D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|star6ija: @h also|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|werge: East stays to his @S-leads|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C better bid than 4th suit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
nt|werge: Easy to play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
nt|davidstern: This could get ugly|pg||
nt|haans: does east  havbe @HK?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf - we were talking about a better defense by NS In Open room same 1HX -1 Push!!!|pg||
nt|haans: yes he had already overbid a little :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing very important here|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might think S has @D cards on this auction,,,,,, the lead is not easy to find|pg||
nt|xenya: actually you just need to lead any @D here to beat it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but a @D lead is tough is it not?|pg||
nt|xenya: just lead the only unbid suit|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kurtove: thats a nice turn|pg||
nt|davidstern: Duck and a club ruff and another heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry club ruff and spade for -1|pg||
nt|haans: safer to play @HA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even if he wins this he can play a high spade honour they get a club ruff and then perhaps black suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|kurtove: its a problem to take the ace if east have the rest of the hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: So Heart Ace and seconbd trump then @SK win diamond ruff spade and ruff diamond and trump will nail West|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@D is a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can get C ruff|pg||
nt|newmoon: a very strange @HQ, if u count the points...|pg||
nt|haans: i assume 2nt was lebensohl so that was no option|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland know all the points, but the shape is also unfavourable|pg||
nt|star6ija: Slam reached at the Open Room|pg||
nt|star6ija: distance shortenned|pg||
nt|rnc: He did!|pg||
nt|mariner1: there it is,,,,, well done|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room the lead was a small @S|pg||
nt|panja: 6 tricks might be the limit for EW...but a couple of tricks in suspense|pg||
nt|haans: 1st try|pg||
nt|petere: ... not @D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|mariner1: the defense helps with the @D play|pg||
nt|ronpa: he will not like the K@H in dummy for sure|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
nt|davidstern: oops|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: soade switch is awkward after cashing clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 13 precious IMPS back|pg||
nt|rnc: If taking care of this good start, it will bring Herbst back in business|pg||
nt|rnc: Other room stopped queitly in 2@S|pg||
nt|rnc: *quietly that is|pg||
nt|haans: may not have been an option for them many play 2@S as forcing|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
nt|rnc: I must admit I would have passed 1NT without a thought|pg||
nt|xenya: me too|pg||
nt|sommer: gtg.. tnx and cu|pg||
nt|werge: But I do´nt like the blocking play, declarer has made in the @C-suit|pg||
nt|werge: West must play the @D Queen, when South plays the suit|pg||
nt|don paulus: 9 @s important card|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: defense needs to play spades|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|haans: never steel the contract when you  can steel suits|pg||
nt|april7: S has still to guess|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
nt|raghavan: a D to KQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: SAK|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best set of board, in the other BBO-match the score is 7-0 after 8|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club goes on SK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
nt|ritong: well played by east, a @d and it was over, since west would certainly play a @d back|pg||
nt|ritong: now on the surface, west has to duck the @d K|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal defense at this level|pg||
nt|dcbutler: that doesn't help, does it?|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that will not help|pg||
nt|ady: should make now   with diamond position favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: she might play a @d from hand right now|pg||
nt|kurtove: he was thinking that east never would have turned hearts without the king|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so much more to see here :)|pg||
nt|haans: :( may get better soon :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3N Open Room here,,, EW like to bid'em up in Open Room|pg||
nt|daman: not always the best sdtrategy but it worls like a charm on occasion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare does not know that @DS are so good and wondering about the @C losers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: should have discarded a club earlier|pg||
nt|april7: dummy is somehow squeezed|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panja: after the 2@D bid, 3@C, if NF is quite ok, isn't it?|pg||
nt|haans: many treat 6-4-hand as GF what you have to pay|pg||
nt|rnc: In OR West elected to bid 2@S (NF in their sys) after 1@S-21C;2@D. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
nt|kurtove: And I agree|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will be forced to take 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|werge: That should be 100 + 100 for US = 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|haans: second one easier|pg||
nt|petere: ahh, 'squeeze' it out :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice defence|pg||
pc|d2|nt|milton_se: +2|pg||
nt|raghavan: H9|pg||
nt|haans: now WH may miss playing @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would not bet on that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|werge: Sorry for NL|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now will be nervous of @sQ getting ruffed|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|haans: they need 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs to Neth White House|pg||
nt|haans: still 10|pg||
nt|star6ija: possibly|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - not even vulnerable, I would try for game|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|rnc: *2@C|pg||
nt|panja: after the 2@D bid..the 4-length @H is not likely to be useful|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed|pg||
nt|afulton: this could have been much worse|pg||
nt|ronpa: its bad enough|pg||
nt|april7: 3 of @S, but faster|pg||
nt|werge: Exactly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: cash two clubs and then @HK and @H10 - even if you lose to east's @HQx, she may be endplayed anyway with @SA|pg||
nt|raghavan: loser on loser|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 25|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after this round. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: H thrown anyway|pg||
nt|star6ija: and small @h back|pg||
nt|raghavan: Welland is fortunate that North does not have better than C3|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|afulton: looks like -1|pg||
nt|afulton: sorry|pg||
nt|afulton: i cannot count|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: as far as inviting goes - conventional wisdom is that you don't want to play in the invitation very often, so you want partner to accept more often, i think?|pg||
nt|daman: nice|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will a long break before the Swiss begins. Restart at 17.30 Paris, 4:30 pm London, 8:30 am Los Angeles, 11:30 am New York|pg||
nt|haans: ohh how funny it is|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: still lot od hearts|pg||
nt|lesrays: I refuse to ask if he really ducked...|pg||
nt|afulton: those of you who have listened to me comment before should know that!|pg||
nt|werge: Fast enough?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: That's how I feel.  I prefer the invitation to be one last chance to decline game with the absolute pits; otherwise, we go.|pg||
nt|daman: still going to make|pg||
nt|april7: no|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well played|pg||
nt|werge: Now East will be even slower|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i wonna die.....................:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|raghavan: Hi Massi - |pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|raghavan: why not DQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|murat: Ace ?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|milton_se: sorry, +1|pg||
nt|werge: This is an 8% game|pg||
nt|raghavan: play C |pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: excellent board for the french team|pg||
nt|raghavan: first time ruffed with 10, now 6?|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @c 3 is enough to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|werge: Maybe 8½...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good play, make the opps do the waork for you|pg||
nt|mcarroll: work|pg||
pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: making exactly will mean 9 imps only|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petere: but now guess right|pg||
nt|haans: good try|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: strong card :)))|pg||
nt|rnc: Not such a big deal, since both contracts will fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not 10|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: did he really pitch a @D?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: and a new leader by 1|pg||
nt|afulton: down 3|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think operator lost some of the play but still 12 imps for the indians to take a very hard lead to close|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: 4 down|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|murat: i guess it was Ace over Q |pg||
nt|buddyshah: S in on the right path here nicely worked out |pg||
pc|d9|nt|werge: CLAIM - we are wasting our time because of West|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahh: so  safe 11 more imps to Vito|pg||
nt|werge: Even overtrick - what a play|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|april7: first time 6, second time 10|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  This should be interesting|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  6D for E/W and a possible spade sacrifice for N/S|pg||
nt|allanr44: Indeed Nigel|pg||
nt|westjava: ty:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: With a worthless doubleton, three to the ace, and a min hand, it seems eminently reasonable to me.  Some prefer only with a stiff.  Some of it may have to do with how much ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: integrity 1@S has over 1@H.|pg||
nt|jcwla: If it could be four to the five, there may be more of a case for something other than 2@S.|pg||
nt|woozle: I rebid 1NT, but I don't claim that I'm definitely right|pg||
nt|afulton: well, if they made 144, it would be gross... in this case was a bit more shy |pg||
nt|raghavan: China leading 16 vs 2|pg||
nt|bebechira: TEXAN ACES doing well ....33-26 after 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS in a @S partial likely here..............|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a welcome 11 to NZ there|pg||
nt|afulton: i have something i would say to that... but it might get deleted by BBO (or get me banned)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS this time.. not much to it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Different strategies possible with West|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|westjava: Japan, leads the way 1 imp from   19|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @C lead make 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what Dawei's plan was with 1@C opener if partner responded 1@H showing @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: just no real play for 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bid 1N ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: agree aholl view|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1NT is 14-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and fortunate cards 3N can't be beat|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: After @CQ @CJ @CA @C4, W suddenly called small @C from dummy, S claimed all tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: sry|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 1@D bid.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is a good spot that can be beaten with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He would enjoy the 3C response from East if there was one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room stopped in 4@H on  4 :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
nt|idblu: P appears right|pg||
nt|woozle: We get an insight into style as Hughes declines to open a moderate 11-count, but Neill is there, upgrading a decent 14 to a strong notrump|pg||
nt|woozle: South will probably bid something and EW will get to 3NT quickly|pg||
nt|afulton: 2@s?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S and a minor 5-5 weak|pg||
nt|afulton: opens door for perfect takeout x|pg||
mb|4S|nt|westjava: 4@H or 3NT EW is ok now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hardly perfect|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but has strength for 1N opener so can't be that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not for interrupt but for interested persons: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
nt|allanr44: If west bid 7NT north may lead H   :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East could still try 6 now but it's a gamble|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@D DONT?|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D, @D and M..?|pg||
nt|jcwla: game values, no @S stopper, and no 4 @H's I'd guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 3@D = Good Trump Bad Point explained by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@S on the way...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice treatment  Assume 2N is @S raise so DBL for takeout|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's a pretty good 3NT with the overcall though 5C is a bit better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2N puppet to 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: Arline, my guess is she meant to be talking to me |pg||
nt|afulton: they make 4|pg||
nt|raghavan: EW have found a fit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|afulton: ok ladies, claim and next hand :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how did W "guess" the minor :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  Clubs don't break so 7NT is out :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: true|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North must bid 6S now|pg||
nt|idblu: @D and @S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|westjava: August,I think|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 3S is just a stopper-ask rather than a lebensohlish thing failing to deliver a fourth heart|pg||
nt|jcwla: Probably right, in any case all roads have led to 3NT.|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT is easy on a black suit lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: because S bid 3C|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|westjava: so,I dont like ur 3@C pd,S said...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or West's 1@C opening :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: good judgement|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,S will bid 4@S if his hand @CAxxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think i'd try @D3 lead - but don't really like any choices|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been hard by the 12 if S runned one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or if North had short @H then try 4@S|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Rodal:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yup it's Ogust, named after Harold Ogust|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from convention card, i think 2@D= 1-suit  @H/@S|pg||
nt|woozle: or maybe not...spade to Q, diamond up, South winning the king, another spade to kill East's hand|pg||
nt|woozle: diamonds still blocked...likely to go down|pg||
nt|afulton: because it was as you said... showed weak opener with @S + minor |pg||
nt|raghavan: SK |pg||
pc|dK|nt|afulton: when South bid 3@c, west assumed the minor was @d|pg||
nt|afulton: since @d ARE a girl's best friend!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Play trump |pg||
pc|dT|nt|patricck: the 3NT tells Nunn there is stuff wasted in @H, but he has such a nice hard it is difficult to give up there|pg||
pc|d7|nt|westjava: sry,Ogust:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Par contract achieved - well done|pg||
nt|idblu: but E bypassed his S!'s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just behinde Lillik:)|pg||
nt|patricck: oops....nice hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: In case we were wondering whether N would ever show his long suit. :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: N to play Trump|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idblu: @H's|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Operation successful...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who hates leads away from Jack so much -- he complains even when it is right!!|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D isn't as good as 6@C, because the @D losers could have been discarded on AKQ@S, probably both were doomed tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because likes hands if partner has @H   i.e. 2@S=pass/correct|pg||
nt|raghavan: reduce the ruffing |pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: can either set up @c or use cross ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: previous board : 3@H was not so bad, super accepting can actually make slam bidding harder, since you dont hear partners natural bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, that 27-point 2NT making 3 was worth 6 to Australia and we're tied through five comparisons.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nigel_k:  No problem for declarer here. Certainly easier than 3NT so good judgment by East|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|westjava: ahaaa...so do I Al|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Martin:)|pg||
nt|idblu: OK...some specs sugg that|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can ruff 2 Spades and twice finesse Clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|idblu: I don't play that :(|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|westjava: 1 imp gain to Japan   20|pg||
nt|mariner1: I too do not like those, especially low from a J if p did not bid or imply the suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence from East because her spade spots mean the suit can't be run if she switches and partner has an entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have used 4@C cue to show slam interest over 3@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: A much more competitive (sense a theme?) OR auction on 19 ended in the same place, 3@H making for a push.|pg||
nt|raghavan: He should have played immediately after SA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nigel_k:  Best play is probably to start with KS as West is more likely than East to be void|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would lead and also play trumps|pg||
nt|afulton: i visited Macau back in 1989... beautiful country!|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately it gives away the 12th trick here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just anoter flat board :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nigel_k:  Doesn't matter if they're 2-1 of course|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|westjava: agree Rob|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: West did imply @H with DBL|pg||
pc|s7|nt|westjava: good trump means 4@H :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Now diamond, overtaken, diamond jack, spade exit for down one|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you bid 4@H over 3@D you also cause an issue to N since S has 4 keys and Q@H|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|mariner1: when p bids transfer to @H your hand is game level automatically|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|westjava: but at a minimum 5@H over 3@S, again from M...meesage, I have everything to cue|pg||

nt|haans: soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: coffee board coming up|pg||

nt|henryb: except N got there first!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf there also 1HX -1 = 200|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N = both minors weak|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting "but not forcing to game" |pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: on Board 16 Versace found the lead of @SA and gave a ruff = 6@D -1 - but 12 IMPs for Salokin-team|pg||
nt|raghavan: May reach slam in H|pg||
nt|panja: 6@H 6@C for NS, but in 6@S...EW might not do badly...3 down for 500 instead of -1430?|pg||
nt|fann4: OR  2@C-2@D; 3@C-3@H; 6@H|pg||

nt|mcarroll: As usual Zia did not hang around in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: good to try something different|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by NS is best,but hard to reach|pg||
nt|raghavan: In ACBL tourneys, Convention cards are published in advance - Here I tried the website - could not go beyond the names of countries |pg||
nt|raghavan: will S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|murat: or Dbl maybe|pg||
nt|april7: if S bids 2NT then N will give him ofcourse the 3d|pg||
nt|murat: dbl would be no sense actually|pg||
nt|april7: the question also is whether N can have a 4card @S suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They are in 4@H in Open|pg||
nt|werge: Not any longer...|pg||
nt|haans: thay have  5@C  profitable|pg||
nt|werge: How many boards the full distance?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 14 this segment|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 14 later on|pg||
mb|2S|nt|charles_l: N must XX?|pg||
nt|panja: W is not very tolerant though, he wants to have his say in the matter|pg||
nt|athene: pretty boring 3nt here with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be unlikely to sell out to 2@S sitting East|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D now perhaps all end|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D looks negative one except you are forced to play the @DA|pg||
nt|haans: singel K again :)|pg||
nt|haans: more likely 4@S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the losers will be eliminated tonight|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the winners move on to the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|petere: North thinking of slam ... or ordering a coffee ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May not get there|pg||
nt|danilo1: I very do not like 2@S (despite as I know Kowalsky-Romansky, they play it constructive) ... had much too good for (especially non-voulnerable) weak-two|pg||
nt|haans: mostly weak 2 do not show 7 cards|pg||
mb|3D|nt|milton_se: but will Henner resist the spades?|pg||
nt|april7: now we hav e it|pg||
nt|werge: A BIG 2 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3N makes with @S 4 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may mean @D + 1 more|pg||
nt|mcarroll: He just bid 5@D not redbl|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and flat boards are not what they need|pg||
nt|werge: Prefer coffee|pg||
nt|haans: clubs 3-1 do not like that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: To get 40 imps in 6 boards is a very tough ask|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb: even so, I think two aces is too mich opposite 2@c not to be trying for if not driving to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: again, W's pass looks timid|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||
nt|ady: likely tgo end 3NT   or 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT shows 22/23 balanced|pg||
nt|raghavan: I feel VUL overcall of 2C should be good suit go for 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: not a really hilarious match |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@H can be beaten with a spade ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to late to bid @H now|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Welland Welland wont play there|pg||
nt|ahh: nothing much in this 1 for Sweden to cheer |pg||
nt|werge: 3 x @D´s is bad for declarer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
mb|4D|nt|wwalter: payback time :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
nt|milton_se: now she should|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 2@d shows some values, they play 2@H as a double negative. Not that anything matters on this hand.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I assume E is thinking, not N|pg||
nt|werge: Match might get closer...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry my eyes did deceive me they were one board ahead of this table|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c is not so easy to defeat|pg||
nt|raghavan: Talf - I agree it should be more down Both rooms defense was noy perfecr|pg||
nt|rnc: It looks like the previous match, where down 3 was more or less an average result :)|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @S is sold for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=796&qphase=32&qroundno=1|pg||
nt|don paulus: trump promotion :)|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Not a single Flat board so far , however unidirectional , good going herbst :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: that would be law going too far|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR declarer played a spade towards the queen to create the entry to take the losing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c seems to be a transfer to @d|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h is down a lot, and with partner opening, South may double|pg||
nt|xenya: being pretty certain NS will bid game in OR|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  -  Swiss A Round 6 running scores|pg||
nt|mariner1: Denmark 17  Harangozo 2  3 boards to score in other match|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some here|pg||
nt|xenya: can't see how it can be made -- but quite a few variations here|pg||
nt|fann4: it seems clear to ask for aces.|pg||
nt|haans: i had expected EW to bid|pg||
nt|panja: South will have to take a shot, too much science might be counterproductive|pg||
nt|werge: So 130 for Nederland|pg||
nt|haans: yes i found a couple of aces |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@C a popular contract this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: will need some ood views and maybe some pressure play for this one to roll in|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 5@C is hardly profitable when it costs 500|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt slaminvite no singel?|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT is the second-last bid, I would make with the North-hand, only pass is worse|pg||
nt|sybarra: may be a slim chance here if n/s do not get to slam |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Opps pushed them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||
nt|wwalter: after this board will come a friendly chat on EW :)|pg||
nt|april7: 10 easy tricks ready for claim|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2NT wont make either...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: therefore trying 3NT :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S + 3@H + 2@D + 3@C = 9|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@D + 3aces = 6|pg||
nt|haans: you may seee it that way 2 :))|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh very favourable lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: E really doesnt have a good lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: J of @H maybe |pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: help from the enemy|pg||
nt|danilo1: West is helping ... maybe he should consider North's probably not very fast pass ... 3@D is for me risky action|pg||
nt|haans: first pass then 3@D many used that as weak 3@D|pg||
nt|danilo1: * very fast 2@H= NEG.|pg||
nt|haans: then nok (i think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Hauge now leads the other semifinal 60-50 with (i think) 5 boards to compare|pg||
nt|ritong: 3Nt = i do not like @ss|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|daman: A @C will|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am going to back Michel to make this one|pg||
nt|kurtove: he may try to get entry on qsp, but will go -1 then|pg||
nt|haans: looks natural|pg||
nt|henryb: everything|pg||
nt|star6ija: interesting case of misreading at page 20 of http://eurobridge.org/bulletin/09_1%20Sanremo/pdf/Bul_08.pdf|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so we need 15 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|werge: They WILL not - they allready did it...|pg||
nt|mariner1: transportation and a lack of winners is the issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: duck @c lead @c lead small @D helps, double dummy though it is|pg||
nt|rnc: South must be delighted (and surprised) seeing partner bid @Hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: east had difficult choice of leads but i would have unimaginatively advanced my fourth best spade|pg||
nt|ahh: so this will be a dot board   or 1 imp at most |pg||
nt|raghavan: How did OR manage to make 10 tricks -Martin / Hanns|pg||
nt|haans: go to MOVIE click on Open |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
nt|ady: lay down A@H    and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now no cue bid of Clubs so stopped probably|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a better contract than 4@c|pg||
nt|haans: thats all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||
nt|charles_l: lots down here|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is cold, but uptricks are heavy at that point  so she considers the best way to gather a max of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: but who would lead that?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Full resault service from the Open Europeian Championship. Bookmark it: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: note that North's @CQ, @DK are useful, but hard to find in bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S should be the "big" bid |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this can be made|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is nice judgement... option for 6 IMPs back|pg||
nt|rnc: The @H-discard and the @H8 is telling bad news|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the 8@H does not warm E's heart much|pg||
nt|rnc: :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: not winning that @c in dummy also cost a trick in tempo|pg||
nt|xenya: it does look like a complex hand?|pg||
nt|fann4: There is talk that in the OR they may be playing control responses to 2@C - hence the leap to 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  off they go |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: @c lead?|pg||
nt|pelu: they play a lot of tranfers after takeout X - so it looklike trandfer here also|pg||
nt|newmoon: good tenaces in dummy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same in Open|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamond lead looks very dangerous to me|pg||
nt|werge: Even without the promotion only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|buddyshah: @D 2 anyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|april7: everycard except K of @D is ok|pg||
nt|don paulus: if you know for sure your p had 2 @d to start with|pg||
nt|don paulus: signal low - high = 2 ( 4 ?)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: she might try leading @H9|pg||
nt|athene: or leading small to @H10|pg||
nt|athene: that still gives time to lead to @HK later|pg||
nt|wwalter: I hope the chairs will not fly :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment if you play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|milton_se: this needs some help -- doubt that he'll get it|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has nothing to discard on the 9@d when it becomes good|pg||
nt|hedyg: should lose 1@d, 1@c and 2@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how he can avoid it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What does E expect from his partner? the X over 3@c is silly with so bad majors|pg||
nt|henryb: he expects partner to have half the missing points|pg||
nt|werge: I would have "unblocked" the @D K from dummy, can´t hurt|pg||
nt|panja: well. N could have @SKQ |pg||
nt|rnc: There will be a quick claim soon|pg||
nt|sharkey: Behrens didn't fancy leading from @SJ - may players share his view in leading from Jxxx|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@s +1 last board so 6 imps to U'Rourke|pg||
nt|lestergold: leading from an unbid four card major seems normal to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: leading ronm a three card minor to the ace much less attractive to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but the lead is from Jxxx  which most of us hate|pg||
nt|lestergold: usually gives declarer a tempo if not a trick because hes likely to be wanting to srt up tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you know N is prepared for a @S lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: we all hate it shirley but sometimes that is the lead you are dealt|pg||
nt|haans: many of us do not like p to lead from Jxxx (not us) :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Yes me to but I think Bertens listened to Levins 3NT and think he has good @ss|pg||
nt|raghavan: Good AN Shirley and Hans - sorry for late - I was held up in Macau tourney|pg||
nt|haans: did u win?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not being a results merchant but it happens to be the best lead on the hand in pfractice|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rag |pg||
nt|sharkey: Declare has his work cut out here as it appears @D lead actually may set up W's @D8|pg||
nt|haans: bridge has been fun here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I don't like this line at all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Why if they ruff you down in 4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt bid of value if slaminvite|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You have 10 certain tricks if hearts break no worse than 3-1|pg||
nt|werge: Was 3 NT alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|Walddk5: spade ruff, D to the ace, spade ruff|pg||
nt|haans: no alert we heard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Don't you deserve that when you don't draw one round of trumps at IMPs?|pg||
nt|petere: yessssssss but in another board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Arline I just joined the cant count club, lots pointing out to me - correctly - we have 7 boards left not 6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|don paulus: 1 @c strong - then ok|pg||
nt|henryb: which would be about 6 of them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only card from E is now @sQ |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now it´s expensive if N finds the @h shift|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in same spot here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Haans|pg||
nt|ahh: hoping either red suit splits 3 3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: thats ok Martin,  I have been member for sometime |pg||
nt|werge: In OR same contract, but very fast 3 x @D|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb: Allix amazingly passive. I wonder what Neve would have done with the @dQ in addition|pg||
nt|athene: they probably play that you complete the transfer with any weak NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I hope they do not play odd even discards|pg||
nt|panja: and less @H's|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: hmm|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not this way but???|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: I win|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N might have made it easier for S by doubling 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||
nt|athene: it gives up the legitimate play in the suit of @HQx / @HJx with east|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: this might give west time to get his long spade set up|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence take @CA, @S, three hearts|pg||
nt|haans: u sure do|pg||
nt|milton_se: if 1NT is 12-14, North is certainly worth 4C|pg||
nt|april7: preparing a squeeze which doesn't exist|pg||
nt|newmoon: who said a 10 counts for no points?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but Welland leading a spade|pg||
nt|afulton: >expresso to Martin|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: the defence can actually stop declarer ducking a club into east's hand with certainty|pg||
nt|athene: west goes in with @CJ if declarer leads low from hand and east plays @C10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: but of course everything works for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: she may have a nasty moment but she can't go down :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she's thinking about discard|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauri-Versace bid and maded 5@Cs on board 17 = +6IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: With this lead makes 6|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|jeanhari: oeps|pg||
nt|haans: i am right :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it|pg||
nt|haans: still long way|pg||
nt|haans: boring|pg||
nt|ahh: if they switched to @C  has to depend on @D 3 3 |pg||
nt|afulton: But stop and think... how many imps swap hands in average match? |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|werge: Stiff @C King by North was tried - no lucky decision this time|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you mean wellan gets closer to 50 imps?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: almost all routes go to 500|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that woulod mean 12 to welland|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: im saying its not bad in theory because your long spade figures to be a trick |pg||
nt|sharkey: nice duck!|pg||
nt|raghavan: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sharkey: N actually played @D&??|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: It was obvious that E held the ace so it doesn't cost anything playing the 6... just an extra chance, E doesn't have any entrance anyway|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans why there is no movement in the screen?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they think |pg||
nt|haans: usually claiming time|pg||
nt|sybarra: Levin thinking |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|raghavan: He has not come to claim time - He has to get 3 H tricks, 2S+DK+CA|pg||
nt|haans: hard thinking|pg||
nt|haans: @C10?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course Levin doesn't know @S finesse is working|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|nubmaster: He sees only 8 trick at this moment|pg||
nt|afulton: while the end result may be close, it is often 50-80 or more|pg||
nt|joemanjo: per deal?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jeanhari: south could know there was not much chance for north to have 3 spades, which he needs if switching to a spade|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but easy to see from the sidelines|pg||
nt|haans: south did not know they had 4-4 in hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: pity why N does not continue - declarer does it now |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|star6ija: no difference between 150 and 130|pg||
nt|haans: and double finesse in @H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|davidstern: With a spade through he would again have to cash the @DA|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d to cut the communications|pg||
pc|s5|nt|davidstern: Claim -1?|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprise may be corrected|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so another 2 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can make it now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: i think "strong but not forcing to game" means something lice Acol 2, Shirley -- in this case |pg||
nt|raghavan: He may A Heart |pg||
nt|xenya: is he about to make it now?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|milton_se: over now -- down|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace was actually on his way to slam but Lauria pulled the emergency brakes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To beat 4@d W has to lead a @d to duck|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @H pitch cost|pg||
nt|xenya: once he got a @D trick?|pg||
nt|afulton: not per deal, per match... we win 12, we lose 12... that =24 imps on table|pg||
pc|d8|nt|oliverc: not likely to either, given the 1@S bid from West. Even if on slim values, West likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: have either the J or Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: He rectified the count trying for 11 tricks instead of 10|pg||
nt|henryb: cash the @sA and exit the third club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still I think your analysis is correct - South should return a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: note the careful play of @SJ..caters to AT9x with West|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: W might keep the @D Q10|pg||
nt|werge: That might cost 5 IMPs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: and as always better to play AFTER :))|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but west being balanced, not bidding @H (with 2@S/3@H)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: would u X on the Westhand or bid 2@S - D + 2@S gave East hope of game|pg||
nt|hedyg: now can go -2 with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for 2@S bid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: as predicted|pg||
nt|athene: of course objectively this wasn't best because east "should" cover with @HJxx|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1100 and blood all over the carpet|pg||
nt|wwalter: Massimo pls tell us how is @@ the table now? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: @d now for 'only' 800, ty specs|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: E is like a fish out of water .............O look for a miracle :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ultimately he will|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree that Easts D over 3@d was not so good|pg||
nt|werge: We must admit, that for several minutes, West has been able to take 8 tricks...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb: I think it is very hard to pass that hand over 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: also good|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: pitching @S from hand on the third diamond has committed her|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry no she only needs one spade|pg||
nt|athene: she can still take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if scared that west has the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: @D2 (if honest) would indicate that|pg||
nt|athene: but i am sure west is good enough to falsecard there with @SK and NOT @CQJx|pg||
nt|haans: jean was correct yes was|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|ahh: his last shot comes home |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: but his partner will take that for majors - or?|pg||
nt|haans: RIGHT U R|pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: oh oh|pg||
nt|sybarra: not 8 of hts?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: is this for real??? kinda lots of errors here...|pg||
nt|danilo1: no need double finesse, 100% (end play)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: lot of errors in this match|pg||
nt|nubmaster: what?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Probably tired|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower claiming last 2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: she will be very annoyed with herself to go down in this|pg||
nt|charles_l: 800 a bargain - could be 1400|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: she mentioned in her book how she woke at 3am one night realising she misplayed a hand even though she made it!|pg||
nt|athene: so this one will cause even more torment :(|pg||
nt|athene: it would be so nice to have that machine from the movie "Men in Black" to wipe one's memory after a misplayed bridge hand|pg||
nt|haans: what?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|raghavan: ok curtains|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that immediate overcalls of 3@c and 3@d should be for the majors and double shows a strong balanced hand, the second double a stronger balanced hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Score now showing 4@H in OR??|pg||
mc|10|nt|rnc: Two boards and Herbst is a 'big' lead|pg||
pg||
qx|o23|st||md|1SQJT5H5D865CAJ653,S7643HJ76DQ743CQ9,SA982HAKT42DK9CT4,SKHQ983DAJT2CK872|sv|b|nt|idblu: part score e/w here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  This should be a routine game - it needs AC onside but there are ample values to bid it|pg||
nt|woozle: Easy game for EW..slam may be tempting but will certainly fail if played by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Making 5 for a push board.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a slam NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: another part score, who gets to 1N 1st|pg||
nt|westjava: again part score hand now|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't know if W can bid 3H as a raise here...maybe he doesn't know either|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: yes, 20 vs 20|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt a bid other than 4 @H a super accept,  such as 3 @S?|pg||
nt|westjava: nice to discuss...|pg||
nt|afulton: well, i think playing against the toughest competition and studying where you went astray helps to make one better|pg||
nt|raghavan: After alond time NS getting a good deal|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 could be void @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: E very quiet with their 5 5|pg||
nt|idblu: 1@C strong....dbl prob 4-7 or some such|pg||
nt|jcwla: uh oh|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: I would play it that way Shirley|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sneak attack time.|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT is an odd choice...now the spotlight is on North|pg||
nt|woozle: If I were to bid 3NT, I'd rather show a spade raise first|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 2@H is reasonable too|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@C rebid 1nt = 18-19,but he has 17 only..?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  This one should be an uneventful 4S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as was other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2nt=inv 3@D=suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Presumably 2NT is because West had thoughts of slam|pg||
nt|afulton: with my partners, i like an agreement where bid of 3@s = I have very positive accept + useful doubleton (in this case, probably ace) |pg||
nt|sybarra: not the "loviest" 5/5 |pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who said 18-19?|pg||
nt|idblu: 5th @C = 1point|pg||
nt|afulton: is the 1@c bid strong opener?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|patricck: The 2@H opening is too rich even for my blood, but it must be what South expected otherwise it would have been impossible to stop. A shame since game does make|pg||
nt|woozle: North aims straight for the newspaper columns and ends up on the cutting room floor|pg||
nt|jcwla: trying to pin stiff @HQ in dummy - matchpoint top there for e/w|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't much like the HK lead, partly because catching a bare queen might not be enough to hurt the contract anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 2@H now trf to 2@S oppss...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer just needs to take care to ruff high on the third diamond|pg||
nt|afulton: if so, I am surprised with 15 count in south, she didn't stop to consider slam |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Include me out.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when you open without opening values you wind up in theses contracts which seldom make|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is a no chance game|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: the older suit win:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess not :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and E is very RED|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N open = 14-16, so Shen shows 17-18|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 2 unsupported Kings and an Ace, WHY would you open?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lung will loose the first 4 tricks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: ok|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: 3@S punishing partner for balancing|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|mariner1: very RED = they are VUL and Opponents are NV|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: especially with 4@H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence playing hearts|pg||
nt|afulton: which btw, will make |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|westjava: again,3@H trf to 3@S opps:)|pg||
nt|afulton: 6@c looks odds on here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary u said slam - they made 6|pg||
nt|afulton: 6N works, but is a bit riskier|pg||
nt|raghavan: He said open chat " Here is a slam for NS|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|westjava: 2 imps gain to Indonesia from   6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HJ as lavental?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This is going to get them all the matchpoints|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  Not only South can ruff but declarer will be cut off from dummy's hearts after drawing trumps|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has underbid is my opinion - It does not show 11 points -1A+2K and 3 cd support|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nigel_k:  That's better|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Was a free signal from N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difficult decision at trick 1 -- especially since declarer is supposed to hold 5@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Aint with u there Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think driving force should have been -- it looks like @C running |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i actually agree with call for @HJ|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,and what decl thinking about?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South should be curious about North overtake to return trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if singleton - why not try to promote partner's length, if doubleton, then must have control of @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer also thinks @C finesse not working??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|patricck: down here at the bottom of the world the blood rushes to our heads Jordan :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The nine was an unnecessary risk but still high enough as West has the 10|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@H is one thing, 3 is another.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: ? hardly underbid, he opened on nothing for a statr|pg||
nt|raghavan: and on 3H South should pass having minimum|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: You're just THAT sure that this hand is producing 9 and 9 only tricks, that the "chance" (I'd say expectation) of 300 extra points is not worth risking 50 for an undertrick?|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome to Rodal from Norway|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Hi all delayed at tournament sorry @H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|westjava: hi Gary,npp..:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: hi Liliek|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|nigel_k:  Now three spade losers as declarer can't reach the hearts and has to play spades himself|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  Ttring to rmember what clubs have gone|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|nigel_k:  Yes they have all gone :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: i don't see how south's trump holding should affect north's play|pg||

nt|wwalter: W should say vwdp :), as declar :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: He still slepping since 10 o'clock:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like it Vlad |pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand could be trouble  |pg||
nt|athene: dclarer under far less pressure in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: after weak-2@S opener and club lead :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I have to go now see you all soon|pg||
nt|kurtove: cu|pg||
nt|haans: nice meeting you david|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal push|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 7 push|pg||
nt|oliverc: true. nothing lost, anyway|pg||
nt|newmoon: as the cards lie, 6-level in a red suit makeable|pg||
nt|haans: slam? they need it|pg||
nt|raghavan: What for this 1400> As E I would pass 2NT bid and see what S bids|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good reward for his enterprise|pg||
nt|haans: yes and fun bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session|pg||
nt|xenya: and another good score for Herbst from OR|pg||
nt|rnc: Two boards to go|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|rnc: Another slam, this time for EW|pg||
nt|haans: once again + zone|pg||
nt|panja: this is often a dilemma for bidding with fits..if you bid too slowly, opps come in, if you bid too fast, you lose the scientific base|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - same result = no swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or ready for lunch |pg||
nt|haans: or both|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: heres another 5 level contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: He made only 9 How in other room +1?|pg||
nt|ahh: ok  to score in 1s if 14 boards left |pg||
nt|petere: trump now brings 1 IMP ... (?)|pg||
nt|petere: could have, should have, did not :(|pg||
nt|haans: i think they were claiming|pg||
nt|werge: Claiming is a good tactic|pg||
nt|haans: sure is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Early and often|pg||
nt|petere: why? could can't manage revokes on BBO !!|pg||
nt|petere: you can'|pg||
nt|haans: never with only three cards continue is quicker|pg||
nt|werge: Now 9|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 1st Flat board|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lucky:)|pg||
nt|werge: For psychological reasons, Texan Aces need 1½-2 swing in the last five boards|pg||
nt|danilo1: he prefered guess vs end play :)|pg||
nt|haans: ok ok ok they made you nid 4@S |pg||
nt|haans: hard to understand|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S is ok|pg||
nt|danilo1: a bit agressive 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Neve closing in on win|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 14+ f1|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deals 16, 17, 18 1ll push - same in OR too|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Let us see how S bids and N responds|pg||
nt|april7: E might bid @S over @H from N,but as I see S bids @S|pg||
nt|jeanhari: another chance here for some points|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|rnc: both tables open 1@D, the slight differens Rodwell did it as North|pg||
nt|xenya: i think EW may well get to 4@H now |pg||
nt|werge: The US-team opens 1 @D at both tables!!!|pg||
nt|xenya: and if they do, they are likely to make it|pg||
nt|rnc: Both teams were tied for 31th before the previous board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that didnot go down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: slam but 2 finesses|pg||
nt|raghavan: 16 IMPs lost|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer could have done better|pg||
nt|mariner1: penultimate board of this session|pg||

nt|haans: if a) open @C b) overcall 1@D c) find 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: expected time for next match 12:15 (ialy time) |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 10 to be precise|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Zia is also on the Welland team, but he is not a morning person. Roy (West) playing with his wife, Christal Henner-Welland, in this match. She is also a strong player|pg||

nt|fann4: OR  1@C (3@S) 6@H (6@S); dbl all pass|pg||
nt|haans: 6@S what does bid mean now|pg||
nt|fann4: This 4NT looks like ordinary Blackwood perhaps. Many would play it as quantitive.|pg||
nt|haans: not on the net i assure you|pg||
nt|fann4: 6@s dbled going for 1100|pg||
nt|panja: good idea, but there has to be something for Aces...also...E hasn't checked about Spade values....W could come up with !Kxx..and there would be no slam|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm sure that this EW pair know exactly what 4NT means in this sequence.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: If he played so nice by ducking @d and then failed like this...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Have Levin/Hamson played together previously Shirley?|pg||
nt|werge: Duty calling... hi|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C gf relay|pg||
nt|haans: ok not to make it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: 3Nt should be played from S hand here..to protect the @HK|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam on 21 in OR either|pg||
nt|sybarra: that double game swing will haunt then |pg||
nt|davidstern: Results can be found at http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm|pg||
nt|davidstern: And you Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: @HKx favourably placed, and @D's 3-3.   But will he... ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 14 top tricks on the @d finesse|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3NT by S makes|pg||
nt|ahh: east might double for the lead  if he can |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: B22: lead @HQ = 9 toptricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: *them|pg||
nt|xenya: they got to 5N there though|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.2 sekund faster :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are fast!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Murat|pg||
nt|murat: i wish i knew.. :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: wonderful hand - Grand slam in H with 1 finesse . So atleast 6 H must be bid let us see|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will bid 4 now|pg||
nt|aupillon: French open doesn't|pg||
nt|haans: they have slam but no trumps|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... but here possible too .. depens on North .. 2 or 3@S over 1S|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|danilo1: for me only 2@S (missing 1 point for 3) :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: good news for allix|pg||
nt|ritong: he sweated just two seconds|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|milton_se: will probably make after some battle|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is nice to have a known person by our side|pg||
nt|oliverc: It's like watching Klingons bidding :)|pg||
nt|murat: i got an answer from the audince "diams. +4 +11 hcp"|pg||
nt|april7: if 2@C is not forcing, why doesn't S pass|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|haans: diamond???|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like only red aces for E/W|pg||
nt|MolvaM: slam would have been good if @cQ would be inside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score may be another flat board|pg||
nt|haans: i bid 3@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: u win 9 out of 10 .)|pg||
nt|april7: very odd bidding|pg||
nt|murat: i guess NS is a Polish pair which i know nothing about them|pg||
nt|henryb: it is a 5 or 7 hand on a club lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if not vulnerable, I had bid 1@d as W, but now - no|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H still a make|pg||
nt|star6ija: no, correct defense will defeat it|pg||
nt|raghavan: well that settles - S may pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C being Puppet for 5 card Major I assume|pg||
nt|haans: double relays are not proper|pg||
nt|buddyshah: other table 3N -1 |pg||
nt|don paulus: pass ?|pg||
nt|werge: Luck for E/W, that they can play in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: would you raise?|pg||
nt|ritong: or try no trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets guess ( nothing in CC) that 2NT asks for force|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Hedy / when 2@H ) GF / then 2NT forcing >(>(|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tobias - is this team in a chance for reaching SF > If u feel so, send me the file  Editor@@BridgeIndia.com  |pg||
nt|april7: a nice @C contract going down the drain|pg||
nt|jeanhari: and miss vuln game|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@C keeps them low but not in best spot|pg||
nt|fann4: Anyone know what 5@D means.|pg||
nt|fann4: Shows you what know:)|pg||
nt|haans: if 4nt quant 5@D natural|pg||
nt|panja: 4-card suit..|pg||
nt|panja: the pause suggests there is some gap in understanding|pg||
nt|haans: i have suggestions 4NT = nat or minor|pg||
nt|haans: did 3@C show 4@H only?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and by north|pg||
nt|haans: yes some play puppet |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 11 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but not today|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3NT by N beauty other 3 suits J and 10 are there to support|pg||
nt|haans: i was one double in 4@H relay play 4@H xx +2|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: strong club and negative - now is 1@H any 20+?|pg||
nt|panja: S made it very easy, ok if 1@S is limited|pg||
nt|charles_l: S shows she can psyche 1@d too|pg||
nt|panja: if 1@S could be stronger, NS could easily lose a 6@C slam|pg||
nt|athene: now Allerton gets a chance to make his second rebid :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Three bids on the 11 count?  No.|pg||
nt|athene: but he declines it|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't think 2@D shows extras in that position|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt sort of limited your hand?|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like a flat board|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d relay again|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play low|pg||
nt|milton_se: AD and D -- let them play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Develop a D trick may play A and small D|pg||
nt|haans: slam here is desperado bridge|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 27 - 4C down here OR 3S-2  gain of 5 IMP to Apteker|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5 or 7! with a @c lead  there is no slam|pg||
nt|aupillon: oui|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead agin helps declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andrei Varlan|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead = expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or perhaps 4+ hearts, forcing, á la Meckwell|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10 fast, but could be 11 :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 11 on this lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't like N's sequence here. |pg||
nt|ady: thats the winning bid by west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: 3NT is possible, don't think you have a raise|pg||
nt|ritong: well it is a matter of @d length with east, i think|pg||
nt|ritong: suppose east has two @ds, it probably will be better in @s|pg||
nt|ady: needs an accurate defence to beat 4 spades if leading clubs   msut not play 3rd club   or will later be end played  after trumps drawn and a diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming south does not hold six|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT is the logical contract|pg||
nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|haans: And I would also like to thank Dr. Raghavan, Momchil Aleksandrov and Sid Ismail my  co-commentator |pg||
nt|haans: And of course all you KIBITZERS  for watching We trust you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @d finess fails|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The failure to bid 4@H (on the same auction) at the other table is very surprising|pg||
nt|jeanhari: stronge comeback from Welland|pg||
nt|haans: looks well for game|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, the layout is friendly, but the bidding tells you that - the spade finesse will work, as will the clubs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding and lead in Open|pg||
nt|haans: this is a boring board|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello all |pg||
nt|MolvaM: safe stop by garner-henner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi andrei|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S is in 4@H in Open|pg||
nt|haans: no slam now|pg||
nt|sybarra: same lead as in the OR|pg||
nt|afulton: couple of ways to make 10 tricks... after you find that @s are friendly (J is marked finesse), duck @c and that breaks nicely|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lots of tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showed Diamonds|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C? - who knows|pg||
nt|star6ija: no... this @h 8 with e is an obstacle|pg||
nt|daman: the pain of missing a vul game will not go away too quickly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Andreai|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|haans: @S @H squeeze?|pg||
nt|danilo1: I came to 16 Distributional .. and need 17 for 3>@S :)|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but A & K|pg||
nt|danilo1: probable Dble by South|pg||
nt|haans: gave it an extra p|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and into the soup we go  |pg||
nt|henryb: Only one of the four pairs on vg managed to reach even 6@c|pg||
nt|dcbutler: but doesn't E rate to be short in diamonds?|pg||
nt|raghavan: we both thought the same|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 7 with the @d finesse working, 5 otherwise unless the clubs are 6-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: They  are heading for slam|pg||
nt|daman: N was almost worth a xx|pg||
nt|rnc: I think North is halfway to a heart attack now|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C puppet is Bergen style|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello Murat :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|charles_l: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|wwalter: a fast claim now :)|pg||
nt|ady: good result for Badger|pg||
nt|haans: board 10 will decide :)))|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks  possible, but normally 11 |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans one more deal is there apart from this |pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx all, and hope the kibs enjoyed this session.   Motto: "Capitalize on opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: with S*|pg||
nt|haans: yes good trumps :)|pg||
nt|haans: youi never never know what relayer have|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans can u tell me why S should not bid 2S (showing 6cds and minimum opening instead 2H)|pg||
nt|ahh: this contract ok  |pg||
nt|petere: 4@H against 6-0 ... what a nice story ;-)|pg||
nt|werge: Too hot in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S was no make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: ok 1@H natural F1 by the look of it|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light opener, ok.  1NT rebid, the misdescription starts.  Passing 2@C carries the connotation you're fine defending that, again, not my cup of tea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 4 imps for Neve|pg||
nt|athene: should make this even if he tries to drop @CKx with north|pg||
nt|star6ija: let us see anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: yes indeed passing 3@H deserves a loss|pg||
nt|jeanhari: play still interesting...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: north think a lot on this turn of 10|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H 1 suiter of hearts as second suit|pg||
nt|raghavan: There is no 2nd suit|pg||
nt|haans: not this time|pg||
nt|haans: 21D may have a minor|pg||
nt|haans: what an error|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Quite an achievement|pg||
nt|petere: @Hs wrong sided opened|pg||
pc|h5|nt|murat: i'm having some informations.. Polish pair was a part of Polish Bermuda Bowl team last year..|pg||
nt|raghavan: which finess to take|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, South leapt straight to 6@S, but that was after his pard bid 3@S over 1@C, not a strong NT.|pg||
nt|haans: do u think all do u know?|pg||
nt|sharkey: showing?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you agree with 3@s?|pg||
nt|buddyshah: this will make or 1 OT|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: then everything else natural|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brgpro: sorry, was away|pg||
nt|raghavan: same by declarer too!!!|pg||
nt|milton_se: As did South|pg||
nt|raghavan: W has to play Spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is so 6-1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: what finesse to take after being in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: well another swing to Herbst, they are on a roll|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - such boards schould be cancelled|pg||
nt|haans: talk about that very long ago|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They certainly played it fast in Open|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, looks like 14|pg||
nt|afulton: boards, that is|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s5|nt|pelu: they have all cards / but missing 2 Aces / so they will stop|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s was Blackwood, 5@d is two key cards without the @hQ|pg||
nt|daman: unless 3@C shows this hand|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|brgpro: she went down...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spades I would think|pg||
nt|rnc: The only good thing for NS is that 4@C is making while 3NT wasn't. |pg||
nt|sybarra: asking 5 card major |pg||
pc|h2|nt|dcbutler: fortunate the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|milton_se: y and E has to play 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Going good till now for S - should start on trumps now|pg||
nt|daman: if so, I would have ventured 3NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: game force |pg||
pc|d5|nt|milton_se: hasn't this relay sequence made clear that 2 aces are missing??|pg||
nt|raghavan: Knowing their system will help in good commenting by us|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now N can see 5 or 7|pg||
nt|jeanhari: to much soft valuas, like redbl more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: north said 4@c is forcing and south ........pass :)|pg||
nt|haans: asking for 5 card or strong four carder|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - I wud have bid Stayman I guess...|pg||
nt|sybarra: on N?? |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, She ran @h9...that needs @h8 on side and one of the @hQJ, less chance than playing @h to the K i think|pg||
nt|athene: well, given time declarer can come to three hearts, three clubs, @SK, @DAK|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they know, they play turbo and Fantoni has shown 1 keycard|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that most of the relays are distribution and HCP / not Aces|pg||
nt|haans: you really know a lot hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT over 4@s would have shown an even nr of keycards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would have gone 4@s myself at these colors|pg||
nt|haans: happy soon|pg||
nt|april7: I think that E is too weak for this bid, beca,use it asks for @H lead and should have a better suit and more points,its a penalty X|pg||
nt|werge: YES!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|milton_se: better use for controls than hcp, I'd say|pg||
nt|star6ija: all was gone|pg||
nt|haans: once i did open 2@D 3rd with 4 carder only way for them to go down |pg||
nt|petere: @Ds will squeeze dummy first|pg||
nt|haans: @C to A |pg||
nt|haans: endplaying W|pg||
nt|petere: 11 tricks, 1 IMP|pg||
nt|werge: Match even closer then|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: defence should make at least 6 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If that finesse loses, you should hopefully be able to ruff a spade to try the heart finesse next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West will be very unhappy about that trick|pg||
nt|daman: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @S holding brings this one home with the up trick |pg||
nt|afulton: yes, the showout by East makes it a marked finesse|pg||
nt|afulton: as long as south doesnt pitch incorrectly! |pg||
nt|afulton: (from dummy)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: going for the immediate spade pitch|pg||
nt|hedyg: any 5 level bid shows an odd number|pg||
nt|haans: knowlege at this ttable|pg||
nt|sybarra: you only have xxx, aqx, in majors |pg||
nt|aupillon: Sorry , only arriving, i'll tell you|pg||
nt|haans: trying endplay is wrong|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: perfect shift by Bocchi|pg||
nt|athene: now|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna can t give an entry to a declarer with singleton @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes count me in too|pg||
nt|xenya: i like the auction in the other room (3@S instead of DBL) much better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Why put up @HQ? |pg||
nt|haans: and then won a full 9 imp|pg||
nt|danilo1: good decision by Apec to pass .. if Dble penalty (guess so), he has not enough values .. if opt (invit to 4@S) - may cause difficulties to pd|pg||
nt|haans: sry dont follow who is apec?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am a Fantunes fan :)|pg||
nt|lesrays: it's hard to imagine a guy who is 40 up going wrong.....|pg||
nt|afulton: I really don't understand this line...|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why he ducked |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it is real ......|pg||
nt|lesrays: he's going to take the rest|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oliverc: Well I have their CC up on screen now, but I suspect we'll not be hugely wiser|pg||
nt|oliverc: except where opening bids are concerned|pg||
nt|newmoon: well played  :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|afulton: why weren't @s tested before cashing @cK|pg||
nt|danilo1: Kowalsky (Apolinary)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: now the defence are poised to take three spades and two clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: even with the @S switch (looks odd), this is down 1|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't put diamonds 6-2 on this auction!|pg||
nt|ritong: so my guess is a @h comes|pg||
nt|haans: i have their full system Will read it some day :))|pg||
nt|hedyg: by then they will have changed it|pg||
nt|milton_se: so not even bad bidding makes you doubt? :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubt in Fantunes???? never!|pg||
nt|haans: give me you mail adress|pg||
nt|hedyg: having already shown a @c control earlier Fantoni with the 5@d bid showed an odd nr of keycards and @d control|pg||
nt|haans: have it now|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5 rounds and not knowing that before...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if no @d ruff now he can claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: you know nr of keycards before Bertil?|pg||
nt|milton_se: with a relay system, certainly|pg||
nt|hedyg: a different relay system|pg||
nt|hedyg: their system seems to work fine for them|pg||
nt|haans: but few have decided to play it|pg||
nt|milton_se: I wouldn't like to be in 5 on that...|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West will be very happy about THAT trick|pg||
nt|haans: and then 3@C further asking 3nt show 4333 then|pg||
nt|haans: sober?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: next match in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|haans: by p overruff 4 @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am with Vlad|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps this is not available in NS's system here?|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
pc|d3|nt|star6ija: 12|pg||
nt|henryb: showing off|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: now the trump promo on the spade|pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|haans: right :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: @D ruff|pg||
nt|petere: a lot of bets in the audience ...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: could declarer have squeezed Bocchi in hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: exit with a spade at that poit|pg||
nt|athene: point|pg||
nt|athene: now if Sabine cashes, she kills her partner|pg||
nt|raghavan: All EW trumps can win tricks now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c3|nt|milton_se: or S|pg||
nt|haans: we agree with u|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so last board coming up|pg||
nt|mcarroll: so an imp saved|pg||
nt|werge: No change - still close|pg||
nt|petere: I lost ... as did all the other :)|pg||
nt|haans: cry for u :)|pg||
nt|haans: break?|pg||
nt|petere: another coffee|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good idea|pg||
nt|haans: not me sorry :(|pg||
pc|d4|nt|raghavan: OR - they bid and made 6D +1|pg||
nt|sybarra: this way you find your 5/3 fit if you have one |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 5@h in Open room|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - I'm getting this mixed up|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|murat: so some new imps of No Name|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: well, no chance now for sure|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|danilo1: Apek (not Apec) - corrected by Polisc specs :) (thanks)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: thought N had 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C stayman + 3@C next asking rebid you M if 5 carder|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hans, that is not standard |pg||
nt|werge: Now a show-up @C-finesse|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|xenya: if the card in trick 1 were shown correctly, W should now E had a singleton @H|pg||
nt|xenya: *cards|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
mc|8|nt|haans: still +0 imps|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hi Rodal.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very tough job for the operator when they play fast so well done to undo and give us the correct play|pg||
nt|idblu: I'm glad Al does his homework :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 6@C of course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 100% blame to North dear Ragha|pg||
nt|raghavan: Gary South did not show much values - It is all South's fault|pg||
nt|raghavan: Soory N did not show much values|pg||
mb|2D|an|weak major|nt|raghavan: 8 deals played both rooms - China 27 and Indonesia 4 IMP|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NO, south had a full opening hand and his pard had opened|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what do you open with West??|pg||
nt|idblu: Pass 4 me|pg||
mb|4H|an|pass or corrct|nt|nigel_k:  Interesting on board 8, at this table they invited game after a 2H opening and the other table passed a 3H opening|pg||
nt|westjava: Thai get 6 imps from   8,3@H only there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this 3@D going to get them to 4@S?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Given my record I won't predict another routine 4S|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case there was thought behind it but likely no swing as that contract will probably (hopefully?) not be duplicated in the OR.|pg||
nt|woozle: 13 top tricks for NS, if they care to bid it|pg||
nt|jcwla: Up to N - S will not accept an invite.|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura might just give up and bid seven if he doesn't have the machinery to avoid it intelligently|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well if cards sat better EW then NS would have 12|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: go on it looks sane|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S all make sense|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: AND he had a 5 card suit so..100% North who should never open|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12-14NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: interesting Neg DBL holding 5@S also|pg||
nt|afulton: another interesting east west hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: 1N=8-13 or 16+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C asks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S doing well here to compete in spades|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not sure how Stayman helps...maybe I'll find out|pg||
nt|jcwla: 23 a push at 4@S making 5.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: next|pg||
nt|bebechira: E will bring this home on D lead... |pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@S & 8-10|pg||
nt|westjava: I think so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and e/w might never find the @C suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd vote for 1@H or 1@S -- just not sure which is better|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Ha|pg||
nt|bebechira: he has 3h+2c+2d|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: at least i think should be 8-10|pg||
nt|mariner1: S should bid game now....... dual fit and short @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt know about clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H a little timid I think|pg||
nt|afulton: played carefully, NS can make 5@H, losing only @d + @c|pg||
nt|afulton: oh good, just what you want to hear when you bid stayman... partner answering you in your stiff |pg||
nt|raghavan: This lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|afulton: yes|pg||
nt|afulton: it will allow Hsien to hold the @c losers to 1 while establishing the suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: another guess coming -- 3@H shows 2 top honors in @S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh the double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Ok the double was just to test us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prompted by?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Sorry no dbl, just tht all pass and press DK = dbl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H transfer after the DBL|pg||
nt|sybarra2: again the @H is transfer?|pg||
nt|idblu: if I had to...1@S for the lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nigel_k:  I think East was looking for slam there actually :)|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@C best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there enough tricks if @D discard?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  just a club guess for the overtrick|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,K of @C on side...|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick in the same 3@D contract earned China 1 IMP on 20.|pg||
nt|patricck: their cc does say 2@H can be 0-8, so maybe Nunn was scared it was even worse than that|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not enough from West unfortunately|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: had us excited operator|pg||
nt|westjava: not too late...|pg||
nt|mariner1: N does a good job|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  After QC wins declarer has to guess whether N has doubleton 10 or South has doubleton King|pg||
nt|idblu: lots of handling charges|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think declarer wins the race here - but not positive|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think can handle it|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra2: draw trump and ruffing ......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may come down to the fortunate lie of NS @D|pg||
nt|idblu: can't play on @D's w/o 2 rds of trump|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't argue with success.|pg||
nt|woozle: Some spectators are admiring North's auction, but I still can't see that he can count 13 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|westjava: will reach to 6..?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it they reach slam level it will be a tough play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unbelivebel friendly hand for NS, but hard to reach the max|pg||
nt|woozle: All he really achieved was avoiding the indignity of playing 7NT where the four missing points were an ace|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|afulton: sounds wacky but @c toward Q should have been trick 2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: W might have over taken and fired a @S back|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why not |pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard had ace of @S,  and ruff  next |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You'd actually want to be in slam with the E/W cards after South's double|pg||
pc|h7|nt|raghavan: she tries to get OT as many as possibe|pg||
pc|hA|nt|westjava: so,be careful Hu|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c out beats 6@H and 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec asking for more guesses ---  4@C asks about @C holding  4@D=not 1st/2nd/3rd round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't explain why South asked in @C rather than @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @S were 3 2 this would have more play likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@H = 2 @S honor, so 6@S is very reasonable|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult contract tough to make|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D,that's S need...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one correct guess -- now how about 4@C??|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|westjava: @C asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confirmation of my guess about 4@C only counts if it comes from the table :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: it can be made now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With the KH wrong it would fail of course|pg||
nt|afulton: here, south could have and probably should have ducked|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: suggest line of play to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that looks wrong|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: has to play E for Jxxx @S though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 2nd @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "no" was supposed to be "now"|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then what  (as martin said)|pg||
nt|afulton: but they need to be playing to make the contract|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|westjava: yes,just need 1 x @C ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: might have been wise to ruff some @H's|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|westjava: now,need @D ruff:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trying to ruff hearts looked relatively safe but she's not taking any chances|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: remember to ruff 3rd round of @D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: could have ruffed a @D  and finessed for J@S and home|pg||
nt|mariner1: at least it would have been a try :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|westjava: 12 imps for 6 boards,good match|pg||
nt|sybarra: so club, over take, ace of spade (if there) and ruff,  ace of @D  =down|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|allanr44: Needs @D lead (or club lead and @D switch) to hold it to 4|pg||

nt|mariner1: seems best defense can beat 4@H here, so 5@C was a phantom..... though it could|pg||
nt|mariner1: have made too|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, operator can check if there is an opportunity...|pg||
nt|aupillon: Yes. 4 spades were my option on the last one. But cruelling missing a needed singleton, tough|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @s NS ?|pg||
nt|werge: Look´s like a NO-SWING BOARD|pg||
mb|p|nt|kurtove: 5 sp is 3 down with best def|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|raghavan: This  of NS has not helped them now - they lost 5IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Massimiliano (Italy), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Jean Harings|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Netherlands), P.S. Raghavan (India), George Holland (Canada) and Roland Wald|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank the lovable kibits, co commentators George, Jean and Rob, VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO. |pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Massimiliano (Italy), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|haans: we are 14 is right|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 carder and 14 hcp is a good excuse to open 1nt always|pg||
nt|ahh: other room doubled 1nt |pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: yes, that might have been a good play, but Bocchi didn't need it|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S  - an unklikely contract|pg||
nt|haans: but does 4@H mean single spade|pg||
nt|haans: changed times |pg||
nt|pelu: so last board 5 IMP for Angelini = 16-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed, 30 minutes earlier than i announced, sry|pg||
nt|haans: first time 10 then 11:40 13:20 17:30 19:10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 8  here 4H made 5 Open 6H -1 so MC Leish picks up 11 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: this board can be bloddy|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C = both majors?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no possibilities to go wrong in @c|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably north will have some instrument to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5+ mi, 4ma?|pg||
nt|werge: Here a very UNlucky 4 @S E/W|pg||
nt|ahh: safe 1 off |pg||
nt|haans: EW will not stop here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope N does not bid 2H?|pg||
nt|afulton: this one should be an easy 4@s hand... tho they may try 6 |pg||
nt|afulton: when south shows 5+ spades, north with all primes should make some aggressive move|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: note that 3N is cold for NS on the last board|pg||
nt|pelu: do u like the X from S? - 2@H or 2@S (Michael) in my book|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 5@C - strong @C-suit and no @Hs ?????|pg||
nt|milton_se: that opening bid might help NS to stay low|pg||
nt|jeanhari: doesnt look like that...|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the European Bridge League (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Massimo Ortensi), and all the generous sponsors and organizers for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs!|pg||

nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@s without @h lead|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that @D8 in trick 1 ask for @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: but will have to guess the position of @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: CC says it's a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thank you all. see you on next session|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank Henry - sorry i missed him|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all for being with us... unfortunately there is some problem with the server for running scores, but I hope iy will be fixed as soon as possible|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: THX all a lot |pg||
nt|raghavan: Rob, George and Jean It is my pleasure to be with you in this ,Spl tx to u all|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good typing Rob, tx to you too|pg||
nt|daman: N shd double|pg||
nt|fann4: A tough re-opening decision for South. He wants to act, but the @h suit is so bad.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no no was that|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C|pg||
nt|werge: - with 5 @H N/S...|pg||
nt|haans: corrected to 5@H|pg||
nt|raghavan: May be in 2D |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pass by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: xx?|pg||
nt|ahh: south will know this is weak |pg||
nt|haans: depends on what X mean|pg||
nt|haans: x as pen not common today|pg||
nt|petere: break for the operator it seems :)|pg||
nt|haans: learned nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: elu said|pg||
nt|haans: 30 min pelu siad|pg||
nt|jeanhari: best not to pas here|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
nt|haans: and spade to short :))|pg||
nt|fann4: Trouble is, without a 3rd @S he has to plunge in with @H or stay out.|pg||
nt|haans: little action here|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW may be in trouble here|pg||
nt|raghavan: this lets w out|pg||
nt|april7: its a simple 4@S contract,where 2 @D have to be ruffed in  the N hand, so best lead is @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: corrected on our website|pg||
nt|raghavan: George N heard you|pg||

nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: welland indeed gaining 13 on 9|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|daman: can this be t/o?  no way|pg||
nt|mariner1: I pass it anyway|pg||
nt|daman: Garner got caught speeding|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I would play it as to|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may pull to 3C? of course not sure of number of clubs with E|pg||
nt|sharkey: what's E to do?|pg||
nt|haans: well done sweden|pg||
nt|ahh: looks like penalty double to me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C not alerted so presumably improvisation|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@C natural or...?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D an underbid and 3nt not really very good|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but not alerted|pg||
nt|athene: actually i think a simple 3@D wld have been OK|pg||
nt|star6ija: and take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: s'alright. I am easily missed|pg||
nt|haans: you and we will be kick out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I am going to rule that 30 minutes = "around 15 minutes"|pg||
nt|werge: This board is against the rule: The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
nt|MolvaM: garner lying in the bushes with a good suit and a side ace|pg||
nt|aupillon: and the impossibility to show picture pattern. I agree with 1NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe hoping opps would reach 3nt|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1D loser and 2H losers|pg||
nt|werge: Right hand is playing now|pg||
nt|april7: it doesn'tmake really any difference|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: yes, nice Morton's Fork possibility here|pg||
nt|brgpro: seems there was an misunderstanding of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: by playing @c4 he set up "mortons fork" - if West take @CA the 2 discards - if not: the @C-trick go away|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather unfortunate...W has sort of "Nat" @hK lead...|pg||
nt|charles_l: S might suggest it over 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: but N bids 4@h|pg||
nt|wwalter: a manly bid :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: real men bid game :) (and try to make it)|pg||
nt|panja: not an easy lead, but @C is safe|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 22 the other room reached to high in 6 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *too |pg||
nt|jcwla: Should work like a charm here if natural.|pg||
nt|athene: but west perhaps just wants to stop the club lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: it didn't|pg||
nt|henryb: N is relaying again|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Gomerov still not satisfied|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|rnc: It has been an interesting match|pg||
nt|rnc: Herbst making a huge rally from 7-21 to 40-21 in five consecutive boards - never give up!|pg||
nt|fann4: Same seq in the OR, but S gave up over 3@C|pg||
nt|petere: with @D lead one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: better from the N side |pg||
nt|werge: OR: No game bid... - 6 @S|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Did i hear no swing board?  Open room is in 6@S :)  so wait till this auction is over.|pg||
nt|werge: @C-lead from West gives 6 @S away|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@H is rite contract ... lucky @C and @H (even @SK) position making it made by force .. but not so clear way to 4@H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wwalter: he made LOL|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it difficult to bid game in S and make it - 2 Club losers Da - will D  belead |pg||
nt|jeanhari: for sure Dubinin has a fast pas if this was not t/o|pg||
nt|daman: I think maybe Weinstein held up the auction|pg||
nt|panja: risky 3@H bid..isn't this one?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: nooo|pg||
nt|petere: with @C lead some ruffs though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: has there been a misunderstanding here? Sabine knows that 3NT isn't solid diamonds...|pg||
nt|haans: only brits play 5@C as slam invite|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that the X = @h + minor - so S has shown his hand!|pg||
nt|kurtove: diamond lead, ruff and small heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=0-11, 4@hs|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes will have to drop QC, since he can't afford E having the trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@d acts as 4sf here?|pg||
nt|april7: @D lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South is not thrilled - although he does have a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: in IMP as rare pen double|pg||
nt|haans: or is it not?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could be yes|pg||
nt|haans: he is worth a well done|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why not S X 2H? Hans|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not x, better action |pg||
nt|sharkey: S decided on modesty....|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens and Bakkeren may have wished they are not in this bidding,  but South saved them |pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes S will be happy gets atleast 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: :) :) @C better :)|pg||
nt|haans: i must be a star|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|charles_l: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|henryb: "The Fat Lady is Singing"|pg||
nt|ritong: north went for the practical bid|pg||
nt|ritong: a second cue wouldn t have scandalized me|pg||
nt|ady: north right gave up once south shows some heart values|pg||
nt|daman: has to duck 1 @H and maybe more|pg||
nt|daman: pitching @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding has maded it easy'er for N to play @Cj|pg||
nt|haans: and this was board 10 welcome back in 40 minutes! |pg||
nt|raghavan: Will E signal his D Ace now?|pg||
nt|milton_se: Welland can't expect more than one ace w East, so D is mandatory|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a tricky 3nt! 5 and 6@c is easier, but not longer|pg||
nt|haans: :) they did right :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: next round (3rd from Swiss Open Teams) starts tomorrow 10:3- CET|pg||
nt|mariner1: well right defense just not in game|pg||
nt|werge: 750|pg||
nt|haans: they are the opps :)))|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open playing in 5@C Dbl also, so @H fit never found|pg||
nt|MolvaM: actually if he had passed again opps would probably land in 2nt|pg||
nt|petere: no that are smileys, not stars :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Needs 2 ruffs to profit as natural trump trick disappears|pg||
nt|petere: why not?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @C switch now?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I don't need any coffe :) the play really very slowly |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they*|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W opened 2@D, E 4@H, pass or correct|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wwalter: 4 wich pair? :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: maybe will fines the @h :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: he has not made it yet......|pg||
nt|wwalter: it sould be simple now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a grand with 2-2 in @s|pg||
nt|raghavan: another 7 in Hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: or spades or NT|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably :)|pg||
nt|daman: draw trumo|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
nt|april7: why should he lead @C, he will lead @S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: And he might have just turned a huge plus into a small minus|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS do better not drawing here I think|pg||
nt|panja: and now, there is a promotion possibility|pg||
nt|werge: - if not playing for another stiff @C K|pg||
nt|werge: Same play - @H / @C|pg||
nt|haans: @H has been found but longer clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: I thought xx was a wish to "get them"|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think Levin wonder why Hampson bid 3@d with that @hs and points...|pg||
nt|haans: i think he is thinking about how to play|pg||
nt|ahh: will play @S to  throw @C then play on @D |pg||
nt|haans: yeah|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brgpro: Bocchi thought pd denied @d control|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can finesse in @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: but now it's over|pg||
nt|milton_se: 11 tricks probably|pg||
nt|haans: trust we will see team salokin again|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 4S down  so ew making 4 will get them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx to all Kibitz, co commentators Hans, Malik,sid,Momchil, Vu GR operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all kibitzers, we are waiting all of you here for the next round|pg||
nt|haans:  and thats was board 10 welcome back 17:30 (italian time) |pg||
nt|henryb: S has now presumably shown 5-5-1-2, minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: and plopped into 4 |pg||
nt|lesrays: stopped in time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have overstretched to 5NT in Open|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all commentators, to EBL and to Roland Wald|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can call it an action double.: partner, I'm still not satisfied until now...|pg||
nt|haans: but still +|pg||
nt|haans: wrong - score|pg||
nt|haans: understand 4-1|pg||
nt|aupillon: not too many points|pg||
nt|aupillon: he'll maybe try to create an upercutt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and 2nt might have failed|pg||
nt|afulton: they made 6 in open room but that won't happen here... |pg||
nt|danilo1: as expected .. 2@S rebid made West @H bid almost impossible|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wwalter: made|pg||
nt|wwalter: or not LOL|pg||
nt|charles_l: he may be preserving his options to misguess @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now way south could see passing was best|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 Spades,HA,DA and (a club)  minimum losers|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a violation of Burn's Law (RULES)|pg||
nt|haans: may go down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not DBL....ED another flat board I guess|pg||
pc|s3|nt|murat: he goes down now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Terence Reese had a pithy comment for South's 3@S ....|pg||
nt|ahh: he has fair idea  where the big @H are |pg||
nt|buddyshah: so we do have another swing,.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: @c i meant|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2 x A from S - have a bet? :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: no|pg||
nt|raghavan: Automatically spade honours fall - no need for worry, |pg||
nt|jeanhari: but depending on what de dbl over 1NT ment|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he said only points|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "He was happy to defend 3@H when it was bid, but not prepared to defend it when partner doubled!"|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wwalter: if he plays @s could come a problewm :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: it was a good pass by S, although 4@S is an execellent contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: Friends- We thank all great Kibitz, co commentators, VuGr operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|henryb: 4N probably agrees spades for the moment, since N is most interested in the @sQ|pg||
nt|henryb: the grand is only good if S has the @sQ|pg||
nt|haans: but onoy may|pg||
nt|panja: S should have played @DT|pg||
nt|fann4: There are 5 top losers with the ruff.|pg||
nt|panja: @D2 is a lazy play|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes probably|pg||
nt|nubmaster: more @d now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh no there was 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no 3 imps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: in 3NT on a @D-lead decla must topplay @Cs - if @cQ in West no problem - if in East has to drop!|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now! I cannot see any 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok, tx|pg||
nt|fann4: thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|haans: sure does|pg||
nt|haans: and not my style of 2 bid|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wwalter: + 11 or -6? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: well if you bids em you has to makes em :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10|pg||
nt|panja: you must reciprocate after a gift..|pg||
nt|sybarra: the nt "right sided"  the @S contract is not |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mariner1: never play in a contract where the opponents have more trumps than you|pg||

nt|nubmaster: no better with 2 @h ruffs|pg||
nt|haans: @H my choice|pg||
nt|raghavan: H e will be thinking whether C 10 could be another entry for 2 ruffs and SK|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ace of @c as entrance for second ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: has to lead @c, he see's he is on hook anyway|pg||
nt|ahh: nice play by east  knocking entry to @S|pg||

nt|afulton: yes, good thing the ladies aren't playing for money!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W will regret not cashing A@C in the post|pg||
nt|westjava: still tied match...1lso 3NT + 3 for   23|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to play AQ@S was a winner|pg||
nt|westjava: also|pg||
nt|woozle: Another very sound weak two from Hirata...NS have no cold game but three feasible ones (4S, 3NT, 5C)|pg||
nt|afulton: or at least the north south pair :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: in 5 deals China has 14 and australia 10|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15, 0+@D   [2@D opener = 0-10 4+@H & 4+@S]|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score battle|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When they go back with +200 maybe teammates will assume it is from 4 spades doubled :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N supposed to be 12-14|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|vugraphzre: 1nt=15-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the unorthodox 3@D by Lung preempted his side out of the making 3N|pg||
nt|bebechira: Texan Aces doing very very well 56-28 with 8 to go.....|pg||
nt|raghavan: well N makes Lead direction bid if Opp reach a contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Pass = 0-2@S  [support dbl with 3]|pg||
nt|rodal f: Waited 1NT and tr there, by 3@H as max|pg||
nt|jcwla: 21, the 3NT hand in here, W in OR threw in a junky 2@D overcall and played that doubled, but down 3 and only -500 to gain 3 for Australia.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Macau now leading after bidding the slam on board 4|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS will lose a lot in money|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nigel_k:  N will have deja-vu from board 6|pg||
nt|afulton: they forgot initial passes... |pg||
nt|rodal f: But an other system for NS I belive. 11 - 14 NT in white?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only makes his pard think of game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|nigel_k:  3H is Ogust showing a good hand and a bad suit|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura not very ambitious - 2DXX might have been fun|pg||
nt|afulton: yet, in spite of all the riches of the E-W pair, this is not a great hand for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W does not like 2@C however has no where to go|pg||
nt|afulton: assume a @H lead... |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity telling all cards - EW will defend better now with information|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: yes:)|pg||
nt|westjava: so,better pass now|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Pass is a bit pessimistic with West, maybe 3H instead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like their chances for 2nd plus score of the set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard, drop the lifeboats|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  Lots of work to do in 4H though|pg||
nt|mariner1: trump leads needed|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there is one|pg||
nt|patricck: NS have missed 4@H here|pg||
nt|woozle: Odd that he didn't even want to play game opposite hearts...from what we've seen of Hirata's weak twos it would probably be laydown|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 24, where Neill upgraded the 14 to 1NT, Ohno also opened it 1NT - as the top end of 11-14!  Over S's interference, West got his side out in 3@C.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idblu: @DK and switch to ??|pg||
nt|raghavan: What is there for W to think Pass|pg||
pc|s2|nt|westjava: 7 imps gain to Japan   24 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: A@C being Ax helps|pg||
nt|afulton: as i said... not great hand for east-west|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: opening nebulous @D has the effect of pinning the suit if the opponents hold it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: holding trump Ace - very powerful for West|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a min 1 after the lead|pg||
nt|afulton: they will lose 2@h's 1@c and @s .. for -2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: E should X|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nigel_k:  A bit timid by E/W. West could have tried 3H or E a reopening double|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcwla: rehi|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|afulton: but with all high @h played on trick 1... why not try to set up @s right away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great lead should be about 500 here for nothing|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 Spades+1H atleast+1D+1C - contract may be more down|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|westjava: PABF is the biggest annual tournament for the Pacific Asia Bridge Federation for Zone 6, representatives for the upcoming Sao Paulo World Championships are deteremined here|pg||
nt|idblu: only 8 tricks....|pg||
nt|westjava: except @H return from W:)|pg||
nt|idblu: as long as @S played before the @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9th trick [@H] not established yet - defense CAN prevail, but will they?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NOPE|pg||

nt|brgpro: pd has @sA @hK and @dKJ|pg||
nt|brgpro: he thought|pg||
nt|wwalter: 20 imps in 3 boards|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  n/s   J@H lead|pg||
nt|trotto: przeciez chyba masz 30 dniu urlopu ,lol?|pg||
nt|trotto: sorry ,prive|pg||
nt|daman: I agree Adam|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|ady: club lead could have been nasty|pg||
nt|werge: @C-ruff is popular here - but not if N/S plays 4 @S|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: levin pull board on the floor |pg||
nt|haans: we are |pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden gets 1 IMP|pg||
nt|ahh: at this rate Sweden fall 8 short |pg||
nt|haans: yep |pg||
nt|ahh: more fun here though|pg||
nt|mcarroll: depends on your definition of fun I suppose|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden will get some points here too|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a make|pg||
nt|ahh: not so sure about that |pg||
nt|ahh: sweden gaining i mean |pg||
nt|haans: and they tried|pg||
nt|werge: @S better than @H - not only by South|pg||
nt|afulton: doesnt matter...  ew should take 1@h and 1@s |pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|afulton: so, should be 5N, making and 4@s making 5... for push|pg||
nt|sybarra: never cashed the ace of @H's when in with spade|pg||
nt|afulton: i c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In the OR 6@S was not played like this:)|pg||
nt|werge: Who said slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 3N plus a few depending on the lead|pg||
nt|trotto: sorry all,   wrong widow:)|pg||
nt|daman: depends upon who plays it|pg||
nt|haans: no|pg||
nt|petere: Another 3NT with more than 4 tricks for the defender from the start|pg||
nt|haans: but mne Ekrens 2M weak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 24 point Grand|pg||
nt|haans: ask none you recieve no lies|pg||
mb|1H|nt|charles_l: 6@c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good result here for Badger.|pg||
nt|ahh: they need to find the save too |pg||
nt|werge: South: Weak with majors - seems to be right|pg||
nt|haans: red suit ok|pg||
nt|danilo1: why this play ? (in 2@S) .. and why @H discard when @S 4-1 ... trying to loose trump control .. would be pretty unpleasnt if N @C AJ|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 3@C is invitational?|pg||
nt|raghavan: now S bids 1D|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S i come prepared|pg||
nt|werge: Now direction 6 @D - 3 NT out of question|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry 5 @D, I meant|pg||
nt|werge: Bad @S-break - might swing|pg||
nt|april7: the finesse in @H could have cost the contract on certain layout, but taking the ace , 100%|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C (hope Forcing) rite bid now|pg||
nt|haans: not to bad slam|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: 4@H from north now?|pg||
nt|panja: not a bad idea, two key cards missing though|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N bid and made on 23|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|werge: But the second @H-honour might help|pg||
nt|MolvaM: lets see good old blackwood will save another life?|pg||
nt|aupillon: for spectators not knowing exactly the Fante team : Italian name but french team with many real youngsters ( a bit less Fantun)|pg||
nt|afulton: did they believe the NS pair were faking their bids?  When playing, you need to decide who is telling the truth!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: N can make 6@c but EW has a vul. save in 6@h, 800|pg||
nt|athene: looks a bit heavy for that|pg||
nt|athene: east has too much defence and is too vulnerable to consider saccing, surely?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brgpro: he can X 4@h now but i doubt W will save|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to save in 6@H for loads and find pd was going to lead stiff @D against 6@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: S has a rather heavy 3@c , she will pass now|pg||
nt|brgpro: showing some interest |pg||
nt|panja: that must be N|pg||
nt|don paulus: shows 3crd @h ?|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need support doubles when partner has shown 5+ in the suit, i wouldn't have thought|pg||
nt|athene: i wld just bid 4@H with west's hand|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps X is game-try in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if they have that agreement it suits the hand perfectly|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is a bit wet and 4@H a bit pushy|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT doesn't work?|pg||
nt|ady: almist certainly south|pg||
nt|haans: he has two chances to play @CK|pg||
nt|werge: EW 4 @S, naturally|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 2@d is 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|jcwla: At a low level, sometimes it's a free roll to tell partner whether the fit is 8 or 9, but here I agree it wouldn't seem to apply.|pg||
nt|daman: now from the wrong side|pg||
nt|ady: not wrong side   better for north to play|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry problrm on bbo |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I lost bidding we wait for the score|pg||
nt|ady: only a spade lead and club switch could be awkward|pg||
nt|ritong: what is final contract pls?|pg||
nt|ady: not finsished bidding yet|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt|pg||
nt|ritong: grazie|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: By S|pg||
nt|sybarra: "lesson board"  ???|pg||
nt|werge: South must avoid the @H-lead - better lead a trump |pg||
nt|mcarroll: well bid|pg||
nt|haans: Geir Helgemo have stopped using Ekrens no as profitable now that all know how to defend|pg||
nt|afulton: we already discussed earlier that one of these matches went into overtime and an imp is an imp is an imp|pg||
nt|ronpa: lengy is winning 1 imp a board but unfortuantly he needs 40 more boards and not 3 :(|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: the 3NT where Bocchi found the @S shift: Semanta won 3NT - he won on and endplay against N! |pg||
nt|athene: well if East bids 4@C or 3@S or 3NT now, west can bid 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: bizarre|pg||
nt|ady: wrong   tht south would open 2NT|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a 2NT opening would be artificial|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It didnt in the Open The void of course complicates things|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I think these days with the dealing programs, you should have good way to locate voids|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: gone all haywire|pg||
nt|MolvaM: as they come up too often|pg||
mb|p|nt|dcbutler: Hauge is ahead 89-50 with one board to score, so will make the final|pg||
nt|aupillon: can be a swing for Fante|pg||
nt|aupillon: 3NT = WEAK trumps|pg||
nt|haans: but long way to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @H9 should restrict to 3|pg||
nt|charles_l: hard to lead @h though|pg||
nt|wwalter: who would lead that? :)|pg||
nt|panja: it is a fair choice, even single dummy|pg||
nt|daman: a lot of good teams have fallen by the wayside|pg||
nt|petere: @C @S @C|pg||
nt|danilo1: .. and now 2@S (West)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: ......|pg||
nt|haans: will not make my money on that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: and this will be made also|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice 10 of @D in W hand |pg||
nt|MolvaM: I suggested that 1@c opening should ask voids but not many people liked my idea  :)|pg||
nt|april7: only 12 tricks in @S |pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: declarer had just better not play @SAKJ throwing @D3 :) she runs into a nasty accident in clubs if she does that|pg||
nt|ahh: beginning to look like bd 16 was the match winner |pg||
nt|ronpa: this result has prevented an israeli match at the semis :(|pg||
nt|afulton: ok, stir something up for them Ron|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: if N wins the ace now, declarer might not need @Cs to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but N ducks correctly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes looks like they have no intention of going beyond game|pg||
nt|aupillon: even with a nice hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
nt|aupillon: no, no|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Can go off wih @C ruff|pg||
nt|petere: does she have any chance making this ?|pg||
nt|werge: Think, the 11th trick is hard to find|pg||
nt|werge: I think, it will be difficult to bid 7 - to tell each other, that we have a 65 % grand slam or so|pg||
nt|haans: i think anything else is just to much|pg||
nt|danilo1: with 3 small (not easting Hcp for ruff) Hearts, a little more than just 4@S is worth try |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|brgpro: with 6@c, Bochi doesnt care as even if they are without @cK pd must have @cAQ 6 times|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, @D to the Ace and a @C-discard on @H King is not directly stupid|pg||
nt|haans: as a speak say only one chane|pg||
nt|haans: spec|pg||
nt|haans: may b|pg||
nt|haans: but three more|pg||
nt|petere: @C will be helpful even|pg||
nt|april7: now E might bid 7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|aupillon: it's over i guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: NS throw the ball at each other|pg||
nt|haans: and down|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|buddyshah: angling towads a dangerus 7 now|pg||
nt|werge: It´s a very good 7|pg||
nt|april7: all high cards are here, but oly singletn K of @S, and E doesn't know it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brgpro: a quick claim|pg||
nt|athene: could draw trumps with the @C4 :)|pg||
nt|athene: just to be cute|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N has the chance to stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|aupillon: say 5 spades. You've done enough|pg||
nt|aupillon: why not Blackwood after 3NT. Fit was given|pg||
nt|werge: But when East knows, that they have all key-cards, @S King included - he will bid 7|pg||
nt|april7: just bad luck,if E bids it|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Kx good Kstiff  not so good|pg||
nt|don paulus: cannot avoid losing a @s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: the thinking should be E did not overcall 1@S, nor did she dbl 2@D..so is unlikely to hold enough to defeat the contract in any of those suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes the spot cards in @H and @C make it impossible to promote a trick|pg||
nt|afulton: they COULD have bid 4@s in other room, no?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|MolvaM: you cant bid 6 rounds and play just a 5level contract|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|charles_l: its only good if S shows stiff|pg||
nt|werge: Well done, NL|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: N probably assumes S has 2@Hs for the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|aupillon: noway :(:(:(|pg||
nt|aupillon: wait a minute|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: Best play op to now, yesterday included|pg||
nt|ritong: not anymore|pg||
nt|aupillon: not a chance by now |pg||
nt|rnmalik: vow|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: specs tell me another 5level making contract.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|april7: not understandable|pg||
nt|don paulus: have Texan Aces bad luck or offday ?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|charles_l: 2@d was effectively nmf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: its just that they didnt stop at 5. but this is coincidental|pg||
nt|MolvaM: by the way garner made a good lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: diamond lead could have been problematic|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and let declarer get rid of his heart loser on 3rd round @d|pg||
nt|ritong: this happened other room, but zia somehow mistimed the play|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh specs tell me he could go down even with @d lead|pg||
nt|aupillon: remember taht Blackwood is always a bridge convention|pg||
nt|aupillon: opps, claim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: looking for -2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: Yes well planned by W|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: the @DJ was a good card to play -- it assurest 2 entries to dummy if N wins the Q|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: misunderstanding I believe.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|werge: So another 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: I do´nt beleive that @S 7...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petere: NEXT!|pg||
nt|werge: Texan needed the luck, that Israel bid 7, but they also stopped - for 980|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 5@D hand does not improve after 5C bid,diff to know why E signs off in this sequence|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: pay me|pg||
nt|aupillon: a REVOKE can make the slam make :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: test|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thats why its good to claim quickly|pg||
nt|april7: I understand the 6@S call in hand 10, rather then the pass of 5@S here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 6@s |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry problems |pg||
nt|werge: Ijn fact this is NO bad luck. Earning by bidding 5 @S would have been hard|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: its flashy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither|pg||
nt|aupillon: a REVOKE by E/W can make the slam ...make|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d9|pc|sJ|nt|haans: operator ahead of us all :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|danilo1: I agree with Specs .. easier to analyse on all 4 hands, still, en-passant 2@S could not cost|pg||
mc|13|nt|nubmaster: They are in 3@d in OR also... let's see how decl manage...|pg||
pg||
qx|o26|st||md|4SJT92HT9D43CQJT97,SKQ7643HQ64D95C54,S5HAJ873D76CAK632,SA8HK52DAKQJT82C8|sv|b|nt|ahollan1: without trump Ace - Dawei must guess at trick 2 -- @D or @C|pg||
nt|westjava: x again by E better|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Missed opportunity for both teams|pg||
nt|mariner1: this could be an action hand|pg||
nt|afulton: she thought @s were 4-2 with the trump leader having AKJx of @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has good play EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was well done by declerer.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  An easy hand to get overboard on so may not be too bad for N/S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Another slam here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think both pairs playing upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|idblu: well then @S2 should have been his clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no - NS sometimes std sometimes udca|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both odd/even discard|pg||
nt|raghavan: Zia|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could I have the website for this tourney so I can talk with minor amount of intelligence|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kiwibridge: yes looked like 3@D was gin others had chances|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tough one|pg||
nt|woozle: EW have a very possible (but inferior and failing) 4H, or an excellent 3NT available|pg||
nt|bebechira: I saw some good work on the bulletin...|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Nice hand nobody has a fit here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: so cant she cross ruff it out for 4  or am I misisng something|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S DBL would please E|pg||
nt|rodal f: 50 and fin in my eys|pg||
nt|woozle: Which game EW play will probably depend on which of E and W makes the final decision|pg||
nt|afulton: one thing I noticed when I was watching USBF finals was that almost all of them opened the bidding extremely light|pg||
nt|bebechira: http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|mariner1: NS in a pickle now|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@C 11-15 either 5@C + 4 or 6+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: If Hughes had a support double available, he did well to ignore it|pg||
nt|afulton: and they bent over to overcall (particularly at favorable vul) extremely light|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: this makes 6@S or 6@C|pg||
nt|westjava: they will|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7 in fact|pg||
nt|westjava: nice lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as good as 3@C was bad :)|pg||
nt|westjava: I always with 7 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no 7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 22 a push at 3NT-1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=0-10, 5+@H|pg||
nt|davidstern: I can say that the general consensus is that Asian (and Aus/NZ) Tournaments are among the friendliest in the world. There seem to be an ongoing number of  appeals here which never ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: happens in Asia|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even peeking at just EW cards, not sure where i'd want to be|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and should be bid|pg||
nt|westjava: key of K@C..!:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and west is sitting |pg||
nt|idblu: but after @DK and @H8....only suit left was @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  7C is a very good contract and may be reached if East uses 4NT key card now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W is happy :)|pg||
nt|afulton: Hsien has made a very heavy 1N bid.. but South found SUPER lead!|pg||
nt|bebechira: Texan Aces getting closer and closer to the semis....+40 with 6 to go|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Grant steals it, this may not be pretty but only 50's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @D lead will make declarer very nervous|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With canape you always feel like you want to rebid a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@C also drifted one off on 24, so the Lamaze class ("Push, push, push") continues.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 7@C not reasonable missing a key|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on a double finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 @C precission? Ok to alert it for specs also:)|pg||
nt|idblu: vul on his side here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: again the substandard game is reached|pg||
nt|afulton: three rounds of @c and then @h thru... |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hans had a number of choices here.  Will be interesting to see how this one plays out at the two tables.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Jodan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Jordan|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nigel_k:  Very pushy by North|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: trump lead not really best here |pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes does very well to not cooperate in his Neill's investigations|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: actually @H lead troublesome too|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Might be ok if the Ace was not a singleton, eg AC instead of AD|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: director -- we were robbed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: I think we missed a pass here|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls|pg||
nt|mariner1: well bid though|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: ok 2 rounds and ht thru |pg||
nt|afulton: ok, i agree|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|westjava: -3 now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ggod night and thx for coming :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East needs West to have seven to the king at least plus an ace, which is optimistic|pg||
nt|woozle: Even if declarer errs and plays on hearts, this will still probably make|pg||
nt|afulton: they never found their @c fit on this hand|pg||
mc|7|nt|nigel_k:  On board 6 Macau made 4H at the other table in addition to making 2S at this table |pg||
pg||

nt|sybarra: have to not get too high her |pg||
nt|sybarra: *here |pg||
nt|jcwla: wd by neve to earn the push|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H can be beaten if the defence organise their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|daman: nicely played :)|pg||
nt|ady: strange lead|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure it was|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry may be J of @s|pg||
nt|haans: we forgive you Massimiliano |pg||
nt|haans: rehi|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry internet problem|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|rnmalik: always:)|pg||
nt|aupillon: North overbid 3 or 4 times his hand. Sorry|pg||
nt|raghavan: no save  so Sweden may lose 3 IMP|pg||
nt|haans: only 15 down|pg||
nt|ahh: as they say in the best   puppet shows  anything can happen in the next half hour |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: i agree not bidding 5@D to close|pg||
nt|ahh: normal auction in other room |pg||
nt|werge: I think, that the second trick here was a clear-cut Lavinthal position. Without the @C-void, South had played a medium @S|pg||
nt|petere: 3@D in the OR ... second best fit|pg||
nt|werge: I have been told, that declarer could set up a @C for the 11th trick - I do´nt agree|pg||
nt|ronpa: the dealer is not helping as well but the indians has played great this set and deserves the compliments|pg||
nt|werge: Fun goes on - what a set of boards|pg||
nt|buddyshah: so they did bid 6|pg||
nt|don paulus: i understand from operator they were in 6@s after all|pg||
nt|werge: SORRY - 6 @S was BID in CR also|pg||
nt|buddyshah: operator   did E rid 6 on 5D or W raised?|pg||
nt|danilo1: and next bid = 4@H ... means .. I have litlle slam invit based on @C |pg||
nt|haans: 41S 5@D|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: operator plays any card then claims|pg||
nt|raghavan: This hand looks like a dull 2H hand  |pg||
nt|petere: after drawing 3 rounds of trumps ... mmmmhhhhh :(|pg||
nt|haans: OR bid @S-3@D all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: play 6 with two men off, have a chance and miss it, then finally score +2:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: Canape should help EW here..3@H  makes|pg||
nt|werge: The point is, that you put vour money on the fact, that South has no @C biggerthan the 9|pg||
nt|haans: if opps bid say THANK YOU|pg||
mb|2D|nt|charles_l: 4@h is 50%|pg||
nt|wwalter: @@ the oter table was the @h9 as lead|pg||
nt|athene: but unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|afulton: there has been some wonderful commentary at this table by Ron Pachlmann, Shirley Ybarra and Martin Carroll |pg||
nt|danilo1: depends on agreement ... 1NT, 2NT, 2@D, 2@S or Dble by North?|pg||
nt|haans: any way @C8 are no stopper!!|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 2@S shows other 2 (evidently, maybe East may find 3@C bid (stopper asking)|pg||
nt|haans: you need help to bid ¤@S or 5@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphztg: est|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in 12 boards 70 to 2 is massive|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D is a good save, but only S can bid it, N with AK in @S won't|pg||
nt|buddyshah: ty massimilano|pg||
nt|danilo1: *if 2@D ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: he did :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: now .. wasy way to 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: what does 3@C mean? i see it but does p know|pg||
nt|danilo1: since North shows @H+@C .. 3@C should mean .. asking for Stop (evidently good @D too>)|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S i1 down|pg||
mb|d|nt|charles_l: good stop|pg||
nt|athene: east has to lead a diamond at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: not impossible|pg||
nt|haans: i(I) bid my stopper asking |pg||
nt|haans: but x ============= thank you|pg||
mb|3S|nt|panja: Canape is a style of bidding wherein longer suit is bid on second round|pg||
nt|panja: so here, W has 5 Clubs and 4 Hearts, he opened 1@H|pg||
nt|aupillon: hello Henri. |pg||
nt|ritong: hi.|pg||
nt|werge: That is DOUBLE-DUMMY only - South could have 5-4-2-2 - this Ekren is out of control|pg||
nt|werge: But a good point anyway, thanks|pg||
nt|haans: sometimes|pg||
nt|danilo1: if NS insist on 5@C .. East should bid 5@D instead 5@S (same -1 .. but he does not know it)|pg||
nt|haans: yep but not 5@S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|xenya: yet another straightforward 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: hard when partner didn't double any artficial diamond bids, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't expect opps to have so many diamonds that a ruff is likely|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C sign off?|pg||
nt|ritong: don t think 2@c was|pg||
nt|MolvaM: agressive 2@s but understandable at this vul|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought after 3NT by S there was no room to go wrong even with a void|pg||
mb|4N|nt|aupillon: look disclipinated East|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I thought that most US pairs had a higher standard than Jxxxxx for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|ahh: south will take his chances on defence |pg||
mb|5C|nt|xenya: but yes, they might try for bigger things|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: so, is a matter of @c complement|pg||
nt|ritong: here, rather poor|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: No chance for gimmicks by any one of the 4|pg||
nt|haans: East see slam|pg||
nt|danilo1: srry, 5@D is on (H discarded on @S)|pg||
nt|haans: but spade 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting 2@S rather than 2NT rebid from east|pg||
nt|pelu: they open 4 card major|pg||
nt|brgpro: many play 2NT is extra and 2@s=waiting|pg||
nt|pelu: B24 NS in 6@S - played by N! - so diff to find the @H-lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: still, have to guess @cA|pg||
nt|athene: strong @C or a shaded 2NT opener?|pg||
nt|athene: east might still lead @H10 surely|pg||
nt|haans: all may think its very close|pg||
nt|ahh: looks like 8 tricks  no more no less   but lets see |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: They have stopped in 3@H in OR|pg||
nt|haans: last chance|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: they shouldn't have to work so hard to beat this, though|pg||
nt|jcwla: A bridge too far.|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: Oops, and I forgot ... some super stuff by Georgia Ray! |pg||
nt|ronpa: defeating 3@H is great result but 4@H has no play in here so another push|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: defence needs to play spades early  to get 2 spades  1 heart and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|werge: Quite a world between the two Ekrans in Bd 11 and 12...|pg||
nt|haans: yes they call it vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: MOST... :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: well done (all)|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: very|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: Hard to see 3NT making, and in Open E is in 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: desperado bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As Spec says witholding @DK a good move|pg||
nt|haans: hard to understand what is happening|pg||
nt|mcarroll: TRUE|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but they are in europe. maybe that explains :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: best chance is that East lead her singleton @D = she cant have an A when she lead a singleton!!|pg||
nt|henryb: 6 could make, if South is inspited to lead a @d|pg||
nt|henryb: inspired*|pg||
nt|aupillon: good point. In France, MOST never open unless at least 3 honours ( from AKJ10 and 9). Otherwise you loose your club licence :)|pg||
nt|petere: this will score more than +110|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: I wonder what their theoreticl Ekren HCP range is, 2 points last hand, and a good 9 here?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|haans: easy to understand RIGHT???????????????????????????????|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if you become the european champion by constantly opening 2 with Jxxxxx they could live with that :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: In Turkey a good sequence headed by 987632 can do. Not true, Murat ?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sure but we prefer 987642 better actually|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be right |pg||
nt|werge: If you bid 5 @D, E/W might try 5 @S|pg||
nt|werge: Look at the West-hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|athene: yes :))|pg||
nt|athene: if north has announced strong balanced, east should be able to avoid the @CA lead|pg||
nt|pelu: a fall from grace : @cA - and easy 12 tricks - the 3. slam-sving in the match|pg||
nt|brgpro: i've seen people leading singleton against a grand...so...|pg||
nt|haans: who has @S6?|pg||
nt|haans: what score after 25 boards|pg||
nt|haans: 125 imp|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|aupillon: aha|pg||
nt|werge: Men lettere havde været at see signalet i spar 4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: or 2nd diamond to kill the diamond suit|pg||
nt|haans: some questions will be sked after the match im sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: this is OK|pg||
nt|ritong: three comparisons to come|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: that is Ekrens|pg||
nt|mcarroll: claim|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: to have finessing position against the 3|pg||
mc|11|nt|charles_l: +1 here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This looks like closing it out forNL with only 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|haans: drwn trumps first|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: should have played small @C when in dummy with @SJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, I know - he scored +920 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, should play @C7 from dummy after overruff @C6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  reasonable question to ask though :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: So sorry all specs. I was blind as.......|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  First partscore for a while and there is more action coming up so get coffee now if you need to|pg||
nt|woozle: Another normal game for NS...3NT is much better than 4H despite the solid 9-card fit|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why there are ni fire works?/|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be good for Aust|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: NS can make 6@H here|pg||
nt|bebechira: 26 and 27 should be good for Australia as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The 200 is unfortunately correct|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: possible 6@H here|pg||
nt|idblu: a quiet 4@H here|pg||
nt|westjava: NS just lost 3nt...|pg||
nt|afulton: after last hand, i am not surprised east didnt open|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will shake the hand of any pair who reach 6@H on this hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hard to reach|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It will be hard to interest North after a 1H opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has good play here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I did say can, expect them to reach 4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Wasnt in resp to your comment just a passing comment|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Yet another close game|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the lucky lead it's home.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S playing precision so South can safely pass the 1S opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|woozle: Nakamura trots out Drury, from the looks of it, and I assume that Neill's double is a lead-direct|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|sybarra2: this looks "easy"  |pg||
nt|woozle: 4H will be very difficult on a club lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  South must be worried about missing slam but his options over 1NT are not great|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H are 3 2 , K@D in pocker|pg||
nt|mariner1: pcoket|pg||
nt|mariner1: pocket :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes obeys orders and manages to avoid the temptation of his diamond holding|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting @C5 lead.|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think the South hand is strong enough to bid hearts and then spades or double on second chance|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michaels doesnt get across the playing strength|pg||
nt|davidstern: Give north doubleton spade and @DK and it is laydown|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here.....|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@S, 1@H and 2@C loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S back from W will end its hopes though|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @S can go on @D if no @S back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 = 3rd/lowest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't see Dawei doing anything other than @CAK and @S shift looking at dummy @D holding|pg||
nt|westjava: should be like that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and hoping that his p has A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Dawei ask what 2@S was|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: wondering because no @S lead then no @S singleton|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCruff AH|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D and 1 down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...surprised no exploration for a major.  @D lead would set the @H (Hans' @H) to racing.|pg||
nt|raghavan: David > get  ready to shake hands whatever the result|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  You probably wouldn't want to bid this one but the auction is very normal|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|westjava: best line of defence...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think risky not to cash 2nd @C -- imagine North  3613|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@C now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- i'd like to retract that please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 = down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Dawei preserving @C really was very fine play|pg||
nt|westjava: that's why he was thinking a while|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E is still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: frustrating when player at table finds better play seeing only 2 hands than i found looking at all 4 :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, E thinking now at the scence|pg||
nt|westjava: E has to ask what was 2@S..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: S replied W 2@S = 3c+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is another case where holding trump Ace gives defender more choices|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,always think alot if you've A of trump|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Claim|pg||
pc|sA|nt|westjava: upss|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: E just asked N the same question about what 2@S was|pg||
nt|westjava: ty:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: same answer = 3+|pg||
nt|idblu: about time able to press the "Easy" button|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bit hard from here in Italy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: now sure how they found the @D back|pg||
nt|afulton: by the way, on last hand... if ew could have made 7@c/@d ... the score would have been 1440 |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: many moons ago Billy Eisenberg wrote a BOLS Bridge Tip that said "play low from dummy"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. @CJ gains nothing .... ever|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its funny how that works|pg||
nt|idblu: true....let the def guess|pg||
nt|woozle: 4H looking good now - Hughes can't continue diamonds profitably so the long spade will set up|pg||
nt|woozle: probably DQ next, playing neill for T7x|pg||
pc|d6|nt|westjava: a new leader now, 12 imps gain from   10, a double score 4@S here and 2@H there|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra2: for those of you joining us in the morning for european championships |pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra2:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: After ten bids, they ended in 6NT on the 7NT hand in the OR - so a big gain coming to Japan.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: E playing declarer for 3631|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so question shouldn't have been about 2@S but if 2@S=3 then how many @H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As it happens 3NT is the only makeable game|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: how many @H before trying @D?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|idblu: 1:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|westjava: @C and finished...|pg||

mb|1H|nt|xenya: well there were @Ss to deal with too |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not  a hand to be in 6 ...|pg||
nt|afulton: Many thanks to Roland Wald (Walddk2) of Denmark who works many hours to make sure you have great coverage of many events! |pg||
nt|april7: another 6 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nederland seams to have made it ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @H or 6 @C  (hate the break in clubs) |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcarroll: 6@D has possibilities here|pg||
nt|ahh: Sweden should bid 6 to flatten it  but very few ways to get 15 on 1 board |pg||
nt|rodal f: For service by all resalt: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm |pg||
nt|petere: 1 free suit still|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right no clubs ruff|pg||
nt|danilo1: ca North find a bid (revaluate @HJ) over probable 1@H-1NT-3@H?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|charles_l: will E dbl 2@d?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems to have been wrong-sided in the open room|pg||
nt|haans: try it all u get|pg||
nt|werge: It is hard to be the only one in the world, who would not bid 1 @D...|pg||
nt|danilo1: *can ...|pg||
nt|haans: do not belive that|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, 2@S make s it (maybe) more difficult ... but possible 4@H by South |pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make|pg||
mb|4H|nt|afulton: what is south's double? |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: small chance they might try 6nt from south and pick up 2 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: how do they find the @D fit now?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans > I was hoping S to bid Diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: i thunk 3@H show 3-5-4-1|pg||
nt|haans: they are relaying|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: if 6@h is played by W, it is easier to find @d lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: E wont pass this...|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that Bocchi-Auken are exp that they are on lead - only 1 bad board - the 3NT-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: pass=2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yessssssssssss|pg||
nt|daman:  3NT here   has chances to go down, but not many|pg||
nt|daman: zero in fact|pg||
nt|ady: South needs to avoid a club lead|pg||
nt|petere: 3NT (NS) depends on 4 @C tricks, but can't get those @Cs running|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am with you on this one Hans, |pg||

pc|s3|nt|xenya: but all W's cards in the minors were "right", so perhaps his final raise was not too unreasonable -- though somewhat inconsistent with the cuatious style he had dispalyed before|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR just finished (and not on a good note for Badger), so welcome to all those who have come here from the OR.|pg||
nt|haans: and so they made it well done|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same here|pg||
nt|haans: assume it means MAX|pg||
nt|raghavan: But 6D by S may be good - Rare occasion W may not lead SA.|pg||
nt|werge: Double? NO?|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... nice Apek :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: e/w jammed the auction |pg||
nt|afulton: nice job of jamming the signals|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: sorry for bad typing|pg||
nt|xenya: so it might be 13 imps for the trailing team |pg||
nt|henryb: not enough boards left|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: thinking or are we crashing again |pg||
nt|haans: not know|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27 hcp and down 2?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nightmare of a rubber bridge player|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way with xx in @D that S can bid |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet N is sick seeing dummy |pg||
nt|ronpa: opp bid without pts to 5@D nv they have AT LEAST 10 of them|pg||
nt|afulton: I asked about the double because it often isn't played as support over the 2 level|pg||
nt|don paulus: more than close - with @h loser pitched on @c|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that lead is better than a spade|pg||
nt|ritong: can make now|pg||
nt|ritong: for the declarer, yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the other room zia led @s9 specs tell me|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a killing lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but here Henner still has work to do|pg||
nt|ritong: hope north will keep his @c8, for a start|pg||
nt|buddyshah: certain slam, did E really X?|pg||
nt|werge: Probably not|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H is make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: no @D stop = stop!|pg||
nt|charles_l: should always make - @d sets up for a loser discard|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am sure being on vugraf we all noticed the backward finesse in hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: a nice scientific auction, asking NS to lead diamonds, please|pg||
nt|xenya: but the gap is already too wide to overcome, true |pg||
nt|daman: up Simba|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4D now atleast|pg||
nt|haans: have u really counted them :)|pg||
nt|werge: I am not a good counter, honestly|pg||
nt|petere: no he estimated and then subtracted a few to pretend a count|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no misclick|pg||
nt|buddyshah: pass looks like E  Xed or @S forgo 4@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brgpro: could be an important imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume they VIP it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: She has to pass the @D to N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: by playing the @D 9|pg||
nt|ritong: south will split|pg||
nt|werge: Peter, that is in german called "Enthüllung"...|pg||
nt|petere: :9|pg||
nt|petere: ducking this trick ... may help to destroy comm. but does it help for 9 tricks?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|panja: EW could either play a third @D for W to ruff small|pg||
nt|haans: or as I say MAX|pg||
nt|ahh: notice the economy of effort in the relays |pg||
nt|mcarroll: S can expect his AQs to produce at least 3 and probably 4 tricks, so I agree with 4@H call|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|haans: entries to hearts|pg||
nt|haans: asnd clubs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahh: not a bid wasted between 3 and 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: but relay take spades itself|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: nees to play a hearft to the queen|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead could still work now|pg||
nt|april7: with 4 losers N passed? unbelievable,but they have enough imps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: if EW just blast into the slam, i think it's far from obvious to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes|pg||
nt|aupillon: missing cruely the 10 @s|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: at risk now|pg||
nt|ritong: this @d 3 was not a jewel|pg||
nt|daman: another @D by South|pg||
nt|ritong: i think @d J would have been much more helpful|pg||
nt|daman: un autre carreau par Sud|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, when declarer has K9x, it looks bad|pg||
nt|ritong: but anyways, north is not on lead soon|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the other room, declarer played a heart toward the queen|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ko immediato?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: The quiet before the (mild) storm of 14.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could choose to draw trumps and exit @SA and another here|pg||
nt|athene: then eventually the defence have to open diamonds or give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|ritong: a better move imho|pg||
nt|werge: This is in fact a very poor slam, even with the @C King on-side, it´s not extremely good|pg||
nt|ritong: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was careless?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes 27HCP and no fillers|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|haans: spades very right|pg||
nt|petere: 9 tricks via an endplay against East ... ist the suggestion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a revelation?|pg||
nt|haans: @CK and then finesse|pg||
nt|don paulus: and we had very few misclicks - even if Max's eyes are burning after 10 days :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, i agree|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorry on vugraf I should say "Im not sure why south didnt play @d10"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|ritong: right M:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thats standard commentator jargon|pg||
nt|ahh: so when you defend against relay systems  with a suitable hand  preempt  they are not as comfortable |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: undo! :)|pg||
nt|henryb: these are KO rounds, Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I start to became tired..............I lost the hand sorry :(|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: kib asked  is east Frances Hinden?|pg||
nt|daman: he/she would be on lead if South played another @D|pg||
nt|ady: thx kibs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I was wondering how it might make but this lead certainly helps|pg||
nt|haans: i am now corrected KO after 2x 14 boards|pg||
nt|werge: Surprising, that North did NOT just lead a small @D|pg||
nt|werge: So - come-on, how does he make this double-dummy?|pg||
nt|haans: so stay on 12:30 (italy time) for next part|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: of course nothing matters with both diamonds right|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: and gin says North |pg||
nt|werge: This will be first real score for Texan, they bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx Paul|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb: probably down one. no problem :)|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|ritong: you can also content urself with "!", like i do:)|pg||
nt|ronpa: other table had the exact same bidding|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: East is indeed Frances Hinden, one of our regular commentators (Finch)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a busy poster on BBO forums|pg||
nt|daman: this contract was going down had S played a @D and not a @H   still may go down|pg||
nt|ady: not an unreasonable line |pg||
nt|ritong: frances is a remarkable commentator|pg||
nt|ahh: however i do not give a government guarentee with that advice |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: these are long sets for operators |pg||
nt|haans: endplays are not as good as squeeze you never know when it is working|pg||
nt|nubmaster: only 8 now|pg||
nt|haans: Ms Sokolow has only 2 @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes, so she will be endplayed|pg||
nt|petere: @D through and @H back|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: but you may read a book article about relay|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: right these are KO,  forgot format |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, looks like 1 or 2 off -- hardly matters really|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah all is clear now thanks to kibs |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me that Zia did play the @d10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D and A@C and low @S N is endplayed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|werge: Honestly: North had 4 suits for his choce - and all three seems more "normal" than this @H-Queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dont think it can be made, unless @C discard|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am inundated with ways to make - the one I like best is @H to the 7, endplaying S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is getting interesting for N|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: done like dinner now|pg||
nt|raghavan: remove trumps  and develop H  |pg||
nt|haans: @D endplay I say|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nubmaster: the last on Q of @d...|pg||
nt|buddyshah: amazing Operator, by far the best Open room in 6@S|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: hand are with is best in the system|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|ritong: or adopt chess notation and use " ? " for dubious moves and " § " for brilliant moves   " ?! " meaning " unexpected, not sure if it is brilliant or dubious"|pg||
nt|haans: it does not always work|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|ritong: who is vulnerable on the last board?:)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|wwalter: UPS|pg||
nt|danilo1: sure agree with 4@H call .. and very nice done by South ... he knows his pd cannot see twice AQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|haans: KILL|pg||
pg||
qx|o28|st||md|2SKJ9H5DAJT985CK82,S74HK96DK742CAJ65,SAQT52HQJ74DQ6C93,S863HAT832D3CQT74|sv|n|nt|ahollan1: so that defense will NOT get bulletin writeup|pg||
nt|afulton: well bid and well played by west |pg||
nt|woozle: Very soft bidding from Lavings at the other table...appears not to have even tried for seven|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may play in part H|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@H needs a diamond lead to have a chance to beat it and even then 50% or better on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: a grand slam time|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW this time|pg||
nt|afulton: this hand will make 1@h e-w or 5@s n-s|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H cold N/A and 5@S pretty bad|pg||
nt|raghavan: S should double and N will bid 5H |pg||
nt|davidstern: If you divine the diamonds and they dont get a ruff -500|pg||
nt|davidstern: else -800|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand would require some handling by both sides|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: may be next time:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yet another part score|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 7 this time|pg||
nt|afulton: she wont play in partscore in @H if north has a say! |pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: just needs to be sure to ruff a @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: let's we see how NS to get 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: odd?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: odds?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One this one South would prefer to defend a heart contract than play one|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sure|pg||
nt|woozle: East too strong for a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|afulton: double and then raise of 3@s to 4|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Neg X and on for fight bough pairs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: On Board 23, where Hans conservatively settled for defending 2@S and beating it 1, in the OR Fu has made 4@H on an intricate play in which the AK7 opposite Tx of trumps, with Q986 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: in one defender's hand, came into play.|pg||
nt|afulton: crossing fingers that partner isnt totally broke |pg||
nt|afulton: ah, she will make only 4, not 5|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H quite timid. I would have bid 4NT and over a minor bid 5@H to show values|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hoping partner doesnt think I just have 2 suiter|pg||
mb|2S|nt|westjava: 4 should be asking bid|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: well N has X ray eyes that there are 2 losers|pg||
nt|davidstern: So optimal spot on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: So the only big swing so far is 11 to China.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need a @D lead now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W are playing a strong NT so East's 1NT is 12-14 unless I am missing something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not THAT is a lead director 3rd seat 1@S opener :)|pg||
nt|woozle: 1S from Hirata an interesting choice... a bit weird that he didn't want to describe his hand in one bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: I think I would have bid 3@D over the DBL...... to jack the auction up a level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually people have some mechanism for showing majors over a strong club|pg||
nt|afulton: wow, conservative raise!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W needed to force here|pg||
nt|jcwla: All roads probably lead to a @S partial.  W might have forced them up a level with 3@C.|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes might have bid more, although 3C can be beaten a couple of tricks anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: Japan add their imps from   27|pg||
nt|sybarra: seen pard in action (balancing) before |pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S is ok|pg||
nt|afulton: but the 1@s bid could have been made without one of those aces|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I  would do more than raise|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but perhaps a 2@H bid might have given some juice to this auction|pg||
nt|woozle: With the cards lying well, 9 tricks look inevitable|pg||
nt|afulton: lucky diamond situation (i tell you guys, @d's are key to women's bridge!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: now W can pass info to E cheaply|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@C & 4@S both = cue bids|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One of those rare occasions where N can even show QC if they keep going|pg||
nt|sybarra: so many specs suggestion 2 @H as bid bye W |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and it isnt even a great poke hand |pg||
nt|sybarra2: misisng the inside card|pg||
nt|sybarra2: (for the straight)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: if West bidding twice -- i prefer 3@C first   but i think should pass 3@D|pg||
nt|westjava: yes Rob,no use redbl|pg||
nt|westjava: no loser in @C,@D and @S,then...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's that chance :)|pg||
nt|afulton: (which would show LR +) |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: the hand with short @D needs honors to pull trump -- so really dislike 3@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: best to play cross ruff here|pg||
nt|westjava: on @H and @D, yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to be sure to cash the A@C in time|pg||
nt|westjava: dont forget to remember|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ruff cash @CA and A@H and cross ruff the best I can see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't south get to ruff high on 4th @H?|pg||
nt|afulton: South was probably sitting there saying unkind words to partner before dummy hit (and a few afterwards) but all will be well on this hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Best defence is third spade hope for promote perhaps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idblu: only 1 down...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF North overcalls 1N then does Shen still bid 2@S?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|westjava: The new leader,Indonesia...|pg||
nt|davidstern: But East will be hoping for a minor trick|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|westjava: no problem...what can decl do..?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the other hand -- defense against 3@D is easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure why the pitch here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange:)|pg||
nt|westjava: a different plan...|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i dont know either why pitching...what's the line of play??|pg||
nt|mariner1: he did not pitch a loser so|pg||
nt|westjava: better 2@H (very good 3 card spade raise)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This should have been a routine 3NT or possibly 4S for E/W but clearly a wheel has come off|pg||
pc|dK|nt|westjava: 23 - 20 imps now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sad really|pg||
nt|afulton: probably best to take a @c finesse... not sure how many times she will be in south hand!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|davidstern: Would be a great hand if West held @HQ x|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claim|pg||
nt|westjava: I bid directly if only in 6@H:):)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|westjava: may be the answer is yes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nz have got to 3@H by E here other room|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually not good to declare the same suit at both tables|pg||
pc|h9|nt|afulton: much better than a simple 2@s... which could be anything... |pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As spec told. Any lead. It makes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|afulton: these are the kind of hands that when you play them, they take a while because you have to consider all of the variations |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: may miss the @D ruff if not careful |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|woozle: EW must lead low from doubletons, otherwise E couldn't have read the position|pg||
mc|8|nt|jcwla: E/W lead low-high from doubleton?|pg||
pg||
qx|c28|st||md|2SKJ9H5DAJT985CK82,S74HK96DK742CAJ65,SAQT52HQJ74DQ6C93,S863HAT832D3CQT74|sv|n|nt|pelu: could cost 1 IMP |pg||
nt|brgpro: but @h will be played by E the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: last board ...............................see you later :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now. Many thanks to Massimiliano, our outstanding operator in Sanremo. Well done!|pg||
nt|ritong: avoids the dreaded cold game lost|pg||
nt|daman: and this hand is unlikely to deposit 14 IMPs to their account either|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: So the only real big pickup this segment for Badger (and a deserved one) will be Board 6, where Allix/Neve rested in 3@S while Hinden played 3NT.|pg||
nt|werge: By to Munich|pg||
nt|don paulus: next segment was scheduled for 18.00 local time - probably some delay|pg||
nt|rnmalik: thanks all C.........U|pg||
nt|werge: Pass in West? Strange|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brgpro: how many extra bds if the match is a draw?|pg||

nt|haans: something like that yes|pg||
nt|ahh: 780 swing not enough |pg||
nt|ahh: need 900 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 4-1 @S break with K offside kills an otherwise godd 6@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb: don't know baout important|pg||

nt|werge: OK - there was a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She was hoping for @DA with partner|pg||
nt|athene: putting her partner with the @DA|pg||
nt|ritong: after the strict fourth best lead|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case declarer would perhaps have just knocked out the @DA first of all|pg||
nt|werge: Without a @D.lead, 6 @S is a great kontrakt - but @d are for ever|pg||
nt|werge: Makes East (un)happy|pg||
nt|haans: all wrong|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: Thx also to EBU and all of the folks who help bring this important tourney to  BBO |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best way of pytting it I suppose is "declarer took advantage of a minor slip by the defence"|pg||
nt|danilo1: after North open .. guess no stop possible for South below GaME|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
nt|haans: a way so show @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@H is a wee bit wet|pg||
nt|don paulus: probably next segment by 18.15 or so - stay tuned on BBO TV :)|pg||
nt|buddyshah: OR simple 2@H for E-W |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: and Welcome back 12:30 (italy time) match continue|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: last board see you soon and sorry for my mistake ...........|pg||
nt|werge: Take a look at the score - Bakkeren did NOT make the slam|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: mistakes |pg||
nt|werge: Maybe 4 @S is the best spot now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I doubt they will bid beyond game at this table|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: west think a lot |pg||
nt|haans: its has been funny (nervy) match this far|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this segment (these semis are quite short, aren't they?), a big thank you to Roland, Bill, Paul, Mike and all specs.  Some great comments.  The second and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: final segment is scheduled for the top of the hour, so stay tuned.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows 3+ and is forcing. It denies 4 and a minimum|pg||
nt|werge: I think, that West has NO slam-ambitions here - knowing probably 6-5 by East|pg||
nt|mcarroll: putting|pg||
nt|haans: thank you all (beru included)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|april7: what a bad luck for EW again,but its not over yet|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
pc|d3|nt|charles_l: i didnt envisage stayman there|pg||
nt|panja: y, Major suits..so more equal|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: only one think please Massimiliano or Max not Massimo :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: Yuval, a spectator, points out what we said that reaching the phase of 16 it's a very good achievement. True|pg||
nt|raghavan: I like this fast approach to game . |pg||
nt|ahh: game over  bad luck Sweden very well done Vito  from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: see you all tomorrow for the rest thx so much |pg||
nt|ahh: more matches tomorrow  |pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|ahh: thx to our great operator in San Remo  Massimillio|pg||

nt|henryb: and to the BBO staff who make this available to them and you all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a little scary|pg||
nt|nubmaster: agree but not that easy when having both M's|pg||
nt|haans: but an easy make|pg||
nt|werge: Match over|pg||
nt|petere: so, have to go now ... lunch preparing. Thanks all and c u :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3@h could make @s disappear|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Match is not over|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is the first half of 14 boards|pg||
nt|haans: :) GOOD BYE ALL :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Yes and it's exciting, only 4 imps up...|pg||
nt|werge: Masochisme bidding by South|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: Roland in particular who herds us cats (sometimes called commentators)   He works very hard to make this run smoothly  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: simple 3NT |pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: Whats for lunch Massi |pg||
nt|henryb: probably down 1. declarer will take the @c finesse, and a @h shift will sink the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: May be a sandwich or a salad.........very light however I could sleep on 3° tournment :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to you Roland for your yeoman efforts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous and bravi to the winners|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: bye all see you tomorrow for final macht|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of specs,  we appreciate you comments and insights, @H@H!  keep them coming |pg||
nt|haans: this has been a very fun match (to watch)|pg||
nt|danilo1: does it look ike like singleton? ... believe after thinking, declarer more probably plays small|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: nice day tommorow|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mr Haans , I am with you on the good interest of your country team|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: ??? - why not keep communication?|pg||
nt|pelu: before u take the trick - be sure what u wont to play next trick - if u dont know - then dont take the trick!|pg||
nt|brgpro: she was afraid Q10x by dec. and pd Jxx|pg||
nt|brgpro: now she knows QJ10|pg||
nt|pelu: I know that S cant see QJ!0 by decl - Bocchi could have the J - but she has to decide before taking @HA|pg||
nt|charles_l: Max is shorter to type :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: in the meantime 2@h is not going to be fun...|pg||
nt|athene: are you sure 1@S promises 3 spades? an earlier board suggested NS play 1@S = any weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it won't go 8 down which is what's needed to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she both asked and looked at the convention card|pg||
nt|haans: but he has a slammy honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be fun hand also |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: bye|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has 3 1Ss, 2@Ds and 3 @Cs -- unless she is clairvoyant|pg||
nt|athene: and now east's 2@S bid suggests the same|pg||
nt|werge: They might loose all here - North is ready with a DOUBLE|pg||
nt|haans: passing time now|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt is that Turbo?|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, there is a play for 6 @S, even on a @D-lead - but double-dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Ignore the banner (top). It has everything wrong on it|pg||
nt|april7: why didn't N X 4@C???|pg||
nt|buddyshah: now this is interesting|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: if she makes this she will gain 10 IMPS   a day late and a dollar short|pg||
nt|haans: overboard only if they x|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Got any news about the times Roland? Is it 13.30 Paris time for next half?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's a quarter-final from whe *women's* event|pg||
nt|danilo1: despite looks like single, difficult to see the way hamo with @DK not rite|pg||
nt|haans: 2 @C + 1 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still going 2 off|pg||
nt|danilo1: * way home|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: On that lead it's even close to making|pg||
nt|don paulus: he liked that contr|pg||
nt|werge: I think, that South and West should form a pair - same style on this board!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: South has no entry now to the @H-tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: might have done better leading @dK at trick 2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Now she has three heart tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The losers will both win a bronze medal. No play-off for third place|pg||
nt|daman: is there a website Roland?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: is there a playoff for third, or do both semifinal losers get bronze?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: read above|pg||
nt|ritong: see up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|dcbutler: too quick for me, Roland|pg||
nt|daman: thanks|pg||
nt|ady: this might make|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer a simple 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the winning teams go to quarterfinals, losers go to play in the open pairs, or go home crying, or go to a restaurant to get drunk|pg||
nt|werge: Best play was to take first trick with @S Q - K might be doubleton - and an entry was safe|pg||
nt|haans: would you have lead @CQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: is she?|pg||
nt|sybarra: go for your woman's intuition!|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is thinking about it |pg||
nt|sybarra: I can feel it |pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: feel good shirley|pg||
nt|aupillon: it's over ( sung by Robinson)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: undo I reckon|pg||
nt|danilo1: @HA rite card (@C is wrong despite Lavinthal) .. @C cannot go away even if @HA ruffed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye all thx see you tommorrow|pg||
pg||
