nt|blueclub2: Cx Dx Hx Sx|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|hantveit: What could norths hand be? North cannot have spade KQ, because they he would play spade and discart a club.|pg||
nt|hantveit: So east knows north has Club AQ, HA, DA and max one spade honor.|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: presumably @D transfer|pg||
nt|hantveit: would be a fun situation on last hand. If east plays another trumph dec sees that vest is showing out. Therefore take heart ace, ruff a club, dia to ace and play club. If east is ...|pg||
nt|hantveit: using the last trumph, just throw a spade for an endplay|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what is going on here, but as the cards lie you can take 12 tricks in most anything|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And if you are going for 'most anything', NT is a wise decision at matchpoints|pg||
nt|bridge_one: anytime playing conventionals bid it oblige to play the hand from bad site - here Nt better played by North|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could generate lots of tricks with the favorable layout in the majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but lucky to find West with AQJ, so may be a advantage in thid particular hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: 16+11 and no fit, 3nt is probably most pairs choice.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in @C|pg||

nt|panja: not an easy MP play....to finesse @S or not? when after reds or before?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Auken showed 5+ diamonds and a balanced hand|pg||

nt|hantveit: in mp you just close your eyes and run spade J. spade K onside is a higher chance then hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south read the club blockage|pg||

nt|ritong: i think a lot of them use transfers|pg||
nt|hantveit: but some use 3spades as invite, some as 5-4 and so on. so most will probably start with 2H|pg||
nt|ritong: then 2@h followed with 3 NT kinda offer that choice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will be very surprised to find just one who led a club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now  BRINK - DRIJVER   3265.90 55.58  in 4° position |pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, 2h followed by 3nt is probably the most common action|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also after a transfer sequence|pg||
nt|panja: but on 2@H, a few could come in with the @C  bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: but now north knows partner did not double 2h, and spades are out the window - so club might be led|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt 3Nt  is more affective to avoid the @C lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but any who bid 2@C will be unlucky since south has an easy lead directing double|pg||

nt|hantveit: aggressive lead too. must continue with spade J if the lead is ducked. |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: yes this is bridge in the fast lane|pg||
nt|panja: will not duck...can make many more tricks if @D 22|pg||
nt|roswolf: should duck|pg||
nt|ritong: and if @ds roll, he can gather a lot of tricks, so uneasy to duck that|pg||
nt|hantveit: should not duck as west knows south probably has 3+ diamonds|pg||
nt|hantveit: but - if he ducks north nearly always continues... so west still can duck :)|pg||

nt|hantveit: 100 ns might turn out to be a good score|pg||
nt|panja: no suitable bid really, Pass seemed best...although uncomfortable at MP|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but first pass is ok - if the bid would continue 1Nt p p  could reopen with Dbl giving the layout of his hand better|pg||
nt|hantveit: That is bridge, different opionions. On this one we must agree to disagree :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Auken Arnim still first|pg||
nt|hantveit: I get many comments that ew could play 2H. That might go home|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to find 2@H need to have precise gadgets|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|hantveit: if you use some king of xy or similar over 1nt, 2h is to play|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|hantveit: 7+17 ew|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hantveit: Looks like nt is the most likely station|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 2@s by north|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: the real point of the hand is that East can't have known that West was 5/5, else he would have passed 2@H (assuming 2@H was nat and nf)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D multi - the play 2@H/@S 2 suit hand 4/7 hcp|pg||
nt|ritong: saying " if you got @hs this could turn out pleasantly"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: EW can make 9 tricks in NT, I guess they will bid only 2Nt.|pg||
nt|hantveit: if the 2nt is 15-18, west might bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: after 2d the odds are that north is holding heart q. will east find the heart q?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: always difficult bid against multi|pg||
nt|panja: the crucial issue will be @H guess....|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|ritong: daniela got the message of 2@s|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|panja: well well...that is bridge|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without this lead probably declarer couldn't guess the Q, bec 2@S by north meens many @h|pg||
nt|hantveit: I might try a diamond lead with this hand. Sounds crazy - I know. But partner often has 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|hantveit: I ment, if I did not want to start with spaeds.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|panja: 2@S merely means better @H, not an emphasis on @H.....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead with sgl is a risk - @H is correct after the auction|pg||
nt|hantveit: spade is low risks, that would be my choice. and sometimes you find partner with Hxx in spades and dec Hx|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think south should stay with the field and lead @S Q|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: unwillingness to lead a minor against Nt is good, however, here...it had to be weighed agains the risk of partner not having any @H padding|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup me|pg||
nt|hantveit: easier for us - we see all 13 cards|pg||
nt|panja: the point is, dbl depends on @H resistance....and only N knows that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 4@C difficult the Dbl - after 4@D would be more easy|pg||
nt|panja: and S bid twice VUL, so she had to have some strength|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ritong: wouldn t you do that with 2@hs and 4@ds?|pg||

nt|hantveit: agree, but south cannot dbl for blood here. South did bid 2spades in red, and holds only club ace and dia ace of value|pg||

nt|hantveit: West should probably just start with trumph at once. He cannot afford that heart king is onside. Then it is 10 in trumphs with a spade lead and 12 if not|pg||
nt|hantveit: and because not everybody is cashing out the 3 first tricks vs 3nt, you can assume that 3nt 11+ is the score with hK onside|pg||
