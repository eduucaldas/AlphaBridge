nt|ahollan1: not only does this match not have an impact upon which countries represent Zone 7 in Bermuda Bowl -- only 1 pair from this NZ team is going to Brazil|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suspect that technically, they are playing for the South Pacific Bridge Championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This was an event created specifically to qualify teams for Zone 7 |pg||
nt|charles_l: and bragging rights|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the New Zealand PABF [and playoff] Team came in 2nd in the NZ trials -- the winners, a 4-man team won the right to go to Brazil|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: Miller-Stout is the only NZ pair that will play both Macau and Sao Paulo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about the Australia team -- since these are not same pairs as played in PABF|pg||
nt|charles_l: were they selected to augment the winners?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: There isn't - they USED to play a very fancy 1@D opening showing any 5-10 point hand|pg||
