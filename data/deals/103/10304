nt|milton_se: not sure I see N's hand as made for preemption|pg||

nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even a spade lead probably won't be sufficient|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume 1@C was strong and artificial, hence the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|jeanhari: both teams need points to get in the upper half|pg||
nt|jeanhari: al long as dummy covers there are no 5 tricks for defense|pg||

nt|ralfwil: As I play is D that I can take care of at least one of the shown suits|pg||
nt|haans: but cannot lead @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: he does not trust her 2nd seat red preempts|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead awkward here|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 board matches are cut throat - can't afford many bad boards|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry 3@S -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Fingers doing the walking|pg||
nt|kurtove: normal 4 h or 3 nt here|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3NT looks like a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC oliver|pg||
nt|oliverc: Hi|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: hello Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Vladimir |pg||
nt|don paulus: friendly lead :)|pg||
nt|ritong: par is reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks, Roland :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Hans :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: will decl find @DQ??????|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H can be set w AC lead|pg||
nt|pelu: and in OR S - after a @H kead to K - took a finess to the @HJ = -1 in 3@H|pg||
nt|haans: har ingen aning|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes looks 3Nt |pg||
nt|mariner1: well they need defense to tangle up their tricks to make|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wwalter: @s now to be sure about makeing|pg||
nt|panja: the correct play now is a @S|pg||
nt|panja: to guarantee 3@H..|pg||
nt|panja: S must be hoping @H finesse is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not this lead!|pg||
nt|milton_se: AH and JS|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity W that he has to be on lead every time his team wins a trick - E ast no entry|pg||
nt|haans: decl can live long on @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: spade lead best|pg||
nt|jeanhari: close call for west, non vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some looks like tartan or muiderberg |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe you said that already) |pg||
nt|xenya: a 2-suiter, yes|pg||
nt|xenya:  does he have an ace, S is thinking|pg||
nt|kurtove: hard to find the 5 club now|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the match between 3rd and 4th ranking team in final A|pg||
mb|p|nt|kurtove: think so|pg||
nt|haans: think they play 3nt|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not much chance, no reason Gromov to go up with a trump|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 S would have been suffiecient - 9 cards in trumpSpades and equal strength|pg||
nt|mariner1: defense not likely to make a slips as entry to dummy early causes a @D issue later|pg||
nt|jeanhari: with open cards one would play three rounds of clubs now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|daman: EW got overboard but NS really couldn't double|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: no great interest in the play. Just needs to knock out the A@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: 10 tricks  normally to be made = 4S+3H+2D+1C=10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Ralf let us hope to have interesting deals|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sure we do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Curious - best lead is in fact @hQ|pg||
nt|haans: other room did bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rnc: 2NT is an option on S|pg||
nt|rnc: and we will have difficulties handling alias (as well)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Poor;ly fitting hand - would make slam a nice contract on other days - liks a third club in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems straight forward here unless he ducks this @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: just a moment|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: good move by north, the 6@h bid suggests 4or5 @hs and out|pg||
nt|kurtove: wow|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks so but how long?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wwalter: she is greedy :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as noted red vs white sacrifice but declarer hasnt found the @DQ yet but the double may steer him right|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well read by North|pg||
nt|haans: is 5@C good bridge??|pg||
nt|davidstern: Aand no double|pg||
nt|davidstern: Dont know about good bridge but -100 against possible +200 or more likely -790|pg||
nt|kurtove: is 1 club 3+ clubs|pg||
nt|kurtove: he knows that pd is short in spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is it clear that the third double is penalties|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S relay 3@H 3-4-3-3|pg||
nt|milton_se: wise w two 4333|pg||
nt|haans: yep :)|pg||
nt|haans: but they could fist ask then  bid nt|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly decides to stop in 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly safer than 3 nt  |pg||
nt|lestergold: on a spade lead it probably goes off|pg||
nt|kurtove: but its wery red|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|milton_se: getting in trouble if double finesse in Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|haans: hi hedy|pg||
nt|jeanhari: game over...|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Weinstein had 2 reasons to bid game   1. it might make    2. he might stampede the opps into bidding 5@H|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Rob|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: can get tangled up on the hand in 3 nt (imo) |pg||
nt|xenya: not really, Shirley -- 6 @Cs, 2@Ds and @HA -- at least|pg||
nt|pelu: S know that there are 'mirrow'distribution - so 3Nt sh be as good as 4@H - nice bidding|pg||
nt|jeanhari: as most players in the east seat did|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: and might sneak a @S also |pg||
nt|star6ija: nice defense|pg||
nt|xenya: S was facing a tough decision i think -- do we agree with 3@C?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best chance for declarer is that he is sure where the honours are|pg||
nt|jeanhari: both could have happened indeed, not this time|pg||
nt|raghavan: If declarer tried to play S from dummy N may split and lose a Spade trick - I know at this level of top players, it may not come thru. But trial costs nothing|pg||
nt|davidstern: And he doesnt of course|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: 2 spades 4 clubs and dim ace |pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, 6 hearts would make with the diamond break|pg||
nt|daman: they would never split thir honors|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed but |pg||
nt|jeanhari: could cost however with spades 2-2 and clubs 5-1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|milton_se: why cover w Kxx?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: Nice to have u here - I was alone with 2x Sweden, so...:):):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC : http://tinyurl.com/mgwd8y|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|milton_se: and now a D|pg||
nt|hedyg: the CC is from last year so might have made some changes|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: not obvious to read the 8@c, W could have ducked|pg||
nt|haans: AJ right in clubs so soon happy decl|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does not know that Hans|pg||
nt|milton_se: but he can't go wrong|pg||
nt|haans: to swedish champions at other table Mårten Gustawsson and Sylvan|pg||
nt|raghavan: Declarer has to lose 2D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) on Monday. Five more rounds of Swiss tomorrow|pg||
nt|star6ija: after round 7 tomorrow first 27 teams from group A and 5 from group B will progress to the knockout phase|pg||
nt|haans: yes two 10|pg||
nt|werge: I would bid 2 NT|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am guessing it is penalties but what can North sseriously believe they can do to 4@S|pg||
nt|oliverc: Did Declarer really play the Q@D on a small one at trick 1, I wonder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry for being late.Hi all |pg||
nt|Walddk5: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: maybe Lofgren led from xxx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like playing diamonds is best|pg||
pc|dK|nt|milton_se: anyhow he needs a D trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: Good play be the expert devalopping Clubs while in E|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|daman: he would have to use his @D K to do that and that would put him at more risk|pg||
nt|jeanhari: open room in 4@S too|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: 5@C is also quite safe|pg||
nt|ritong: the small danger is to see opponents bid seven @ss, but who does that in the dark|pg||
nt|raghavan: how could he expect 16 points - all missing high honours with W - For a over call need have this strength. some with E and give trick to WSo Declarer may expect |pg||
nt|haans: @H10 may be a trick|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|raghavan: Declarer won first D with Q though could have by 10|pg||
nt|werge: Intermediates are good also|pg||
nt|raghavan: ??|pg||
pc|c4|nt|raghavan: whatever North's idea for covering, it is made easy for W|pg||
nt|oliverc: This seems very improbable :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: declarer would have to make inspired guess to put up Ks to make|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 1/2 NT for me|pg||
nt|xenya: even if he ducks, Rob, it makes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|milton_se: any line i succesful now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in 6 vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 10, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: most don't. Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: lucky clubs 4-3|pg||
mc|10|nt|davidstern: Claiming time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W is caught and must play @d back for a @c discard|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the ruff is with a good trump anyway|pg||
nt|davidstern: ruffing with nat trump trick but he doesnt know who has two hearts and the club ace|pg||

nt|westjava: ohh,ty Lau for info|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no! always 4cM w/Canape|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+ and another transfer response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some can rebid 1N to show 18-19|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: that's a benefit of transfer responses|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes can be canape and 2C denies a major|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@S is normal contract for EW|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: raising with 3 frisky then|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|westjava: undo pls...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that treatment accept transfer = 2/3 support|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, 1NT would have found clubs but also lets opponents in|pg||
nt|westjava: EW with 23 hcp can do nothing...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: Ru could have upgraded to 1N|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|nigel_k:  This is probably asking for trump queen|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|westjava: any thing|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: that is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like EW using accept=exactly 3  so 1N rebid=bal with 2 in responder's major|pg||
pc|c4|nt|westjava: and 2NT rebid show 18-19|pg||
nt|mariner1: careful play makes this|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, very hard |pg||
nt|westjava: may be @D lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W a bit lucky that JD is the twelfth trick|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|westjava: without a @H lead,yes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@D=ask @SQ+side K, 5@S=@SQ, no side K|pg||
nt|westjava: agree Gary|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: the more i see it, the more i like the treatment where 1N is used to show the "jump 2N" strength|pg||

nt|lestergold: im not blaming west for the lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: No, I understand.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A push on 2.|pg||
nt|don paulus: See 4 @s EW - but NS may take out in a minor suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: è assurdoprovare interesse per te lo so ma questo è...........tu che didi?|pg||
nt|ady: well if 6@S is bid in OR   then a save|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are doubled in 5@H|pg||
nt|kurtove: 6 nt|pg||
nt|haans: i like 3@C 3rd hand|pg||
nt|kurtove: because q of spades double|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes - Declarer winng with DQ instaed of 10   later N ducking with DJ|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they cover the cards with their hand sorry sometimes I don't see at all|pg||
nt|haans: Mårten won swedish pairs championship three times running claiming luck|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Henry|pg||
nt|henryb: Hello all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Henry|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H overcall?|pg||
nt|haans: easy 4@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nice hand for south but a weak suit... interesting to see which level he opens the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H i think|pg||
nt|haans: may b 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here it seems|pg||
nt|rnc: Thx Massimiliano|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kurtove: and kqj10 in club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW!|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Deal No 1 - Open room 4S bid and made so Welland gets7 IMP|pg||
nt|milton_se: decent 6C goes down|pg||
nt|raghavan: Henry > I hope u saw > Last deal was interesting |pg||
nt|jeanhari: hand has much potential|pg||
nt|haans: yes 1@H was an option|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@H not my choice|pg||
nt|haans: what is+|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but it will get a raise|pg||
nt|haans: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tiny.cc/eegFD  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|jeanhari: heart partscore for EW|pg||
nt|rnc: Now we know who is who|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N high enough here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Maybe too high|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they mistake plaing on the table and not on bbo|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcwla: 4 of a major here after some interference by N/S probably.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 off for 500 n/s save some profit not the royal mint tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: neve wont be kept out|pg||
nt|kurtove: but 10 of diamonds cant go wrong|pg||
nt|milton_se: well, Cs won't affect it -- he has to get a C trick to succeed|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S possible EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: good board for England|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H  a great save|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be very light as we see here, even vulnerable|pg||
nt|haans: a now 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|raghavan: We are seeing Zia Mahmood as E and Welland as W  They represent USA 2 to world team championship @@ Brazil|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S for EW here but may be hard to reach|pg||
nt|mariner1: easy for E to get them too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Normal contract may be 4H by E|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Not quite right|pg||
nt|haans: many now double meaning 4+ spade|pg||
nt|daman: I like a 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good start though... 1@H p 1@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: she had 2@c+ 1@s as losers|pg||
nt|trotto: an be ,couse error of operator ,Joanna played ,in second trick , ce of  trumps ( and next @sQ) that's correct safety play|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the same imps :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@h= to justify N's choice :)|pg||
nt|trotto: Ace of  trumps*|pg||
nt|panja: Even 3@D might be too high here..|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no........ she claim sanding I give you 2@c 1@s and K@H|pg||
nt|xenya: another 4@H for EW|pg||
nt|don paulus: 5 now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wont encourage north to save|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pressure bid of 4@C opposite passed pd, well within Rule of 2-3-4 guidelines.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too many major suit losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c mandatory at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 3c at green|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh all pass|pg||
nt|raghavan: after 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Zia does, not Welland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Zia's partner is Hamman|pg||
nt|henryb: looks like a straightforward major suit of NT game|pg||
nt|jeanhari: saw a dutch player in the other match open 4@H|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be helpfull|pg||
nt|rnc: Easier now|pg||
nt|mariner1: RDBL a transfer to @c?|pg||
nt|davidstern: The weather here in Sanremo is a lovely 25-27 degrees with some humidity. It is an excellent seaside town to hold a bridge tournament. Lots of accommodation and food options|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N? Some bid?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|charles_l: np grazie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I use D to show a 4-card suit in @s and a bid atleast a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now W has to guess|pg||
nt|davidstern: West is lucky he has the @C8|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @c lead does not really help|pg||
nt|davidstern: Godefory obviously subscribes to the 2NT can never be right|pg||
nt|rnc: And in Sweden it's (still) raining (:|pg||
nt|davidstern: @HA @HK and low heart will likely make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: 3NT  can make  as A@C with North    but 5@C   the better contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he will not punish his pd for the overcall|pg||
nt|milton_se: NS playing 12-14 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: WHO ??????????????????? :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Roland|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult contract|pg||
nt|star6ija: always is dificult to win 3N when you have less points than opps :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Sid Ismail from South Africa|pg||
nt|newmoon: hello Roland, Hi all   :)|pg||
nt|haans: but east will bid 4@S he can count @H|pg||
nt|haans: but who is prempting|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and that´s why i don´t like D inn this sequence|pg||
nt|werge: This 2 @H is not my cup of coffee|pg||
nt|xenya: well not so hard :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: do u know that the X was? - some play that X = 4 card @S and 1@S = 5 card - but X as 5 card @S I have never seen before|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 4@S is criminal|pg||
nt|star6ija: but is very close|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could end here|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure is not a normal RDBL showing count|pg||
nt|daman: nah|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3-6 point less than 4 @d|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: o course can bid 3n gambling if they play it to show this sort of preempt|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will try to find a CC for them|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4NT nat now?|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Sid|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N by South? strange call|pg||
nt|haans: yes all options BUT 2@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 13 tricks here, another 3 imps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|sommer: I would bid 2@H too|pg||
nt|werge: Which confirms my opinion|pg||
nt|mariner1: least not the 10+ .. maybe a neg count|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly, but he has an entry for a @H finesse...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: north probably lead a diamond|pg||
nt|henryb: I think N-S are relaying|pg||
nt|daman: W might bid 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you get an error by clicking on that link, it's because there are too many hits at the moment. Try again later|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Massimilano so it is neg count|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has exactly one entry to dummy and nothing he does works|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: they made one on 1|pg||
nt|milton_se: probably their way w GF hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Henry! I only can see it as forcing  for N to show his distribution|pg||
nt|henryb: South|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: Yes N shall show his...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but for me it´s the reversed way|pg||
nt|henryb: presumably N now knows S is 5=5=0=3 with a minimum and 4 controls|pg||
nt|henryb: which makes his hand much less good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bud in my opinnion N has to downgrade his hand with @dAQxx|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would like to see their convention card - How can South proceed on cue bids without much information from N except game force.|pg||
nt|henryb: actually, once S showed 5-5 in the majors at least one of North's queens became wasted|pg||
nt|henryb: not cue bids; North is asking and South is telling|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: found their best spot|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: First three in each group will qualify for Swiss A after 5 rounds Rest will play in Swiss B |pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: X = 4+ @ss - 1@S = max 3 card @S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sid :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h is in fact better than 4@s on S.|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure about N's 4@H though|pg||
nt|xenya: so probably down anyway |pg||
nt|xenya: but we shall see|pg||
nt|mariner1: W would have been better off ducking that @D to let E in|pg||
nt|mariner1: now W has Zugzwang'd himself a bit|pg||
nt|rnc: ...for a @S-shift|pg||
nt|xenya: a @S now beats it for certain|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sommer: agree|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wwalter: this was a sweet lead 4 declar :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Information.htm   only website I have |pg||
nt|xenya: is there a sure line for 10 tricks here? |pg||
nt|henryb: sure? I don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean without seeing NS's cards of course|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil NS going as you feared to 6C - The X oD will not discourage|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho maybe not third in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: depend on style|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like claim will follow quickly|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to play transfers after overcall so X= @s transfer|pg||
nt|henryb: He said: spades, spades and hearts, hearts at least 5, 5=5=0=3|pg||
nt|werge: Take a look at the bidding in OR - and you get one MORE reason NOT to bid 2 @H|pg||
nt|xenya: not much to the play here it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: N had to remain silent..then, E might not go for game|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably end up with 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dcbutler: 9 tricks for declarer on any lead with this layout|pg||
nt|haans: that has been mpore and more popular|pg||
nt|raghavan: X of D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The slam is roughly 50% and bid at many tables|pg||
nt|haans: what do you think about that lead?|pg||
nt|rnc: This works also, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: so does the @D, as it happens |pg||
nt|mariner1: now W has a real problem|pg||
nt|davidstern: North profile (assuming it is Godefroy) http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=6234 Fantun http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=20158|pg||
nt|rnc: East's @D7 is a good card|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers calling for W to chuck Q@H under AKh|pg||
nt|xenya: one pf the best, yes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|charles_l: helpful|pg||
nt|ritong: although he knows south has a @s top|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is not a good hand for those who subscribe to "always lead an ace against a slam"|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Sid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: S did not seem to have any doubt|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower has certainly seen Apteker's preempts before...  I am surprised here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|newmoon: hi fellow commentators  :)|pg||
nt|henryb: this contract needs the @cK on, the hearts 3-2 and a spade guess. about 20% and it will not make|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf  What is ur opinion of fulfilling the cotract? |pg||
nt|ralfwil: No chace with that lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and makable with a @d lead, if he finds @sQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can ruff the 3rd @s and cash @cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: S should realize why @S have not been led yet|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: @SA would be the only card to let it through|pg||
nt|milton_se: about 48 (stiff S lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: you need 3-2 @S to make, so...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcwla: In OR Reess opened the S hand 3@D, then 4@C by N -- E/W have been pushed to 5@S, a bridge too far.|pg||
nt|ady: west really has the hand for a suit contract  evedn if 2 tricks higher  good controls   but only 1 spade stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: since she clearly has a light opening|pg||
nt|rnc: With no bad breaks, this will bring a 10 home for O'Rourke levelling the match|pg||
nt|xenya: or perhpas you can also cope with 4 spades with N|pg||
pc|c8|nt|raghavan: run Hearts |pg||
nt|raghavan: needs some Diamond discards from Opp|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: key moment|pg||
nt|rnc: Must hold on to his hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: likely 2 off now|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club throw in|pg||
nt|mariner1: E does not need @S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb: surely best to strip minors before playing a heart in case someone (particularly South) has a stiff @hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess you take a deep breath and try the spade hook  |pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Will still make with @HA @HK and low heart|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jeanhari: ruffing diamonds in dummy reating some sort of endplay|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|don paulus: that's what i expected NS to do here - bid 5|pg||

nt|jcwla: 12 to Neve.|pg||
nt|rnc: West has to throw away his @HQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room they passed 2N|pg||
nt|xenya: but his play indicated he was going to take the finesse|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|nt|daman: nice play|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: and there is no possibility to solve the trumph suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|raghavan: Henner does want to gift the slam to NS - and X of D from Partner demands D lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://tinyurl.com/lmqa9z|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in " stolen bid"|pg||
nt|newmoon: didn't matter if he takes or ducks @HK - cash-out situation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: always makeable on N|pg||
nt|haans: only 1 did know hands fitted |pg||
nt|mariner1: only needed to pitch Q@H if S cashed AKh|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: best it seems to ruff out the minors now, then play a trump hoping for @HA singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: hedy @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|haans: how unlucky :)))|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wwalter: time to play trump :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: needed active defence from Opps rather than passive :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: ah ah made|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oliverc: Declarer was alwqays going to be off if he had to open up the Diamonds himself|pg||
nt|davidstern: Finito La Musica for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|raghavan: Bertil can u suggest any way to make - I could not |pg||
nt|daman: but it's not profitable|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|newmoon: lost a trick in the process tho|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: then opponents might help you with @Ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: nope|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s4|nt|henryb: Mark Yeager suggests that you should win the @cA and try to find Qxx of spades with three hearts. If you are convinced that W would not lead away from the @cK that is an approach, ...|pg||
nt|henryb: certainly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: entry short for 9 tricks spades will get overruffed|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|mariner1: N is in 1N here in Open Room|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: with a bang, too -- 3 off|pg||

mb|2N|nt|westjava: Thai leads the way now|pg||
nt|westjava: and 4@S N..!:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: A VIEW i wouldn't favour|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H/@S overcall would be 4M & 5+minor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North does have a good hand but slam is a long way off and the diamonds are a worry|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: if not Capp or DONT,what's the name of 2@D by N..?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I assume she was considering a heart slam not a spade game|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: all VUL and 1@S pass out|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|mariner1: as the card lie 2 and even 3@H has play NS|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: @H and a minor:)|pg||
nt|westjava: may be:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it looks a bit like Woolsey where 2@D="multi" but Kit's version DBL covers the 4M & 5+minor so 2M overcall = 5M+@C/@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: there are several NT defenses that use transfers|pg||

nt|haans: M löfgren|pg||
nt|haans: weak 2 2 aces???????????|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3NT now is possible for NS|pg||
nt|werge: Was South afraid of NOT getting the @D Ace?|pg||
nt|xenya: seems communications were a bit awkward for declarer to take a safety play in @Ss|pg||
nt|davidstern: EW have to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK OK Finita I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: the cards lie well for N-S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 2 - EW went to 3NT down 1 - So Welland got 5 IMP - now total 12|pg||
nt|jeanhari: speculative, too much lenght in clubs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but could be a winner|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Best chance to get into the bulletin|pg||
nt|haans: is H Welland Mr Welland?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Mr welland in west |pg||

mb|d|nt|kurtove: 6 h or 6 cl or 6 nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: CC is from Pau, might have made changes since|pg||
nt|haans: not any more :))|pg||
nt|aupillon: 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be weak NT for the double by Nunes|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|milton_se: this should be 4H making|pg||
nt|milton_se: but S has to duck a S lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: they do play leb here|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@d also as well as 4@s|pg||
nt|newmoon: so probable 3D... or even 5D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 4), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting mix of cards here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not for sure, wellannd cant see through the cards didnt took the best line|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 2@s in 4th maybe?|pg||
nt|panja: if a @C is not led, NS can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think you need 4@s together with 3 @h|pg||
nt|henryb: what would you respond with the S hand?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might make in W|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: bad lead mister|pg||
nt|haans: she was called henner in previous match|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she gave me her name :) Welland H.|pg||
nt|daman: do they play DONT?  or a version of same?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Need to get spade lead and sneak through a heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or get two hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  too high at the vulnerability for n/s   even if guessing the minor suits well|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont happen much on this deal either|pg||
nt|haans: no boring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 8 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|daman: Garner will get frisky here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: 2@c by S = ??????|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It is not this board|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome to misfit corner|pg||
nt|jcwla: Leslie likes this auction so far.|pg||
nt|ritong: won t happen|pg||
nt|aupillon: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play X= strength vs weak NT|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces now nowdays :)))|pg||
nt|rnc: And with spades 4-1 North would probably have tried to tap declarer by continuing hearts|pg||
nt|daman: with his @C void|pg||
nt|jeanhari: thats looks forcing to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: or @H lead and win 2@H with no @c shirt|pg||
nt|rnc: Will be hard to stay out from 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 2@c must be drury|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: in cl|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H my bid|pg||
nt|kurtove: 7 cl|pg||
nt|hedyg: vs strong double would be 5m+4M|pg||
nt|milton_se: easy now|pg||
nt|kurtove: and now its easy|pg||
nt|haans: none nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: if so they get too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm they may well miss their heart fit|pg||
nt|newmoon: took 4@S as a cue?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they yook wrong way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c for me|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s seems very conservative, but driving to 3@s seems like a lot|pg||
nt|raghavan: Will HQ be the lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well brave effort by west with 7 count|pg||
nt|dcbutler: not at this vul|pg||
nt|ritong: now west has a serious problem|pg||
nt|ritong: his part showed a good limit raise |pg||
nt|dcbutler: wonder how much 2NT showed?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   looked enough with that collection|pg||
nt|ritong: agreed|pg||
nt|dcbutler: looks like a mixed raise (at best) to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oliver can you explain the bidding - I could not understand what is 2Club by S?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead in any case|pg||
nt|haans: we do not have their cc|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think they will make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes @H lead and it looks good|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphztg: IT IS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I'll say, both aces on side, the qj of @H flopping |pg||
nt|xenya: VERY well, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: would this bid not show a stronger hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ady: east hoping for the best here  QJ spades look poor values on the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: was 4@H fast arrival (negative bid) ?|pg||
nt|haans: why not start with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: trouble:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pre empts creat problem - that is what is intended|pg||
nt|newmoon: makes sense, Hans  :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is matter of style, but...|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|davidstern: As long as declarer doesnt try a spade to then|pg||
nt|davidstern: ten|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S 2@H 4@D and it makes in no @c shift|pg||
nt|davidstern: But if declarer plays hearts straigh back there will be a smell in the air|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but it will not be clear to N what it is from|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer's best play @HK and low club to hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think win @H and play one back is it|pg||
nt|davidstern: That will certainly get a club ace shift I suspect|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bet not :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table finessed @S10 I am told|pg||
nt|mariner1: i n@@o 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: if declarer plays @Ds now, it shouldn't be difficult for N to work things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|rnc: If win and continue hearts, doesn't it looks like you have fast tricks? Just need a second @H-trick. Then the @C-shift is more likely to come|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: tre other 3 hand = the bidding, but S??|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe South's 2@C shows both majors, but West doesn't care|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|pelu: or dont know? - if opp alert 2@C u dont exp both majors .)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: We had a problem at the begin, they switched Open and Closed Room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
nt|ritong: danger zone entered|pg||
nt|ady: yes    too high now|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@c is not possible because it is forcing to game (artificial in their methods)|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in trouble now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pelu: and he will make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I was away a minute|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it a weak opening in a Major?  and 2H by N is pass or correct?|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sounds like it|pg||
nt|xenya: i could make this contract|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now will he pas this dbl?|pg||
nt|daman: the 3@S bid was uncalled for|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must be|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: how about a @C?|pg||
nt|mariner1: thinking too long also gives them a signal|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|haans: 13 hcp for opps|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by S - also 5D makes but this 4H is a trial on way to 5D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: But all in all, the auction could have been considerably worse.  This spot is reasonable if perhaps not ideal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he didnt know he would find partner with 100 honours in dims|pg||
nt|haans: may be 10-12 nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: W not happy about the pull here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must know his partner has stretched|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may pass 4D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if E tries to reason out the cards it should show him W has a @c stack,,,,,,|pg||
pc|sT|nt|raghavan: a good lead 1H+3Spades + atleast 1 minor K|pg||
nt|rnc: Me too...|pg||
nt|sommer: like a walk in the park:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but normaly south should have some fit for bidding 3@S in second round|pg||
nt|daman: if you live by the sword you should be prepared to die by the sword and pass 4@C doubled|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: this should be a useful swing to Neve|pg||
nt|kurtove: do they play 2 club as gf?|pg||
nt|mariner1: same play here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still need club now though|pg||
nt|davidstern: North can divine that declarer is looking for ninth trick and might get aggressive|pg||
nt|xenya: can postpone that|pg||
nt|mariner1: now N knows W has the @H's|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think North will get this right|pg||
nt|davidstern: He knows declarer likely has 3 spades and four diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N in fact made on 3 so 7 imps to Herbst|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will give north due credit if he does it but I wouldnt think it is defence of the year material|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @S finesse looks a reasonable play|pg||
nt|mariner1: the other problem is if N plays A@C what are S's signals?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am betting @CA next|pg||
nt|xenya: at least it's the only legitimate chance to make -- or nearly so|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: S doesn't know that, of course -- from her perspectibe, contract mau be in real danger |pg||
nt|henryb: this is not worth a 15-17 1N (I do not know their range) and Jx is not a holding you particularly want to have as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5422 pattern  (yuck) |pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has already his 2 suiter hand If W still doubles, E must respect w decision|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Zia bidding immediatly as south|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: the spot is ok its just the layout which is savage of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|ritong: hello G|pg||
nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: looks like I missed some action already|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, first boards swinged|pg||
nt|daman: this will swing too    doomed|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not neutral either, rite|pg||
nt|daman: aggressive bidding by West opposite a passed hand   will pay the price|pg||
nt|rnc: And it's not the Jurassic one this time|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a classical way to only loose 1 @s trick. a small from the table to 7 and next @sQ pinning the @sJ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well I was half right but -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done Godefory|pg||
nt|davidstern: Godefroy|pg||
nt|mariner1: small @c works too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's good enough - 12 IMPs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|xenya: sigh of relief from S|pg||
nt|xenya: now she will be quick to grab 11 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: W in 3N in Open Room here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcwla: In the OR W passed the 2@C rebid and Hinden went -2 for -200.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Leslie knows that preventing spade ruffs more important than worrying about trump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: in most natral systems the ability to show heart suit in  a weak hand would not exist|pg||
nt|ampelman: my version is from july 2008|pg||
nt|hedyg: the players all had give in their CCs before play started, shame we have no access to them|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|raghavan: 4 Spades, 5D making but did not stop|pg||
nt|sommer: but no overtrick with @Sshift|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: We dont know, but asume that West didnt know :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised to see they play 2@c as weak both majors as they are not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c4|nt|oliverc: Apparently, NS play Dwururka - the Little major like system developed by Pazur|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's going on?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: renonce by west director on table|pg||
nt|jeanhari: such dull board, operator must com into action !:)|pg||
nt|haans: i think Heller say 1 trick for @HK|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kurtove: 2 cl not GF|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: can claim that now|pg||
nt|lestergold: good defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Mu sequence had been 1@s - 2@c 2@d - 2@s - P. 2@s had promised a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes nice swing here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: now the trump trick is still there!! and all the spades too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi yer  Bill|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of rebidding 1NT with the E hand.  Certainly reasonable to rebid 2@C (as both did) with nine cards in two suits, but 1NT would have worked like a charm here to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: allow E/W to drop dead in 2@H.|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill.|pg||
nt|milton_se: killing lead though|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: still one|pg||
nt|haans: and still a spade loser|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 off also ?|pg||
nt|ady: 7@HX  on board 16 should have been a save against a vul 6@S making    but the contract in open room was 5@HX|pg||
nt|daman: East assumed a Drury stance with 3433  9 count    not clever|pg||
nt|ritong: well it saved some anyways|pg||
nt|ritong: which is the target of sacrifices:)|pg||
nt|daman: some of those targets are pretty small|pg||
nt|ady: turned out an 11 imp loss rather than a possible 12 imp gain|pg||
nt|daman: Barry Crane used to say....."Only Jesus saves..."|pg||
nt|kurtove: so it is a bit hurry to bid 4 h now, i think|pg||
nt|davidstern: One thing that has impressed me in these championships is the very large number of young people at this tournament|pg||
mc|8|nt|raghavan: D 10 ruff is begging|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Who would have thought this 1NT would take about an hour to play?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bet if W has won @H in hand and led one back this would have made|pg||
pg||

nt|westjava: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW in 4@S here I think|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  partscore swing to China on the second board - they made 2C at the other table and 2S here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|an| |nt|mariner1: 6@S is too much with @c ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: 6@S down by @C lead:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: true that contract is also there|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not a fan of overcalling 2C on that sort of hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor me |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: here is same, never overcall this w/5332 and poor @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: Thai gain 8 imps from   2, play only 3@H|pg||
nt|westjava: @D lead..??|pg||
pc|d2|nt|westjava: a good stop|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|westjava: but enough tricks for decl|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mariner1: I was thinking small @c back hoping S has A@D and will cash and lead one|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: sets up the 1 trumptrick :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Can she find KH now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: if trust E @ST, always @HK|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: next pl |pg||
nt|mariner1: 8@C asked for the @H switch which was also reasonable|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  Actually East will be squeezed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|westjava: yup:)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  His best hope is partner with 9D|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|h6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: an awful bid reaps its reward|pg||

nt|henryb: more 4@h contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3 down sorry :)|pg||
nt|daman: easy @S game now   a breather|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 3 - again IMP to Welland - OPEN room bid 3NT made 5 |pg||
nt|oliverc: if one has say 4 + spades is suppose to bid 1 D - 2 below actual call :) So 1C = 4 +|pg||
nt|oliverc: H. So presumably 2@C was a weak 2 in Hearts|pg||
nt|werge: Solid game - bad slam, but both can make|pg||
nt|raghavan: deal 24 5 IMP to Welland - 2h made here, 1NT made by team mates|pg||
nt|mariner1: another misfit here|pg||
nt|davidstern: I bet not|pg||
nt|mariner1: sometimes thinking just alerts the opponents|pg||
nt|davidstern: Defence always wary when declarer plays to establish tricks in your suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would take your money David :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: BRB|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if east bids 6@S, Sabine had better lead the right ace!|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6C for EW|pg||
nt|aupillon: stop before 4 spades ? :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: sort of|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: the push to 5@H on the last cost 10 big ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: looks like 12 tricks in @s for E. why? well, you tend to lead from your short AK....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so Badger's on the board with 3.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 down how come i missed something obviously|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@C/@D by EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: but not a good slam|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt good prempt|pg||
nt|aupillon: now minor slam in progress ...|pg||
nt|kurtove: 5 club|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely changed their system, last year this was 20-21|pg||
nt|aupillon: try 4 spades, a Splinter bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 23 here NS 3NT-2, in OR 4D made so welland gets 8 IMP|pg||
nt|newmoon: they should get to 6@H here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@D must show the majors here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: really he alerts pass ...............|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: but not when west has shown hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: the vulnerability should deter EW from sacrificing|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Bergen now?|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d would a tad pushy|pg||
nt|milton_se: doesn't look like that :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: only H lead sets 6C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that means that after  - alt least - 1@s opening it´s impossible to play 1nt|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to stop in 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as he now surely will|pg||
nt|ritong: be*|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in fact north pass :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S best contract|pg||
nt|haans: or 21D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For E/W anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@H looks the limit on good defense|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, 12 tricks in 4@S with a good view|pg||
nt|raghavan: D bid showing both majors |pg||
nt|mariner1: problem is N might think they need to guard over tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: very true, Rob, but N shouldn't be caught sleeping here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well as I said, thinking that long alerts the opponent that there is an issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok - maybe he won't get the chance|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I raise,  wonder if 2 @S or 3 H! is better |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H |pg||
nt|don paulus: ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The club layout might see this one home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here game to be bid but both 3n and 4h look precarious on thelayout|pg||
nt|pelu: 11-14 5-5 in m|pg||
nt|haans: not an easy make  4-1 in @H|pg||
nt|newmoon: Zia's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|haans: only @CK right|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h possible here, even though the trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bd 2 hot wines get 12   and Bd 3 - Zeleski get 10 IMP |pg||
nt|henryb: that is correct. its not my choice but it would be the most common over here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Running scores are back|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass might be 5-7 count|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|d|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
nt|oliverc: Apparently 2@C was 4+5+ in the Majors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will bid 3 I presume|pg||
nt|jeanhari: too late for predictions :)|pg||
nt|haans: yes prepared to stretch|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So Bessis on the board|pg||
nt|haans: icedlandic pecision perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men då kan jag påpeka att typ ägg typ inte är helt rätt...|pg||
nt|werge: or 2 of them...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Some play X as 5-7 and pass is <4|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might bid 2@S here..... and play in a Moysian a level lower|pg||
mb|3C|nt|milton_se: the reasonable contract|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|aupillon: sure,clubs 2/2, diamonds 2/2....|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: I am getting some tea|pg||
nt|ritong: showing @ds and @ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: very fat 2C -- may be hard to communicate|pg||
nt|jeanhari: should help enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: with limited access to dummy this helps solve one issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s would be an egregious overbid|pg||
nt|ritong: bergen style not popular in france|pg||
nt|daman: merci|pg||
nt|daman: quatre piques fait cing ici|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|daman: cinq*|pg||
nt|ritong: joli , G|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table North playing 3@D on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Precision is SO much easier to understand LOL|pg||
nt|newmoon: swop @H8 and @H7, and it gets difficult    :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: missed... 1@s overcall slightly misleaded them|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer shouldn't be given a chance to get a spade away from either hand on a long minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt must be lebesohl|pg||
nt|haans: leben|pg||
nt|raghavan: good lead |pg||
nt|milton_se: only +1 now|pg||
nt|raghavan: there are 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|newmoon: panel - response to 1@C?   1@D or 1@H ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: not to be|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3@H for me too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's one (of many) reasons why Meckwell usually play so fast|pg||
nt|mariner1: the VUL position makes this tough|pg||
pc|dK|nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow saly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hans you havent seen commentators manual Page 4 Paragraph 7 - we save bandwidth and do not correct minor typos|pg||
nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: May lose 1-2-2-1|pg||
nt|davidstern: For -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H not played could have developped 1 more in D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks quite normal though -- and makeable|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if south didnt find a spade lead there is no way he wouldnt find the switch when in with Kc|pg||
nt|kurtove: if he entres the table|pg||
nt|davidstern: That lead looks helpful but if he puts up @CJ and finesses heart will prove a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D down in other room|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: common now  1@D transfer :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 9 top tricks - 1S + 4H +3D + 1c  more may come by CK finesse etc|pg||
nt|newmoon: Kib says "guess this is a good example for walsh even on a good hand."|pg||
nt|haans: i would show my hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sure west should show Hearts  |pg||
nt|newmoon: well... whatever, this match is based on "winning on the opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@d,3@s and jump (which King will be chosen?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|charles_l: no takers :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: making 12 now|pg||
nt|haans: standard is to bid @D only with longer @D|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s Jack could be ducked now and black squeeze after that for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: nooo|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3@H does seem on|pg||
nt|mariner1: making is worth an imp|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: un autre pique|pg||
nt|daman: un carreau est faible|pg||
nt|daman: that's my frendh for today|pg||
nt|daman: French*|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: or dim if thats the way declarer plays it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H by E would have been relay|pg||
nt|milton_se: in fact 2 (J dropping)|pg||
nt|haans: ame squeeze|pg||
nt|haans: sme|pg||
nt|haans: same|pg||
nt|star6ija: still possible, yup|pg||
pc|h4|nt|aupillon: aha|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: yes ruff 3x@c disc @D - ruff @D ruff @h and u will have 12 tricks in the end|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 5), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||

nt|brgpro: one spec. asked me if the ladies have sit S or E in this event, i guess yes|pg||
nt|athene: -450 can't surely be bad for NS|pg||

nt|wwalter: @d than @h|pg||
nt|ritong: "my grand gin card" allix thinks|pg||

nt|hedyg: he must have been worried about where all the @ss were|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb: it is a bad habit|pg||
nt|raghavan: a costly 1NT - If S passed they will be playing in a part score.|pg||

pc|hT|pg||

nt|mariner1: in other match  Denmark 15  Harangozo 1  5 to score|pg||
pc|c2|nt|charles_l: @s also ok - can force a reentry|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|kurtove: sry|pg||
nt|henryb: not that costly. West would have balanced with 1N and east west tould play 1N or 2H|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 4 they also played in 3S-2 = Push|pg||
pc|c8|nt|charles_l: now a bold @h|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps and play three rounds of diamonds now|pg||
nt|haans: precision 2@C opening in other table paid this time|pg||

mb|1H|nt|pelu: same in Sweden - I am told - so only the South-country discriminate .) - In Germany lady S and W!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That's not good enough, Murat. It's sexist|pg||
nt|wwalter: how 7?|pg||
nt|charles_l: sitff @hJ and dummy reverse|pg||
nt|wwalter: any play would lose 1@h|pg||

nt|pelu: so the 5-level is max for both sides - will they fight on 6-level? :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW Turkish, apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk5: However, this is not about winning according to Pierre de Coubertin|pg||
nt|raghavan: a X bid is good for S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I must bid on S now i prefer D|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: easier if played in S but still makes|pg||
nt|davidstern: Cash 3 spades and a diamond and gain an IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on TOOLBAR|pg||

nt|mariner1: a @S lead on the auction in Open Room might be called for|pg||
mb|d|nt|MolvaM: that the screen partners on one side should be one lady and one gentleman|pg||
nt|athene: i know Sabine Auken doesn't like it - she complained about it in her book :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: interesting hand -- 5D makeable (but a bit double dummy)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil, Diamond bid is due from E |pg||

nt|haans: zia has never bid polish|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a @h lead from S I vote for -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: a natural D lead is there - may shorten Declarer's trump holding|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: well E bids the @S here, so auction will be different|pg||
nt|mariner1: S may end up playing 3N now|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: well I was talking about the general EBL rules :)|pg||

nt|milton_se: not happy w spades bid by LHO...|pg||

nt|henryb: although he will be disappointed to find the @sK offside|pg||
nt|raghavan: He will try to enter Dummy thru SK or CJ|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|haans: but very close :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no it isnt... maybe it is after the lead|pg||

nt|jeanhari: small club?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On a spade lead, i wouldn't like to predict the outcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: might  beat 1nt   lead a spade    and switgch to clubs|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3N has play NS, not easy|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: Spain : Lady N and E :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: sorry for the word Easy...nothing is easy in this game|pg||
nt|aupillon: but slam no way cause 2@c opening bid|pg||
nt|haans: 4 diamonds????????|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S by W now might make it pretty hard for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H shows a huge hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Say a woman wants to sit West and you tell her that she can't. Isn't that sexist? I am just asking|pg||
nt|xenya: but not this one?|pg||
nt|star6ija: one problem decided|pg||
nt|newmoon: tough for Gower to find a @H-lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: ok, if the result is correct, np|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wwalter: I see playing rederse summy, ruffing 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s looks making as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: if south had raised to 4@D i am sure west wld have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed not|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find who should play 4@H|pg||
nt|kurtove: must be worth trying 4 h with that hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: problem for Gromov heren, choose the right bid as the cards lie|pg||
nt|raghavan: that is the 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must take it though|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: this hand is not trivial if N-s play more @h|pg||
nt|kurtove: in North|pg||
nt|haans: play 1 @D get it claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: huge dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 rounds of @d a @c shift and a @c discard on next @d|pg||
nt|sommer: small @S lead..and?|pg||
nt|werge: Down on the nnaturral @S-lead|pg||
nt|rnc: as predicted, 3NT from the South seat|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows S has a @S stopper so.............|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but south was + score|pg||
nt|sommer: then "noisy":)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: alsways down on 6-2 as defenders will switch to a spade|pg||
nt|xenya: well done, though i'm not sure how|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
nt|haans: but that is pairs thinking|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|mariner1: migth see the @D switch now|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
nt|aupillon: and slowly, but surely, thry drew their plans agains us ( War of The Worlds)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland has to find @S Jack now|pg||
nt|werge: You have seen to many crimi´s in TV, when you think a @D-lead is good. North MUSThave been misinformed about the 3 @S-bid|pg||
nt|sommer: so it became (maybe) a great and lucky gain for the Americans|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but top @c ducked and then east is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: as it  turn o ut 2 hearts  or even 2@D  works better for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: luxemburg has done well this far|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match both in 3N, making 3 and 4|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ALL results on the board already recorded http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.06..795|pg||
nt|rnc: Prospect looks bad from West's point of view|pg||
nt|davidstern: Change that 006 for any other board number|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows E has to have something, and the only thing he can have is A@D or K@D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
nt|star6ija: now twelve tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 12|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: and would have passed with K@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
nt|raghavan: Should play D and continue to shorten S in trumps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: defence will hav e to do the right thing though|pg||
nt|henryb: really? Is N trying to let this make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Defence is not on top|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: So on that board which required a club switch to beat 3NT http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=004.06..795|pg||
nt|mariner1: there goes the beer card|pg||
nt|davidstern: And you will see about half the field is beating it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
nt|newmoon: Will exit a @H after next trump|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|henryb: I take that back, but North's plays to tricks one and 2 seem strange|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||

nt|star6ija: 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i only can when i am commentating, not at table :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: double|pg||
nt|raghavan: ultimately end in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: wellands do well her|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks 3@H would not hve been forcing...?|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score heree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ew open in 3NT..|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: oh no|pg||
nt|hedyg: not over 1@d|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showing Diamonds, perhaps? :)|pg||
nt|haans: double to follow|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s = 5+@s and a minor, less than an opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N takes his 2@d tricks and plays a @c there is -2|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|henryb: 7@c is a good contract and cold on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt likely to come home here|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play strong @c, thus the 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: now S in 6@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Dael6 1NT -3 here, 1NT-1 in OR. so 5 IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now!|pg||
nt|pelu: over 5@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: he must X now|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauria 8East) in box - 6@D making on @H-lead|pg||
nt|murat: Sen has enough values to balance the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Zia may come to life|pg||
nt|newmoon: belated x by Zia may lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: action begins|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wwalter: most of us :)|pg||
nt|ritong: this will go fast|pg||
nt|oliverc: With a void in Partner's Hearts, though?|pg||
nt|haans: prempt from slam thinking|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont get to high this way|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid 3S |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  looks the best shot|pg||
nt|raghavan: N will pass I think - May bid D if what charles said is correct - that 1S shows Diamonds by S|pg||
nt|murat: misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead a small @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is new minor I suspect or a forced relay|pg||
mb|3C|nt|raghavan: D J is natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: strong nt why 3nt?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|raghavan: or a low D|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh sorry N on lead|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wise pas from mr Welland|pg||
nt|werge: In Turkey: 23 HCP = game|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be too high -- or...?|pg||
nt|sommer: MA lead for 6 imps one or the other way|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 3@C super-accept|pg||
nt|panja: the bad break in @H will defeat this|pg||
nt|athene: there won't be much to go on regardigg @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: regarding|pg||
nt|raghavan: If that understanding is not there, he should pass - N has told his story - South must decide|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower did good, else 3@S gets whacked|pg||
nt|werge: Not with this lead...|pg||
nt|xenya: it may not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4th suit also possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: they will do well to bid 6 i think|pg||
nt|xenya: ah!|pg||
nt|henryb: a big chance for Hansen|pg||
nt|haans: @C and can go down|pg||
nt|haans: even with spades down possible|pg||
nt|oliverc: It seems to me as if all 4 players are bidding their hands without considering what|pg||
nt|april7: if 1@S shows @D then why didn't N bid @D, but now S did|pg||
nt|oliverc: opps and partner have bid|pg||
nt|henryb: here N-S missed a decent @s slam; an excellent one if played by North|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@c is a little bit agressive (politely said) in the OR|pg||
nt|star6ija: running scores at http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dcbutler: good idea by south - can she make it?|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   showed I believe showed 5 hearts and 4 spades and forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: mrs hinden has a tough switch to make|pg||
nt|ritong: @d jack could slip |pg||
nt|murat: they are still ok|pg||
nt|april7: S will start a crocss ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s lead makes the things difficult for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: @h also|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|werge: East stays to his @S-leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
nt|werge: Easy to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
nt|davidstern: This could get ugly|pg||
nt|haans: does east  havbe @HK?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf - we were talking about a better defense by NS In Open room same 1HX -1 Push!!!|pg||
nt|haans: yes he had already overbid a little :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing very important here|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might think S has @D cards on this auction,,,,,, the lead is not easy to find|pg||
nt|xenya: actually you just need to lead any @D here to beat it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but a @D lead is tough is it not?|pg||
nt|xenya: just lead the only unbid suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kurtove: thats a nice turn|pg||
nt|davidstern: Duck and a club ruff and another heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry club ruff and spade for -1|pg||
nt|haans: safer to play @HA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even if he wins this he can play a high spade honour they get a club ruff and then perhaps black suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|kurtove: its a problem to take the ace if east have the rest of the hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: So Heart Ace and seconbd trump then @SK win diamond ruff spade and ruff diamond and trump will nail West|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@D is a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can get C ruff|pg||
nt|newmoon: a very strange @HQ, if u count the points...|pg||
nt|haans: i assume 2nt was lebensohl so that was no option|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland know all the points, but the shape is also unfavourable|pg||
nt|star6ija: Slam reached at the Open Room|pg||
nt|star6ija: distance shortenned|pg||
nt|rnc: He did!|pg||
nt|mariner1: there it is,,,,, well done|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room the lead was a small @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|mariner1: the defense helps with the @D play|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
nt|davidstern: oops|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: soade switch is awkward after cashing clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 13 precious IMPS back|pg||
nt|rnc: If taking care of this good start, it will bring Herbst back in business|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
nt|rnc: I must admit I would have passed 1NT without a thought|pg||
nt|xenya: me too|pg||
nt|sommer: gtg.. tnx and cu|pg||
nt|werge: But I do´nt like the blocking play, declarer has made in the @C-suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: defense needs to play spades|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
nt|raghavan: a D to KQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: SAK|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best set of board, in the other BBO-match the score is 7-0 after 8|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
nt|ritong: well played by east, a @d and it was over, since west would certainly play a @d back|pg||
nt|ritong: now on the surface, west has to duck the @d K|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal defense at this level|pg||
nt|dcbutler: that doesn't help, does it?|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that will not help|pg||
nt|ady: should make now   with diamond position favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: she might play a @d from hand right now|pg||
nt|kurtove: he was thinking that east never would have turned hearts without the king|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so much more to see here :)|pg||
nt|haans: :( may get better soon :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3N Open Room here,,, EW like to bid'em up in Open Room|pg||
nt|daman: not always the best sdtrategy but it worls like a charm on occasion|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
nt|kurtove: And I agree|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will be forced to take 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|milton_se: +2|pg||
nt|raghavan: H9|pg||
nt|haans: now WH may miss playing @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would not bet on that|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: they need 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs to Neth White House|pg||
nt|haans: still 10|pg||
nt|star6ija: possibly|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - not even vulnerable, I would try for game|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: cash two clubs and then @HK and @H10 - even if you lose to east's @HQx, she may be endplayed anyway with @SA|pg||
nt|raghavan: loser on loser|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 25|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after this round. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: H thrown anyway|pg||
nt|star6ija: and small @h back|pg||
nt|raghavan: Welland is fortunate that North does not have better than C3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: as far as inviting goes - conventional wisdom is that you don't want to play in the invitation very often, so you want partner to accept more often, i think?|pg||
nt|daman: nice|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will a long break before the Swiss begins. Restart at 17.30 Paris, 4:30 pm London, 8:30 am Los Angeles, 11:30 am New York|pg||
nt|haans: ohh how funny it is|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: That's how I feel.  I prefer the invitation to be one last chance to decline game with the absolute pits; otherwise, we go.|pg||
nt|daman: still going to make|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|raghavan: why not DQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|murat: Ace ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|milton_se: sorry, +1|pg||
nt|werge: This is an 8% game|pg||
nt|raghavan: play C |pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: excellent board for the french team|pg||
nt|raghavan: first time ruffed with 10, now 6?|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @c 3 is enough to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|werge: Maybe 8½...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|westjava: Japan, leads the way 1 imp from   19|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not sure what Dawei's plan was with 1@C opener if partner responded 1@H showing @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: just no real play for 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bid 1N ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: agree aholl view|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1NT is 14-17|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and fortunate cards 3N can't be beat|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: After @CQ @CJ @CA @C4, W suddenly called small @C from dummy, S claimed all tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: 4@H or 3NT EW is ok now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: but has strength for 1N opener so can't be that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: 3@D = Good Trump Bad Point explained by W|pg||
mb|3N|nt|westjava: 4@S on the way...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice treatment  Assume 2N is @S raise so DBL for takeout|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: August,I think|pg||
pc|c3|nt|westjava: so,I dont like ur 3@C pd,S said...|pg||

nt|mariner1: good judgement|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,S will bid 4@S if his hand @CAxxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think i'd try @D3 lead - but don't really like any choices|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been hard by the 12 if S runned one|pg||

nt|mariner1: I too do not like those, especially low from a J if p did not bid or imply the suit|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||

mb|1H|nt|brgpro: coffee board coming up|pg||

nt|raghavan: Deal 6 - here went 2Down in 2S - Open -3D by E made so push|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6H by South making but not by North (D lead)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and what did you find out? -2?|pg||
nt|henryb: not the dummy you want opposite a 2N opener|pg||
nt|rnc: ...and succeded|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 5@C here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: a 3NT hand for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  -  Running Scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, boring 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D opening, 1@H from sementa, 2@D - 2@H, 3@D - 3@H, 3@S - 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb: some danger of getting too high now, I would think|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes massi VuGr operator - your work is difficult - esp when they claim and close the hands|pg||
nt|henryb: except N got there first!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf there also 1HX -1 = 200|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N = both minors weak|pg||
nt|raghavan: S 10 is a stopper in Spade|pg||
nt|xenya: a srewd observation by a kibitzer -- perhaps NS were trying to match Meckwell's style|pg||
nt|werge: If they continue, they tale 1.430 here...|pg||
nt|werge: take|pg||
nt|xenya: *shrewd|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brgpro: we just wait and say NEXT later|pg||

nt|charles_l: same in 5@c though|pg||

nt|charles_l: E has some fun|pg||
nt|wwalter: did E open?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting "but not forcing to game" |pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: on Board 16 Versace found the lead of @SA and gave a ruff = 6@D -1 - but 12 IMPs for Salokin-team|pg||
nt|raghavan: May reach slam in H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes Lauria bid only 1@H, not 3|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good result for EW open room|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScoresOWS.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: good to try something different|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by NS is best,but hard to reach|pg||
nt|raghavan: In ACBL tourneys, Convention cards are published in advance - Here I tried the website - could not go beyond the names of countries |pg||
nt|raghavan: will S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|murat: or Dbl maybe|pg||
nt|april7: if S bids 2NT then N will give him ofcourse the 3d|pg||
nt|murat: dbl would be no sense actually|pg||
nt|april7: the question also is whether N can have a 4card @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: N must XX?|pg||
nt|panja: W is not very tolerant though, he wants to have his say in the matter|pg||
nt|athene: pretty boring 3nt here with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be unlikely to sell out to 2@S sitting East|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D now perhaps all end|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D looks negative one except you are forced to play the @DA|pg||
nt|haans: singel K again :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|milton_se: but will Henner resist the spades?|pg||
nt|april7: now we hav e it|pg||
nt|werge: A BIG 2 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3N makes with @S 4 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: even so, I think two aces is too mich opposite 2@c not to be trying for if not driving to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: again, W's pass looks timid|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||
nt|ady: likely tgo end 3NT   or 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT shows 22/23 balanced|pg||
nt|raghavan: I feel VUL overcall of 2C should be good suit go for 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: not a really hilarious match |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@H can be beaten with a spade ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to late to bid @H now|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Welland Welland wont play there|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: payback time :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
nt|milton_se: now she should|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry my eyes did deceive me they were one board ahead of this table|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c is not so easy to defeat|pg||
nt|raghavan: Talf - I agree it should be more down Both rooms defense was noy perfecr|pg||
nt|rnc: It looks like the previous match, where down 3 was more or less an average result :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: that would be law going too far|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR declarer played a spade towards the queen to create the entry to take the losing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c seems to be a transfer to @d|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h is down a lot, and with partner opening, South may double|pg||
nt|xenya: being pretty certain NS will bid game in OR|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  -  Swiss A Round 6 running scores|pg||
nt|mariner1: Denmark 17  Harangozo 2  3 boards to score in other match|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some here|pg||
nt|xenya: can't see how it can be made -- but quite a few variations here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||
nt|wwalter: after this board will come a friendly chat on EW :)|pg||
nt|april7: 10 easy tricks ready for claim|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2NT wont make either...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: therefore trying 3NT :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S + 3@H + 2@D + 3@C = 9|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@D + 3aces = 6|pg||
nt|haans: you may seee it that way 2 :))|pg||
pc|h4|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Hauge now leads the other semifinal 60-50 with (i think) 5 boards to compare|pg||
nt|ritong: 3Nt = i do not like @ss|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|daman: A @C will|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am going to back Michel to make this one|pg||
nt|kurtove: he may try to get entry on qsp, but will go -1 then|pg||
nt|haans: looks natural|pg||
nt|henryb: everything|pg||
nt|star6ija: interesting case of misreading at page 20 of http://eurobridge.org/bulletin/09_1%20Sanremo/pdf/Bul_08.pdf|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so we need 15 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|werge: They WILL not - they allready did it...|pg||
nt|mariner1: transportation and a lack of winners is the issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: duck @c lead @c lead small @D helps, double dummy though it is|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
nt|ady: lay down A@H    and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now no cue bid of Clubs so stopped probably|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a better contract than 4@c|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||
nt|charles_l: lots down here|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is cold, but uptricks are heavy at that point  so she considers the best way to gather a max of tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this can be made|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is nice judgement... option for 6 IMPs back|pg||
nt|rnc: The @H-discard and the @H8 is telling bad news|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the 8@H does not warm E's heart much|pg||
nt|rnc: :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: not winning that @c in dummy also cost a trick in tempo|pg||
nt|xenya: it does look like a complex hand?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead?|pg||
nt|pelu: they play a lot of tranfers after takeout X - so it looklike trandfer here also|pg||
nt|newmoon: good tenaces in dummy|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: she might try leading @H9|pg||
nt|athene: or leading small to @H10|pg||
nt|athene: that still gives time to lead to @HK later|pg||
nt|wwalter: I hope the chairs will not fly :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment if you play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|milton_se: this needs some help -- doubt that he'll get it|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has nothing to discard on the 9@d when it becomes good|pg||
nt|hedyg: should lose 1@d, 1@c and 2@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how he can avoid it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What does E expect from his partner? the X over 3@c is silly with so bad majors|pg||
nt|henryb: he expects partner to have half the missing points|pg||
nt|werge: I would have "unblocked" the @D K from dummy, can´t hurt|pg||
pc|d2|nt|don paulus: 1 @c strong - then ok|pg||
nt|henryb: which would be about 6 of them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only card from E is now @sQ |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now it´s expensive if N finds the @h shift|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in same spot here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: Allix amazingly passive. I wonder what Neve would have done with the @dQ in addition|pg||
nt|athene: they probably play that you complete the transfer with any weak NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I hope they do not play odd even discards|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: hmm|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not this way but???|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: I win|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||
nt|athene: it gives up the legitimate play in the suit of @HQx / @HJx with east|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: this might give west time to get his long spade set up|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence take @CA, @S, three hearts|pg||
nt|haans: u sure do|pg||
nt|milton_se: if 1NT is 12-14, North is certainly worth 4C|pg||
nt|april7: preparing a squeeze which doesn't exist|pg||
nt|newmoon: who said a 10 counts for no points?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but Welland leading a spade|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: the defence can actually stop declarer ducking a club into east's hand with certainty|pg||
nt|athene: west goes in with @CJ if declarer leads low from hand and east plays @C10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: but of course everything works for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: she may have a nasty moment but she can't go down :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she's thinking about discard|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauri-Versace bid and maded 5@Cs on board 17 = +6IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: With this lead makes 6|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|jeanhari: oeps|pg||
nt|haans: i am right :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it|pg||
nt|haans: still long way|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|jeanhari: south could know there was not much chance for north to have 3 spades, which he needs if switching to a spade|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but easy to see from the sidelines|pg||
nt|haans: south did not know they had 4-4 in hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|star6ija: no difference between 150 and 130|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|davidstern: With a spade through he would again have to cash the @DA|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d to cut the communications|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidstern: Claim -1?|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprise may be corrected|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so another 2 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can make it now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c2|nt|xenya: i think "strong but not forcing to game" means something lice Acol 2, Shirley -- in this case |pg||
nt|raghavan: He may A Heart |pg||
nt|xenya: is he about to make it now?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|milton_se: over now -- down|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace was actually on his way to slam but Lauria pulled the emergency brakes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To beat 4@d W has to lead a @d to duck|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @H pitch cost|pg||
nt|xenya: once he got a @D trick?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oliverc: not likely to either, given the 1@S bid from West. Even if on slim values, West likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: have either the J or Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: He rectified the count trying for 11 tricks instead of 10|pg||
nt|henryb: cash the @sA and exit the third club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still I think your analysis is correct - South should return a diamond|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: W might keep the @D Q10|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: and as always better to play AFTER :))|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but west being balanced, not bidding @H (with 2@S/3@H)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pelu: would u X on the Westhand or bid 2@S - D + 2@S gave East hope of game|pg||
nt|hedyg: now can go -2 with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for 2@S bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: as predicted|pg||
nt|athene: of course objectively this wasn't best because east "should" cover with @HJxx|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1100 and blood all over the carpet|pg||
nt|wwalter: Massimo pls tell us how is @@ the table now? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: @d now for 'only' 800, ty specs|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: E is like a fish out of water .............O look for a miracle :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ultimately he will|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree that Easts D over 3@d was not so good|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb: I think it is very hard to pass that hand over 3@c|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: pitching @S from hand on the third diamond has committed her|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry no she only needs one spade|pg||
nt|athene: she can still take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if scared that west has the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: @D2 (if honest) would indicate that|pg||
nt|athene: but i am sure west is good enough to falsecard there with @SK and NOT @CQJx|pg||
nt|haans: jean was correct yes was|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dT|pc|sJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but his partner will take that for majors - or?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s2|pc|cA|nt|newmoon: Gower claiming last 2|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: she will be very annoyed with herself to go down in this|pg||
nt|charles_l: 800 a bargain - could be 1400|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: she mentioned in her book how she woke at 3am one night realising she misplayed a hand even though she made it!|pg||
nt|athene: so this one will cause even more torment :(|pg||
nt|athene: it would be so nice to have that machine from the movie "Men in Black" to wipe one's memory after a misplayed bridge hand|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|raghavan: ok curtains|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that immediate overcalls of 3@c and 3@d should be for the majors and double shows a strong balanced hand, the second double a stronger balanced hand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rnc: Two boards and Herbst is a 'big' lead|pg||
pc|dK|pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: so a big swing for Herbst|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so i actually agree with call for @HJ|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,and what decl thinking about?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South should be curious about North overtake to return trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if singleton - why not try to promote partner's length, if doubleton, then must have control of @C|pg||

nt|wwalter: 10 fast, but could be 11 :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 11 on this lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't like N's sequence here. |pg||
nt|ady: thats the winning bid by west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: 3NT is possible, don't think you have a raise|pg||
nt|ritong: well it is a matter of @d length with east, i think|pg||
nt|ritong: suppose east has two @ds, it probably will be better in @s|pg||
nt|ady: needs an accurate defence to beat 4 spades if leading clubs   msut not play 3rd club   or will later be end played  after trumps drawn and a diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming south does not hold six|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT is the logical contract|pg||
nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|haans: And I would also like to thank Dr. Raghavan, Momchil Aleksandrov and Sid Ismail my  co-commentator |pg||
nt|haans: And of course all you KIBITZERS  for watching We trust you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @d finess fails|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The failure to bid 4@H (on the same auction) at the other table is very surprising|pg||
nt|jeanhari: stronge comeback from Welland|pg||
nt|haans: looks well for game|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, the layout is friendly, but the bidding tells you that - the spade finesse will work, as will the clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lots of tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showed Diamonds|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C? - who knows|pg||
nt|star6ija: no... this @h 8 with e is an obstacle|pg||
nt|daman: the pain of missing a vul game will not go away too quickly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: and into the soup we go  |pg||
nt|henryb: Only one of the four pairs on vg managed to reach even 6@c|pg||
nt|dcbutler: but doesn't E rate to be short in diamonds?|pg||
nt|raghavan: we both thought the same|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 7 with the @d finesse working, 5 otherwise unless the clubs are 6-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: They  are heading for slam|pg||
nt|daman: N was almost worth a xx|pg||
nt|rnc: I think North is halfway to a heart attack now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|charles_l: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|wwalter: a fast claim now :)|pg||
nt|ady: good result for Badger|pg||
nt|haans: board 10 will decide :)))|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks  possible, but normally 11 |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans one more deal is there apart from this |pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx all, and hope the kibs enjoyed this session.   Motto: "Capitalize on opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: with S*|pg||
nt|haans: yes good trumps :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: ok 1@H natural F1 by the look of it|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light opener, ok.  1NT rebid, the misdescription starts.  Passing 2@C carries the connotation you're fine defending that, again, not my cup of tea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 4 imps for Neve|pg||
nt|athene: should make this even if he tries to drop @CKx with north|pg||
nt|star6ija: let us see anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: yes indeed passing 3@H deserves a loss|pg||
nt|jeanhari: play still interesting...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: north think a lot on this turn of 10|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|murat: i'm having some informations.. Polish pair was a part of Polish Bermuda Bowl team last year..|pg||
nt|raghavan: which finess to take|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: then everything else natural|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brgpro: sorry, was away|pg||
nt|raghavan: same by declarer too!!!|pg||
nt|milton_se: As did South|pg||
nt|raghavan: W has to play Spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is so 6-1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: what finesse to take after being in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: well another swing to Herbst, they are on a roll|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all cards / but missing 2 Aces / so they will stop|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s was Blackwood, 5@d is two key cards without the @hQ|pg||
nt|daman: unless 3@C shows this hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brgpro: she went down...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spades I would think|pg||
nt|rnc: The only good thing for NS is that 4@C is making while 3NT wasn't. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|dcbutler: fortunate the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|milton_se: y and E has to play 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Going good till now for S - should start on trumps now|pg||
nt|daman: if so, I would have ventured 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|milton_se: hasn't this relay sequence made clear that 2 aces are missing??|pg||
nt|raghavan: Knowing their system will help in good commenting by us|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now N can see 5 or 7|pg||
nt|jeanhari: to much soft valuas, like redbl more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: north said 4@c is forcing and south ........pass :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brgpro: well, She ran @h9...that needs @h8 on side and one of the @hQJ, less chance than playing @h to the K i think|pg||
nt|athene: well, given time declarer can come to three hearts, three clubs, @SK, @DAK|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they know, they play turbo and Fantoni has shown 1 keycard|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that most of the relays are distribution and HCP / not Aces|pg||
nt|haans: you really know a lot hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT over 4@s would have shown an even nr of keycards|pg||
pc|cK|nt|milton_se: better use for controls than hcp, I'd say|pg||
nt|star6ija: all was gone|pg||
nt|haans: once i did open 2@D 3rd with 4 carder only way for them to go down |pg||
pc|c9|nt|april7: defence should make at least 6 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If that finesse loses, you should hopefully be able to ruff a spade to try the heart finesse next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West will be very unhappy about that trick|pg||
nt|daman: me too|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: going for the immediate spade pitch|pg||
nt|hedyg: any 5 level bid shows an odd number|pg||
nt|haans: knowlege at this ttable|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: perfect shift by Bocchi|pg||
nt|athene: now|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna can t give an entry to a declarer with singleton @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes count me in too|pg||
nt|xenya: i like the auction in the other room (3@S instead of DBL) much better|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am a Fantunes fan :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oliverc: Well I have their CC up on screen now, but I suspect we'll not be hugely wiser|pg||
nt|oliverc: except where opening bids are concerned|pg||
nt|newmoon: well played  :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: now the defence are poised to take three spades and two clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: even with the @S switch (looks odd), this is down 1|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't put diamonds 6-2 on this auction!|pg||
nt|ritong: so my guess is a @h comes|pg||
nt|haans: i have their full system Will read it some day :))|pg||
nt|hedyg: by then they will have changed it|pg||
nt|milton_se: so not even bad bidding makes you doubt? :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubt in Fantunes???? never!|pg||
nt|haans: give me you mail adress|pg||
nt|hedyg: having already shown a @c control earlier Fantoni with the 5@d bid showed an odd nr of keycards and @d control|pg||
nt|haans: have it now|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5 rounds and not knowing that before...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if no @d ruff now he can claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: you know nr of keycards before Bertil?|pg||
nt|milton_se: with a relay system, certainly|pg||
nt|hedyg: a different relay system|pg||
nt|hedyg: their system seems to work fine for them|pg||
nt|haans: but few have decided to play it|pg||
nt|milton_se: I wouldn't like to be in 5 on that...|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West will be very happy about THAT trick|pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: next match in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|haans: by p overruff 4 @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am with Vlad|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps this is not available in NS's system here?|pg||
pg||
qx|o10|st||md|4SQ9852H5DA2CQJ984,SA4HKQT983DK98C63,S3HA42DQT753CAT72,SKJT76HJ76DJ64CK5|sv|b|nt|ahollan1: well done Kazuo to rely upon @C suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|nigel_k:  Interesting on board 8, at this table they invited game after a 2H opening and the other table passed a 3H opening|pg||
nt|westjava: Thai get 6 imps from   8,3@H only there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this 3@D going to get them to 4@S?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Given my record I won't predict another routine 4S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mariner1: well if cards sat better EW then NS would have 12|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: go on it looks sane|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=8-13 or 16+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C asks|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kiwibridge: next|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@S & 8-10|pg||
nt|westjava: I think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Ha|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at least i think should be 8-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another guess coming -- 3@H shows 2 top honors in @S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh the double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Ok the double was just to test us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prompted by?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Sorry no dbl, just tht all pass and press DK = dbl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No problem|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nigel_k:  I think East was looking for slam there actually :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  just a club guess for the overtrick|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,K of @C on side...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: had us excited operator|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  After QC wins declarer has to guess whether N has doubleton 10 or South has doubleton King|pg||
pc|d5|nt|westjava: will reach to 6..?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it they reach slam level it will be a tough play|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|westjava: so,be careful Hu|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c out beats 6@H and 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec asking for more guesses ---  4@C asks about @C holding  4@D=not 1st/2nd/3rd round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't explain why South asked in @C rather than @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @S were 3 2 this would have more play likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@H = 2 @S honor, so 6@S is very reasonable|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult contract tough to make|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D,that's S need...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one correct guess -- now how about 4@C??|pg||
pc|dK|nt|westjava: @C asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confirmation of my guess about 4@C only counts if it comes from the table :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: it can be made now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suggest line of play to make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: has to play E for Jxxx @S though|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,just need 1 x @C ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: might have been wise to ruff some @H's|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|westjava: now,need @D ruff:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trying to ruff hearts looked relatively safe but she's not taking any chances|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: remember to ruff 3rd round of @D|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mariner1: could have ruffed a @D  and finessed for J@S and home|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nigel_k:  He should play three rounds of hearts now. When S doesn't follow the club position is clear|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|westjava: yeah|pg||
nt|mariner1: looking good|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Immaterial if South helps by covering, though S was still trying to beat the contract|pg||
pc|c8|nt|westjava: so,wd Hu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice result|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: yes, that might have been a good play, but Bocchi didn't need it|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S  - an unklikely contract|pg||
nt|haans: but does 4@H mean single spade|pg||
nt|haans: changed times |pg||
nt|pelu: so last board 5 IMP for Angelini = 16-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed, 30 minutes earlier than i announced, sry|pg||
nt|haans: first time 10 then 11:40 13:20 17:30 19:10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 8  here 4H made 5 Open 6H -1 so MC Leish picks up 11 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: this board can be bloddy|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C = both majors?|pg||

nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 5@C - strong @C-suit and no @Hs ?????|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C not alerted so presumably improvisation|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@C natural or...?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D an underbid and 3nt not really very good|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but not alerted|pg||
nt|athene: actually i think a simple 3@D wld have been OK|pg||
nt|star6ija: and take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: s'alright. I am easily missed|pg||
nt|haans: you and we will be kick out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I am going to rule that 30 minutes = "around 15 minutes"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: yes, nice Morton's Fork possibility here|pg||
nt|brgpro: seems there was an misunderstanding of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: by playing @c4 he set up "mortons fork" - if West take @CA the 2 discards - if not: the @C-trick go away|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather unfortunate...W has sort of "Nat" @hK lead...|pg||
nt|charles_l: S might suggest it over 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: but N bids 4@h|pg||
nt|wwalter: a manly bid :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: real men bid game :) (and try to make it)|pg||
nt|panja: not an easy lead, but @C is safe|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 22 the other room reached to high in 6 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *too |pg||
nt|jcwla: Should work like a charm here if natural.|pg||
nt|athene: but west perhaps just wants to stop the club lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: it didn't|pg||
nt|henryb: N is relaying again|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Gomerov still not satisfied|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|rnc: It has been an interesting match|pg||
nt|rnc: Herbst making a huge rally from 7-21 to 40-21 in five consecutive boards - never give up!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wwalter: he made LOL|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it difficult to bid game in S and make it - 2 Club losers Da - will D  belead |pg||
nt|jeanhari: for sure Dubinin has a fast pas if this was not t/o|pg||
nt|daman: I think maybe Weinstein held up the auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: has there been a misunderstanding here? Sabine knows that 3NT isn't solid diamonds...|pg||
nt|haans: only brits play 5@C as slam invite|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that the X = @h + minor - so S has shown his hand!|pg||
nt|kurtove: diamond lead, ruff and small heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=0-11, 4@hs|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes will have to drop QC, since he can't afford E having the trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@d acts as 4sf here?|pg||
nt|april7: @D lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South is not thrilled - although he does have a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: in IMP as rare pen double|pg||
nt|haans: or is it not?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could be yes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|charles_l: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|henryb: "The Fat Lady is Singing"|pg||
nt|ritong: north went for the practical bid|pg||
nt|ritong: a second cue wouldn t have scandalized me|pg||
nt|ady: north right gave up once south shows some heart values|pg||
nt|daman: has to duck 1 @H and maybe more|pg||
nt|daman: pitching @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding has maded it easy'er for N to play @Cj|pg||
nt|haans: and this was board 10 welcome back in 40 minutes! |pg||
nt|raghavan: Will E signal his D Ace now?|pg||
nt|milton_se: Welland can't expect more than one ace w East, so D is mandatory|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a tricky 3nt! 5 and 6@c is easier, but not longer|pg||
nt|haans: :) they did right :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: next round (3rd from Swiss Open Teams) starts tomorrow 10:3- CET|pg||
nt|mariner1: well right defense just not in game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wwalter: 4 wich pair? :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: maybe will fines the @h :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: he has not made it yet......|pg||
nt|wwalter: it sould be simple now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a grand with 2-2 in @s|pg||
nt|raghavan: another 7 in Hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: or spades or NT|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably :)|pg||
nt|daman: draw trumo|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: And he might have just turned a huge plus into a small minus|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS do better not drawing here I think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brgpro: Bocchi thought pd denied @d control|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can finesse in @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: but now it's over|pg||
nt|milton_se: 11 tricks probably|pg||
nt|haans: trust we will see team salokin again|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 4S down  so ew making 4 will get them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx to all Kibitz, co commentators Hans, Malik,sid,Momchil, Vu GR operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all kibitzers, we are waiting all of you here for the next round|pg||
nt|haans:  and thats was board 10 welcome back 17:30 (italian time) |pg||
nt|henryb: S has now presumably shown 5-5-1-2, minimum|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all commentators, to EBL and to Roland Wald|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can call it an action double.: partner, I'm still not satisfied until now...|pg||
nt|haans: but still +|pg||
nt|haans: wrong - score|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wwalter: made|pg||
nt|wwalter: or not LOL|pg||
nt|charles_l: he may be preserving his options to misguess @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now way south could see passing was best|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 Spades,HA,DA and (a club)  minimum losers|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a violation of Burn's Law (RULES)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|murat: he goes down now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Terence Reese had a pithy comment for South's 3@S ....|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brgpro: @c i meant|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2 x A from S - have a bet? :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: no|pg||
nt|raghavan: Automatically spade honours fall - no need for worry, |pg||
nt|jeanhari: but depending on what de dbl over 1NT ment|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he said only points|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "He was happy to defend 3@H when it was bid, but not prepared to defend it when partner doubled!"|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|wwalter: if he plays @s could come a problewm :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|april7: it was a good pass by S, although 4@S is an execellent contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: Friends- We thank all great Kibitz, co commentators, VuGr operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|henryb: 4N probably agrees spades for the moment, since N is most interested in the @sQ|pg||
nt|henryb: the grand is only good if S has the @sQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: in 3NT on a @D-lead decla must topplay @Cs - if @cQ in West no problem - if in East has to drop!|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now! I cannot see any 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok, tx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wwalter: + 11 or -6? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: well if you bids em you has to makes em :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10|pg||
nt|panja: you must reciprocate after a gift..|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mariner1: never play in a contract where the opponents have more trumps than you|pg||

pc|cK|nt|mariner1: has to lead @c, he see's he is on hook anyway|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kurtove: that was bad play|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
