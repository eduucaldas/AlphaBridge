nt|bobholl: what to do against those "madman" ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: agree, but part of someting is - not to help oponents ... opening with West hand is surely helping opps whatever distribution is ...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|raghavan: Bob The opponents must prepare for these conventions |pg||
nt|danilo1: ... if  pd has @S support, they will find their suit |pg||
nt|jstokes: give South a few of East's values, and this is a big gain for EW -- as it is, a partscore hand, no big deal either way -- at least NS will be plus|pg||

nt|santyclz: At matchpoints e might easily lead the @dq vs 1nt.|pg||
nt|danilo1: 100 will probably not be tragedy for EW (35-40%) ... 150 would be probably cold 0|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|danilo1: if South would have @HKJ10. he would lead J or 10 ... so ... to preserve 2 entries (for 4 @D tricks). declarer should play Q from dummy|pg||

mc|9|nt|bobholl: sry back to 9|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... as he played trick 1 (and 2) - it has been clear, declarer is not planing to play on @D|pg||
nt|jstokes: not everyone will open E, so making game should be OK, even though there will be 630s|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, I guess everyone will open as East, but 3NT may often be played by West (@S lead)|pg||
nt|jstokes: do we have results from prior boards?|pg||
