nt|haans: look like it|pg||
nt|xenya: we start off with a slam hand|pg||
nt|werge: It also looks like a "fast" 6 @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H probably @S (transfer walsh) now 1 or 2 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|april7: hi everybody and good afternoon|pg||

nt|raghavan: Will N finding the killing lead of HQ?|pg||
nt|haans: Hi all welcome you kibitzers|pg||
nt|afulton: East may / may not invite, but if North is on lead against NT and pulls out that @h J, thing may get interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Transfe response - 1@H showed spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: 1NT showing 15-17??|pg||
nt|haans: more common soon than natural bidding|pg||
nt|kurtove: 9 tricks in spade will be normal, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: @HK and @CQ right - so 'only' down 1|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H did show minimum opening but better than weak 2 promise only 5|pg||
nt|haans: he did not intend 4@H to make|pg||

nt|sybarra: but pard bid @S so may lead it |pg||
nt|lesrays: well I believe in NOT leading pards suit with such a nice one of my own|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but that @s card is now known to be sure entry|pg||
nt|werge: Still a long way|pg||
nt|afulton: and East never asked whether partner had a major suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think E expects to be putting 5 tricks on the table |pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@C is being played in the open room but the indians so a chance for pickup for them|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like we go off with a good 3nt NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Paul and Massimiliano|pg||
nt|haans: pass no option?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I have seen many worse 11 counts that N opened in these championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Just about any lead OK here, but the contract should come home on power.|pg||
nt|don paulus: warming up board|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 easy tricks 3s dim  2c and a heart or maybe even heart suit set up|pg||
nt|haans: Hi and Welcome or Welcome Back. Now the last part of a very exiting match. 14 boards to NO of the opponents. But who will that be   |pg||

nt|Walddk5: Henner-Welland  sry|pg||
nt|xenya: might not be easy to arrive there though |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure landing in 2 @C was right idea |pg||

nt|panja: looks like 2@H is some kind of raise..the hands are not far from a slam...|pg||
nt|haans: as soon as opps get in they play trumps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|charles_l: OR in 5@cx by W|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Hard to see 3NT being beaten|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even a spade lead probably won't be sufficient|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume 1@C was strong and artificial, hence the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|jeanhari: both teams need points to get in the upper half|pg||
nt|jeanhari: al long as dummy covers there are no 5 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|werge: Problem is a @C-lead/shift - you will not know, how @S´s are behaving|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|afulton: the problem with North hand:  not only one but 2 honors in @s... so suit might block on lead of 3spot|pg||

nt|haans: do they know what they are doing?|pg||

nt|pelu: I lost the play - did East take @SA????|pg||
nt|kurtove: strange of east to use the A in trick 1|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: needed  @D pitch from N I am afraid |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: surely east should not have bid n0-trump with no club stopper    give preference to diamonds|pg||

nt|kurtove: ruff two diamonds|pg||

mb|1D|nt|panja: and a raise by N is a must|pg||

nt|jeanhari: 2@H will be good spade raise|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||

nt|werge: What is North worth here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: oover shot the runway as it were|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now just what outh wanted to hear|pg||
nt|haans: but the swedish use both|pg||

nt|haans: but cannot lead @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: south|pg||

nt|panja: oh, I forgot partner is counted as opp|pg||
nt|haans: sometimes :)|pg||
nt|haans: :( you are never sure :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think it was Mike Lawrence who coined the term " middle hand opponent"|pg||
nt|haans: swedes use Big Club|pg||
nt|sybarra: with this spade lay out, 4 @S is making |pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: will decl find @DQ??????|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H can be set w AC lead|pg||
nt|pelu: and in OR S - after a @H kead to K - took a finess to the @HJ = -1 in 3@H|pg||
nt|haans: har ingen aning|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes looks 3Nt |pg||
nt|mariner1: well they need defense to tangle up their tricks to make|pg||
nt|fann4: Other room in 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: * is not |pg||
nt|afulton: wow|pg||
nt|ronpa: 4@S and 3NT both make as cards are|pg||
nt|ronpa: tak @H lead and duck to beat 4@S\|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they make 4 @S?|pg||
nt|afulton: no checkback?|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @S !?! - are @H-ruffs not allowed any longer?|pg||
nt|april7: if N would have balanced then W could also end up in a @D part making3 and now E makes 2 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: @s now to be sure about makeing|pg||
nt|panja: the correct play now is a @S|pg||
nt|panja: to guarantee 3@H..|pg||
nt|panja: S must be hoping @H finesse is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not this lead!|pg||
nt|milton_se: AH and JS|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity W that he has to be on lead every time his team wins a trick - E ast no entry|pg||
nt|haans: decl can live long on @D|pg||
nt|werge: Interesting slam - defence can only get 1 @C-trick...|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't bid it iguess :)|pg||
nt|haans: i think we are seeing Ladies semi|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: spade lead best|pg||
nt|jeanhari: close call for west, non vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: may not want to hear it as much as he hopes tho!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid with 2@C losers|pg||
nt|mcarroll: pretty impossible to bid|pg||
nt|werge: Per definition, ther is only ONE @c-loser...|pg||
nt|haans: a zia bid?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some looks like tartan or muiderberg |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe you said that already) |pg||
nt|xenya: a 2-suiter, yes|pg||
nt|xenya:  does he have an ace, S is thinking|pg||
nt|kurtove: hard to find the 5 club now|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the match between 3rd and 4th ranking team in final A|pg||
nt|panja: RKC perhaps, 4@C was|pg||
nt|haans: perhaps|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@H is 4+H and 4+@S|pg||
nt|werge: Must be a triple-squeeze, whuch I have´nt seen|pg||
nt|werge: which|pg||
nt|ronpa: very tough to make 4@S, 3NT is much easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt looks a lot better to me also |pg||
nt|werge: Not very tough - impossible - East ist screaming for a @H-ruff|pg||
nt|afulton: so is "ruff" hand to make in suit contract :)|pg||
nt|haans: well done Preve|pg||
nt|haans: well done Ms Preve (excuse)|pg||
mb|d|nt|kurtove: think so|pg||
nt|haans: think they play 3nt|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not much chance, no reason Gromov to go up with a trump|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 S would have been suffiecient - 9 cards in trumpSpades and equal strength|pg||
nt|mariner1: defense not likely to make a slips as entry to dummy early causes a @D issue later|pg||
nt|jeanhari: with open cards one would play three rounds of clubs now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|daman: EW got overboard but NS really couldn't double|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|werge: What was 4 @C supposed to show?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: no great interest in the play. Just needs to knock out the A@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: 10 tricks  normally to be made = 4S+3H+2D+1C=10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Ralf let us hope to have interesting deals|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sure we do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Curious - best lead is in fact @hQ|pg||
nt|haans: other room did bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rnc: 2NT is an option on S|pg||
nt|rnc: and we will have difficulties handling alias (as well)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Poor;ly fitting hand - would make slam a nice contract on other days - liks a third club in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems straight forward here unless he ducks this @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: just a moment|pg||
nt|werge: Fast and flat board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|werge: - and West will know from the bidding, that East has no singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: better part of valor with that 7 count |pg||
nt|ronpa: did souh really pass??|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|lesrays: have they really passed it out?|pg||
nt|werge: I prefer to bid 5 @S than only 3...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt made in other room,  but only in 1 |pg||
nt|afulton: this could be yet another pickup by NS |pg||
nt|april7: 2 entries for playing @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: good move by north, the 6@h bid suggests 4or5 @hs and out|pg||
nt|kurtove: wow|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks so but how long?|pg||
nt|afulton: ah|pg||
nt|werge: East goes for a @C-ruff instead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: she is greedy :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as noted red vs white sacrifice but declarer hasnt found the @DQ yet but the double may steer him right|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well read by North|pg||
nt|haans: is 5@C good bridge??|pg||
nt|davidstern: Aand no double|pg||
nt|davidstern: Dont know about good bridge but -100 against possible +200 or more likely -790|pg||
nt|kurtove: is 1 club 3+ clubs|pg||
nt|kurtove: he knows that pd is short in spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is it clear that the third double is penalties|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S relay 3@H 3-4-3-3|pg||
nt|milton_se: wise w two 4333|pg||
nt|haans: yep :)|pg||
nt|haans: but they could fist ask then  bid nt|pg||
nt|fann4: @D lead in the OR|pg||
nt|haans: popos say nothing |pg||
nt|haans: @D ruff ???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good save - with some chance to make if @C not led early|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: and rightly decides to stop in 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly safer than 3 nt  |pg||
nt|lestergold: on a spade lead it probably goes off|pg||
nt|kurtove: but its wery red|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|milton_se: getting in trouble if double finesse in Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|haans: hi hedy|pg||
nt|jeanhari: game over...|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Weinstein had 2 reasons to bid game   1. it might make    2. he might stampede the opps into bidding 5@H|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Rob|pg||
nt|haans: underlead @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: can get tangled up on the hand in 3 nt (imo) |pg||
nt|xenya: not really, Shirley -- 6 @Cs, 2@Ds and @HA -- at least|pg||
nt|pelu: S know that there are 'mirrow'distribution - so 3Nt sh be as good as 4@H - nice bidding|pg||
nt|jeanhari: as most players in the east seat did|pg||
nt|lestergold: epsecially on tye lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partner I have @C losers if you have singleton @C we are in business|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/nmnvk3  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|panja: hypothesis rejected, 4Nt was the RKC|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yet another 5 level contract|pg||
nt|haans: or 4nt king ask|pg||
nt|mcarroll: undo I suggest|pg||
nt|haans: king + Q|pg||
nt|haans: make it harder top ruff @D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: if 4@C ace ask...P on 4@H was in order|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: and might sneak a @S also |pg||
nt|star6ija: nice defense|pg||
nt|xenya: S was facing a tough decision i think -- do we agree with 3@C?|pg||
nt|panja: on this bidding, @D small lead seems attractive|pg||
nt|april7: undo|pg||
nt|don paulus: in OR board 1 went down after @h start - 11 for Herbst to start with !|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: the best chance for declarer is that he is sure where the honours are|pg||
nt|jeanhari: both could have happened indeed, not this time|pg||
nt|raghavan: If declarer tried to play S from dummy N may split and lose a Spade trick - I know at this level of top players, it may not come thru. But trial costs nothing|pg||
nt|davidstern: And he doesnt of course|pg||
nt|haans: spade are RIGHT|pg||
nt|haans: 450 to SWEDEN|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Dr Paranjapee and Hans GE|pg||
nt|ronpa: operator did south really pass 3@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: YES|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: 2 spades 4 clubs and dim ace |pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, 6 hearts would make with the diamond break|pg||
nt|daman: they would never split thir honors|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed but |pg||
nt|jeanhari: could cost however with spades 2-2 and clubs 5-1|pg||
nt|haans: sort of agree|pg||
nt|werge: Board only flat - not FAST|pg||
nt|werge: Call a doctor|pg||
nt|ronpa: lol|pg||
nt|werge: For ronpa...|pg||
nt|ronpa: I already called a taxi for hospital :)|pg||
nt|lesrays: or for Massi:)|pg||
nt|werge: I would prefer passing 2 NT - but never 3 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no no i'm feel very good :)|pg||
nt|werge: Not much work for doctors nowadays|pg||
pc|c2|nt|milton_se: why cover w Kxx?|pg||
nt|rnc: agree, and so did Balicki|pg||
nt|haans: easier to agree seeing all cards :)|pg||
nt|werge: That helped...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|milton_se: and now a D|pg||
nt|hedyg: the CC is from last year so might have made some changes|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: not obvious to read the 8@c, W could have ducked|pg||
nt|haans: AJ right in clubs so soon happy decl|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does not know that Hans|pg||
nt|milton_se: but he can't go wrong|pg||
nt|haans: to swedish champions at other table Mårten Gustawsson and Sylvan|pg||
nt|raghavan: Declarer has to lose 2D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) on Monday. Five more rounds of Swiss tomorrow|pg||
nt|star6ija: after round 7 tomorrow first 27 teams from group A and 5 from group B will progress to the knockout phase|pg||
nt|haans: yes two 10|pg||
nt|werge: I would bid 2 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an interesting bidding point, I think they reverse the "traditional" negative double, i.e. 1SS by East = 4 card, and Dbl would have shown 5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|davidstern: I am guessing it is penalties but what can North sseriously believe they can do to 4@S|pg||
nt|oliverc: Did Declarer really play the Q@D on a small one at trick 1, I wonder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry for being late.Hi all |pg||
nt|Walddk5: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought maybe he would pitch the @D |pg||
nt|haans: 2 x 14 boards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: maybe Lofgren led from xxx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like playing diamonds is best|pg||
nt|haans: so Im said|pg||
nt|haans: both lay matches quite close|pg||
nt|haans: lady|pg||
pc|s7|nt|milton_se: anyhow he needs a D trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: Good play be the expert devalopping Clubs while in E|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|daman: he would have to use his @D K to do that and that would put him at more risk|pg||
nt|jeanhari: open room in 4@S too|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal contract|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C is also quite safe|pg||
nt|ritong: the small danger is to see opponents bid seven @ss, but who does that in the dark|pg||
nt|raghavan: how could he expect 16 points - all missing high honours with W - For a over call need have this strength. some with E and give trick to WSo Declarer may expect |pg||
nt|haans: @H10 may be a trick|pg||
nt|fann4: People have been known to lead a low @C on auctions like this.|pg||
nt|werge: Is 2 x 14 total for the match - and knock-out?|pg||
nt|haans: hi Doctor|pg||
nt|raghavan: Glad to say Hi again\|pg||
nt|raghavan: Namaste Dr|pg||
nt|haans: same |pg||
nt|panja: hi|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: Declarer won first D with Q though could have by 10|pg||
nt|werge: Intermediates are good also|pg||
nt|raghavan: ??|pg||
nt|panja: the bidding after 1Nt was daisypicking..a straight 3nt might have worked|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|raghavan: whatever North's idea for covering, it is made easy for W|pg||
nt|oliverc: This seems very improbable :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: declarer would have to make inspired guess to put up Ks to make|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 1/2 NT for me|pg||
nt|xenya: even if he ducks, Rob, it makes|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|milton_se: any line i succesful now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in 6 vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 10, ...|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|haans: lucky clubs 4-3|pg||
nt|rnc: You have a point there undeniably, Hans :)|pg||
nt|haans: ty very kind of you :)))|pg||
nt|werge: Very soon we write 140 - and we all agree with Souths final decision|pg||
pc|sT|nt|davidstern: Claiming time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W is caught and must play @d back for a @c discard|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the ruff is with a good trump anyway|pg||
nt|davidstern: ruffing with nat trump trick but he doesnt know who has two hearts and the club ace|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1 or 2 off depending on how the @Ss are played, but the bidding suggests shortness with E|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: now also -1 here - strange that Nunes didnt realice that he need to "steal" a @D-trick|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kurtove: q of hearts seems like a nice card against 4 sp|pg||
nt|davidstern: So a flat board|pg||
nt|milton_se: surprising|pg||
nt|haans: may b|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|hedyg: Fantoni declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: hello Martin  |pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcwla: With Ax opposite xx, no reason to duck a round of @C's.  With 9x of @H's, it's normal to lead pd's bid suit.  Declarer doesn't always have AKJx on this auction.|pg||
nt|haans: you play clubs and I walk|pg||
nt|panja: I wonder if Popov thought about cashing @CA..when in with @SA|pg||

mb|2H|nt|raghavan: a part score|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: and W did not recognize 5N as the GSF|pg||
nt|charles_l: EW often use 5N as 'pick a slam'|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but west already bypassed a club raise, so really is not logical it could be pick a slam|pg||
nt|woozle: Hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Ji Kieran|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi even|pg||
nt|charles_l: hi|pg||
nt|mariner1: GSF = Grand Slam Force, if p has two of top 3 trumps they should bid 7|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Kiernan|pg||
nt|woozle: It would be weird for East to play his partner for less than AK to many diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: E has to raise to 7 here, there has to be a play|pg||
mb|3N|nt|charles_l: yes all he needs are AK to many @ds |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Unlikely that 7D is better than 7NT though|pg||
nt|mariner1: and could easily have and outside K|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe a trump coup if he has AK98xxx and trumps are 4-0 onside...all a bit far-fetched|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: at least he took the best line of play|pg||

nt|haans: do not make 7 (i think :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4 of a major here after some interference by N/S probably.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|wwalter: she had 2@c+ 1@s as losers|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: do u know that the X was? - some play that X = 4 card @S and 1@S = 5 card - but X as 5 card @S I have never seen before|pg||

nt|star6ija: but is very close|pg||

nt|lestergold: he knows something is going on knows pard probably has weak hand with clubs|pg||
nt|werge: Easy - and fast - on that lead|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|lestergold: o course can bid 3n gambling if they play it to show this sort of preempt|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will try to find a CC for them|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4NT nat now?|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Sid|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N by South? strange call|pg||
nt|haans: yes all options BUT 2@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 13 tricks here, another 3 imps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|sommer: I would bid 2@H too|pg||
nt|werge: Which confirms my opinion|pg||
nt|mariner1: least not the 10+ .. maybe a neg count|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly, but he has an entry for a @H finesse...|pg||
nt|sybarra: mercifully undoubled |pg||
nt|sharkey: N a little weak in HCP for the second Dbl|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 13 points he could not justify a unilateral further bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north probably lead a diamond|pg||
nt|henryb: I think N-S are relaying|pg||
nt|daman: W might bid 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you get an error by clicking on that link, it's because there are too many hits at the moment. Try again later|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Massimilano so it is neg count|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has exactly one entry to dummy and nothing he does works|pg||
nt|panja: with only once Ace and a void, Balicki is not likely to bid more|pg||
nt|werge: North did´nt want a @S-lead (double...) so now only 100 for 2 down|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|xenya: they made one on 1|pg||
nt|milton_se: probably their way w GF hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Henry! I only can see it as forcing  for N to show his distribution|pg||
nt|henryb: South|pg||
nt|fann4: Isn't 4@S as 'shut out'ish as can be|pg||
nt|panja: a void in partner's suit...that is|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead and a @H...|pg||
nt|april7: N thinks about how many @H to bid or showing max with the cuebid. At first sight S will be unhappy, but.......|pg||
nt|danilo1: depends on agreement how good (minimum) 2NT may be ... if any bid, surely not 6NT ... maybe 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: i would have prefered 6nt|pg||
nt|haans: 6nt cards @C|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6NT is too risky ... what if ps has 9-10 @D with no Ace (table would be dead)|pg||
nt|haans: gards|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S before 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Yes N shall show his...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but for me it´s the reversed way|pg||
nt|henryb: presumably N now knows S is 5=5=0=3 with a minimum and 4 controls|pg||
nt|henryb: which makes his hand much less good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bud in my opinnion N has to downgrade his hand with @dAQxx|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would like to see their convention card - How can South proceed on cue bids without much information from N except game force.|pg||
nt|henryb: actually, once S showed 5-5 in the majors at least one of North's queens became wasted|pg||
nt|henryb: not cue bids; North is asking and South is telling|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: found their best spot|pg||
nt|haans: Hi all Welcome all kibitzers|pg||
nt|sharkey: Expect W to have a better @C fit for his 2@D cue bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: his suit is the same one his righty opened|pg||
nt|werge: First step...|pg||
nt|werge: North MUST play the Jack - otherwise West KNOWS, who has the @S Queen!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: First three in each group will qualify for Swiss A after 5 rounds Rest will play in Swiss B |pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: X = 4+ @ss - 1@S = max 3 card @S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sid :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h is in fact better than 4@s on S.|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure about N's 4@H though|pg||
nt|xenya: so probably down anyway |pg||
nt|xenya: but we shall see|pg||
nt|mariner1: W would have been better off ducking that @D to let E in|pg||
nt|mariner1: now W has Zugzwang'd himself a bit|pg||
nt|rnc: ...for a @S-shift|pg||
nt|xenya: a @S now beats it for certain|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead difficult on @H not|pg||
nt|werge: With East as declarer, the lead of @H 3 would bring some trouble, I think|pg||
nt|werge: But for sure a @C-lead also|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 16 Vito got 11 IMP as here 5H-1 and OR 4H+1|pg||
nt|haans: yep costly|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about that for taking a deep breath and praying |pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: agree|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 overtricks it seems|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No|pg||
nt|haans: spec say 2@S show MIN and 3 spades|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wwalter: this was a sweet lead 4 declar :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Information.htm   only website I have |pg||
nt|xenya: is there a sure line for 10 tricks here? |pg||
nt|henryb: sure? I don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean without seeing NS's cards of course|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bertil NS going as you feared to 6C - The X oD will not discourage|pg||
nt|werge: 11 IMP|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho maybe not third in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: depend on style|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like claim will follow quickly|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to play transfers after overcall so X= @s transfer|pg||
nt|henryb: He said: spades, spades and hearts, hearts at least 5, 5=5=0=3|pg||
nt|werge: Take a look at the bidding in OR - and you get one MORE reason NOT to bid 2 @H|pg||
nt|xenya: not much to the play here it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: N had to remain silent..then, E might not go for game|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably end up with 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dcbutler: 9 tricks for declarer on any lead with this layout|pg||
nt|haans: that has been mpore and more popular|pg||
nt|raghavan: X of D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The slam is roughly 50% and bid at many tables|pg||
nt|haans: what do you think about that lead?|pg||
nt|rnc: This works also, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: so does the @D, as it happens |pg||
nt|mariner1: now W has a real problem|pg||
nt|davidstern: North profile (assuming it is Godefroy) http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=6234 Fantun http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=20158|pg||
nt|rnc: East's @D7 is a good card|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers calling for W to chuck Q@H under AKh|pg||
nt|xenya: one pf the best, yes|pg||
nt|werge: Hi - a @C-lead would be a good start on this monday|pg||
nt|werge: Seems to end up with uninteresting 450|pg||
nt|haans: but would have still be a make|pg||
nt|werge: Dummy is shouting: HEART-SHIFT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As they say - the only way is the best way - finesse only option|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|charles_l: helpful|pg||
nt|ritong: although he knows south has a @s top|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is not a good hand for those who subscribe to "always lead an ace against a slam"|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Sid|pg||
nt|haans: yes need clubs support to bid on|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Bakker did not open |pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: S did not seem to have any doubt|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower has certainly seen Apteker's preempts before...  I am surprised here|pg||
nt|haans: :( they have 25 imp :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|newmoon: hi fellow commentators  :)|pg||
nt|henryb: this contract needs the @cK on, the hearts 3-2 and a spade guess. about 20% and it will not make|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf  What is ur opinion of fulfilling the cotract? |pg||
nt|ralfwil: No chace with that lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and makable with a @d lead, if he finds @sQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can ruff the 3rd @s and cash @cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: S should realize why @S have not been led yet|pg||
nt|haans: all are right 5@D said GUESS|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk5: @SA would be the only card to let it through|pg||
nt|milton_se: about 48 (stiff S lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: you need 3-2 @S to make, so...|pg||
nt|april7: I.H. is now loughing|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR Reess opened the S hand 3@D, then 4@C by N -- E/W have been pushed to 5@S, a bridge too far.|pg||
nt|ady: west really has the hand for a suit contract  evedn if 2 tricks higher  good controls   but only 1 spade stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: since she clearly has a light opening|pg||
nt|rnc: With no bad breaks, this will bring a 10 home for O'Rourke levelling the match|pg||
nt|xenya: or perhpas you can also cope with 4 spades with N|pg||
nt|haans: dummy has nothing to shout about |pg||
nt|werge: But time enough, I think|pg||
nt|werge: Oh-yes - because East has the @C-entry, it´s over for the defence|pg||
nt|don paulus: on board 2 E opened 2 nt - and 3 nt by W with long @d - made !|pg||
nt|haans: they can pay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Even if min, opening bid opposite opening bid - and a fit!|pg||
nt|haans: big really bid error|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: run Hearts |pg||
nt|raghavan: needs some Diamond discards from Opp|pg||
nt|haans: beginners error|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: key moment|pg||
nt|rnc: Must hold on to his hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: likely 2 off now|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club throw in|pg||
nt|mariner1: E does not need @S|pg||
nt|haans: we have to few que asking bid an other suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb: surely best to strip minors before playing a heart in case someone (particularly South) has a stiff @hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess you take a deep breath and try the spade hook  |pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Will still make with @HA @HK and low heart|pg||
nt|nubmaster: but difficult with 44 M's, what to bid?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ruffing diamonds in dummy reating some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|haans: would it not be better to play @SK first???|pg||
pc|h7|nt|werge: But many of us play, that this lead might be from Q-10-9-8|pg||
nt|haans: opps missed it is @H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|don paulus: that's what i expected NS to do here - bid 5|pg||

pc|s9|nt|daman: nice play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: and there is no possibility to solve the trumph suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: Henner does want to gift the slam to NS - and X of D from Partner demands D lead|pg||
nt|lesrays: well bid and played, nice lead - good bridge|pg||

nt|panja: @Sk first would be very risky|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://tinyurl.com/lmqa9z|pg||

nt|mariner1: only needed to pitch Q@H if S cashed AKh|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - stuck....|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now no entry to SK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: best it seems to ruff out the minors now, then play a trump hoping for @HA singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: hedy @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|werge: Only 50 then|pg||
nt|haans: but may b tiny tiny bit better|pg||

nt|raghavan: ah ah made|pg||

pc|s8|nt|oliverc: Declarer was alwqays going to be off if he had to open up the Diamonds himself|pg||
nt|davidstern: Finito La Musica for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|raghavan: Bertil can u suggest any way to make - I could not |pg||
nt|daman: but it's not profitable|pg||
pc|s6|nt|newmoon: lost a trick in the process tho|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|xenya: then opponents might help you with @Ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: nope|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|henryb: Mark Yeager suggests that you should win the @cA and try to find Qxx of spades with three hearts. If you are convinced that W would not lead away from the @cK that is an approach, ...|pg||
nt|henryb: certainly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: entry short for 9 tricks spades will get overruffed|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|mariner1: N is in 1N here in Open Room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: claim pl|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: with a bang, too -- 3 off|pg||
nt|mariner1: the good news is 2N should be off as well|pg||
nt|werge: Lead might have been from four to the 6...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Only 16 after this board|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: south bid 6nt in OR|pg||
nt|haans: many has won with 16|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb: first possibility gone, so now take the @s hook and hope|pg||
nt|sybarra: since can hook only one way, close eyes and hope for the best |pg||
nt|xenya: but the ace is not singleton, so he is down to the finesse|pg||
nt|daman: making 2|pg||
nt|jeanhari: which plays well after a spoade lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a dual part score swing|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb: a deep finesse|pg||

nt|haans: NS can be boody here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: And Meckstroth-Rodwell got to 3NT last deal with K single to Axxxxx in @c...|pg||
nt|sharkey: they usually don't underbid|pg||
nt|afulton: i knew i woke up too early... this is either dream or nightmare! |pg||
nt|sybarra: (from the xxx hand)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Stupid, I was scoring @S partscore not @CS it makes a substantial difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  too high at the vulnerability for n/s   even if guessing the minor suits well|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont happen much on this deal either|pg||
nt|haans: no boring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 8 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|daman: Garner will get frisky here|pg||
nt|haans: board 4|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|sybarra: X pls|pg||
nt|werge: o children at this table now, pls|pg||
nt|werge: No|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is pass forcing |pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe north might have passed with a stiff in his pard suit and a 3 count|pg||
nt|panja: 4@h will be interesting on B18|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 @c asking for 5crd major ?|pg||
nt|haans: does look like an easy 3n|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|pelu: 2@c by S = ??????|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It is not this board|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome to misfit corner|pg||
nt|jcwla: Leslie likes this auction so far.|pg||
nt|ritong: won t happen|pg||
nt|aupillon: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play X= strength vs weak NT|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces now nowdays :)))|pg||
nt|rnc: And with spades 4-1 North would probably have tried to tap declarer by continuing hearts|pg||
nt|daman: with his @C void|pg||
nt|jeanhari: thats looks forcing to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: or @H lead and win 2@H with no @c shirt|pg||
nt|rnc: Will be hard to stay out from 3NT|pg||
nt|werge: 3 X @S - ouf|pg||
nt|werge: I think we are waiting for West, nor South!|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 2@c must be drury|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: in cl|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H my bid|pg||
nt|kurtove: 7 cl|pg||
nt|hedyg: vs strong double would be 5m+4M|pg||
nt|milton_se: easy now|pg||
nt|kurtove: and now its easy|pg||
nt|haans: none nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: if so they get too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: shift|pg||
nt|haans: sure fast|pg||
nt|werge: Now E/W look more dutch to me...|pg||
nt|werge: A fair 6 @H|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt has been on the agenda for 80 years but strong nt still more popular|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt or 5@C|pg||
nt|haans: no spade lead in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: no spade from South|pg||
nt|ronpa: so the indian team has started this set very well|pg||
nt|ronpa: not missing 9876|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|lestergold: hm they may well miss their heart fit|pg||
nt|newmoon: took 4@S as a cue?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they yook wrong way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c for me|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s seems very conservative, but driving to 3@s seems like a lot|pg||
nt|raghavan: Will HQ be the lead?|pg||
nt|rnc: For sure - they are Polish :)|pg||
nt|werge: not South|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well brave effort by west with 7 count|pg||
nt|dcbutler: not at this vul|pg||
nt|ritong: now west has a serious problem|pg||
nt|ritong: his part showed a good limit raise |pg||
nt|dcbutler: wonder how much 2NT showed?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   looked enough with that collection|pg||
nt|ritong: agreed|pg||
nt|dcbutler: looks like a mixed raise (at best) to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oliver can you explain the bidding - I could not understand what is 2Club by S?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead in any case|pg||
nt|haans: we do not have their cc|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think they will make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes @H lead and it looks good|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|vugraphztg: IT IS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I'll say, both aces on side, the qj of @H flopping |pg||
nt|xenya: VERY well, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: would this bid not show a stronger hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ady: east hoping for the best here  QJ spades look poor values on the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: was 4@H fast arrival (negative bid) ?|pg||
nt|haans: why not start with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: trouble:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pre empts creat problem - that is what is intended|pg||
nt|newmoon: makes sense, Hans  :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is matter of style, but...|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|davidstern: As long as declarer doesnt try a spade to then|pg||
nt|davidstern: ten|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S 2@H 4@D and it makes in no @c shift|pg||
nt|davidstern: But if declarer plays hearts straigh back there will be a smell in the air|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but it will not be clear to N what it is from|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer's best play @HK and low club to hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think win @H and play one back is it|pg||
nt|davidstern: That will certainly get a club ace shift I suspect|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bet not :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Other table finessed @S10 I am told|pg||
nt|mariner1: i n@@o 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: if declarer plays @Ds now, it shouldn't be difficult for N to work things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room 3N and @H lead, declarer tried the @S to 10 :)|pg||
nt|rnc: If win and continue hearts, doesn't it looks like you have fast tricks? Just need a second @H-trick. Then the @C-shift is more likely to come|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Guess there will be some talk here|pg||
nt|sybarra: the tap will start on trick one, I thought |pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 @d = 1 4crd major - no 5crd|pg||
nt|haans: danilo u here?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@C Polish ... 1@H Polish upgrade (looks like 4@S) |pg||
nt|haans: get u Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: tre other 3 hand = the bidding, but S??|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe South's 2@C shows both majors, but West doesn't care|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|pelu: or dont know? - if opp alert 2@C u dont exp both majors .)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: We had a problem at the begin, they switched Open and Closed Room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|brgpro: hello|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was weak both majors, i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So , sorry for the problems but it was not our fault|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: She is thinking a lot........|pg||
nt|wwalter: no cant lose the @c lead|pg||
nt|charles_l: guess the lead....|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no evidently not|pg||
nt|don paulus: think 2 @h would mean 4th suit - and be stronger|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of work to do in 3h with these unfavourable breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in the Open. This match is from the women's event although the banner reads Open Teams|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT you should always bid - and beat. 5 @C is easy - without the @S-lead, which Easts 1 @S-bid has avoided|pg||
nt|haans: will they miss thsi game?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@C must be Puppet Stayman, and if 2NT = min they may not bid game |pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|lestergold: and that force beginning immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: north doesnt really want to ruff but can hradly lead spades!|pg||
nt|ritong: danger zone entered|pg||
nt|ady: yes    too high now|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@c is not possible because it is forcing to game (artificial in their methods)|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in trouble now|pg||
nt|werge: Less than 1100 seems to deserve the commentaire: WELL played |pg||
nt|panja: establishment bias....|pg||
nt|haans: perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and he will make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I was away a minute|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it a weak opening in a Major?  and 2H by N is pass or correct?|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sounds like it|pg||
nt|xenya: i could make this contract|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now will he pas this dbl?|pg||
nt|daman: the 3@S bid was uncalled for|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must be|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: how about a @C?|pg||
nt|mariner1: thinking too long also gives them a signal|pg||
nt|fann4: Ew in 3NT in the CR, making on a @S lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E is going to hate this|pg||
nt|werge: But 3 NT by East OK|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|haans: hi|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Crash seems to have deleted most of the scores|pg||
nt|haans: not much is happening|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: crash sistem on bbo :) wait a second please|pg||
mb|3N|an| |nt|henryb: BTW, unless there is a systemic reason not to open 1@c, I think 1N is not very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|haans: 13 hcp for opps|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by S - also 5D makes but this 4H is a trial on way to 5D|pg||
nt|haans: but will it make?|pg||
nt|werge: Problem in 6 @H is, that you have "some" possibilities in the @S-suit, in 6 NT it´s easy play = double finesse|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Morning Hans x 2 and Martin|pg||
nt|haans: morning Roland|pg||
nt|werge: - and you go down in 6 NT, I think 6 @H makes easiily|pg||
nt|werge: Morning Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
nt|haans: yeah need only 1 ruff|pg||
nt|panja: there are a lot of trade barriers etc. in bridge, too|pg||
nt|werge: West|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: But all in all, the auction could have been considerably worse.  This spot is reasonable if perhaps not ideal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he didnt know he would find partner with 100 honours in dims|pg||
nt|haans: may be 10-12 nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: W not happy about the pull here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must know his partner has stretched|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may pass 4D|pg||
nt|mariner1: if E tries to reason out the cards it should show him W has a @c stack,,,,,,|pg||
nt|werge: I take every bet, that this board will be a swing - and I have NOT seen it played in OR!|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe a talk about making inappropriate noises with a pile of festering garbage|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has good coverage of other 3 suits - prefers 3 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H in Open |pg||
nt|haans: and its a make|pg||
nt|afulton: everything works on this... next hand? |pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: a good lead 1H+3Spades + atleast 1 minor K|pg||
nt|rnc: Me too...|pg||
nt|sommer: like a walk in the park:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but normaly south should have some fit for bidding 3@S in second round|pg||
nt|daman: if you live by the sword you should be prepared to die by the sword and pass 4@C doubled|pg||
nt|haans: i do not bet against you here :)))|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt and support x do not mix|pg||
nt|werge: One down is good bridge|pg||
nt|haans: when S gets in trouble|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am getting loads of private messages and can't respond to them all. BBO does *not* decide which matches we get, so approach the EBL if you are unhappy about no match from the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Open in this set|pg||
nt|ronpa: did declarer really played @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this should be a useful swing to Neve|pg||
nt|kurtove: do they play 2 club as gf?|pg||
nt|mariner1: same play here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still need club now though|pg||
nt|davidstern: North can divine that declarer is looking for ninth trick and might get aggressive|pg||
nt|xenya: can postpone that|pg||
nt|mariner1: now N knows W has the @H's|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think North will get this right|pg||
nt|davidstern: He knows declarer likely has 3 spades and four diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N in fact made on 3 so 7 imps to Herbst|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will give north due credit if he does it but I wouldnt think it is defence of the year material|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @S finesse looks a reasonable play|pg||
nt|mariner1: the other problem is if N plays A@C what are S's signals?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am betting @CA next|pg||
nt|xenya: at least it's the only legitimate chance to make -- or nearly so|pg||
nt|rnc: and this seems to go one off|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither|pg||
nt|sharkey: I don't know why Hamson didn't just bid 3@C Vul - which should show a fairly big hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: YES|pg||
nt|haans: do not know what bidding meant do not want to know|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: S doesn't know that, of course -- from her perspectibe, contract mau be in real danger |pg||
nt|henryb: this is not worth a 15-17 1N (I do not know their range) and Jx is not a holding you particularly want to have as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5422 pattern  (yuck) |pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has already his 2 suiter hand If W still doubles, E must respect w decision|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Zia bidding immediatly as south|pg||
nt|sharkey: especially if the have Good/Bad 2 NT available|pg||
nt|werge: Not best defence this - but who cares...?|pg||
nt|haans: had Qx in ps suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: he thought his qx of spade was working bwecause his partner had bid spades VULNERABLE agaibnst not to boot|pg||
nt|sharkey: still - 5 level?|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead = 9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: the spot is ok its just the layout which is savage of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|ritong: hello G|pg||
nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: looks like I missed some action already|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, first boards swinged|pg||
nt|daman: this will swing too    doomed|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not neutral either, rite|pg||
nt|daman: aggressive bidding by West opposite a passed hand   will pay the price|pg||
nt|rnc: And it's not the Jurassic one this time|pg||
nt|werge: Better @D back - and uppercut with @C 9|pg||
nt|haans: x men 15-19 hcp bid something|pg||
nt|haans: balanced hand|pg||
nt|haans: how many understand me?|pg||
nt|panja: this 3Nt might not be all that simple...|pg||
nt|lesrays: surely not?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk5: The most notable fact is that Team Lavazza did not qualify for Swiss A and that they won't qualify for the knockout phase either. They are currently 28th in Swiss B|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a classical way to only loose 1 @s trick. a small from the table to 7 and next @sQ pinning the @sJ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well I was half right but -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done Godefory|pg||
nt|davidstern: Godefroy|pg||
nt|mariner1: small @c works too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's good enough - 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree too far but his pard was bonkers on this occasion|pg||
nt|haans: yes not  best defense|pg||
nt|nubmaster: always difficult play in def with a lot of high cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are still a number of diamond pips which will have something to say shortly|pg||
nt|werge: My guess: We are waiting for SOUTH now...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Spec tells me 2@D = 4@S with min/max or no Major|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|xenya: sigh of relief from S|pg||
nt|xenya: now she will be quick to grab 11 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: W in 3N in Open Room here|pg||
nt|fann4: E must play 3 rounds of @H to promote West's @SK|pg||
nt|afulton: south could have trusted luck and made 6... may STILL make 6|pg||
nt|lesrays: sorry, :)|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 aces for defense|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: In the OR W passed the 2@C rebid and Hinden went -2 for -200.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Leslie knows that preventing spade ruffs more important than worrying about trump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: in most natral systems the ability to show heart suit in  a weak hand would not exist|pg||
nt|ampelman: my version is from july 2008|pg||
nt|hedyg: the players all had give in their CCs before play started, shame we have no access to them|pg||
pc|cA|nt|raghavan: 4 Spades, 5D making but did not stop|pg||
nt|sommer: but no overtrick with @Sshift|pg||
nt|panja: I don't....|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we were waiting for W |pg||
nt|werge: Sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: notice they have not tapped declarer yet |pg||
nt|haans: u really think??????????????|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: We dont know, but asume that West didnt know :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised to see they play 2@c as weak both majors as they are not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|athene: anything beat here|pg||
nt|athene: even @SA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can never get the diamond ruff AND draw trumps and get the pitch on the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: west might well have bid 2@S over 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|athene: often when you play these bids, you get big gains from opps not bidding their cold 4major|pg||
nt|athene: when you have just 4 small in one of the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps 2@C was something else like weak with diamonds OR weak both majors OR some strong hands|pg||
nt|haans: fantunes then did they make it?|pg||
nt|don paulus: it's going really fast for Herbst ) they bid slam on previous board - 1 off|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: N might steel a @D playing toward Q|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oliverc: Apparently, NS play Dwururka - the Little major like system developed by Pazur|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's going on?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: renonce by west director on table|pg||
nt|jeanhari: such dull board, operator must com into action !:)|pg||
nt|haans: i think Heller say 1 trick for @HK|pg||
nt|sybarra: but now may be the time |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kurtove: 2 cl not GF|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H =relay 2nt=5 card suit 3@C = wich 3nt = clubs say spec |pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: can claim that now|pg||
nt|lestergold: good defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Mu sequence had been 1@s - 2@c 2@d - 2@s - P. 2@s had promised a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes nice swing here|pg||
nt|rnc: I have not read the conditions of contest, but if it's the same procedure as in the Mixed Teams there is an advantage in finishing on top since you have some choosing possibilities ...|pg||
nt|rnc: for the KO-match.|pg||
nt|panja: this might turn out to be a good sac against 3Nt|pg||
nt|haans: squeeze?|pg||
nt|haans: may be best play in 4nt|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes W squeezed in @D and @Ss|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lvpx76  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 off?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1400 any takers?|pg||
nt|don paulus: can claim now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: now the trump trick is still there!! and all the spades too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi yer  Bill|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some discussion of rebidding 1NT with the E hand.  Certainly reasonable to rebid 2@C (as both did) with nine cards in two suits, but 1NT would have worked like a charm here to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: allow E/W to drop dead in 2@H.|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill.|pg||
nt|milton_se: killing lead though|pg||
nt|ronpa: giving up overtricks in a close match might be something u'll be sorry for doing at the end|pg||
nt|lesrays: obviously playing to get ruff and sluff - but E was up to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: now the pitch could potentially be in wrong hand |pg||
nt|ronpa: and this indian team knows it well, they won 2 matches in overtime already|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @d discart on @h|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Hi Rashid, Paul|pg||
nt|don paulus: @d goes on @h|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: still one|pg||
nt|haans: and still a spade loser|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud be |pg||
nt|panja: so we can begin at the beginning..|pg||
nt|haans: an other day|pg||
nt|panja: S sitting over E with minors....this is now likely to go down|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in @D|pg||
nt|panja: well..Decl will have to guess @CQ to do that|pg||
nt|haans: play @CA play all @D|pg||
nt|haans: does he know who has last spade?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 off also ?|pg||
nt|ady: 7@HX  on board 16 should have been a save against a vul 6@S making    but the contract in open room was 5@HX|pg||
nt|daman: East assumed a Drury stance with 3433  9 count    not clever|pg||
nt|ritong: well it saved some anyways|pg||
nt|ritong: which is the target of sacrifices:)|pg||
nt|daman: some of those targets are pretty small|pg||
nt|ady: turned out an 11 imp loss rather than a possible 12 imp gain|pg||
nt|daman: Barry Crane used to say....."Only Jesus saves..."|pg||
nt|kurtove: so it is a bit hurry to bid 4 h now, i think|pg||
nt|davidstern: One thing that has impressed me in these championships is the very large number of young people at this tournament|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are right, Carl|pg||
nt|haans: is that not really at 2nt opening|pg||
nt|werge: 1400 should assure them a flat board|pg||
pc|sT|nt|raghavan: D 10 ruff is begging|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Who would have thought this 1NT would take about an hour to play?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bet if W has won @H in hand and led one back this would have made|pg||
nt|Walddk5:  1 gets to choose first, then  2, and so on|pg||
nt|rnc: They are on their way to make it (3NT) in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Among 17-32|pg||
nt|afulton: In many close matches, these small imp swings actually cost the match|pg||

nt|panja: it has got partner thinking, should he cash the @S9 or not?|pg||
nt|haans: spade 9 BIG|pg||
nt|haans: @S9 squeezing p|pg||
nt|panja: if there is a sq, there is a matching endplay opportunity, looking at @CKJ..so @S9 cashing is fine|pg||
nt|haans: youi have never agreed with my comments|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: West could bid 2@H natural non-forcing over 2@C as a passed hand, surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this could be flat with the defence taking 6 tricks unless endplayed which i think is do able now|pg||
nt|haans: endplaying W H|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb: not quite yet|pg||

pc|s3|nt|davidstern: Whenever I am in the corridors there are plenty of young players|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|henryb: 1N would be a one round force and this would show a three card limit raise|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s8|pc|dJ|nt|dcbutler: declarer needs both QJ of diamonds (or 4) in north|pg||

nt|ritong: but genuine down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: nicwe to see|pg||

nt|haans: always  a little below|pg||
nt|werge: One finesse is a "double" one|pg||

nt|april7: E should haqve known that W has no point|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S i think|pg||
nt|haans: just 4@H nothing else|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if east bids 6@S, Sabine had better lead the right ace!|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6C for EW|pg||

nt|jeanhari: sort of|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Swiss B that is|pg||

mb|1C|nt|daman: the push to 5@H on the last cost 10 big ones|pg||

nt|don paulus: hi buddy wlc|pg||
nt|buddyshah: great start by Herbst|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: looks like 12 tricks in @s for E. why? well, you tend to lead from your short AK....|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3 down how come i missed something obviously|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@C/@D by EW|pg||

nt|haans: 2nt good prempt|pg||
nt|aupillon: now minor slam in progress ...|pg||
nt|kurtove: 5 club|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely changed their system, last year this was 20-21|pg||
nt|aupillon: try 4 spades, a Splinter bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 23 here NS 3NT-2, in OR 4D made so welland gets 8 IMP|pg||
nt|newmoon: they should get to 6@H here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@D must show the majors here|pg||

nt|haans: 1@S a novel biddding|pg||
nt|buddyshah: hi Avram|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt also|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: but not when west has shown hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|xenya: the vulnerability should deter EW from sacrificing|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Bergen now?|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d would a tad pushy|pg||
nt|milton_se: doesn't look like that :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: only H lead sets 6C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that means that after  - alt least - 1@s opening it´s impossible to play 1nt|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to stop in 1N|pg||
nt|werge: Board 18 was perfect for playing behind screens|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S as a weak bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as he now surely will|pg||
nt|ritong: be*|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in fact north pass :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S best contract|pg||
nt|haans: or 21D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For E/W anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@H looks the limit on good defense|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, 12 tricks in 4@S with a good view|pg||
nt|raghavan: D bid showing both majors |pg||
nt|mariner1: problem is N might think they need to guard over tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: very true, Rob, but N shouldn't be caught sleeping here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well as I said, thinking that long alerts the opponent that there is an issue|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - found out too late 2 Keycards missing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: ok - maybe he won't get the chance|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I raise,  wonder if 2 @S or 3 H! is better |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H |pg||
nt|don paulus: ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The club layout might see this one home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here game to be bid but both 3n and 4h look precarious on thelayout|pg||
nt|pelu: 11-14 5-5 in m|pg||
nt|haans: not an easy make  4-1 in @H|pg||
nt|newmoon: Zia's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|haans: only @CK right|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h possible here, even though the trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bd 2 hot wines get 12   and Bd 3 - Zeleski get 10 IMP |pg||
nt|henryb: that is correct. its not my choice but it would be the most common over here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Running scores are back|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass might be 5-7 count|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will make on B15, but 4@H in 43 fit, yet again, might be a better spot a priori|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, W made an immediate 2@S wjo|pg||
nt|lesrays: it was a donation, not a score|pg||
nt|ronpa: will north dbl for lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: but even on @hA lead, does E have enough entries?|pg||
nt|pelu: we have no scores yet from CR - but i look like +11 on B16 (for the slam) and -5 B18 3@C making in CR|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering about the play - @S9xx is a trouble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you can't make 6@S anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @S @S @C @D to lose in 4@H; should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see anyway of 4h making|pg||
nt|oliverc: Apparently 2@C was 4+5+ in the Majors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will bid 3 I presume|pg||
nt|jeanhari: too late for predictions :)|pg||
nt|haans: yes prepared to stretch|pg||
nt|werge: NOW Wests hand nis very BIG...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Tomorrow we will be showing the Open final + either the Women's or Seniors' (depending on score)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|davidstern: So Bessis on the board|pg||
nt|haans: icedlandic pecision perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men då kan jag påpeka att typ ägg typ inte är helt rätt...|pg||
nt|werge: or 2 of them...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Some play X as 5-7 and pass is <4|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might bid 2@S here..... and play in a Moysian a level lower|pg||
nt|panja: did they end up in 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: even less now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: trtue|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|werge: 480 - flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: the reasonable contract|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|aupillon: sure,clubs 2/2, diamonds 2/2....|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some|pg||
nt|werge: Because of @H Queen|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR they bid and made 4H in deal 18 so Sweeden got 10 IMP It is 35 against 36 - tough fight|pg||
nt|rnmalik: after DBL 1@S could be only 4+|pg||
nt|april7: S took away W's bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I am getting some tea|pg||
nt|ritong: showing @ds and @ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: very fat 2C -- may be hard to communicate|pg||
nt|jeanhari: should help enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: with limited access to dummy this helps solve one issue|pg||
nt|rnc: Zimmerman 16 VPs ahead of Apteker going into this round, 13 VPs ahead of 2nd (Jacob), so it's odds on for Zimmerman winning the Swiss A|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes, Helness jumped straight to 3NT|pg||
nt|werge: Better take your 300 against 2 @S X|pg||
nt|haans: adrenaline high now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levin/Hamson need to forget the last and regroup|pg||
nt|sybarra: W transfering back to @H's|pg||
nt|ronpa: missed his chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: should make 5|pg||
nt|panja: on a @C lead, Declarer must boldly play a @H to K sometime, on @D lead, that is the play to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: on that lead possible|pg||
nt|charles_l: might unboldly go for 10 tricks though |pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s would be an egregious overbid|pg||
nt|ritong: bergen style not popular in france|pg||
nt|daman: merci|pg||
nt|daman: quatre piques fait cing ici|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|daman: cinq*|pg||

nt|davidstern: Other table North playing 3@D on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Precision is SO much easier to understand LOL|pg||
nt|newmoon: swop @H8 and @H7, and it gets difficult    :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: missed... 1@s overcall slightly misleaded them|pg||
nt|lestergold: but w wont forget it in a hurry|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Straightforward|pg||
nt|haans: yep boring|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: seems they entered wrong dec. on the first bd, so it is 13 instead of 18|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza shd be 5 imps less|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have pointed out that 6@S will make on @HA lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer shouldn't be given a chance to get a spade away from either hand on a long minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt must be lebesohl|pg||
nt|haans: leben|pg||
nt|raghavan: good lead |pg||
nt|milton_se: only +1 now|pg||
nt|raghavan: there are 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|newmoon: panel - response to 1@C?   1@D or 1@H ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: not to be|pg||
nt|werge: Has´nt West not just a 4 @H over 2 @H - 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another imp available here|pg||
nt|afulton: the double would have gained them an imp! |pg||
nt|april7: best is if S passes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: 3@H for me too|pg||
nt|rnc: That's one (of many) reasons why Meckwell usually play so fast|pg||
nt|mariner1: the VUL position makes this tough|pg||
pc|s7|nt|charles_l: i think its 9 or 11, personally|pg||
nt|wwalter: I bet 4 11 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow saly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hans you havent seen commentators manual Page 4 Paragraph 7 - we save bandwidth and do not correct minor typos|pg||
nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: May lose 1-2-2-1|pg||
nt|davidstern: For -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H not played could have developped 1 more in D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks quite normal though -- and makeable|pg||
nt|panja: @ST or small lead?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But the temptation of the Vulnerable game is hard to resist|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - even 500 is easy to get|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: you can cash @CAKQ and make all the trumps separately on a crossruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that prob resolved at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if south didnt find a spade lead there is no way he wouldnt find the switch when in with Kc|pg||
nt|kurtove: if he entres the table|pg||
nt|davidstern: That lead looks helpful but if he puts up @CJ and finesses heart will prove a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D down in other room|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: common now  1@D transfer :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 9 top tricks - 1S + 4H +3D + 1c  more may come by CK finesse etc|pg||
nt|newmoon: Kib says "guess this is a good example for walsh even on a good hand."|pg||
nt|haans: i would show my hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sure west should show Hearts  |pg||
nt|newmoon: well... whatever, this match is based on "winning on the opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@d,3@s and jump (which King will be chosen?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: salam|pg||
nt|haans: may be sad when he finds out no extra @H-trick|pg||
nt|danilo1: E will probably make at least a little slam try (not just 4@S) |pg||
nt|haans: if E pass 3nt be very nervous if @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: to late :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|charles_l: no takers :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: making 12 now|pg||
nt|haans: standard is to bid @D only with longer @D|pg||
nt|nubmaster: make now...|pg||
nt|sharkey: not anymore Shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the old days we led fourth best from north's holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: now we block the suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: life just got better for sure|pg||
nt|buddyshah: looks like -1 on 8@C lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|star6ija: @s Jack could be ducked now and black squeeze after that for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: nooo|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3@H does seem on|pg||
nt|mariner1: making is worth an imp|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dim if thats the way declarer plays it|pg||

nt|milton_se: in fact 2 (J dropping)|pg||
nt|haans: ame squeeze|pg||
nt|haans: sme|pg||
nt|haans: same|pg||
nt|star6ija: still possible, yup|pg||
nt|lestergold: new days that old guys like me dont understan that well|pg||
nt|haans: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer did well to grab it|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt need a spade switch of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the good old black will save another slam before it sinks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@H problem solved now EW will play 5@H|pg||
nt|werge: - which will bring 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|haans: easy 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: no overtrick?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes there should be an overtrick now|pg||
nt|haans: how did they avoid it?|pg||

nt|brgpro: one spec. asked me if the ladies have sit S or E in this event, i guess yes|pg||
nt|athene: -450 can't surely be bad for NS|pg||
nt|brgpro: but i dont know for sure|pg||
nt|wwalter: @d than @h|pg||
nt|ritong: "my grand gin card" allix thinks|pg||
nt|kurtove: and 2 imps to bessis|pg||
nt|davidstern: and there you go|pg||
nt|davidstern: As do both teams - running 31st with 2 qualifying|pg||
nt|rnc: So, we have the same contract - on a longer auction though|pg||
nt|lestergold: betterunclock hearts and duck a club|pg||

nt|jeanhari: club now for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: we get it|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to be doing the club first |pg||
nt|lestergold: im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: id have done hearts first|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications slightly awkwar on this han|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - some communications problems now|pg||
nt|haans: @D blocked|pg||
nt|sybarra: but "unclock" may work also on N |pg||
nt|MolvaM: in real life 5 lavel contracts fail quite frequently. not here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: real life = my life|pg||
nt|werge: A french player tells me, that East could just have passed to 5 @S!!!|pg||
nt|werge: That is 2 down, but would often make|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @H is NOT making very often|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: -650 sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: still 6 tricks for the declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead and diamond underlead to get a ruff would be interesting|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but not today|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now he can make 6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: 13-11 to Lavazza after 4 bords |pg||

nt|davidstern: Herbst 39th with current score|pg||
nt|haans: rare to pass and not transfer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wwalter: can play a @s also|pg||
nt|davidstern: Perhaps 100 = 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have been worried about where all the @ss were|pg||
nt|rnmalik: likely|pg||
nt|don paulus: so 1st imps to Texan Aces ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense by E|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb: it is a bad habit|pg||
nt|raghavan: a costly 1NT - If S passed they will be playing in a part score.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C now|pg||
nt|lestergold: one way or the other cant be broken now|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you declarer can go wrong|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jeanhari: maybe south shouldnt have played diamond ace|pg||
nt|sharkey: may have to guess @S now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now i bet he wished hed unblocked the pesky hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|haans: im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: frankly a surprising error for cardplay at thislevel|pg||
nt|haans: @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looked autonatic to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: and should have been Mike |pg||
nt|sybarra: (imo )|pg||
nt|haans: may b because last board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as Haans mentioned the adrenaline may be running high for EW which may explain some|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its a verylong tourney i suppose hard for them all to play at the top of their form|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brgpro: why shd I know....or what do I know...I am not a director...|pg||

pc|d8|nt|charles_l: @s also ok - can force a reentry|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|kurtove: sry|pg||
nt|henryb: not that costly. West would have balanced with 1N and east west tould play 1N or 2H|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal No 4 they also played in 3S-2 = Push|pg||
nt|haans: @D is called giving up|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lhagwq  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||

nt|charles_l: now a bold @h|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps and play three rounds of diamonds now|pg||
nt|haans: precision 2@C opening in other table paid this time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 14 imp swing possible on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably quite hot in san remo in mid june|pg||
nt|werge: This overtrick only is good for your health - still 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT pass should not be in consideration despite 4-3-3-3 ... hand with controls (Aces and Kings) .. I have expected 4@C over 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|raghavan: Can you tell me as which countries these 2 pairs belong to?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D around sure looked right there,,,,,,|pg||
nt|raghavan: may play SA|pg||
nt|lestergold: wish i was there|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: hope someone has to lead away from @CK|pg||
nt|sommer: @H to 10 now...no:)|pg||
nt|werge: Not only possible, please|pg||
nt|haans: much has happened at bridge table|pg||
nt|werge: You very often can judge the "quality" of a contract, when you follow the speed, declarer plays in...  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes but now we see the Open result|pg||
nt|haans: only - 7 imps|pg||
nt|werge: A brave man would have paid the 500 long time ago - CLAIM|pg||
nt|haans: most of us do not do that|pg||
nt|werge: No comment...|pg||
nt|haans: QJ dubble in @H = only 200|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still hoping for less than 500 - if QJ @H doubleton it would be very interesting|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Incidentally, the Open Final is much closer 11-9 played 6, Dutch trailing there too|pg||
pc|h3|nt|werge: Regarding the @S-suit known, you cannot even put the other cards in a way, which make 3 NT, best would be @H Q-J doubleton for 200|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round the first 27 teams from Swiss A and first 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|nubmaster: a @s guess now|pg||
nt|lestergold: not playig bridge  i mean on beach|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: too fast |pg||
nt|afulton: sorry, i not following this defense or line... they give up 1 trick on opening but east gives it back but south says NONO you take it and east insists!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davidstern: If he can manage -160 would be 2|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks now - well done|pg||
nt|afulton: from first hand experience, I can tell you... when the players start to go in lightening mode, it is very dificult to follow! |pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@S|pg||
nt|april7: now only 2 down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: what|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levin missed it....|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh, 9th trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they (defense) are not helping him |pg||
nt|haans: really|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||

nt|davidstern: Duck to get club through|pg||
nt|xenya: strange -- how could a @H to the 10 be worse?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: Levin had to return @S to test declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: unbelieveable what we are seeing a ping pong of errors of a type we might see in some remote location second rate tourney not in this sort of match|pg||
nt|haans: lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll|pg||
nt|nubmaster: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heat and the 1400 a fatal cocktail for levin maybe|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: sorry it is not easy to play with leslie that don't show cards :)|pg||
nt|daman: in North America   the @C Queen would be called an "elbow card"  you push it between the AKJ10 with your elbow and smile|pg||

nt|hedyg: a typical points-shmoints hand|pg||

nt|raghavan: S must pass|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 9 tricks made|pg||
nt|haans: nor me|pg||

nt|Walddk5: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 segments of 16 in the final|pg||
nt|werge: I agree with the unlikely Q-J position in @H, but both of you had faound out long time ago - NEW BOARD|pg||
nt|nubmaster: And Meckwell in 3NT, @s lead from south|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S get it|pg||
nt|nubmaster: last deal|pg||
nt|werge: By some luck, the opponent with @D Ace waould NOT be on lead|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: israel|pg||
nt|haans: to weak for 3nt |pg||
nt|werge: In Open, East and West did´nt play the same system here. East opened a weak 2 - and West drove on to 3 NT...|pg||
nt|afulton: and they don't make a point of allowing the VG operator to see|pg||
nt|lesrays: On board 18 where declarer here made 10 of the 12 tricks, Welland raised Zia's 1NT to 3 and they led a heart...|pg||
nt|haans: but it would not be wrong to have a little talk with p|pg||
nt|danilo1: AK is correct play ... wins vs 3-3 any any Hx ... 10 wins only ve Hx or Hxx at North|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt again|pg||
nt|danilo1: may be 1@C (Polish)|pg||
nt|haans: yeah|pg||
nt|danilo1: depends on NT steps agreement|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C-1@S-2@D|pg||
nt|haans: looks funny|pg||
nt|haans: are 2@C after 1@C natural for u?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wonderful misfit - anyone declaring is in trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Jos and discussed this earlier. We think it's against the EU rules if you took it that far|pg||

nt|wwalter: how 7?|pg||
nt|charles_l: sitff @hJ and dummy reverse|pg||

nt|davidstern: Over E/W 4@S|pg||
nt|aupillon: can one say 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|pelu: so the 5-level is max for both sides - will they fight on 6-level? :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW Turkish, apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk5: However, this is not about winning according to Pierre de Coubertin|pg||
nt|raghavan: a X bid is good for S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I must bid on S now i prefer D|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: easier if played in S but still makes|pg||
nt|davidstern: Cash 3 spades and a diamond and gain an IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on TOOLBAR|pg||
nt|mariner1: and then OPEN or CLOSED|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @S lead on the auction in Open Room might be called for|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm |pg||
nt|werge: West has the fastest pass, I have seen for years!!!|pg||
nt|haans: well done passs more often :)|pg||
nt|haans: many use 2@D as michaels|pg||
mb|3C|nt|MolvaM: that the screen partners on one side should be one lady and one gentleman|pg||
nt|athene: i know Sabine Auken doesn't like it - she complained about it in her book :)|pg||

nt|raghavan: Yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|charles_l: N has single J|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder we've got a football (soccer) score in this set so far -- 2-1 -- the hands have been fairly routine |pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@D in both rooms|pg||
nt|kurtove: Not a good result for bessis in open|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 4NT|pg||
nt|aupillon: enfin. In fine...|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 6+@c +4@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: If E misses this chance, may not get again|pg||

nt|Walddk5: "The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well"|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|newmoon: previous hand Zia opened with unbalanced 17|pg||
nt|haans: zia has never bid polish|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a @h lead from S I vote for -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: a natural D lead is there - may shorten Declarer's trump holding|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: well E bids the @S here, so auction will be different|pg||
nt|mariner1: S may end up playing 3N now|pg||
nt|haans: and now an easy 1nt  (thats all)|pg||
nt|werge: In OR, thay mus have an agreement NOT to lead a @S against NT|pg||
nt|werge: they must|pg||
nt|werge: North is wondering about the game here|pg||
nt|april7: again 2 down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No For me it would be Majors, but if the 1C opening is artificial, I know pairs who play "@C as natC|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: well I was talking about the general EBL rules :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes they both like their pure 6-4|pg||
nt|milton_se: not happy w spades bid by LHO...|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid now 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: although he will be disappointed to find the @sK offside|pg||
nt|raghavan: He will try to enter Dummy thru SK or CJ|pg||
nt|henryb: I am not sure that a @d is right. I was taught to lead trump when partner passes a 1 level double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|haans: but very close :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no it isnt... maybe it is after the lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After a club lead, it will certainly make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: small club?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On a spade lead, i wouldn't like to predict the outcome|pg||
nt|haans: easier for N to enter now|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jim Hay|pg||

nt|werge: Change the minor kings - and it´s an easy 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: But he was right. 2 @S is NOT a winner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leading yr longest suit on vugraf is a bit old fashioned|pg||
nt|werge: So put the 200 into your pocket|pg||
nt|werge: Problem is: 3 @C is a good contract - BUT: South will not pass|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Peter Eidt|pg||
nt|petere: good morning together|pg||
nt|werge: As West, I would lead a @D|pg||
nt|haans: 5 down still + score|pg||
nt|rnmalik: What EW are playing as defense to 1NT-DBL single suit?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wwalter: I see playing rederse summy, ruffing 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s looks making as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: if south had raised to 4@D i am sure west wld have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed not|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find who should play 4@H|pg||
nt|kurtove: must be worth trying 4 h with that hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: problem for Gromov heren, choose the right bid as the cards lie|pg||
nt|raghavan: that is the 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must take it though|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only 2 |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d maybe not 3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well they will certainly lead @S here|pg||
nt|werge: It´s not the LONGESTR - @d just as long...|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play 3 nt here |pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
nt|haans: i think 3@C was prempt but what choice did she have|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb: this hand is not trivial if N-s play more @h|pg||
nt|kurtove: in North|pg||
nt|haans: play 1 @D get it claim|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprising|pg||
nt|fann4: If played constructively, even facing 6 of them.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: when everyone bids at the table people get suspicious and tend to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D or 3@H|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Jim|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|haans: very close|pg||
nt|haans: nyström has nothing in @H or @C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: huge dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 rounds of @d a @c shift and a @c discard on next @d|pg||
nt|sommer: small @S lead..and?|pg||
nt|werge: Down on the nnaturral @S-lead|pg||
nt|rnc: as predicted, 3NT from the South seat|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows S has a @S stopper so.............|pg||
nt|buddyshah: m+M  m longer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: but south was + score|pg||
nt|sommer: then "noisy":)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: alsways down on 6-2 as defenders will switch to a spade|pg||
nt|xenya: well done, though i'm not sure how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
nt|werge: 550 out through is no PLUS-score, Haansf|pg||
nt|haans: yes they play togther RIGHT|pg||
nt|werge: through the window, I meant|pg||
nt|petere: but 550 in is one :)|pg||
nt|haans: good double lead now :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: puppet, unpleasynt Dble ... but North has no options except 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: no|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I wonder why double for the lead when you are going to be on lead?|pg||
nt|haans: we all mhave seen it|pg||
nt|haans: i once did!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: did not lead it !!|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably very rite, Martin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||
nt|haans: decl finessed against me!|pg||
nt|haans: i had nothing in the suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brgpro: no....Roland, rules are made to be followed, doesnt matter. sometimes men might like to sit S, they cant as well|pg||
nt|wwalter: reverse dummy :)|pg||
nt|haans: but that is pairs thinking|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 top losers without the option|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Perhaps it should stand 2@d there... just an error...|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes sense - 2@S showing @H fit|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Usually 2@s is for play against a 2@d opening showing weak major and you have to 3@h if opener had @hs|pg||
nt|werge: I am told, that they led a @S in Open - then they must have covered the @D Queen - or?|pg||
nt|haans: they called TD|pg||
nt|haans: TD told me NOW BUT NEVER AGAIN|pg||
nt|haans: if 2@C landy|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|mariner1: migth see the @D switch now|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@s from north and 3nt?|pg||
nt|raghavan: good |pg||
nt|haans: and well done|pg||
nt|ahh: will be easy on @S lead |pg||
nt|mcarroll: should be no problem in the play|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless a @H lead is found|pg||
nt|ahh: @H lead  makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True and now W is stuck as Dbl would be takeout|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brgpro: why W didnt bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: they can in a lot of nations|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @dQ is a big card after pd responded 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: well he hasn't got @DA or @DK|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree - he has a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: with sixth heart as well, which 2@H might not have promised|pg||
nt|aupillon: and slowly, but surely, thry drew their plans agains us ( War of The Worlds)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland has to find @S Jack now|pg||
nt|werge: You have seen to many crimi´s in TV, when you think a @D-lead is good. North MUSThave been misinformed about the 3 @S-bid|pg||
nt|sommer: so it became (maybe) a great and lucky gain for the Americans|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S+2@H+2@C=?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: still i think this is more east's fault|pg||
nt|brgpro: very often, @s in pd's side suit is bigger than a K or even an A|pg||
nt|athene: when you look at that east hand you can see partner can't do much over 4@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: Qs i mean|pg||
nt|brgpro: W shd definitelly "cue" bid 4@d|pg||
nt|charles_l: in canape you do not respond on 4 as partner will either have 3 or 5|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but top @c ducked and then east is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: as it  turn o ut 2 hearts  or even 2@D  works better for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: luxemburg has done well this far|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match both in 3N, making 3 and 4|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ALL results on the board already recorded http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.06..795|pg||
nt|rnc: Prospect looks bad from West's point of view|pg||
nt|davidstern: Change that 006 for any other board number|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows E has to have something, and the only thing he can have is A@D or K@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: 6D+1C+2S and 1H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: at most|pg||
nt|sybarra: now on to 4 @S |pg||
pc|dK|nt|panja: so 1@S response should be fine here..|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame east for passing doesnt know about stiff dim opposite as u imply so rightly|pg||
nt|star6ija: now twelve tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 12|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: and would have passed with K@D|pg||
nt|rnc: West bought the contract, uncontested, in 1NT in the OR. North never mentioning the @Ds.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: y, sorry Carl... repeat here :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: took the short cut|pg||
nt|ronpa: only @H lead will beat this|pg||
nt|afulton: this might not fare well on @H lead|pg||
nt|werge: But we saw earlier, that double-leads are not popular|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H fails, but 4@S can be made|pg||
nt|raghavan: Should play D and continue to shorten S in trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@H is not an error. Shows 5-6 spades and 3-10 hcp|pg||
nt|MolvaM: to a minus score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but you never know|pg||
nt|werge: What´s this game called?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S has already shown a @S stop so straight to the NT game|pg||
nt|haans: @C was not a winner|pg||
nt|raghavan: He should immediately play S|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|afulton: they decided to go for it|pg||
nt|ronpa: wow|pg||
nt|lesrays: well done, @d Q must have been tempting|pg||
nt|afulton: So, 2@H's, ruff and the ace of @s |pg||
nt|sybarra: played from the other side at the OR |pg||
nt|mcarroll: So alevel higher and a flat board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: Now to see if it can be made|pg||
nt|MolvaM: name of the game is "bid 3nt and see what happens"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought 3@D was a good pass but trouble:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Was not but became a winner|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: defence will hav e to do the right thing though|pg||
nt|henryb: really? Is N trying to let this make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Defence is not on top|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: So on that board which required a club switch to beat 3NT http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=004.06..795|pg||
nt|mariner1: there goes the beer card|pg||
nt|davidstern: And you will see about half the field is beating it|pg||
nt|haans: a board to talk about|pg||
nt|ronpa: thats a viugraph error|pg||
nt|haans: yes WHY|pg||
nt|haans: and why did he tell me Now but never again|pg||
nt|danilo1: but now ... if I already Dbled (would not) and also if I did not Dble .. I would NEVER lead @D ... neutral in strong NT ... since looks like North has @H ... guess I would choose ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C down in OR|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: difficult to figure out @HQ or @CQ now|pg||
nt|henryb: now possibly easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR West made a balancing X when it came round, Hinden rebid her 5-card @H's, and they ended in 3NT which is making on "courteous" defense.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Netherlands/bakkeren-bertens.pdf|pg||
nt|haans: nortway has invented 2@H meaning werak 2 in either M|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ok, then this is settled :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H multii do not think that is allowed here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Sure it is if it shows both majors|pg||
nt|danilo1: Dble on 3@D worked fine in OR :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|afulton: >>|pg||
nt|afulton: ??|pg||
pc|cA|nt|charles_l: still sniffing at 7@s|pg||
nt|panja: I am wondering whether W knows E's stiff @D|pg||
nt|wwalter: but the declar should be like @@ a double dummy to make it :)|pg||
nt|panja: I guess not really|pg||
nt|charles_l: up up and awayyyyyyyyy?|pg||
nt|panja: @S fit, @C cue bid, @H cue bid, 5@D shows 1 key card, 6@D shows @SQ and @D second round check|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thinking a lot :):)|pg||
nt|panja: I should think 6@D showed @DK...but that shouldn't have excited W for a grand|pg||
nt|newmoon: Will exit a @H after next trump|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|henryb: I take that back, but North's plays to tricks one and 2 seem strange|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Many play that|pg||
nt|petere: at the (milk-) bar|pg||
nt|april7: very good lead, it kills the @C suit|pg||
nt|buddyshah: was supposed to be puppeting to 2@C but JM willing to play in 4-3 spades  for a shot at Game|pg||
nt|don paulus: J@c favourable|pg||
nt|april7: but this doesn't help E|pg||
nt|don paulus: not enough - comm probl|pg||
pc|s5|nt|charles_l: maybe 6@h asks for 2nd round @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: or 3rd|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes could be better|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: of course|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: dont think can make now|pg||
nt|haans: killer|pg||
nt|werge: I know another game - one pair at the table can always make 3 NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was an interesting lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: no no double|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: duck |pg||
nt|mariner1: E pitching @H conveys A@C is probably right|pg||
nt|jeanhari: reliefed to see two hearts go|pg||
nt|ahh: play in other room strange if   record is right |pg||
nt|raghavan: there also 10 tricks so may be a push|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panja: 3rd...|pg||
nt|newmoon: partial elimination|pg||
nt|star6ija: guess avoided|pg||
nt|newmoon: well played yes   :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: What a nice throw in|pg||
nt|newmoon: case for apteker to continue with a small @H second time|pg||
nt|newmoon: he could have got in with 3rd @H to punch @D8|pg||
nt|star6ija: Apteker's mistake... had to play @c after 1st ducking in @h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C 2 was a very safe exit |pg||
nt|rnc: Since N and E are on the same side of the screen, it seems odd if he got misinformed about the @S-bid|pg||
nt|fann4: Once again, EW are playing a contract in the other room - 1NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @C to the K@C and Q@D|pg||
nt|buddyshah: really?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought so:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: dummy reversal is an attractive line, ruff 3 @D in Dummy|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes and lose a @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: in hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead on the go, might have done but who would do that?|pg||
nt|henryb: If she ducks, declarer can just ram @d down her throat|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in trumps are too good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now N is caught to play from @sA|pg||
nt|werge: De må have følt sig hjemme, jeg kender personalet|pg||
nt|haans: nothing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|don paulus: that would be 10 for badger|pg||
nt|haans: and next|pg||
nt|haans: not both any|pg||
nt|werge: Which means, that the 150 from OR was not enough|pg||
nt|danilo1: kidding :)|pg||
nt|haans: kidding njet|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: club now ans then 3 rounds of spades to get another trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 5@D here,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club K now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@C dbl -1 in both rooms in Open|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: @DA, @SQA..|pg||
nt|wwalter: the dummy has 1 @h losre, if the @h is not found|pg||
nt|wwalter: now should ruff some @d|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer has to worry about 4-1 trumps too|pg||
nt|werge: Sry, privat...!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb: a heart continuation would create enormous problems|pg||
nt|werge: For me, that was half a joke|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: i have to go now folks bye for now thx all|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lucky the loss is less than it could have been 7 instead of 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: As long as at least one suit is known, it's permitted|pg||
nt|haans: norway have invented many things|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The Multi is an exception to that rule, by the way|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's allowed anywhere in Europe|pg||
nt|sharkey: I haven't seen this one in Norway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: but here's no one known...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Unlike North America|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi = either M not allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Of course there is, it shows spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Isn't it "any" of the M's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: USA no multi except in "big" events|pg||
nt|haans: spade or hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and sometimes not even there|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But this shows spades only|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ok, then it was easy...|pg||
nt|haans: norway has it showing either M|pg||
nt|nubmaster: let's comment the play now :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: @H finesse now?|pg||
nt|haans: do they still play :))|pg||
nt|werge: The safe way to 100|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wwalter: this is the best line to play|pg||
nt|don paulus: ty mike cu|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW won the Under 28 Pairs at Beijing in the Mind Sport Games|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N leads a small @S to K..and W let it hold, S MUST shift to a small @D!..to set it|pg||
nt|buddyshah: this defense is relly thinking good :) |pg||
nt|don paulus: best def @d now ?|pg||
nt|werge: @H is OK also|pg||
pc|h8|nt|werge: No sprint-prize for this board|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: north played for some blocking @c position|pg||
nt|ady: but discarding a heart and a diamond made the contract unmakeable|pg||
nt|ritong: unless @d 10 drops|pg||
nt|ritong: if a defender has a @c less, he has a @d more and then @d 10 can be short|pg||
nt|ritong: he/she, btw|pg||
nt|daman: should be a push then|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in all Open matches|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry, -2 in one  room|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|henryb: at trick 2. declarer plays a club and South wins and plays a third heart|pg||
nt|xenya: would be much better, yes -- still declarer can prevail i think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@D oke to|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: as cards lie cant go of|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the closed room, the defence established their spades but failed to cash them|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No EW silent throughout|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|star6ija: A is correct line of play if N was with 5 clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H shows weak 2@S, FG three suiter or strong NT|pg||
nt|werge: Claim|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb: but declarer did not read the position|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have said this many times on vugraph,  I played in NL at many clubs etc,  everyone (including the grannies) had defense to multi |pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi??????????????????|pg||
nt|don paulus: made 2 @s in OR|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|c7|nt|charles_l: i think the @h count is later known|pg||
nt|fann4: A plus is that the 3@D raise may shut the opponents out, but if pard bids on it may be a disappointing dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: how come|pg||
nt|sharkey: on their CC|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: ok ok open room  :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we have alert kibitzers thanks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ritong: but you were finally right, even with good news this defense beats it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: not taking out trump at all thus far, is certainly a little risky|pg||
nt|raghavan: one more trick WD|pg||
nt|mariner1: Bessis stops the schneid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: so evident! play @c and watch on N|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry misclick|pg||
nt|april7: but 2 down here|pg||
nt|werge: We can never be sure, if they MADE it - often defence gives it away, and VERY GOOD defence here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphztg: the score is 1 down|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: long winded   but still down 1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|charles_l: she is still ok though|pg||
nt|panja: if a @D is played now, decl will be a bit under pressure..|pg||
nt|panja: ruff high or not? where to place @SJ?|pg||
nt|wwalter: only one losing line, high ruff, than finess|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panja: y, but from 13 tricks we have come to a point where a losing line is available|pg||
pc|dT|nt|don paulus: don't like 170 scores in imps count :(|pg||
nt|jcwla: Threading the needle loses again.  They pay 500 extra for vulnerable games.|pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong discard (@S) on @DQ .. otherwise, progressive squezze for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: exiting the club there was 100% for the overtrick, no?|pg||
nt|athene: if you make 11, you persuade your partner to raise you next time it's close :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Neve had prime cards and two @S's for partner.  I love it when opponents try to judge that this will be the hand where they can only take nine tricks.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, for sure, it's much more restful defending 3major or 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: if you mess up and let an overtrick through - big deal :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|woozle: 1S is either something artificial which I can't fathom right now, or the psych of the day|pg||
mb|d|nt|woozle: It might be interesting to see how far North drives this hand|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm told that 1S shows majors or minors...still, I imagine that North thinks he has something in reserve|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H?|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd probably play any bid by North as showing a great hand...creeping up against strong clubs isn't a long-term winning stratagem|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: when the 1@C is based on a 14 count, is not so clear|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think W shd take more blame|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H showed a strong slam try and demanded control-bid then 3@S didn't promise any extras|pg||
nt|brgpro: his 2@h rebid might not have shown 6|pg||
nt|athene: in which case maybe west should do more|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right.  Pressure at all times.|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons to come|pg||
nt|aupillon: nice hands !|pg||
nt|pelu: in Op 1@C - 1@H - 2@D .. here NS has found the @D-suit|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat Anter|pg||
nt|murat: hello all..|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: okay|pg||
nt|raghavan: Massi what is the correct result |pg||
nt|haans: this look more fun|pg||
nt|jeanhari: open room stopped in time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bessis gets 1 IMP |pg||
nt|mariner1: J@D from W would be interesting if S is in 3N|pg||
nt|werge: A very flat 4 §S here|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @s...|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer had 6 tricks and had to come to the two spades sitting over the q??|pg||
nt|werge: Another 6 to Welland|pg||
nt|raghavan: Jim what was played?|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looks playable|pg||
nt|ahh:  given play is unlikely      i think  dec played on @S in other room and @C never played |pg||
nt|ahh: started well wiith 2 rounds of @H |pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Jim|pg||
nt|haans: picked you clean|pg||
nt|petere: mmmh what about @H6 ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|petere: hi Martin :)|pg||
nt|haans: hi Martin|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wwalter: is not so easy @@ the table, this is made by the great masters :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 3), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|jeanhari: saw dutch junior pair double 4NT, hoping for soma bad agreements... could have been costly|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ended in 5@H|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like a @S-lead in OR - @h-lead works better|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely contract was made|pg||
nt|april7: with this hand 1 NT, thats really odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: well, count of not, the only play available is to drop @HJ or Q stiff in 7@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: OR 4@H by SOuth|pg||
nt|milton_se: also 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: wild board|pg||
nt|raghavan: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1down |pg||
nt|mariner1: how to lead that I have no idea though|pg||
nt|haans: 2 @H ruffs|pg||
nt|raghavan: wether to pre empt 4S - N must be thinking |pg||
nt|werge: Has a difficult bid after 1 H - 1 S|pg||
nt|werge: But 2 @C should be ocay|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|brgpro: and 3@s was sort of "on the way" cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: but if 3@H was only a mild slam try, then 3@S was showing west had a decent hand|pg||
nt|haans: 40 minutes late but still many specs|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 5 E made +2 in 3NT so Mc Leish gets 2 IMP |pg||
nt|milton_se: how do you respond to 2C with a solid 6-card major?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bid 3 of the major|pg||
nt|oliverc: expect 1 1@D Opening from North, showing Spades|pg||
nt|murat: E is Civginer actually|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||
nt|murat: was E aware of North's heart ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Looks like Flannery reversed > 4H and 5S |pg||
nt|murat: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: swing board|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4@c|pg||
nt|ahh: 4@S looks normal opener 1st in hand |pg||
nt|haans: 4nt soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i only can when i am commentating, not at table :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: double|pg||
nt|raghavan: ultimately end in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: wellands do well her|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks 3@H would not hve been forcing...?|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score heree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ew open in 3NT..|pg||
nt|mcarroll: An opportunity for gain here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: good bid by W - reach 5D|pg||
nt|haans: both minors or @D+@H|pg||
nt|afulton: this could be semi-painful|pg||
mb|2C|an|  |nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: Massi,   didnt he make that?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no 1 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play for 4@H|pg||
nt|petere: in the OR West miscounted (?) and passed in 2nd seat but EW found 3 SA|pg||
nt|haans: a miracle?|pg||
nt|haans: a he did not pass 2nt sorry|pg||
nt|petere: the good (?) news is, they didn't managed to fullfill|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/lxhfv6  for running scores in the Open. This match is from the women's event although it reads Open Teams on the banner|pg||
nt|werge: To open - as in OR - the East hand after 3 x pass - deserves a doping-control|pg||
nt|haans: lets try Ms for all|pg||
nt|afulton: with @H fit, but suit breaking badly|pg||
nt|sybarra: think they get to same place |pg||
nt|sybarra: however we have seen S pass before |pg||
nt|lesrays: not this time|pg||
nt|afulton: Ron, how is the weather there in Sanremo? |pg||
nt|haans: opps to enter???|pg||
nt|haans: will give them 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director on the table for bord 20 .........problems beetwen the players|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @H would have been discarded .. E should keep 4@S .. than cashing 3 Spades ending in dummy, West would be squezzed @H-@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: oh no|pg||
nt|hedyg: not over 1@d|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showing Diamonds, perhaps? :)|pg||
nt|haans: double to follow|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s = 5+@s and a minor, less than an opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N takes his 2@d tricks and plays a @c there is -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: how?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe a 3@h response to the transfer would work?|pg||
nt|ronpa: today weather is nice, yesterday was raining like hell :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably gorgeous!|pg||
nt|ronpa: but I sure prefer the rain and the israeli teams winning like yesterday!|pg||
nt|afulton: For more information click http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm |pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb: 7@c is a good contract and cold on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt likely to come home here|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play strong @c, thus the 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: now S in 6@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: Dael6 1NT -3 here, 1NT-1 in OR. so 5 IMP|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the open room I mean|pg||
nt|haans: witgh u there|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now!|pg||
nt|pelu: over 5@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: he must X now|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauria 8East) in box - 6@D making on @H-lead|pg||
nt|murat: Sen has enough values to balance the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Zia may come to life|pg||
nt|newmoon: belated x by Zia may lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: action begins|pg||
nt|ahh: will be pleased when p bids @D not @C |pg||
nt|haans: or strong @H+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: most of us :)|pg||
nt|ritong: this will go fast|pg||
nt|oliverc: With a void in Partner's Hearts, though?|pg||
nt|haans: prempt from slam thinking|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wont get to high this way|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may bid 3S |pg||
nt|panja: misfit will lead them overboard here..cards lying badly too|pg||
nt|werge: But 5 @C is a good sacrifica - which often puses N/S higher|pg||
nt|haans: best is @D 3-0 against|pg||
nt|ahh: 6 @D makes on the lie |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: west said 4NT three suites |pg||
nt|ahh: well he has a void so it is accurate |pg||
nt|raghavan: usually 2 suit - still more likely lower 2 unbid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he said 2 sometimes 3 :)|pg||
nt|haans: ok with u|pg||
nt|buddyshah: will JM find a Spade lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  looks the best shot|pg||
nt|raghavan: N will pass I think - May bid D if what charles said is correct - that 1S shows Diamonds by S|pg||
nt|murat: misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead a small @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is new minor I suspect or a forced relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: New leader after this board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: e Passed in Open?|pg||
nt|haans: dutch getting closer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: little by little - a long way to go|pg||
nt|haans: true :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|raghavan: D J is natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: strong nt why 3nt?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks!|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S no make |pg||
nt|werge: No - but the bid it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: East "stole" it in 4@C in Open|pg||
nt|werge: Flat for one down, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: claim declared 1 down |pg||
nt|lestergold: piano hand fo a change 11 tricks next case please|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Multi see http://www.geocities.com/gerben47/bridge/|pg||
nt|lestergold: claimed one off??|pg||
nt|haans: ?|pg||
nt|haans: not fighting|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|raghavan: or a low D|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh sorry N on lead|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wise pas from mr Welland|pg||
nt|werge: In Turkey: 23 HCP = game|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be too high -- or...?|pg||
nt|sommer: MA lead for 6 imps one or the other way|pg||
nt|haans: and rightly so|pg||
nt|petere: find one minor J ... that's the task here|pg||
nt|afulton: WOW! Lengy let them off the hook|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That certainly came out of the blue|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: 3@C super-accept|pg||
nt|panja: the bad break in @H will defeat this|pg||
nt|athene: there won't be much to go on regardigg @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: regarding|pg||
nt|raghavan: If that understanding is not there, he should pass - N has told his story - South must decide|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower did good, else 3@S gets whacked|pg||
nt|werge: Not with this lead...|pg||
nt|xenya: it may not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4th suit also possible|pg||
nt|ronpa: he felt bad after last hand and thought good chance for fit when partner is known for @H shortness|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: they will do well to bid 6 i think|pg||
nt|xenya: ah!|pg||
nt|henryb: a big chance for Hansen|pg||
nt|haans: @C and can go down|pg||
nt|haans: even with spades down possible|pg||
nt|oliverc: It seems to me as if all 4 players are bidding their hands without considering what|pg||
nt|april7: if 1@S shows @D then why didn't N bid @D, but now S did|pg||
nt|oliverc: opps and partner have bid|pg||
nt|henryb: here N-S missed a decent @s slam; an excellent one if played by North|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@c is a little bit agressive (politely said) in the OR|pg||
nt|star6ija: running scores at http://eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=794&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes it needs a superaccept to get S to move again after 1NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible massive fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes several kibitzers tell me that 2NT response would have been even better|pg||
nt|MolvaM: because it seems many people bit 3H even with a minimum opening if they hold 4card support for pd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anyway 2@h seems a bit too conservative|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dcbutler: good idea by south - can she make it?|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   showed I believe showed 5 hearts and 4 spades and forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: mrs hinden has a tough switch to make|pg||
nt|ritong: @d jack could slip |pg||
nt|murat: they are still ok|pg||
nt|april7: S will start a crocss ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @s lead makes the things difficult for declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 10 imp loss for this board must be billed to welland apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does declarer have a problem?|pg||
nt|werge: Dream-position in @D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|star6ija: @h also|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|werge: East stays to his @S-leads|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C better bid than 4th suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: perhaps showing specifically the doubleton club|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in fact, W didnt push at all. of course i dont know their agreements and pdship stle, just speaking in general|pg||
nt|panja: now, by two tricks|pg||
nt|charles_l: only a question of undertricks|pg||
nt|panja: as such !E had insufficient values for game, worse still opposite the stiff @CA, @Ck got wasted|pg||
nt|wwalter: 1@s+2@h+1@dstil to give|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt play as well in 3 nt as in @C's |pg||
nt|athene: declarer may find out that west has 5@D 1@C...but then east has 2@D 4@C so nothing to point out the @HQ|pg||
nt|werge: Easy to play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brgpro: N might lead @s|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to play that 3@H wld show 4 trumps but minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is 4 trumps, max, no small doubleton|pg||
nt|davidstern: This could get ugly|pg||
nt|haans: does east  havbe @HK?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf - we were talking about a better defense by NS In Open room same 1HX -1 Push!!!|pg||
nt|haans: yes he had already overbid a little :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing very important here|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might think S has @D cards on this auction,,,,,, the lead is not easy to find|pg||
nt|xenya: actually you just need to lead any @D here to beat it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but a @D lead is tough is it not?|pg||
nt|xenya: just lead the only unbid suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kurtove: thats a nice turn|pg||
nt|davidstern: Duck and a club ruff and another heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry club ruff and spade for -1|pg||
nt|haans: safer to play @HA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even if he wins this he can play a high spade honour they get a club ruff and then perhaps black suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|kurtove: its a problem to take the ace if east have the rest of the hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: So Heart Ace and seconbd trump then @SK win diamond ruff spade and ruff diamond and trump will nail West|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@D is a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: He can get C ruff|pg||
nt|newmoon: a very strange @HQ, if u count the points...|pg||
nt|haans: i assume 2nt was lebensohl so that was no option|pg||
nt|star6ija: Welland know all the points, but the shape is also unfavourable|pg||
nt|star6ija: Slam reached at the Open Room|pg||
nt|star6ija: distance shortenned|pg||
nt|rnc: He did!|pg||
nt|mariner1: there it is,,,,, well done|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room the lead was a small @S|pg||
nt|panja: 6 tricks might be the limit for EW...but a couple of tricks in suspense|pg||
nt|haans: 1st try|pg||
nt|petere: ... not @D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: suit = small doubleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...does he know the meaning of 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 nt not in jeopardy |pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|mariner1: the defense helps with the @D play|pg||
nt|ronpa: he will not like the K@H in dummy for sure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: the only problem with that scheme is, you don't have room for re-transfer if opener bids 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: E had patterned out her hand and showed some extras -- i don't understand why W was so shy |pg||
nt|davidstern: oops|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb: who need it after suffering a 2-way game swing on the previous board, letting 4@h through in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: soade switch is awkward after cashing clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 13 precious IMPS back|pg||
nt|rnc: If taking care of this good start, it will bring Herbst back in business|pg||
nt|rnc: Other room stopped queitly in 2@S|pg||
nt|rnc: *quietly that is|pg||
nt|haans: may not have been an option for them many play 2@S as forcing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: Obviously South is always accepting this invitation, but what is your philosophy on game invitations?  Do you like to make invitations that partner can only accept with a true ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: maximum, or do you like to make invitations that partner can only reject with a true minimum?|pg||
nt|rnc: I must admit I would have passed 1NT without a thought|pg||
nt|xenya: me too|pg||
nt|sommer: gtg.. tnx and cu|pg||
nt|werge: But I do´nt like the blocking play, declarer has made in the @C-suit|pg||
nt|werge: West must play the @D Queen, when South plays the suit|pg||
nt|don paulus: 9 @s important card|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: so it will be natural to finesse through west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: defense needs to play spades|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|haans: never steel the contract when you  can steel suits|pg||
nt|april7: S has still to guess|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Here N's light @H stole E's bid and there was no real way for them to recover|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: in B19 Sementa-Cuzzi had a strange bidding misunderstanding: playing 4@H on 6-0 with 5-4 in @S|pg||
nt|wwalter: so the 2 down is a popular result|pg||
nt|raghavan: a D to KQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: SAK|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best set of board, in the other BBO-match the score is 7-0 after 8|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club goes on SK|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: did east at some point splinter in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and west think it was natural?|pg||
nt|ritong: well played by east, a @d and it was over, since west would certainly play a @d back|pg||
nt|ritong: now on the surface, west has to duck the @d K|pg||
nt|daman: seems like a normal defense at this level|pg||
nt|dcbutler: that doesn't help, does it?|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that will not help|pg||
nt|ady: should make now   with diamond position favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: she might play a @d from hand right now|pg||
nt|kurtove: he was thinking that east never would have turned hearts without the king|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so much more to see here :)|pg||
nt|haans: :( may get better soon :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3N Open Room here,,, EW like to bid'em up in Open Room|pg||
nt|daman: not always the best sdtrategy but it worls like a charm on occasion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare does not know that @DS are so good and wondering about the @C losers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: should have discarded a club earlier|pg||
nt|april7: dummy is somehow squeezed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: after the 2@D bid, 3@C, if NF is quite ok, isn't it?|pg||
nt|haans: many treat 6-4-hand as GF what you have to pay|pg||
nt|rnc: In OR West elected to bid 2@S (NF in their sys) after 1@S-21C;2@D. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|charles_l: i think most of the field is in 4@h here|pg||
nt|kurtove: And I agree|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will be forced to take 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|werge: That should be 100 + 100 for US = 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|haans: second one easier|pg||
nt|petere: ahh, 'squeeze' it out :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice defence|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|milton_se: +2|pg||
nt|raghavan: H9|pg||
nt|haans: now WH may miss playing @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would not bet on that|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry for NL|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now will be nervous of @sQ getting ruffed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry - looking at entirely different hand|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: they need 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs to Neth White House|pg||
nt|haans: still 10|pg||
nt|star6ija: possibly|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - not even vulnerable, I would try for game|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|rnc: *2@C|pg||
nt|panja: after the 2@D bid..the 4-length @H is not likely to be useful|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed|pg||
nt|afulton: this could have been much worse|pg||
nt|ronpa: its bad enough|pg||
nt|april7: 3 of @S, but faster|pg||
nt|werge: Exactly|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: cash two clubs and then @HK and @H10 - even if you lose to east's @HQx, she may be endplayed anyway with @SA|pg||
nt|raghavan: loser on loser|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 25|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after this round. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: H thrown anyway|pg||
nt|star6ija: and small @h back|pg||

pc|c9|nt|athene: as far as inviting goes - conventional wisdom is that you don't want to play in the invitation very often, so you want partner to accept more often, i think?|pg||
nt|daman: nice|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will a long break before the Swiss begins. Restart at 17.30 Paris, 4:30 pm London, 8:30 am Los Angeles, 11:30 am New York|pg||

nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: excellent board for the french team|pg||
nt|raghavan: first time ruffed with 10, now 6?|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @c 3 is enough to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|werge: Maybe 8½...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good play, make the opps do the waork for you|pg||
nt|mcarroll: work|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|MolvaM: making exactly will mean 9 imps only|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|petere: but now guess right|pg||
nt|haans: good try|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: strong card :)))|pg||

nt|MolvaM: not 10|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: More than 1 imp|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: did he really pitch a @D?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: and a new leader by 1|pg||
nt|afulton: down 3|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think operator lost some of the play but still 12 imps for the indians to take a very hard lead to close|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 down|pg||
pc|cT|nt|murat: i guess it was Ace over Q |pg||
nt|buddyshah: S in on the right path here nicely worked out |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: CLAIM - we are wasting our time because of West|pg||

nt|haans: yes see no problem|pg||
nt|april7: E should have taken Q of @C and @C|pg||
nt|buddyshah:  E could have defeated this by discarding a D earlier & a club later?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: soon|pg||
nt|haans: cards for 2@C always interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: coffee board coming up|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt would need a careful @C play..small to J first time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 6 - here went 2Down in 2S - Open -3D by E made so push|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6H by South making but not by North (D lead)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and what did you find out? -2?|pg||
nt|henryb: not the dummy you want opposite a 2N opener|pg||
nt|rnc: ...and succeded|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 5@C here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: a 3NT hand for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/m67xpu  -  Running Scores|pg||

nt|raghavan: again 3NT by E|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, boring 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D opening, 1@H from sementa, 2@D - 2@H, 3@D - 3@H, 3@S - 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb: some danger of getting too high now, I would think|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes massi VuGr operator - your work is difficult - esp when they claim and close the hands|pg||
nt|henryb: except N got there first!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf there also 1HX -1 = 200|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N = both minors weak|pg||
nt|raghavan: S 10 is a stopper in Spade|pg||
nt|xenya: a srewd observation by a kibitzer -- perhaps NS were trying to match Meckwell's style|pg||
nt|werge: If they continue, they tale 1.430 here...|pg||
nt|werge: take|pg||
nt|xenya: *shrewd|pg||

nt|charles_l: E has some fun|pg||
nt|wwalter: did E open?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting "but not forcing to game" |pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: on Board 16 Versace found the lead of @SA and gave a ruff = 6@D -1 - but 12 IMPs for Salokin-team|pg||
nt|raghavan: May reach slam in H|pg||
nt|panja: 6@H 6@C for NS, but in 6@S...EW might not do badly...3 down for 500 instead of -1430?|pg||
nt|fann4: OR  2@C-2@D; 3@C-3@H; 6@H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3NT here.. can be some trouble making it though|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes claimed 1 off|pg||
nt|haans: yep we all seen that before|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @s anyone ?|pg||
nt|haans: multi any 2 in M|pg||
nt|haans: longer to 4@S|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|hedyg: yes Lauria bid only 1@H, not 3|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good result for EW open room|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScoresOWS.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this match consists of 2 x 14 = 28 boards|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As usual Zia did not hang around in the bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6@D from S best I think, 6@S will be played by N and depends on @HA being right |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: good to try something different|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by NS is best,but hard to reach|pg||
nt|raghavan: In ACBL tourneys, Convention cards are published in advance - Here I tried the website - could not go beyond the names of countries |pg||
nt|raghavan: will S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|murat: or Dbl maybe|pg||
nt|april7: if S bids 2NT then N will give him ofcourse the 3d|pg||
nt|murat: dbl would be no sense actually|pg||
nt|april7: the question also is whether N can have a 4card @S suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They are in 4@H in Open|pg||
nt|werge: Not any longer...|pg||
nt|haans: thay have  5@C  profitable|pg||
nt|werge: How many boards the full distance?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 14 this segment|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 14 later on|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|charles_l: N must XX?|pg||
nt|panja: W is not very tolerant though, he wants to have his say in the matter|pg||
nt|athene: pretty boring 3nt here with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be unlikely to sell out to 2@S sitting East|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D now perhaps all end|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@D looks negative one except you are forced to play the @DA|pg||
nt|haans: singel K again :)|pg||
nt|haans: more likely 4@S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the losers will be eliminated tonight|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the winners move on to the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|petere: North thinking of slam ... or ordering a coffee ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May not get there|pg||
nt|danilo1: I very do not like 2@S (despite as I know Kowalsky-Romansky, they play it constructive) ... had much too good for (especially non-voulnerable) weak-two|pg||
nt|haans: mostly weak 2 do not show 7 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: but will Henner resist the spades?|pg||
nt|april7: now we hav e it|pg||
nt|werge: A BIG 2 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3N makes with @S 4 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may mean @D + 1 more|pg||
nt|mcarroll: He just bid 5@D not redbl|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and flat boards are not what they need|pg||
nt|werge: Prefer coffee|pg||
nt|haans: clubs 3-1 do not like that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: To get 40 imps in 6 boards is a very tough ask|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb: even so, I think two aces is too mich opposite 2@c not to be trying for if not driving to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: again, W's pass looks timid|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence clear the diamonds, declarer won't want to take the spade finesse into the danger hand|pg||
nt|ady: likely tgo end 3NT   or 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT shows 22/23 balanced|pg||
nt|raghavan: I feel VUL overcall of 2C should be good suit go for 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: not a really hilarious match |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@H can be beaten with a spade ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to late to bid @H now|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Welland Welland wont play there|pg||
nt|ahh: nothing much in this 1 for Sweden to cheer |pg||
nt|werge: 3 x @D´s is bad for declarer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: payback time :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: would W passing be considered fielding?|pg||
nt|milton_se: now she should|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 2@d shows some values, they play 2@H as a double negative. Not that anything matters on this hand.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I assume E is thinking, not N|pg||
nt|werge: Match might get closer...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: she will prefer to try to duck a club into east's hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: sorry my eyes did deceive me they were one board ahead of this table|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c is not so easy to defeat|pg||
nt|raghavan: Talf - I agree it should be more down Both rooms defense was noy perfecr|pg||
nt|rnc: It looks like the previous match, where down 3 was more or less an average result :)|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @S is sold for 500|pg||

nt|don paulus: trump promotion :)|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Not a single Flat board so far , however unidirectional , good going herbst :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an interesting misunderstanding then in the other room to reach 4@H rather than 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to bid 6@h to give themselves a chance in the match|pg||
nt|athene: east felt obliged to cue lots to show the good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 61H|pg||
nt|athene: but her spade bid came so late it sounded like a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@S was non-forcing over 1@H, then you cue once and THEN bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: that would be law going too far|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR declarer played a spade towards the queen to create the entry to take the losing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c seems to be a transfer to @d|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h is down a lot, and with partner opening, South may double|pg||
nt|xenya: being pretty certain NS will bid game in OR|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  -  Swiss A Round 6 running scores|pg||
nt|mariner1: Denmark 17  Harangozo 2  3 boards to score in other match|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps some here|pg||
nt|xenya: can't see how it can be made -- but quite a few variations here|pg||
nt|fann4: it seems clear to ask for aces.|pg||
nt|haans: i had expected EW to bid|pg||
nt|panja: South will have to take a shot, too much science might be counterproductive|pg||
nt|werge: So 130 for Nederland|pg||
nt|haans: yes i found a couple of aces |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@C a popular contract this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: will need some ood views and maybe some pressure play for this one to roll in|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 5@C is hardly profitable when it costs 500|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt slaminvite no singel?|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT is the second-last bid, I would make with the North-hand, only pass is worse|pg||
nt|sybarra: may be a slim chance here if n/s do not get to slam |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Opps pushed them there|pg||
nt|haans: 6nt best|pg||
nt|haans: by south|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: most play 1-over-1 forcing after an overcall though|pg||

nt|april7: 10 easy tricks ready for claim|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2NT wont make either...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: therefore trying 3NT :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S + 3@H + 2@D + 3@C = 9|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@D + 3aces = 6|pg||
nt|haans: you may seee it that way 2 :))|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh very favourable lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: E really doesnt have a good lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: J of @H maybe |pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: help from the enemy|pg||
nt|danilo1: West is helping ... maybe he should consider North's probably not very fast pass ... 3@D is for me risky action|pg||
nt|haans: first pass then 3@D many used that as weak 3@D|pg||
nt|danilo1: * very fast 2@H= NEG.|pg||
nt|haans: then nok (i think)|pg||
nt|haans: ring course|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: what's the range of 1 @c opening ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 17+ ?|pg||
nt|athene: so will probably just take nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt NS are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C probably just "natural" 2+|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Hauge now leads the other semifinal 60-50 with (i think) 5 boards to compare|pg||
nt|ritong: 3Nt = i do not like @ss|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|daman: A @C will|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am going to back Michel to make this one|pg||
nt|kurtove: he may try to get entry on qsp, but will go -1 then|pg||
nt|haans: looks natural|pg||
nt|henryb: everything|pg||
nt|star6ija: interesting case of misreading at page 20 of http://eurobridge.org/bulletin/09_1%20Sanremo/pdf/Bul_08.pdf|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so we need 15 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|werge: They WILL not - they allready did it...|pg||
nt|mariner1: transportation and a lack of winners is the issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: duck @c lead @c lead small @D helps, double dummy though it is|pg||
nt|rnc: South must be delighted (and surprised) seeing partner bid @Hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: east had difficult choice of leads but i would have unimaginatively advanced my fourth best spade|pg||
nt|ahh: so this will be a dot board   or 1 imp at most |pg||
nt|raghavan: How did OR manage to make 10 tricks -Martin / Hanns|pg||
nt|haans: go to MOVIE click on Open |pg||
nt|haans: spec ask why not open 1@C by east with you there|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep |pg||
nt|mcarroll: and on a non@H lead makes 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: S opened 1@C on 11 on Board 1 so if it's strong it's variable! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|athene: win third diamond, duck club into east's hand, refuse the spade finesse for 9 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 4 hearts, @SA)|pg||
nt|don paulus: then 1 nt doesn't seem enough with 19hcp|pg||
nt|ady: lay down A@H    and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now no cue bid of Clubs so stopped probably|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a better contract than 4@c|pg||
nt|haans: thats all|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the problem was that she over 2@H bid a cue again in @D - tryed to show both black suit - but that message didn't pass the sreen .)|pg||
nt|charles_l: lots down here|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is cold, but uptricks are heavy at that point  so she considers the best way to gather a max of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: but who would lead that?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Full resault service from the Open Europeian Championship. Bookmark it: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: well its amake|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panja: note that North's @CQ, @DK are useful, but hard to find in bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S should be the "big" bid |pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: of course we can see this hand is boring but Sabine can't see the @HA is onside|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this can be made|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is nice judgement... option for 6 IMPs back|pg||
nt|rnc: The @H-discard and the @H8 is telling bad news|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the 8@H does not warm E's heart much|pg||
nt|rnc: :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: not winning that @c in dummy also cost a trick in tempo|pg||
nt|xenya: it does look like a complex hand?|pg||
nt|fann4: There is talk that in the OR they may be playing control responses to 2@C - hence the leap to 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  off they go |pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: @c lead?|pg||
nt|pelu: they play a lot of tranfers after takeout X - so it looklike trandfer here also|pg||
nt|newmoon: good tenaces in dummy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same in Open|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamond lead looks very dangerous to me|pg||
nt|werge: Even without the promotion only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|buddyshah: @D 2 anyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|april7: everycard except K of @D is ok|pg||
nt|don paulus: if you know for sure your p had 2 @d to start with|pg||
nt|don paulus: signal low - high = 2 ( 4 ?)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: she might try leading @H9|pg||
nt|athene: or leading small to @H10|pg||
nt|athene: that still gives time to lead to @HK later|pg||
nt|wwalter: I hope the chairs will not fly :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment if you play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|milton_se: this needs some help -- doubt that he'll get it|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has nothing to discard on the 9@d when it becomes good|pg||
nt|hedyg: should lose 1@d, 1@c and 2@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how he can avoid it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What does E expect from his partner? the X over 3@c is silly with so bad majors|pg||
nt|henryb: he expects partner to have half the missing points|pg||
nt|werge: I would have "unblocked" the @D K from dummy, can´t hurt|pg||
nt|panja: well. N could have @SKQ |pg||
nt|rnc: There will be a quick claim soon|pg||
nt|sharkey: Behrens didn't fancy leading from @SJ - may players share his view in leading from Jxxx|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@s +1 last board so 6 imps to U'Rourke|pg||
nt|lestergold: leading from an unbid four card major seems normal to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: leading ronm a three card minor to the ace much less attractive to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but the lead is from Jxxx  which most of us hate|pg||
nt|lestergold: usually gives declarer a tempo if not a trick because hes likely to be wanting to srt up tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you know N is prepared for a @S lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: we all hate it shirley but sometimes that is the lead you are dealt|pg||
nt|haans: many of us do not like p to lead from Jxxx (not us) :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Yes me to but I think Bertens listened to Levins 3NT and think he has good @ss|pg||
nt|raghavan: Good AN Shirley and Hans - sorry for late - I was held up in Macau tourney|pg||
nt|haans: did u win?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not being a results merchant but it happens to be the best lead on the hand in pfractice|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rag |pg||
nt|sharkey: Declare has his work cut out here as it appears @D lead actually may set up W's @D8|pg||
nt|haans: bridge has been fun here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I don't like this line at all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Why if they ruff you down in 4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt bid of value if slaminvite|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You have 10 certain tricks if hearts break no worse than 3-1|pg||
nt|werge: Was 3 NT alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|Walddk5: spade ruff, D to the ace, spade ruff|pg||
nt|haans: no alert we heard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Don't you deserve that when you don't draw one round of trumps at IMPs?|pg||
nt|petere: yessssssss but in another board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Arline I just joined the cant count club, lots pointing out to me - correctly - we have 7 boards left not 6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|don paulus: 1 @c strong - then ok|pg||
nt|henryb: which would be about 6 of them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only card from E is now @sQ |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now it´s expensive if N finds the @h shift|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in same spot here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Haans|pg||
nt|ahh: hoping either red suit splits 3 3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: thats ok Martin,  I have been member for sometime |pg||
nt|werge: In OR same contract, but very fast 3 x @D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb: Allix amazingly passive. I wonder what Neve would have done with the @dQ in addition|pg||
nt|athene: they probably play that you complete the transfer with any weak NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I hope they do not play odd even discards|pg||
nt|panja: and less @H's|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: hmm|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not this way but???|pg||
nt|kurtove: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: I win|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N might have made it easier for S by doubling 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: leading the @H9 scores a big goal when east neglects to cover from @HQxx, for example|pg||
nt|athene: it gives up the legitimate play in the suit of @HQx / @HJx with east|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is, she might get it wrong, playing restricted choice|pg||
nt|athene: and lead to the @H10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: this might give west time to get his long spade set up|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence take @CA, @S, three hearts|pg||
nt|haans: u sure do|pg||
nt|milton_se: if 1NT is 12-14, North is certainly worth 4C|pg||
nt|april7: preparing a squeeze which doesn't exist|pg||
nt|newmoon: who said a 10 counts for no points?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but Welland leading a spade|pg||
nt|afulton: >expresso to Martin|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: the defence can actually stop declarer ducking a club into east's hand with certainty|pg||
nt|athene: west goes in with @CJ if declarer leads low from hand and east plays @C10 next time|pg||
nt|athene: but of course everything works for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: she may have a nasty moment but she can't go down :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she's thinking about discard|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauri-Versace bid and maded 5@Cs on board 17 = +6IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: With this lead makes 6|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|jeanhari: oeps|pg||
nt|haans: i am right :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it|pg||
nt|haans: still long way|pg||
nt|haans: boring|pg||
nt|ahh: if they switched to @C  has to depend on @D 3 3 |pg||
nt|afulton: But stop and think... how many imps swap hands in average match? |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|werge: Stiff @C King by North was tried - no lucky decision this time|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you mean wellan gets closer to 50 imps?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: almost all routes go to 500|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that woulod mean 12 to welland|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: im saying its not bad in theory because your long spade figures to be a trick |pg||
nt|sharkey: nice duck!|pg||
nt|raghavan: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sharkey: N actually played @D&??|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: It was obvious that E held the ace so it doesn't cost anything playing the 6... just an extra chance, E doesn't have any entrance anyway|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans why there is no movement in the screen?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they think |pg||
nt|haans: usually claiming time|pg||
nt|sybarra: Levin thinking |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|raghavan: He has not come to claim time - He has to get 3 H tricks, 2S+DK+CA|pg||
nt|haans: hard thinking|pg||
nt|haans: @C10?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course Levin doesn't know @S finesse is working|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|nubmaster: He sees only 8 trick at this moment|pg||
nt|afulton: while the end result may be close, it is often 50-80 or more|pg||
nt|joemanjo: per deal?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jeanhari: south could know there was not much chance for north to have 3 spades, which he needs if switching to a spade|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but easy to see from the sidelines|pg||
nt|haans: south did not know they had 4-4 in hearts|pg||
nt|raghavan: pity why N does not continue - declarer does it now |pg||
pc|d7|nt|star6ija: no difference between 150 and 130|pg||
nt|haans: and double finesse in @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and a 1 imp gain|pg||
pc|c5|nt|davidstern: With a spade through he would again have to cash the @DA|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d to cut the communications|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Claim -1?|pg||
nt|kurtove: y|pg||
nt|haans: yes suprise may be corrected|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so another 2 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can make it now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|xenya: i think "strong but not forcing to game" means something lice Acol 2, Shirley -- in this case |pg||
nt|raghavan: He may A Heart |pg||
nt|xenya: is he about to make it now?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|milton_se: over now -- down|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace was actually on his way to slam but Lauria pulled the emergency brakes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To beat 4@d W has to lead a @d to duck|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @H pitch cost|pg||
nt|xenya: once he got a @D trick?|pg||
nt|afulton: not per deal, per match... we win 12, we lose 12... that =24 imps on table|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|oliverc: not likely to either, given the 1@S bid from West. Even if on slim values, West likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: have either the J or Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: He rectified the count trying for 11 tricks instead of 10|pg||
nt|henryb: cash the @sA and exit the third club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still I think your analysis is correct - South should return a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: note the careful play of @SJ..caters to AT9x with West|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: W might keep the @D Q10|pg||
nt|werge: That might cost 5 IMPs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: and as always better to play AFTER :))|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but west being balanced, not bidding @H (with 2@S/3@H)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: would u X on the Westhand or bid 2@S - D + 2@S gave East hope of game|pg||
nt|hedyg: now can go -2 with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for 2@S bid|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: as predicted|pg||
nt|athene: of course objectively this wasn't best because east "should" cover with @HJxx|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1100 and blood all over the carpet|pg||
nt|wwalter: Massimo pls tell us how is @@ the table now? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: @d now for 'only' 800, ty specs|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: E is like a fish out of water .............O look for a miracle :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ultimately he will|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree that Easts D over 3@d was not so good|pg||
nt|werge: We must admit, that for several minutes, West has been able to take 8 tricks...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb: I think it is very hard to pass that hand over 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: also good|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: pitching @S from hand on the third diamond has committed her|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry no she only needs one spade|pg||
nt|athene: she can still take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if scared that west has the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: @D2 (if honest) would indicate that|pg||
nt|athene: but i am sure west is good enough to falsecard there with @SK and NOT @CQJx|pg||
nt|haans: jean was correct yes was|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|ahh: his last shot comes home |pg||
nt|haans: yes lets not forget that|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: but his partner will take that for majors - or?|pg||
nt|haans: RIGHT U R|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh oh|pg||
nt|sybarra: not 8 of hts?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: is this for real??? kinda lots of errors here...|pg||
nt|danilo1: no need double finesse, 100% (end play)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: lot of errors in this match|pg||
nt|nubmaster: what?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Probably tired|pg||
pc|c4|nt|newmoon: Gower claiming last 2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: she will be very annoyed with herself to go down in this|pg||
nt|charles_l: 800 a bargain - could be 1400|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: she mentioned in her book how she woke at 3am one night realising she misplayed a hand even though she made it!|pg||
nt|athene: so this one will cause even more torment :(|pg||
nt|athene: it would be so nice to have that machine from the movie "Men in Black" to wipe one's memory after a misplayed bridge hand|pg||
nt|haans: what?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c8|nt|raghavan: ok curtains|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that immediate overcalls of 3@c and 3@d should be for the majors and double shows a strong balanced hand, the second double a stronger balanced hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Score now showing 4@H in OR??|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnc: Two boards and Herbst is a 'big' lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
mc|13|nt|mariner1: so a big swing for Herbst|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|woozle: How many diamonds is South up for?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends, i think only 2, unless they play jump overcalls intermediate|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|woozle: provided that someone remembers to double|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D looks like it has chances, but the unlucky-looking CQ lead would mean that declarer gets locked in his hand|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|raghavan: well gary Is there 6c? |pg||
mb|2H|an|.|nt|kiwibridge: not quite :)|pg||

nt|woozle: did North think that his pass was forcing?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: that was the problem with 5@D, it sounds defensively weak|pg||

nt|werge: The US-team opens 1 @D at both tables!!!|pg||

nt|mcarroll: As I said - little by little, only 18 boards to go for a draw|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: B22: lead @HQ = 9 toptricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: *them|pg||
nt|xenya: they got to 5N there though|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.2 sekund faster :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are fast!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Murat|pg||
nt|murat: i wish i knew.. :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: wonderful hand - Grand slam in H with 1 finesse . So atleast 6 H must be bid let us see|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will bid 4 now|pg||
nt|aupillon: French open doesn't|pg||
nt|haans: they have slam but no trumps|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... but here possible too .. depens on North .. 2 or 3@S over 1S|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|danilo1: for me only 2@S (missing 1 point for 3) :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: good news for allix|pg||
nt|ritong: he sweated just two seconds|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|milton_se: will probably make after some battle|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is nice to have a known person by our side|pg||
nt|oliverc: It's like watching Klingons bidding :)|pg||
nt|murat: i got an answer from the audince "diams. +4 +11 hcp"|pg||
nt|april7: if 2@C is not forcing, why doesn't S pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm -  Results|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|haans: diamond???|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like only red aces for E/W|pg||
nt|MolvaM: slam would have been good if @cQ would be inside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score may be another flat board|pg||
nt|haans: i bid 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u win 9 out of 10 .)|pg||
nt|april7: very odd bidding|pg||
nt|murat: i guess NS is a Polish pair which i know nothing about them|pg||
nt|henryb: it is a 5 or 7 hand on a club lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if not vulnerable, I had bid 1@d as W, but now - no|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H still a make|pg||
nt|star6ija: no, correct defense will defeat it|pg||
nt|raghavan: well that settles - S may pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C being Puppet for 5 card Major I assume|pg||
nt|haans: double relays are not proper|pg||
nt|buddyshah: other table 3N -1 |pg||
nt|don paulus: pass ?|pg||
nt|werge: Luck for E/W, that they can play in @D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: would you raise?|pg||
nt|ritong: or try no trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets guess ( nothing in CC) that 2NT asks for force|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Hedy / when 2@H ) GF / then 2NT forcing >(>(|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tobias - is this team in a chance for reaching SF > If u feel so, send me the file  Editor@@BridgeIndia.com  |pg||
nt|april7: a nice @C contract going down the drain|pg||
nt|jeanhari: and miss vuln game|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@C keeps them low but not in best spot|pg||
nt|fann4: Anyone know what 5@D means.|pg||
nt|fann4: Shows you what know:)|pg||
nt|haans: if 4nt quant 5@D natural|pg||
nt|panja: 4-card suit..|pg||
nt|panja: the pause suggests there is some gap in understanding|pg||
nt|haans: i have suggestions 4NT = nat or minor|pg||
nt|haans: did 3@C show 4@H only?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and by north|pg||
nt|haans: yes some play puppet |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 11 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but not today|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3NT by N beauty other 3 suits J and 10 are there to support|pg||
nt|haans: i was one double in 4@H relay play 4@H xx +2|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: strong club and negative - now is 1@H any 20+?|pg||
nt|panja: S made it very easy, ok if 1@S is limited|pg||
nt|charles_l: S shows she can psyche 1@d too|pg||
nt|panja: if 1@S could be stronger, NS could easily lose a 6@C slam|pg||
nt|athene: now Allerton gets a chance to make his second rebid :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Three bids on the 11 count?  No.|pg||
nt|athene: but he declines it|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't think 2@D shows extras in that position|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt sort of limited your hand?|pg||
nt|kurtove: looks like a flat board|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d relay again|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play low|pg||
nt|milton_se: AD and D -- let them play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Develop a D trick may play A and small D|pg||
nt|haans: slam here is desperado bridge|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 27 - 4C down here OR 3S-2  gain of 5 IMP to Apteker|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5 or 7! with a @c lead  there is no slam|pg||
nt|aupillon: oui|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead agin helps declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andrei Varlan|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead = expensive|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: or perhaps 4+ hearts, forcing, á la Meckwell|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10 fast, but could be 11 :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 11 on this lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't like N's sequence here. |pg||
nt|ady: thats the winning bid by west|pg||
nt|dcbutler: 3NT is possible, don't think you have a raise|pg||
nt|ritong: well it is a matter of @d length with east, i think|pg||
nt|ritong: suppose east has two @ds, it probably will be better in @s|pg||
nt|ady: needs an accurate defence to beat 4 spades if leading clubs   msut not play 3rd club   or will later be end played  after trumps drawn and a diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming south does not hold six|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT is the logical contract|pg||
nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|haans: And I would also like to thank Dr. Raghavan, Momchil Aleksandrov and Sid Ismail my  co-commentator |pg||
nt|haans: And of course all you KIBITZERS  for watching We trust you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @d finess fails|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The failure to bid 4@H (on the same auction) at the other table is very surprising|pg||
nt|jeanhari: stronge comeback from Welland|pg||
nt|haans: looks well for game|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, the layout is friendly, but the bidding tells you that - the spade finesse will work, as will the clubs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding and lead in Open|pg||
nt|haans: this is a boring board|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello all |pg||
nt|MolvaM: safe stop by garner-henner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi andrei|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S is in 4@H in Open|pg||
nt|haans: no slam now|pg||
nt|sybarra: same lead as in the OR|pg||
nt|afulton: couple of ways to make 10 tricks... after you find that @s are friendly (J is marked finesse), duck @c and that breaks nicely|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lots of tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S showed Diamonds|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C? - who knows|pg||
nt|star6ija: no... this @h 8 with e is an obstacle|pg||
nt|daman: the pain of missing a vul game will not go away too quickly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Andreai|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|haans: @S @H squeeze?|pg||
nt|danilo1: I came to 16 Distributional .. and need 17 for 3>@S :)|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but A & K|pg||
nt|danilo1: probable Dble by South|pg||
nt|haans: gave it an extra p|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and into the soup we go  |pg||
nt|henryb: Only one of the four pairs on vg managed to reach even 6@c|pg||
nt|dcbutler: but doesn't E rate to be short in diamonds?|pg||
nt|raghavan: we both thought the same|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 7 with the @d finesse working, 5 otherwise unless the clubs are 6-1|pg||
nt|raghavan: They  are heading for slam|pg||
nt|daman: N was almost worth a xx|pg||
nt|rnc: I think North is halfway to a heart attack now|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C puppet is Bergen style|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello Murat :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qshowflag=1&qtournid=757&qroundno=1&qphase=QF  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|wwalter: a fast claim now :)|pg||
nt|ady: good result for Badger|pg||
nt|haans: board 10 will decide :)))|pg||
nt|Walddk5: First three from each group of six will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks  possible, but normally 11 |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans one more deal is there apart from this |pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx all, and hope the kibs enjoyed this session.   Motto: "Capitalize on opps' mistakes"|pg||
nt|star6ija: with S*|pg||
nt|haans: yes good trumps :)|pg||
nt|haans: youi never never know what relayer have|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans can u tell me why S should not bid 2S (showing 6cds and minimum opening instead 2H)|pg||
nt|ahh: this contract ok  |pg||
nt|petere: 4@H against 6-0 ... what a nice story ;-)|pg||
nt|werge: Too hot in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S was no make|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: ok 1@H natural F1 by the look of it|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light opener, ok.  1NT rebid, the misdescription starts.  Passing 2@C carries the connotation you're fine defending that, again, not my cup of tea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: another 4 imps for Neve|pg||
nt|athene: should make this even if he tries to drop @CKx with north|pg||
nt|star6ija: let us see anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: yes indeed passing 3@H deserves a loss|pg||
nt|jeanhari: play still interesting...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: north think a lot on this turn of 10|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H 1 suiter of hearts as second suit|pg||
nt|raghavan: There is no 2nd suit|pg||
nt|haans: not this time|pg||
nt|haans: 21D may have a minor|pg||
nt|haans: what an error|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Quite an achievement|pg||
nt|petere: @Hs wrong sided opened|pg||
nt|haans: i assunme 3@D mean = have u support here go for it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|murat: i'm having some informations.. Polish pair was a part of Polish Bermuda Bowl team last year..|pg||
nt|raghavan: which finess to take|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, South leapt straight to 6@S, but that was after his pard bid 3@S over 1@C, not a strong NT.|pg||
nt|haans: do u think all do u know?|pg||
nt|sharkey: showing?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you agree with 3@s?|pg||
nt|buddyshah: this will make or 1 OT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: then everything else natural|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brgpro: sorry, was away|pg||
nt|raghavan: same by declarer too!!!|pg||
nt|milton_se: As did South|pg||
nt|raghavan: W has to play Spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is so 6-1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: what finesse to take after being in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: well another swing to Herbst, they are on a roll|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - such boards schould be cancelled|pg||
nt|haans: talk about that very long ago|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They certainly played it fast in Open|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, looks like 14|pg||
nt|afulton: boards, that is|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Both tables stretching a bit, I am not sure S should go on if N does not superaccept the transfer, but maybe, having missed a slam it is natural to overcompensate|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: true|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: they have all cards / but missing 2 Aces / so they will stop|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s was Blackwood, 5@d is two key cards without the @hQ|pg||
nt|daman: unless 3@C shows this hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brgpro: she went down...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spades I would think|pg||
nt|rnc: The only good thing for NS is that 4@C is making while 3NT wasn't. |pg||
nt|sybarra: asking 5 card major |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dcbutler: fortunate the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|milton_se: y and E has to play 10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Going good till now for S - should start on trumps now|pg||
nt|daman: if so, I would have ventured 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: has been easy to have interesting this to say|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: game force |pg||
nt|haans: things|pg||
pc|c4|nt|milton_se: hasn't this relay sequence made clear that 2 aces are missing??|pg||
nt|raghavan: Knowing their system will help in good commenting by us|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now N can see 5 or 7|pg||
nt|jeanhari: to much soft valuas, like redbl more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: north said 4@c is forcing and south ........pass :)|pg||
nt|haans: asking for 5 card or strong four carder|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - I wud have bid Stayman I guess...|pg||
nt|sybarra: on N?? |pg||
pc|c2|nt|brgpro: well, She ran @h9...that needs @h8 on side and one of the @hQJ, less chance than playing @h to the K i think|pg||
nt|athene: well, given time declarer can come to three hearts, three clubs, @SK, @DAK|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they know, they play turbo and Fantoni has shown 1 keycard|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that most of the relays are distribution and HCP / not Aces|pg||
nt|haans: you really know a lot hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT over 4@s would have shown an even nr of keycards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would have gone 4@s myself at these colors|pg||
nt|haans: happy soon|pg||
nt|april7: I think that E is too weak for this bid, beca,use it asks for @H lead and should have a better suit and more points,its a penalty X|pg||
nt|werge: YES!|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|milton_se: better use for controls than hcp, I'd say|pg||
nt|star6ija: all was gone|pg||
nt|haans: once i did open 2@D 3rd with 4 carder only way for them to go down |pg||
nt|petere: @Ds will squeeze dummy first|pg||
nt|haans: @C to A |pg||
nt|haans: endplaying W|pg||
nt|petere: 11 tricks, 1 IMP|pg||
nt|werge: Match even closer then|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: defence should make at least 6 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: looks like it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If that finesse loses, you should hopefully be able to ruff a spade to try the heart finesse next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West will be very unhappy about that trick|pg||
nt|daman: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @S holding brings this one home with the up trick |pg||
nt|afulton: yes, the showout by East makes it a marked finesse|pg||
nt|afulton: as long as south doesnt pitch incorrectly! |pg||
nt|afulton: (from dummy)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: going for the immediate spade pitch|pg||
nt|hedyg: any 5 level bid shows an odd number|pg||
nt|haans: knowlege at this ttable|pg||
nt|sybarra: you only have xxx, aqx, in majors |pg||
nt|aupillon: Sorry , only arriving, i'll tell you|pg||
nt|haans: trying endplay is wrong|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: perfect shift by Bocchi|pg||
nt|athene: now|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna can t give an entry to a declarer with singleton @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes count me in too|pg||
nt|xenya: i like the auction in the other room (3@S instead of DBL) much better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Why put up @HQ? |pg||
nt|haans: and then won a full 9 imp|pg||
nt|danilo1: good decision by Apec to pass .. if Dble penalty (guess so), he has not enough values .. if opt (invit to 4@S) - may cause difficulties to pd|pg||
nt|haans: sry dont follow who is apec?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am a Fantunes fan :)|pg||
nt|lesrays: it's hard to imagine a guy who is 40 up going wrong.....|pg||
nt|afulton: I really don't understand this line...|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why he ducked |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it is real ......|pg||
nt|lesrays: he's going to take the rest|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oliverc: Well I have their CC up on screen now, but I suspect we'll not be hugely wiser|pg||
nt|oliverc: except where opening bids are concerned|pg||
nt|newmoon: well played  :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|afulton: why weren't @s tested before cashing @cK|pg||
nt|danilo1: Kowalsky (Apolinary)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: now the defence are poised to take three spades and two clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: even with the @S switch (looks odd), this is down 1|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't put diamonds 6-2 on this auction!|pg||
nt|ritong: so my guess is a @h comes|pg||
nt|haans: i have their full system Will read it some day :))|pg||
nt|hedyg: by then they will have changed it|pg||
nt|milton_se: so not even bad bidding makes you doubt? :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubt in Fantunes???? never!|pg||
nt|haans: give me you mail adress|pg||
nt|hedyg: having already shown a @c control earlier Fantoni with the 5@d bid showed an odd nr of keycards and @d control|pg||
nt|haans: have it now|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5 rounds and not knowing that before...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if no @d ruff now he can claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: you know nr of keycards before Bertil?|pg||
nt|milton_se: with a relay system, certainly|pg||
nt|hedyg: a different relay system|pg||
nt|hedyg: their system seems to work fine for them|pg||
nt|haans: but few have decided to play it|pg||
nt|milton_se: I wouldn't like to be in 5 on that...|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West will be very happy about THAT trick|pg||
nt|haans: and then 3@C further asking 3nt show 4333 then|pg||
nt|haans: sober?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: next match in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|haans: by p overruff 4 @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am with Vlad|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps this is not available in NS's system here?|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12|pg||
nt|henryb: showing off|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: now the trump promo on the spade|pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|haans: right :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: @D ruff|pg||
nt|petere: a lot of bets in the audience ...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: could declarer have squeezed Bocchi in hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: exit with a spade at that poit|pg||
nt|athene: point|pg||
nt|athene: now if Sabine cashes, she kills her partner|pg||
nt|raghavan: All EW trumps can win tricks now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|milton_se: or S|pg||
nt|haans: we agree with u|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so last board coming up|pg||
nt|mcarroll: so an imp saved|pg||
nt|werge: No change - still close|pg||
nt|petere: I lost ... as did all the other :)|pg||
nt|haans: cry for u :)|pg||
nt|haans: break?|pg||
nt|petere: another coffee|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good idea|pg||
nt|haans: not me sorry :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|raghavan: OR - they bid and made 6D +1|pg||
nt|sybarra: this way you find your 5/3 fit if you have one |pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: also in 5@h in Open room|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - I'm getting this mixed up|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|murat: so some new imps of No Name|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: well, no chance now for sure|pg||
pc|sA|nt|danilo1: Apek (not Apec) - corrected by Polisc specs :) (thanks)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sharkey: thought N had 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C stayman + 3@C next asking rebid you M if 5 carder|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hans, that is not standard |pg||
nt|werge: Now a show-up @C-finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|xenya: if the card in trick 1 were shown correctly, W should now E had a singleton @H|pg||
nt|xenya: *cards|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: still +0 imps|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|don paulus: it all looked so promising :(|pg||
nt|milton_se: costly mistake|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: from kibs: Why didn't Sabine take the @CQ and play @SQ??? - help partner!|pg||
nt|raghavan: In other room 3C bid and made|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats one way to play it |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|afulton: yes, he will take the rest but not the easy way|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes the lead gave away the overtrick, double-dummy|pg||
nt|werge: But no use|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||

nt|woozle: or they can make 5C on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: good defense|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: turned in to 800 in the end|pg||
nt|raghavan: 6C is 40% chance - this is good|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile Thailand steadily pick up imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ??|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4S contract by S making probably 5|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|woozle: doubtless a typo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did we miss a pass or is this a new convention|pg||
nt|woozle: or maybe not...is 2D an old-fashioned precision-style thing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe|pg||
nt|woozle: I thought that opening was extinct|pg||

nt|woozle: 4S at least two down...if West is going to bid 5C here he should have bid it at his previous turn|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Half way thru after 8 Bds 21 vs 7|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: actually west bid this well, giving partner options|pg||
nt|woozle: North is trapped into bidding 4S by his own decision not to bid 3S earlier...West does well to double for about 500 (maybe 800)|pg||
nt|woozle: A direct 5C (if he knew about clubs from the opening bid) might have caught a 300-point bigger fish|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D was a Bergen raise artificial|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|woozle: I won't go as far as to suggest that West bid this hand well, but he at least bid it consistently...he'll pick up a needed swing with the other EW pair down one in 6C|pg||

pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: well he knows partner has 4 spades (probably) so defense can prevail in many ways|pg||
pc|dK|nt|woozle: The defense need to lead a red card at some point, or they won't get any diamond tricks at all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|pc|h8|nt|woozle: East must lead a heart when he wins the SK|pg||

nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||

nt|bjacobs: Final board of the set|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ugly result|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Many thanks to our excellent operator Massimiliano|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last board of this session|pg||
nt|daman: could be 13 away with that one|pg||
nt|mariner1: last board this session now.............|pg||
nt|panja: sometimes the pause is also to reconfirm what one thought the meaning was the first time...a good idea in high level matches..|pg||
nt|fann4: I can't believe that E meant 4NT as quant there. Whatever is was, it was something else.|pg||
nt|fann4: So 6imps heading to ZIMM, |pg||
nt|haans: as you have no gerber i say B|pg||
nt|fann4: Sorry, I mean 8|pg||
nt|haans: and now the final board for one of them :)))|pg||
nt|werge: Not so sure - they play 14, is some player ill?|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: S opened 1 NT - N didnt Stayman with 4 card @H suit...|pg||
nt|haans: NO NOWAY STAYMAN|pg||
nt|aupillon: Il fante di fiori is a non expected team at this level. But they get now on a big fish :(|pg||
nt|haans: relays come in many different forms|pg||
nt|april7: E didn't even make a single @H trick|pg||
nt|haans: taking a lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And yet another imp gain|pg||
nt|haans: your coming ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kurtove: possible to gain some imps here for Benassi|pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 15-8, both balanced, no Ten's|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :) always on your service |pg||
nt|haans: its a good idea i like it|pg||
nt|haans: they both bid and made 4@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: kibs: u dont need that - playing with Bocchi :):)|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H a make|pg||
nt|raghavan: Dear friends - This is the last board in this session. We thank Rafl my co commentator, all of you sweet kibitz, VuGr operator Mallis, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|haans: And I would also like to thank Ralf Willquist, Momchil Aleksandrov and Peter Konings my  co-commentator |pg||
nt|haans: i have to learn |pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 10, some don't, ...|pg||
nt|charles_l: Open one browser window per table.|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt is a great spot for NS here|pg||
nt|haans: 5@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: can they avoid 3NT?|pg||
nt|milton_se: no game here w best def|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S by N will go down on a @H ruff by W|pg||
nt|raghavan: NS may normally reach 4S  |pg||
nt|haans: And of course all you KIBITZERS  for watching We trust you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx so much :)|pg||
nt|haans: and a kib have also  said "THANK  Roland Wald 2"  so I do (rightly so)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And well done to Hans and Jean for the perceptive comments|pg||
nt|haans: And our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|mariner1: seems best defense can beat 4@H here, so 5@C was a phantom..... though it could|pg||
nt|mariner1: have made too|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, operator can check if there is an opportunity...|pg||
nt|aupillon: Yes. 4 spades were my option on the last one. But cruelling missing a needed singleton, tough|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @s NS ?|pg||
nt|werge: Look´s like a NO-SWING BOARD|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kurtove: 5 sp is 3 down with best def|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|raghavan: This  of NS has not helped them now - they lost 5IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Massimiliano (Italy), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Jean Harings|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Netherlands), P.S. Raghavan (India), George Holland (Canada) and Roland Wald|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank the lovable kibits, co commentators George, Jean and Rob, VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO. |pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Massimiliano (Italy), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|haans: we are 14 is right|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 carder and 14 hcp is a good excuse to open 1nt always|pg||
nt|ahh: other room doubled 1nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, that might have been a good play, but Bocchi didn't need it|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S  - an unklikely contract|pg||
nt|haans: but does 4@H mean single spade|pg||
nt|haans: changed times |pg||
nt|pelu: so last board 5 IMP for Angelini = 16-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed, 30 minutes earlier than i announced, sry|pg||
nt|haans: first time 10 then 11:40 13:20 17:30 19:10|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 8  here 4H made 5 Open 6H -1 so MC Leish picks up 11 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: this board can be bloddy|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C = both majors?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no possibilities to go wrong in @c|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably north will have some instrument to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5+ mi, 4ma?|pg||
nt|werge: Here a very UNlucky 4 @S E/W|pg||
nt|ahh: safe 1 off |pg||
nt|haans: EW will not stop here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope N does not bid 2H?|pg||
nt|afulton: this one should be an easy 4@s hand... tho they may try 6 |pg||
nt|afulton: when south shows 5+ spades, north with all primes should make some aggressive move|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: note that 3N is cold for NS on the last board|pg||
nt|pelu: do u like the X from S? - 2@H or 2@S (Michael) in my book|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 5@C - strong @C-suit and no @Hs ?????|pg||
nt|milton_se: that opening bid might help NS to stay low|pg||
nt|jeanhari: doesnt look like that...|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the European Bridge League (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Massimo Ortensi), and all the generous sponsors and organizers for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs!|pg||

nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@s without @h lead|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that @D8 in trick 1 ask for @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: but will have to guess the position of @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: CC says it's a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thank you all. see you on next session|pg||
nt|raghavan: I thank Henry - sorry i missed him|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all for being with us... unfortunately there is some problem with the server for running scores, but I hope iy will be fixed as soon as possible|pg||
nt|jeanhari: south bidding 2@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The next match will start in around 15 minutes|pg||
nt|daman: Bravo Massimiliano|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||

nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
nt|daman: clap clap|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: THX all a lot |pg||
nt|raghavan: Rob, George and Jean It is my pleasure to be with you in this ,Spl tx to u all|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good typing Rob, tx to you too|pg||
nt|daman: N shd double|pg||
nt|fann4: A tough re-opening decision for South. He wants to act, but the @h suit is so bad.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no no was that|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C|pg||
nt|werge: - with 5 @H N/S...|pg||
nt|haans: corrected to 5@H|pg||
nt|raghavan: May be in 2D |pg||
nt|raghavan: Pass by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: xx?|pg||
nt|ahh: south will know this is weak |pg||
nt|haans: depends on what X mean|pg||
nt|haans: x as pen not common today|pg||
nt|petere: break for the operator it seems :)|pg||
nt|haans: learned nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: elu said|pg||
nt|haans: 30 min pelu siad|pg||
nt|jeanhari: best not to pas here|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
nt|haans: and spade to short :))|pg||
nt|fann4: Trouble is, without a 3rd @S he has to plunge in with @H or stay out.|pg||
nt|haans: little action here|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW may be in trouble here|pg||
nt|raghavan: this lets w out|pg||
nt|april7: its a simple 4@S contract,where 2 @D have to be ruffed in  the N hand, so best lead is @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: corrected on our website|pg||
nt|raghavan: George N heard you|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/RunningScoresOWS.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores ALL matches Open, Women's, Seniors|pg||
nt|jeanhari: welland indeed gaining 13 on 9|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|daman: can this be t/o?  no way|pg||
nt|mariner1: I pass it anyway|pg||
nt|daman: Garner got caught speeding|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I would play it as to|pg||
nt|raghavan: W may pull to 3C? of course not sure of number of clubs with E|pg||
nt|sharkey: what's E to do?|pg||
nt|haans: well done sweden|pg||
nt|ahh: looks like penalty double to me :)|pg||
nt|haans: if CBC Milano win they do really well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: 2@C not alerted so presumably improvisation|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@C natural or...?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D an underbid and 3nt not really very good|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but not alerted|pg||
nt|athene: actually i think a simple 3@D wld have been OK|pg||
nt|star6ija: and take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: s'alright. I am easily missed|pg||
nt|haans: you and we will be kick out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I am going to rule that 30 minutes = "around 15 minutes"|pg||
nt|werge: This board is against the rule: The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
nt|MolvaM: garner lying in the bushes with a good suit and a side ace|pg||
nt|aupillon: and the impossibility to show picture pattern. I agree with 1NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe hoping opps would reach 3nt|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1D loser and 2H losers|pg||
nt|werge: Right hand is playing now|pg||
nt|april7: it doesn'tmake really any difference|pg||
nt|haans: spek tells me|pg||
nt|haans: spec|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes, nice Morton's Fork possibility here|pg||
nt|brgpro: seems there was an misunderstanding of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: by playing @c4 he set up "mortons fork" - if West take @CA the 2 discards - if not: the @C-trick go away|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather unfortunate...W has sort of "Nat" @hK lead...|pg||
nt|charles_l: S might suggest it over 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: but N bids 4@h|pg||
nt|wwalter: a manly bid :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: real men bid game :) (and try to make it)|pg||
nt|panja: not an easy lead, but @C is safe|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 22 the other room reached to high in 6 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *too |pg||
nt|jcwla: Should work like a charm here if natural.|pg||
nt|athene: but west perhaps just wants to stop the club lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: it didn't|pg||
nt|henryb: N is relaying again|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Gomerov still not satisfied|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|rnc: It has been an interesting match|pg||
nt|rnc: Herbst making a huge rally from 7-21 to 40-21 in five consecutive boards - never give up!|pg||
nt|fann4: Same seq in the OR, but S gave up over 3@C|pg||
nt|petere: with @D lead one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: better from the N side |pg||
nt|werge: OR: No game bid... - 6 @S|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Did i hear no swing board?  Open room is in 6@S :)  so wait till this auction is over.|pg||
nt|werge: @C-lead from West gives 6 @S away|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@H is rite contract ... lucky @C and @H (even @SK) position making it made by force .. but not so clear way to 4@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wwalter: he made LOL|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is it difficult to bid game in S and make it - 2 Club losers Da - will D  belead |pg||
nt|jeanhari: for sure Dubinin has a fast pas if this was not t/o|pg||
nt|daman: I think maybe Weinstein held up the auction|pg||
nt|panja: risky 3@H bid..isn't this one?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: nooo|pg||
nt|petere: with @C lead some ruffs though|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: has there been a misunderstanding here? Sabine knows that 3NT isn't solid diamonds...|pg||
nt|haans: only brits play 5@C as slam invite|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that the X = @h + minor - so S has shown his hand!|pg||
nt|kurtove: diamond lead, ruff and small heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=0-11, 4@hs|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes will have to drop QC, since he can't afford E having the trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@d acts as 4sf here?|pg||
nt|april7: @D lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South is not thrilled - although he does have a good lead|pg||
nt|haans: in IMP as rare pen double|pg||
nt|haans: or is it not?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could be yes|pg||
nt|haans: he is worth a well done|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why not S X 2H? Hans|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not x, better action |pg||
nt|sharkey: S decided on modesty....|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens and Bakkeren may have wished they are not in this bidding,  but South saved them |pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes S will be happy gets atleast 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: :) :) @C better :)|pg||
nt|haans: i must be a star|pg||
pc|s5|nt|charles_l: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|henryb: "The Fat Lady is Singing"|pg||
nt|ritong: north went for the practical bid|pg||
nt|ritong: a second cue wouldn t have scandalized me|pg||
nt|ady: north right gave up once south shows some heart values|pg||
nt|daman: has to duck 1 @H and maybe more|pg||
nt|daman: pitching @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding has maded it easy'er for N to play @Cj|pg||
nt|haans: and this was board 10 welcome back in 40 minutes! |pg||
nt|raghavan: Will E signal his D Ace now?|pg||
nt|milton_se: Welland can't expect more than one ace w East, so D is mandatory|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a tricky 3nt! 5 and 6@c is easier, but not longer|pg||
nt|haans: :) they did right :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: next round (3rd from Swiss Open Teams) starts tomorrow 10:3- CET|pg||
nt|mariner1: well right defense just not in game|pg||
nt|werge: 750|pg||
nt|haans: they are the opps :)))|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open playing in 5@C Dbl also, so @H fit never found|pg||
nt|MolvaM: actually if he had passed again opps would probably land in 2nt|pg||
nt|petere: no that are smileys, not stars :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Needs 2 ruffs to profit as natural trump trick disappears|pg||
nt|petere: why not?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @C switch now?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I don't need any coffe :) the play really very slowly |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they*|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W opened 2@D, E 4@H, pass or correct|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wwalter: 4 wich pair? :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: maybe will fines the @h :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: he has not made it yet......|pg||
nt|wwalter: it sould be simple now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a grand with 2-2 in @s|pg||
nt|raghavan: another 7 in Hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: or spades or NT|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably :)|pg||
nt|daman: draw trumo|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
nt|april7: why should he lead @C, he will lead @S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: And he might have just turned a huge plus into a small minus|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS do better not drawing here I think|pg||
nt|panja: and now, there is a promotion possibility|pg||
nt|werge: - if not playing for another stiff @C K|pg||
nt|werge: Same play - @H / @C|pg||
nt|haans: @H has been found but longer clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: I thought xx was a wish to "get them"|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think Levin wonder why Hampson bid 3@d with that @hs and points...|pg||
nt|haans: i think he is thinking about how to play|pg||
nt|ahh: will play @S to  throw @C then play on @D |pg||
nt|haans: yeah|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brgpro: Bocchi thought pd denied @d control|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can finesse in @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: but now it's over|pg||
nt|milton_se: 11 tricks probably|pg||
nt|haans: trust we will see team salokin again|pg||
nt|raghavan: In OR 4S down  so ew making 4 will get them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx to all Kibitz, co commentators Hans, Malik,sid,Momchil, Vu GR operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks to all kibitzers, we are waiting all of you here for the next round|pg||
nt|haans:  and thats was board 10 welcome back 17:30 (italian time) |pg||
nt|henryb: S has now presumably shown 5-5-1-2, minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: and plopped into 4 |pg||
nt|lesrays: stopped in time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have overstretched to 5NT in Open|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1 off standard|pg||
nt|haans: yupp|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|star6ija: thanks to all commentators, to EBL and to Roland Wald|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can call it an action double.: partner, I'm still not satisfied until now...|pg||
nt|haans: but still +|pg||
nt|haans: wrong - score|pg||
nt|haans: understand 4-1|pg||
nt|aupillon: not too many points|pg||
nt|aupillon: he'll maybe try to create an upercutt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and 2nt might have failed|pg||
nt|afulton: they made 6 in open room but that won't happen here... |pg||
nt|danilo1: as expected .. 2@S rebid made West @H bid almost impossible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wwalter: made|pg||
nt|wwalter: or not LOL|pg||
nt|charles_l: he may be preserving his options to misguess @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now way south could see passing was best|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 Spades,HA,DA and (a club)  minimum losers|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a violation of Burn's Law (RULES)|pg||
nt|haans: may go down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not DBL....ED another flat board I guess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|murat: he goes down now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Terence Reese had a pithy comment for South's 3@S ....|pg||
nt|ahh: he has fair idea  where the big @H are |pg||
nt|buddyshah: so we do have another swing,.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brgpro: @c i meant|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2 x A from S - have a bet? :)|pg||
nt|kurtove: no|pg||
nt|raghavan: Automatically spade honours fall - no need for worry, |pg||
nt|jeanhari: but depending on what de dbl over 1NT ment|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he said only points|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "He was happy to defend 3@H when it was bid, but not prepared to defend it when partner doubled!"|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The only suit favouring declarer is @D|pg||
nt|haans: only a bad lead  could make it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wwalter: if he plays @s could come a problewm :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: it was a good pass by S, although 4@S is an execellent contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: Friends- We thank all great Kibitz, co commentators, VuGr operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|henryb: 4N probably agrees spades for the moment, since N is most interested in the @sQ|pg||
nt|henryb: the grand is only good if S has the @sQ|pg||
nt|haans: but onoy may|pg||
nt|panja: S should have played @DT|pg||
nt|fann4: There are 5 top losers with the ruff.|pg||
nt|panja: @D2 is a lazy play|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes probably|pg||
nt|nubmaster: more @d now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh no there was 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no 3 imps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: in 3NT on a @D-lead decla must topplay @Cs - if @cQ in West no problem - if in East has to drop!|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now! I cannot see any 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok, tx|pg||
nt|fann4: thanks all, bye for now.|pg||

nt|haans: and not my style of 2 bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|wwalter: + 11 or -6? :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: well if you bids em you has to makes em :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: 10|pg||
nt|panja: you must reciprocate after a gift..|pg||
nt|sybarra: the nt "right sided"  the @S contract is not |pg||

nt|raghavan: in this session|pg||
nt|raghavan: playing H may help declarer in discard a club|pg||
nt|nubmaster: a @s, ace by Bakkeren and another @d ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: think same here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: no better with 2 @h ruffs|pg||
nt|haans: @H my choice|pg||
nt|raghavan: H e will be thinking whether C 10 could be another entry for 2 ruffs and SK|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ace of @c as entrance for second ruff|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: has to lead @c, he see's he is on hook anyway|pg||
nt|ahh: nice play by east  knocking entry to @S|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|raghavan: He may keep HJ as entry|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kurtove: that was bad play|pg||
nt|haans: and a kib have also  said "say THANKS  Roland Wald 2"  so I do (rightly so)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think the only lead to let it through would be @CK|pg||
pc|d9|nt|werge: If they cover - they have it...|pg||
nt|ahh: he cant |pg||
nt|danilo1: despite worked good here, I do not like weak-two with such a bad suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: the same problem in @s or @h. If he want to check @sQ he cannot find @hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session after a short break, not sure how long|pg||

pc|d6|nt|haans: chance there|pg||

nt|rnc: Herbst moving up - ranked 22 at the moment|pg||
nt|petere: and now ??|pg||
nt|haans: + 170|pg||

pc|c2|nt|april7: if E would have ruffed 2 @H in dummy then he had 10 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @c to T now, only way to make it...|pg||

nt|haans: 1 imp more|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: no sorry |pg||

pc|sA|nt|petere: NEXT!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahh: 9 tricks and another imp |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West perhaps needed to lead a heart (partner's suit!) to ensure a set against 3@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: 2 IMP = 16-14|pg||
nt|kurtove: east didnt expect clA in south now|pg||
nt|haans: Our appreciation to European Open Championship, San Remo, Italy  the for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|kurtove: cu in 40 min|pg||
nt|haans: cu soon|pg||
nt|pelu: no but he could unblock @DK = -200 ? 7 IMP and and 18-12 - that cost 4VP|pg||
nt|haans: cu Peter|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb: apparently they bid this bad grand in the other room, and will be rewarded with 13 impa, and a 17-13 win for the He Witte Huis team|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|an|!s|mb|p|nt|woozle: The club continuation blows the hand any time that declarer has another heart, and even two discards (if declarer began with bare king) still won't make the hand...abysmal defense ...|pg||
nt|woozle: from East|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: NS would like to bid a major suit game here, but I don't know that they will|pg||
nt|woozle: my, my, East has a poor hand...probably his reward for the last hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we dont know what this bidding means, so hard to assess|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently North's double showed an overcall in hearts, so he's doing a fair job of describing this hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: they appear to be using some form of crash (two suited overcalls)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: A spec just pointed out that West can duck the first heart for 800, which is true and relevant, but East made the final mistake when it could be known to be fatal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that would preclude a direct 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|woozle: South might have done more here...nice cards opposite spades and hearts|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|woozle: Double showed an overcall in hearts (1D would show spades, 1H/1S/1NT as two-suiters)|pg||
nt|woozle: Making 5 will be a little embarassing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does that convention have a name?|pg||
nt|woozle: It seems like this overcall structure is losing any preemptive value that a major suit overcall might have had|pg||

nt|ahh: not so sure about that |pg||
nt|ahh: sweden gaining i mean |pg||
nt|haans: and they tried|pg||
nt|werge: @S better than @H - not only by South|pg||
nt|afulton: doesnt matter...  ew should take 1@h and 1@s |pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|afulton: so, should be 5N, making and 4@s making 5... for push|pg||
nt|sybarra: never cashed the ace of @H's when in with spade|pg||
nt|afulton: i c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In the OR 6@S was not played like this:)|pg||
nt|werge: Who said slam?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|charles_l: 3N plus a few depending on the lead|pg||
nt|trotto: sorry all,   wrong widow:)|pg||
nt|daman: depends upon who plays it|pg||
nt|haans: no|pg||
nt|petere: Another 3NT with more than 4 tricks for the defender from the start|pg||
nt|haans: but mne Ekrens 2M weak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 24 point Grand|pg||
nt|haans: ask none you recieve no lies|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 6@c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good result here for Badger.|pg||
nt|ahh: they need to find the save too |pg||
nt|werge: South: Weak with majors - seems to be right|pg||
nt|haans: red suit ok|pg||
nt|danilo1: why this play ? (in 2@S) .. and why @H discard when @S 4-1 ... trying to loose trump control .. would be pretty unpleasnt if N @C AJ|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 3@C is invitational?|pg||
nt|raghavan: now S bids 1D|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S i come prepared|pg||
nt|werge: Now direction 6 @D - 3 NT out of question|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry 5 @D, I meant|pg||
nt|werge: Bad @S-break - might swing|pg||
nt|april7: the finesse in @H could have cost the contract on certain layout, but taking the ace , 100%|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C (hope Forcing) rite bid now|pg||
nt|haans: not to bad slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H from north now?|pg||
nt|panja: not a bad idea, two key cards missing though|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N bid and made on 23|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|werge: But the second @H-honour might help|pg||
nt|MolvaM: lets see good old blackwood will save another life?|pg||
nt|aupillon: for spectators not knowing exactly the Fante team : Italian name but french team with many real youngsters ( a bit less Fantun)|pg||
nt|afulton: did they believe the NS pair were faking their bids?  When playing, you need to decide who is telling the truth!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brgpro: N can make 6@c but EW has a vul. save in 6@h, 800|pg||
nt|athene: looks a bit heavy for that|pg||
nt|athene: east has too much defence and is too vulnerable to consider saccing, surely?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: he can X 4@h now but i doubt W will save|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to save in 6@H for loads and find pd was going to lead stiff @D against 6@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: S has a rather heavy 3@c , she will pass now|pg||
nt|brgpro: showing some interest |pg||
nt|panja: that must be N|pg||
nt|don paulus: shows 3crd @h ?|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need support doubles when partner has shown 5+ in the suit, i wouldn't have thought|pg||
nt|athene: i wld just bid 4@H with west's hand|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps X is game-try in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: if they have that agreement it suits the hand perfectly|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is a bit wet and 4@H a bit pushy|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT doesn't work?|pg||
nt|ady: almist certainly south|pg||
nt|haans: he has two chances to play @CK|pg||
nt|werge: EW 4 @S, naturally|pg||
mb|2C|an|Check Back|nt|charles_l: 2@d is 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|jcwla: At a low level, sometimes it's a free roll to tell partner whether the fit is 8 or 9, but here I agree it wouldn't seem to apply.|pg||
nt|daman: now from the wrong side|pg||
nt|ady: not wrong side   better for north to play|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry problrm on bbo |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I lost bidding we wait for the score|pg||
nt|ady: only a spade lead and club switch could be awkward|pg||
nt|ritong: what is final contract pls?|pg||
nt|ady: not finsished bidding yet|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt|pg||
nt|ritong: grazie|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: By S|pg||
nt|sybarra: "lesson board"  ???|pg||
nt|werge: South must avoid the @H-lead - better lead a trump |pg||
nt|mcarroll: well bid|pg||
nt|haans: Geir Helgemo have stopped using Ekrens no as profitable now that all know how to defend|pg||
nt|afulton: we already discussed earlier that one of these matches went into overtime and an imp is an imp is an imp|pg||
nt|ronpa: lengy is winning 1 imp a board but unfortuantly he needs 40 more boards and not 3 :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 3NT where Bocchi found the @S shift: Semanta won 3NT - he won on and endplay against N! |pg||
nt|athene: well if East bids 4@C or 3@S or 3NT now, west can bid 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: bizarre|pg||
nt|ady: wrong   tht south would open 2NT|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a 2NT opening would be artificial|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It didnt in the Open The void of course complicates things|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I think these days with the dealing programs, you should have good way to locate voids|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|ady: gone all haywire|pg||
nt|MolvaM: as they come up too often|pg||
mb|p|nt|dcbutler: Hauge is ahead 89-50 with one board to score, so will make the final|pg||
nt|aupillon: can be a swing for Fante|pg||
nt|aupillon: 3NT = WEAK trumps|pg||
nt|haans: but long way to go|pg||
nt|haans: forcing 2@D?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@D denies 3@S, 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @H9 should restrict to 3|pg||
nt|charles_l: hard to lead @h though|pg||
nt|wwalter: who would lead that? :)|pg||
nt|panja: it is a fair choice, even single dummy|pg||
nt|daman: a lot of good teams have fallen by the wayside|pg||
nt|petere: @C @S @C|pg||
nt|danilo1: .. and now 2@S (West)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brgpro: ......|pg||
nt|haans: will not make my money on that|pg||
nt|haans: not logical|pg||
nt|mcarroll: why not?|pg||
nt|haans: no cards to game|pg||
nt|haans: only cards for 2@D END|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and this will be made also|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice 10 of @D in W hand |pg||
nt|MolvaM: I suggested that 1@c opening should ask voids but not many people liked my idea  :)|pg||
nt|april7: only 12 tricks in @S |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1NT limits the hand so why use 2@D as a force?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer had just better not play @SAKJ throwing @D3 :) she runs into a nasty accident in clubs if she does that|pg||
nt|ahh: beginning to look like bd 16 was the match winner |pg||
nt|ronpa: this result has prevented an israeli match at the semis :(|pg||
nt|afulton: ok, stir something up for them Ron|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: if N wins the ace now, declarer might not need @Cs to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but N ducks correctly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes looks like they have no intention of going beyond game|pg||
nt|aupillon: even with a nice hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
nt|aupillon: no, no|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Can go off wih @C ruff|pg||
nt|petere: does she have any chance making this ?|pg||
nt|werge: Think, the 11th trick is hard to find|pg||
nt|werge: I think, it will be difficult to bid 7 - to tell each other, that we have a 65 % grand slam or so|pg||
nt|haans: i think anything else is just to much|pg||
nt|danilo1: with 3 small (not easting Hcp for ruff) Hearts, a little more than just 4@S is worth try |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: with 6@c, Bochi doesnt care as even if they are without @cK pd must have @cAQ 6 times|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, @D to the Ace and a @C-discard on @H King is not directly stupid|pg||
nt|haans: as a speak say only one chane|pg||
nt|haans: spec|pg||
nt|haans: may b|pg||
nt|haans: but three more|pg||
nt|petere: @C will be helpful even|pg||
nt|april7: now E might bid 7|pg||
mb|3H|nt|aupillon: it's over i guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: NS throw the ball at each other|pg||
nt|haans: and down|pg||
mb|p|nt|buddyshah: angling towads a dangerus 7 now|pg||
nt|werge: It´s a very good 7|pg||
nt|april7: all high cards are here, but oly singletn K of @S, and E doesn't know it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: a quick claim|pg||
nt|athene: could draw trumps with the @C4 :)|pg||
nt|athene: just to be cute|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N has the chance to stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|aupillon: say 5 spades. You've done enough|pg||
nt|aupillon: why not Blackwood after 3NT. Fit was given|pg||
nt|werge: But when East knows, that they have all key-cards, @S King included - he will bid 7|pg||
nt|april7: just bad luck,if E bids it|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Kx good Kstiff  not so good|pg||
nt|don paulus: cannot avoid losing a @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the thinking should be E did not overcall 1@S, nor did she dbl 2@D..so is unlikely to hold enough to defeat the contract in any of those suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes the spot cards in @H and @C make it impossible to promote a trick|pg||
nt|afulton: they COULD have bid 4@s in other room, no?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@C asks about Major distribution|pg||
nt|haans: may have bid 2@C not as checkback but trf to 2@D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: you cant bid 6 rounds and play just a 5level contract|pg||

pc|s2|nt|charles_l: its only good if S shows stiff|pg||

pc|s3|nt|charles_l: 2@d was effectively nmf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: its just that they didnt stop at 5. but this is coincidental|pg||
nt|MolvaM: by the way garner made a good lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: diamond lead could have been problematic|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and let declarer get rid of his heart loser on 3rd round @d|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: i agree not bidding 5@D to close|pg||
nt|ahh: normal auction in other room |pg||
nt|werge: I think, that the second trick here was a clear-cut Lavinthal position. Without the @C-void, South had played a medium @S|pg||
nt|petere: 3@D in the OR ... second best fit|pg||
nt|werge: I have been told, that declarer could set up a @C for the 11th trick - I do´nt agree|pg||
nt|ronpa: the dealer is not helping as well but the indians has played great this set and deserves the compliments|pg||
nt|werge: Fun goes on - what a set of boards|pg||
nt|buddyshah: so they did bid 6|pg||
nt|don paulus: i understand from operator they were in 6@s after all|pg||
nt|werge: SORRY - 6 @S was BID in CR also|pg||
nt|buddyshah: operator   did E rid 6 on 5D or W raised?|pg||

nt|haans: 41S 5@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: operator plays any card then claims|pg||
nt|raghavan: This hand looks like a dull 2H hand  |pg||

nt|haans: OR bid @S-3@D all pass|pg||
nt|haans: how o find @H if 3@D opening|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: play 6 with two men off, have a chance and miss it, then finally score +2:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Canape should help EW here..3@H  makes|pg||
nt|werge: The point is, that you put vour money on the fact, that South has no @C biggerthan the 9|pg||
nt|haans: if opps bid say THANK YOU|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes much more difficult than over the 2@C opening in OR|pg||
nt|haans: i say 4@D mean spade support|pg||
mb|4C|nt|charles_l: 4@h is 50%|pg||
nt|wwalter: @@ the oter table was the @h9 as lead|pg||
nt|athene: but unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|afulton: there has been some wonderful commentary at this table by Ron Pachlmann, Shirley Ybarra and Martin Carroll |pg||
nt|danilo1: depends on agreement ... 1NT, 2NT, 2@D, 2@S or Dble by North?|pg||
nt|haans: any way @C8 are no stopper!!|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 2@S shows other 2 (evidently, maybe East may find 3@C bid (stopper asking)|pg||
nt|haans: you need help to bid ¤@S or 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: est|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in 12 boards 70 to 2 is massive|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D is a good save, but only S can bid it, N with AK in @S won't|pg||
nt|buddyshah: ty massimilano|pg||

nt|danilo1: he did :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: now .. wasy way to 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: what does 3@C mean? i see it but does p know|pg||
nt|danilo1: since North shows @H+@C .. 3@C should mean .. asking for Stop (evidently good @D too>)|pg||

nt|athene: not impossible|pg||
nt|haans: i(I) bid my stopper asking |pg||
nt|haans: but x ============= thank you|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Canape is a style of bidding wherein longer suit is bid on second round|pg||
nt|panja: so here, W has 5 Clubs and 4 Hearts, he opened 1@H|pg||
nt|aupillon: hello Henri. |pg||
nt|ritong: hi.|pg||
nt|werge: That is DOUBLE-DUMMY only - South could have 5-4-2-2 - this Ekren is out of control|pg||
nt|werge: But a good point anyway, thanks|pg||
nt|haans: sometimes|pg||
nt|danilo1: if NS insist on 5@C .. East should bid 5@D instead 5@S (same -1 .. but he does not know it)|pg||
nt|haans: yep but not 5@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yet another straightforward 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: hard when partner didn't double any artficial diamond bids, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't expect opps to have so many diamonds that a ruff is likely|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C sign off?|pg||
nt|ritong: don t think 2@c was|pg||
nt|MolvaM: agressive 2@s but understandable at this vul|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought after 3NT by S there was no room to go wrong even with a void|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: look disclipinated East|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I thought that most US pairs had a higher standard than Jxxxxx for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|ahh: south will take his chances on defence |pg||
nt|haans: and they did it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well done|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: but yes, they might try for bigger things|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||

nt|ady: thx|pg||

nt|raghavan: No chance for gimmicks by any one of the 4|pg||
nt|haans: East see slam|pg||
nt|danilo1: srry, 5@D is on (H discarded on @S)|pg||
nt|haans: but spade 4-1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: interesting 2@S rather than 2NT rebid from east|pg||
nt|pelu: they open 4 card major|pg||
nt|brgpro: many play 2NT is extra and 2@s=waiting|pg||
nt|pelu: B24 NS in 6@S - played by N! - so diff to find the @H-lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: still, have to guess @cA|pg||
nt|athene: strong @C or a shaded 2NT opener?|pg||
nt|athene: east might still lead @H10 surely|pg||
nt|haans: all may think its very close|pg||
nt|ahh: looks like 8 tricks  no more no less   but lets see |pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: They have stopped in 3@H in OR|pg||
nt|haans: last chance|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: they shouldn't have to work so hard to beat this, though|pg||
nt|jcwla: A bridge too far.|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
pc|s8|nt|afulton: Oops, and I forgot ... some super stuff by Georgia Ray! |pg||
nt|ronpa: defeating 3@H is great result but 4@H has no play in here so another push|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: defence needs to play spades early  to get 2 spades  1 heart and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|werge: Quite a world between the two Ekrans in Bd 11 and 12...|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to see 3NT making, and in Open E is in 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: desperado bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As Spec says witholding @DK a good move|pg||
nt|haans: hard to understand what is happening|pg||
nt|mcarroll: TRUE|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but they are in europe. maybe that explains :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: best chance is that East lead her singleton @D = she cant have an A when she lead a singleton!!|pg||
nt|henryb: 6 could make, if South is inspited to lead a @d|pg||
nt|henryb: inspired*|pg||
nt|aupillon: good point. In France, MOST never open unless at least 3 honours ( from AKJ10 and 9). Otherwise you loose your club licence :)|pg||
nt|petere: this will score more than +110|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mcarroll: I wonder what their theoreticl Ekren HCP range is, 2 points last hand, and a good 9 here?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: easy to understand RIGHT???????????????????????????????|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if you become the european champion by constantly opening 2 with Jxxxxx they could live with that :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: In Turkey a good sequence headed by 987632 can do. Not true, Murat ?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sure but we prefer 987642 better actually|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be right |pg||
nt|werge: If you bid 5 @D, E/W might try 5 @S|pg||
nt|werge: Look at the West-hand|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: yes :))|pg||
nt|athene: if north has announced strong balanced, east should be able to avoid the @CA lead|pg||
nt|pelu: a fall from grace : @cA - and easy 12 tricks - the 3. slam-sving in the match|pg||
nt|brgpro: i've seen people leading singleton against a grand...so...|pg||
nt|haans: who has @S6?|pg||
nt|haans: what score after 25 boards|pg||

nt|haans: some questions will be sked after the match im sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: this is OK|pg||
nt|ritong: three comparisons to come|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: that is Ekrens|pg||
nt|mcarroll: claim|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: to have finessing position against the 3|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|charles_l: +1 here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This looks like closing it out forNL with only 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|haans: drwn trumps first|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: declarer is under no pressure here - although if south had @SK107 left, a diamond back wld be nasty|pg||
nt|pelu: the 4. slamswing: NS in 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: 96 imps changed hands in 11 boards|pg||
nt|haans: most likely 1@D did never happen|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: that's what we like to see!|pg||
nt|petere: so, a new leader again|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: so all kibs - stay for tha last 2 boards!|pg||

nt|buddyshah: next|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is their trick ,  take it says declarer|pg||
nt|raghavan: so that a D can be ruffed|pg||
nt|haans: @S6?|pg||
nt|ahh: all about stopping south making a @H trick now |pg||
nt|ahh: pitch @S andits down on the ruff |pg||
nt|haans: lead of @SJ = does not know from how many|pg||
nt|ahh: but  need to cash the @C  before the ruff or 1 goes away |pg||
nt|ahh: so its a bit deeper as north must underlead |pg||
nt|raghavan: Will declarer finess H9 after entering via S ruff|pg||
nt|haans: @S 5 and 6 bid cards|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|brgpro: the last 2 bds will be pairs or BAM ( board a match)|pg||
nt|wwalter: probaly they play 4M , we saw canape earlyer, so 1@c denies 4M|pg||

nt|sybarra: 6 @H or 6 @C  (hate the break in clubs) |pg||
nt|haans: may get to high|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I think 4@C for me|pg||
nt|haans: not nice with @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 6@D has possibilities here|pg||
nt|ahh: Sweden should bid 6 to flatten it  but very few ways to get 15 on 1 board |pg||
nt|rodal f: For service by all resalt: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Results.htm |pg||
nt|petere: 1 free suit still|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right no clubs ruff|pg||
nt|danilo1: ca North find a bid (revaluate @HJ) over probable 1@H-1NT-3@H?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|charles_l: will E dbl 2@d?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems to have been wrong-sided in the open room|pg||
nt|haans: try it all u get|pg||
nt|werge: It is hard to be the only one in the world, who would not bid 1 @D...|pg||
nt|danilo1: *can ...|pg||
nt|haans: do not belive that|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, 2@S make s it (maybe) more difficult ... but possible 4@H by South |pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But that may be aMajor Transfer - Texas|pg||
nt|haans: not popular today though|pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: what is south's double? |pg||
mb|4C|an| |nt|ahh: small chance they might try 6nt from south and pick up 2 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: how do they find the @D fit now?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans > I was hoping S to bid Diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: i thunk 3@H show 3-5-4-1|pg||
nt|haans: they are relaying|pg||
mb|d|nt|brgpro: if 6@h is played by W, it is easier to find @d lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: E wont pass this...|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that Bocchi-Auken are exp that they are on lead - only 1 bad board - the 3NT-1|pg||
nt|haans: reverse stayman  = namyats|pg||
nt|haans: for some reason|pg||
mb|4H|nt|charles_l: pass=2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yessssssssssss|pg||
nt|daman:  3NT here   has chances to go down, but not many|pg||
nt|daman: zero in fact|pg||
nt|ady: South needs to avoid a club lead|pg||
nt|petere: 3NT (NS) depends on 4 @C tricks, but can't get those @Cs running|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am with you on this one Hans, |pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|petere: so, +500 looks fine for Joel|pg||
nt|werge: STOP!!! I have allready 427 messages from good players, who agree with me upon tha PASS instead of 1 @D...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the X from E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but all W's cards in the minors were "right", so perhaps his final raise was not too unreasonable -- though somewhat inconsistent with the cuatious style he had dispalyed before|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR just finished (and not on a good note for Badger), so welcome to all those who have come here from the OR.|pg||
nt|haans: and so they made it well done|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same here|pg||
nt|haans: assume it means MAX|pg||
nt|raghavan: But 6D by S may be good - Rare occasion W may not lead SA.|pg||
nt|werge: Double? NO?|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... nice Apek :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: e/w jammed the auction |pg||
nt|afulton: nice job of jamming the signals|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: sorry for bad typing|pg||
nt|xenya: so it might be 13 imps for the trailing team |pg||
nt|henryb: not enough boards left|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: thinking or are we crashing again |pg||
nt|haans: not know|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27 hcp and down 2?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nightmare of a rubber bridge player|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way with xx in @D that S can bid |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet N is sick seeing dummy |pg||
nt|ronpa: opp bid without pts to 5@D nv they have AT LEAST 10 of them|pg||
nt|afulton: I asked about the double because it often isn't played as support over the 2 level|pg||
nt|don paulus: more than close - with @h loser pitched on @c|pg||
nt|haans: void in !B will black relly do|pg||
nt|haans: @D|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that lead is better than a spade|pg||
nt|ritong: can make now|pg||
nt|ritong: for the declarer, yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the other room zia led @s9 specs tell me|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a killing lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but here Henner still has work to do|pg||
nt|ritong: hope north will keep his @c8, for a start|pg||
nt|buddyshah: certain slam, did E really X?|pg||
nt|werge: Probably not|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H is make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no @D stop = stop!|pg||
nt|charles_l: should always make - @d sets up for a loser discard|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am sure being on vugraf we all noticed the backward finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|haans: not my choice|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: a nice scientific auction, asking NS to lead diamonds, please|pg||
nt|xenya: but the gap is already too wide to overcome, true |pg||
nt|daman: up Simba|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4D now atleast|pg||
nt|haans: have u really counted them :)|pg||
nt|werge: I am not a good counter, honestly|pg||
nt|petere: no he estimated and then subtracted a few to pretend a count|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no misclick|pg||
nt|buddyshah: pass looks like E  Xed or @S forgo 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: could be an important imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume they VIP it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: She has to pass the @D to N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: by playing the @D 9|pg||
nt|ritong: south will split|pg||
nt|werge: Peter, that is in german called "Enthüllung"...|pg||
nt|petere: :9|pg||
nt|petere: ducking this trick ... may help to destroy comm. but does it help for 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: EW could either play a third @D for W to ruff small|pg||
nt|haans: or as I say MAX|pg||
nt|ahh: notice the economy of effort in the relays |pg||
nt|mcarroll: S can expect his AQs to produce at least 3 and probably 4 tricks, so I agree with 4@H call|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|haans: entries to hearts|pg||
nt|haans: asnd clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: not a bid wasted between 3 and 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: but relay take spades itself|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is the penultimate board of this round. Thanks to the EBL and Italian Bridge Federation for organising an excellent tournament. Thanks also to my fellow commentator Hans ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sjostrom, and to all spectators for thier comments an information - especially on the bidding systems. And finally to Roland Wald for organising the BBO so well - as always.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: nees to play a hearft to the queen|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead could still work now|pg||
nt|april7: with 4 losers N passed? unbelievable,but they have enough imps|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: if EW just blast into the slam, i think it's far from obvious to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes|pg||
nt|aupillon: missing cruely the 10 @s|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: at risk now|pg||
nt|ritong: this @d 3 was not a jewel|pg||
nt|daman: another @D by South|pg||
nt|ritong: i think @d J would have been much more helpful|pg||
nt|daman: un autre carreau par Sud|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, when declarer has K9x, it looks bad|pg||
nt|ritong: but anyways, north is not on lead soon|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the other room, declarer played a heart toward the queen|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ko immediato?|pg||
nt|haans: This interesting match will continue 14.45 (italian time???) If you do not return you may regret it. 14:45 (italy time??????) |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: The quiet before the (mild) storm of 14.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could choose to draw trumps and exit @SA and another here|pg||
nt|athene: then eventually the defence have to open diamonds or give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|ritong: a better move imho|pg||
nt|werge: This is in fact a very poor slam, even with the @C King on-side, it´s not extremely good|pg||
nt|ritong: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was careless?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes 27HCP and no fillers|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|haans: spades very right|pg||
nt|petere: 9 tricks via an endplay against East ... ist the suggestion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a revelation?|pg||
nt|haans: @CK and then finesse|pg||
nt|don paulus: and we had very few misclicks - even if Max's eyes are burning after 10 days :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, i agree|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorry on vugraf I should say "Im not sure why south didnt play @d10"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|ritong: right M:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thats standard commentator jargon|pg||
nt|ahh: so when you defend against relay systems  with a suitable hand  preempt  they are not as comfortable |pg||
nt|haans: and a make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: undo! :)|pg||
nt|henryb: these are KO rounds, Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I start to became tired..............I lost the hand sorry :(|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: kib asked  is east Frances Hinden?|pg||
nt|daman: he/she would be on lead if South played another @D|pg||
nt|ady: thx kibs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I was wondering how it might make but this lead certainly helps|pg||
nt|haans: i am now corrected KO after 2x 14 boards|pg||
nt|werge: Surprising, that North did NOT just lead a small @D|pg||
nt|werge: So - come-on, how does he make this double-dummy?|pg||
nt|haans: so stay on 12:30 (italy time) for next part|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: of course nothing matters with both diamonds right|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: and gin says North |pg||
nt|werge: This will be first real score for Texan, they bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx Paul|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb: probably down one. no problem :)|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|ritong: you can also content urself with "!", like i do:)|pg||
nt|ronpa: other table had the exact same bidding|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East is indeed Frances Hinden, one of our regular commentators (Finch)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a busy poster on BBO forums|pg||
nt|daman: this contract was going down had S played a @D and not a @H   still may go down|pg||
nt|ady: not an unreasonable line |pg||
nt|ritong: frances is a remarkable commentator|pg||
nt|ahh: however i do not give a government guarentee with that advice |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: these are long sets for operators |pg||
nt|haans: endplays are not as good as squeeze you never know when it is working|pg||
nt|nubmaster: only 8 now|pg||
nt|haans: Ms Sokolow has only 2 @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes, so she will be endplayed|pg||
nt|petere: @D through and @H back|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sK|nt|haans: but you may read a book article about relay|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: right these are KO,  forgot format |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, looks like 1 or 2 off -- hardly matters really|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah all is clear now thanks to kibs |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|MolvaM: specs tell me that Zia did play the @d10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D and A@C and low @S N is endplayed|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|werge: Honestly: North had 4 suits for his choce - and all three seems more "normal" than this @H-Queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dont think it can be made, unless @C discard|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am inundated with ways to make - the one I like best is @H to the 7, endplaying S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is getting interesting for N|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: done like dinner now|pg||
nt|raghavan: remove trumps  and develop H  |pg||
nt|haans: @D endplay I say|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: the last on Q of @d...|pg||
nt|buddyshah: amazing Operator, by far the best Open room in 6@S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: hand are with is best in the system|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|ritong: or adopt chess notation and use " ? " for dubious moves and " § " for brilliant moves   " ?! " meaning " unexpected, not sure if it is brilliant or dubious"|pg||
nt|haans: it does not always work|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|nt|ritong: who is vulnerable on the last board?:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wwalter: UPS|pg||
nt|danilo1: sure agree with 4@H call .. and very nice done by South ... he knows his pd cannot see twice AQ|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: KILL|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: Apologies, I have forgotten that this being the final, rounds are 16 boards, not 14 as in previous rounds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|charles_l: @s lead does beat t - ty PO and Walter|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S would have endplayed N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: when do you use the notation  "!x%&/$" ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well played or badly defended|pg||
nt|aupillon: i am very, very sad about the issue of this match, but we have to recognize they play a VERY strong team|pg||

nt|ritong: avoids the dreaded cold game lost|pg||
nt|daman: and this hand is unlikely to deposit 14 IMPs to their account either|pg||

nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: So the only real big pickup this segment for Badger (and a deserved one) will be Board 6, where Allix/Neve rested in 3@S while Hinden played 3NT.|pg||
nt|werge: By to Munich|pg||
nt|don paulus: next segment was scheduled for 18.00 local time - probably some delay|pg||
nt|rnmalik: thanks all C.........U|pg||
nt|werge: Pass in West? Strange|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|brgpro: how many extra bds if the match is a draw?|pg||
nt|pelu: pl stay for the last board, Massimiliano :) - u have done a great job|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i'm here :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: second half consists of 14 more exciting boards so dont go away|pg||
nt|haans: something like that yes|pg||
nt|ahh: 780 swing not enough |pg||
nt|ahh: need 900 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 4-1 @S break with K offside kills an otherwise godd 6@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: on a good day you make 6@S. This is not the day|pg||
nt|haans: here 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: don't know baout important|pg||
nt|athene: East in the other room was trying to kill the entry to the diamonds>|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s will be the final contract anfter 2NT-3@s ?|pg||
nt|haans: lets end last board|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|daman: thank you everyone    |pg||
nt|werge: OK - there was a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She was hoping for @DA with partner|pg||
nt|athene: putting her partner with the @DA|pg||
nt|ritong: after the strict fourth best lead|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case declarer would perhaps have just knocked out the @DA first of all|pg||
nt|werge: Without a @D.lead, 6 @S is a great kontrakt - but @d are for ever|pg||
nt|werge: Makes East (un)happy|pg||
nt|haans: all wrong|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: Thx also to EBU and all of the folks who help bring this important tourney to  BBO |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best way of pytting it I suppose is "declarer took advantage of a minor slip by the defence"|pg||
nt|danilo1: after North open .. guess no stop possible for South below GaME|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
nt|haans: a way so show @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@H is a wee bit wet|pg||
nt|don paulus: probably next segment by 18.15 or so - stay tuned on BBO TV :)|pg||
nt|buddyshah: OR simple 2@H for E-W |pg||
nt|haans: 2@C on 4-2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: and Welcome back 12:30 (italy time) match continue|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: last board see you soon and sorry for my mistake ...........|pg||
nt|werge: Take a look at the score - Bakkeren did NOT make the slam|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: mistakes |pg||
nt|werge: Maybe 4 @S is the best spot now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I doubt they will bid beyond game at this table|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: west think a lot |pg||
nt|haans: its has been funny (nervy) match this far|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this segment (these semis are quite short, aren't they?), a big thank you to Roland, Bill, Paul, Mike and all specs.  Some great comments.  The second and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: final segment is scheduled for the top of the hour, so stay tuned.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows 3+ and is forcing. It denies 4 and a minimum|pg||
nt|werge: I think, that West has NO slam-ambitions here - knowing probably 6-5 by East|pg||
nt|mcarroll: putting|pg||
nt|haans: thank you all (beru included)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|april7: what a bad luck for EW again,but its not over yet|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
pc|c3|nt|charles_l: i didnt envisage stayman there|pg||
nt|panja: y, Major suits..so more equal|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: only one think please Massimiliano or Max not Massimo :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: Yuval, a spectator, points out what we said that reaching the phase of 16 it's a very good achievement. True|pg||
nt|raghavan: I like this fast approach to game . |pg||
nt|ahh: game over  bad luck Sweden very well done Vito  from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: see you all tomorrow for the rest thx so much |pg||
nt|ahh: more matches tomorrow  |pg||
nt|haans: And as always we thank our excellent Vugr Operator Massimiliano for a really great job! |pg||
nt|ahh: thx to our great operator in San Remo  Massimillio|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is the last deal of this session. We thanl all sweey spectators, co commentatos Haans abd Jim and Dr Raranjapee, Tx to VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|haans: i was first :)|pg||
nt|april7: E is afraid of X, W might go out:):)|pg||
nt|haans: many lead singel no singel lead === have no singel|pg||
nt|haans: single|pg||
nt|haans: :) sry :)'|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  thx for thoughts and comments,  we appreciate them @H@H  hope you enjoyed |pg||
nt|henryb: and to the BBO staff who make this available to them and you all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a little scary|pg||
nt|nubmaster: agree but not that easy when having both M's|pg||
nt|haans: but an easy make|pg||
nt|werge: Match over|pg||
nt|petere: so, have to go now ... lunch preparing. Thanks all and c u :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3@h could make @s disappear|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Match is not over|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is the first half of 14 boards|pg||
nt|haans: :) GOOD BYE ALL :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Yes and it's exciting, only 4 imps up...|pg||
nt|werge: Masochisme bidding by South|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: Roland in particular who herds us cats (sometimes called commentators)   He works very hard to make this run smoothly  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: simple 3NT |pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: Whats for lunch Massi |pg||
nt|henryb: probably down 1. declarer will take the @c finesse, and a @h shift will sink the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: May be a sandwich or a salad.........very light however I could sleep on 3° tournment :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to you Roland for your yeoman efforts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous and bravi to the winners|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Play will resume tomorrow with the final (48 boards) at 10:30 CET, 4:30 am New York, 9:30 am London, 6:30 pm Sydney. Welcome back then|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye all see you tomorrow for final macht|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of specs,  we appreciate you comments and insights, @H@H!  keep them coming |pg||
nt|haans: this has been a very fun match (to watch)|pg||
nt|danilo1: does it look ike like singleton? ... believe after thinking, declarer more probably plays small|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: nice day tommorow|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mr Haans , I am with you on the good interest of your country team|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: ??? - why not keep communication?|pg||
nt|pelu: before u take the trick - be sure what u wont to play next trick - if u dont know - then dont take the trick!|pg||
nt|brgpro: she was afraid Q10x by dec. and pd Jxx|pg||
nt|brgpro: now she knows QJ10|pg||
nt|pelu: I know that S cant see QJ!0 by decl - Bocchi could have the J - but she has to decide before taking @HA|pg||
nt|charles_l: Max is shorter to type :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: in the meantime 2@h is not going to be fun...|pg||
nt|athene: are you sure 1@S promises 3 spades? an earlier board suggested NS play 1@S = any weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it won't go 8 down which is what's needed to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: she both asked and looked at the convention card|pg||
nt|haans: but he has a slammy honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be fun hand also |pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: bye|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has 3 1Ss, 2@Ds and 3 @Cs -- unless she is clairvoyant|pg||
nt|athene: and now east's 2@S bid suggests the same|pg||
nt|werge: They might loose all here - North is ready with a DOUBLE|pg||
nt|haans: passing time now|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt is that Turbo?|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, there is a play for 6 @S, even on a @D-lead - but double-dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Ignore the banner (top). It has everything wrong on it|pg||
nt|april7: why didn't N X 4@C???|pg||
nt|buddyshah: now this is interesting|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: if she makes this she will gain 10 IMPS   a day late and a dollar short|pg||
nt|haans: overboard only if they x|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Got any news about the times Roland? Is it 13.30 Paris time for next half?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's a quarter-final from whe *women's* event|pg||
nt|danilo1: despite looks like single, difficult to see the way hamo with @DK not rite|pg||
nt|haans: 2 @C + 1 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still going 2 off|pg||
nt|danilo1: * way home|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: On that lead it's even close to making|pg||
nt|don paulus: he liked that contr|pg||
nt|werge: I think, that South and West should form a pair - same style on this board!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|werge: South has no entry now to the @H-tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: might have done better leading @dK at trick 2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Now she has three heart tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The losers will both win a bronze medal. No play-off for third place|pg||
nt|daman: is there a website Roland?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: is there a playoff for third, or do both semifinal losers get bronze?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: read above|pg||
nt|ritong: see up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|dcbutler: too quick for me, Roland|pg||
nt|daman: thanks|pg||
nt|ady: this might make|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer a simple 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the winning teams go to quarterfinals, losers go to play in the open pairs, or go home crying, or go to a restaurant to get drunk|pg||
nt|werge: Best play was to take first trick with @S Q - K might be doubleton - and an entry was safe|pg||
nt|haans: would you have lead @CQ|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: is she?|pg||
nt|sybarra: go for your woman's intuition!|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is thinking about it |pg||
nt|sybarra: I can feel it |pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: feel good shirley|pg||
nt|aupillon: it's over ( sung by Robinson)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: undo I reckon|pg||
nt|danilo1: @HA rite card (@C is wrong despite Lavinthal) .. @C cannot go away even if @HA ruffed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye all thx see you tommorrow|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: two ruffs|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt felt better |pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope this doesnt sould slammish to Bertens |pg||
nt|sybarra: *sound|pg||
nt|haans: it sounds to me STOP SOON!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brgpro: and 4 trumps and @cA|pg||
nt|ritong: one club|pg||
nt|werge: South should know, that if E/W can make 6 @C - they would have bid 7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: - and he knew|pg||
nt|werge: We learn about South - that he is a she...|pg||
nt|haans: and we have a winner|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Some imps to O'Rourke, they missed 4@s last deal at the last table...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh if was Bertens who made the try wit 4 @C,  forget my comment |pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to all commentators, our brilliant bbo operator|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, she tried Merimac copu|pg||
nt|pelu: 27 = flat - so this board will decide the winner|pg||
nt|brgpro: coup|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So Hauge (Norway/Bulgaria) vs Neve (Franc) in the final tomorrow. Hauge won comprehensively against De Botton (England)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: O´Rourke is a SHE|pg||
nt|werge: South is Lou Ann - and the family name is your guess...|pg||
nt|haans: we will remember that to next fight|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: absolutly MRS O'ROURKE|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: France  even|pg||
nt|haans: we learn all the time|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Massi|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and our spectators with their guiding comments|pg||
pc|dK|nt|aupillon: and Master and Commander = Roland Wald|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: now 9 toptricks - working for an overtrick|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: 11 IMPs to France it seems|pg||
nt|sybarra: and -1 coming |pg||
nt|ronpa: now declarer can make by squeezing East in the minors|pg||
nt|ronpa: just run all the trumps|pg||
nt|joemanjo: sqz|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: she does possess supernatural powers then|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: - and my grangmother once had the North hand, she double 4 @C... (By for now...)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|charles_l: only consolation is its only 50 a pop|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry I lost all |pg||
nt|charles_l: np|pg||
nt|charles_l: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set up to show times for your area) thanks to Roland Wald (Denmark) the BBO vugraph co-ordinator|pg||
nt|ritong: make that three ruffs and a plus score|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brgpro: this is the deciding overtrick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 = the 10 trick|pg||
nt|brgpro: decisive|pg||
nt|wwalter: bye|pg||
nt|charles_l: see you all later|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: see you later|pg||
nt|dcbutler: 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All events in Sanremo are transnational|pg||
nt|daman: failure to return a @C will be costly|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again all |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: thank you all, see ya later|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: too late now|pg||
nt|ritong: tough blow on the last board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I believe next set will start at 6pm paris time|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|dcbutler: she could always make it, i think|pg||
nt|daman: lose by 4    ouch|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is the squeeze going to work?|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: Cool hand.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: 6NT is best (proof against 5-0 hearts) but we'll forgive other slams|pg||
