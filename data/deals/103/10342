nt|westjava: info from kibs, no final round|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: and W did not recognize 5N as the GSF|pg||
nt|charles_l: EW often use 5N as 'pick a slam'|pg||

nt|woozle: Hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Ji Kieran|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi even|pg||
nt|charles_l: hi|pg||
nt|mariner1: GSF = Grand Slam Force, if p has two of top 3 trumps they should bid 7|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Kiernan|pg||
nt|woozle: It would be weird for East to play his partner for less than AK to many diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: E has to raise to 7 here, there has to be a play|pg||
mb|4D|nt|charles_l: yes all he needs are AK to many @ds |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: maybe 4@H-4@S-5@C-5NT-7@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure any bid from this point will be made confidently|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Unlikely that 7D is better than 7NT though|pg||
nt|mariner1: and could easily have and outside K|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe a trump coup if he has AK98xxx and trumps are 4-0 onside...all a bit far-fetched|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|woozle: at least he took the best line of play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in a real close match or at matchpoints i bid 7nt|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|westjava: japan 2nd rank and Indonesia 5th after RR2-7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: takes courage to bid 7 but probably right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the skippped 4@H cue bid has made this much harder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next vugraph today also Indonesia vs Japan -- but Ladies in 2nd match|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so many uncertainties -- a) was 1@S forcing or just encouraging  b) 3@C probe for NT or good hand  c) was 4@D real @D or the hand that was looking for 3N ....|pg||

nt|woozle: responding with 3-counts, you need a way to reach your high card games|pg||
nt|fabsayc: minimum count, and bad hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Game is poor because there is no @H10. You don't know that|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice line George!!!   quick claim - let opponent's figure it out :)|pg||
nt|westjava: ahaa|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: more slamming |pg||
nt|rodal f: New slam?|pg||
nt|westjava: again   24 is a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S then what from George?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this one may not be as easy to bid unless N (and S) bid a lot of spades |pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D!|nt|woozle: The club continuation blows the hand any time that declarer has another heart, and even two discards (if declarer began with bare king) still won't make the hand...abysmal defense ...|pg||
nt|woozle: from East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe  1@H-(3@S)-5@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 2@S left too much room for EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S will make opps bis further by no prob, but how many would have bidde 4@S direct?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 4 @H can not be right |pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like shut out to me |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D either "transfer" or 1-under=artificial raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: whatever it is, i dont like it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|woozle: NS would like to bid a major suit game here, but I don't know that they will|pg||
nt|woozle: my, my, East has a poor hand...probably his reward for the last hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we dont know what this bidding means, so hard to assess|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently North's double showed an overcall in hearts, so he's doing a fair job of describing this hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better pass now|pg||
nt|westjava: Eadt,on the way|pg||
nt|westjava: East|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: unless is equivalent to standard 3@S, but appears it was not|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@D are cleare but the next are harder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would you object to an artificial 3@D -- gives East lots of room for further description if no more interference|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 3 sp should help e/w |pg||
nt|fabsayc: is fine if implies slam interest and forces cue bidding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but from west response it is invite+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to me sounds like east searching for @S control from West -- perfect description|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree there Al. They gave EW space|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@D=invite+ then East has learned partner has extras - and so slam investigation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice great parlay|pg||
nt|sybarra: find thx, hope you are as well |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they appear to be using some form of crash (two suited overcalls)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: A spec just pointed out that West can duck the first heart for 800, which is true and relevant, but East made the final mistake when it could be known to be fatal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that would preclude a direct 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|woozle: South might have done more here...nice cards opposite spades and hearts|pg||
nt|westjava: @H,@D and@C control is ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok I dont get it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: just didn't work :(|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: A quick 12er|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|woozle: Double showed an overcall in hearts (1D would show spades, 1H/1S/1NT as two-suiters)|pg||
nt|woozle: Making 5 will be a little embarassing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does that convention have a name?|pg||
nt|woozle: It seems like this overcall structure is losing any preemptive value that a major suit overcall might have had|pg||

nt|rodal f: Ok. Came:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|fabsayc: i gave up on two suited overcalls, better to use your normal structure, since you need both strong and weak bids against modern light 1@C openings|pg||
nt|rodal f: And an easy 4@H I belive.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Teramoto-Takayama not on same wavelength regarding DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S splinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to take the splinter/que beside|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: how about 6@D..?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|woozle: NS might be in trouble here...3H is their best landing spot and it's not that pretty|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: seems silly when partner has 2@H [with 3@H accept transfer over the DBL]|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ups. Why not 4@D on the way?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully no one is thinking of biddint more |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodal's comment raises interesting question -- what does Karwur need for RDBL?|pg||
nt|westjava: rdbl may GF..??|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|woozle: Nobody doubles 3H, so we needn't get out the calculator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite weak NT George needs perfecta for slam -- 3 keycards AND either @HQ or @H length  and  even doubleton KQ doesn't make slam cold|pg||
nt|sybarra: better hear the screeching of brakes soon |pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive it will end at 5@H but forgetting the ques on the way often makes miss at slams|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: A deft diamond guess might hold this to down one|pg||
nt|woozle: no, still down two|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am betting on down 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1n-2@D followed by 3@S splinter shows entire hand|pg||

mb|1H|nt|woozle: NS both have tempting hands, but they're lucky that they can make 4S|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm afraid that I don't see any point to the 1D overcall - poor suit, poor hand, negative preemptive value|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or maybe it didin't matter|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand of this set |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: particularly daft if dummy has shown spade shortage or something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Last board now. Thanks are due to and Flora Lam, organisers Associacao de Bridge de Macau and Asvezes Tsang for bringing this event ...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: great job from our operator, Laurence Lau [Hong Kong]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kudos to our international group of commentators, Liliek Sudirahardjo [Indonesia], Rodal Frank [Norway], Shirley Ybarra [USA], Martin Johnson [Canada]|pg||
mb|2C|nt|woozle: I know that I'm commentating the open, not the seniors, when this North hand opens 1C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and thx to you also Al |pg||
mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|woozle: I assume that 2S is intermediate or something...it's a very wet effort if it's weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: Al are the best I belive after the mic slams for Roland:)|pg||
nt|westjava: ty vmuch Al, Shirley, Martin, Rodal, Lawrence Lau (operator) and all spectators|pg||
nt|rodal f: On at the max|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might not find this save|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@C are a good sac|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: South will probably just blackwood his way into a slam|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|woozle: 6NT is best (proof against 5-0 hearts) but we'll forgive other slams|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a very big victory|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|woozle: The NS auction at the other table lost its way, as did this one|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|woozle: Very undisciplined effort from South...blackwood should be like an affadavit to bid slam if you're not off two fast tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one hit an iceberg apparently|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|raghavan: last deal game for EW  GL to them|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks again all and see you again tomorrow @H|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|westjava: will be 8 imps for Indonesia|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond lead was beating hand, but really no reason to find the lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec told. @D lead and ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy to see from here,  not so easy at the table |pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember more vugraph from Macau today and San Remo Italy European Nationals|pg||
