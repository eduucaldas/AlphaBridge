nt|haans: but not good pairs|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: no; too aggressive with E; should let partner make move|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|danilo1: but what I dislike more ... once I opened 1NT, I would also stand pass over reopening Dble ... let partner breeze too|pg||

nt|haans: ye assume that|pg||
nt|chthonic: What, 1NT?|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, 2@S pass-pass-pass (lets not consider neg. DBle by South) will be probably better result for NS than 130 |pg||
nt|chthonic: or the double?|pg||
nt|haans: 1 see ending in 2@D|pg||
nt|chthonic: The double.  Thanks.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D costly|pg||
nt|chthonic: Without competition, 1NT might have fetched a spade lead and a really good score|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|chthonic: When playing transfer responses over takeout doubles, the doubling side needs specific understandings of responses -- including both a double of the transfer suit and "raises"|pg||

nt|aupillon: In 7 i have to count 14 tricks on my hand, in MP's to bid it|pg||

nt|aupillon: the 4/4 fit in club, guys ( I have nothing agains E/W). It's for the bidding pleasure|pg||
nt|rnmalik: give this hand to EW and comments would be same:)|pg||

mc|13|nt|aupillon: cheers all after these 15 days in the beautiful Italy !:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: someone kidding? ... 7@C is easy on any lead ... just ruff 1 @D , discard 1H on @S and hand is high|pg||

nt|aupillon: Trust Rashed|pg||
nt|danilo1: and 6NT is 12 tricks also (I would not guess @D) |pg||
