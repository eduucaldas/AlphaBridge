mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rv: all action happened in the other table, no real reason for NS here to look for points|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though S might give it a thought....if N has A@h rather than KJ.... 6 is an excellent bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i believe that id N had this he'd have encourgae with a cuebid over 3@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: *if|pg||
nt|rv: if North had cue bid South might have been tempted|pg||
nt|ady: dont think n/s can be optimistic at this table either    no points in|pg||
nt|rv: is Alon actually thinking here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's hand needs to see an initiative from partner to justify bidding a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: Alan has a tank of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: rspecially hen trailing so much|pg||
nt|rv: I don't think he can guess so much carnage happened at the other table|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's trying to think about hands that his P in north won't cue-bid in that worth the slam try|pg||
nt|lestergold: south likes his Kc his 6 spades his ace diamonds he has much to tank about|pg||
nt|buddyshah: my guess they will try if they think they are trailing heavy, 5 also looks safe.|pg||
nt|ady: if in a slam  better from north hand    could play 6NT     just need to bring the spades in   no worry about losing 2 hearts on the lead|pg||
nt|ady: 5 not all that safe on heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: safe in practice|pg||
nt|rv: my guess is he will pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: couth wopuld insert the j on a heart lead of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's either 5@c or Pass from S... i don't think he has any "turn of the match" state of mind now|pg||
nt|rv: if the same hand had come up in other table for Israeli pair they would have surely bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|ady: certainly wont be aware the match has gone as badly as it has|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|yuval10: i'm quite assure he'll be very disappointed to see that he lost 3 double-digit swings on boards which looks like rather ordinery|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|ady: will know Q@S  is missing   but does have 6|pg||
nt|buddyshah: so south thinks bd 21 and 17 cost them|pg||
nt|yuval10: now they'll stop in 5@s|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|yuval10: I think if you make a slam try, RKCB isn't the best of choices....|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has put them off bidding it for a reason best known to himself|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is better because you might miss AK@h|pg||
nt|rv: Sridhar didn't want to risk slam swing on a non @h lead, hence he Xed:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this bidding thye heart trick was unlikely to dissappear more likely that the non making slam would disappear|pg||
mb|5N|nt|yuval10: David Smartly want to play from his side|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has been warned to right side the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: of course he doesn't know E has only the A and not the Q... very good bid|pg||
nt|buddyshah: excellent bid |pg||
nt|lestergold: however has soutgh understood this?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: another tank perhaps?|pg||

nt|ady: very slow pace to the match|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: J@d lead probably|pg||
nt|rv: Sridhar also could not have been aware of the match situation, so it is a bit surprising that he Xed to protect against a huge possible swing rather than take a fair shot at ...|pg||
nt|rv: beating the slam|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

nt|ady: I cant see how north could know of 19 h.c.p wshen the auction had rfeached the 5 level    apparantly 1@C  just normal opening   and then a support double    cant see he could have ...|pg||
nt|ady: done anything more than 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5hbid could be made on quite a bit less than that |pg||
nt|rv: and also to organizers for organising the Vu graph and BBO/Roland for working out the logistics|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its a judgement matter David at the end of the day and a hand evaluation matter in the light of the whole auction|pg||
