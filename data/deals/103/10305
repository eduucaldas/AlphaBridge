nt|sybarra: gm all |pg||
mb|1H|nt|nubmaster: Hi all and welcome, will be interesting to see the Hackett brothers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Typical modern light opening here and we will probably see a landing in 3NT.|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D    south?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David |pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no room for -en in Christiansen, so we will see Christians|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
mb|2C|an|.|nt|pelu: not so light - 6 losers - ok opening|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  a make for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think n/s play a club system, however I find 1 @D an unusual opening |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C = diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play transfer advances|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: http://www.macauabm.com/46th_pabf/|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w  can save in 6@H for -800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told they have some canape elements in their system |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Please repeat the bidding...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ciao again Eugenio :)|pg||
nt|werge: hi from here also|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy, Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||

mb|2S|nt|justin c: y, they are both imaginative players, and very nice guys|pg||
nt|werge: Here|pg||
nt|ady: be interesting to know what 3@C showed|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hans |pg||
nt|roswolf: hi shirley|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Shirley of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Welcome to this match from group Q, leading Apteker (74 VPs) vs Welland third (53 VPs)|pg||
nt|werge: I´ve seen worse 4 @H-contracts|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome to this match between two teams in the qualifying positions at the moment, but close enough to the cut off line that a loss here could be a serious blow|pg||
nt|werge: The lead is safing trick number 7 for East - can´t misguess the @S-suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland, Shirley, Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|patricck: EW can make 3NT, but bidding it isn't certain|pg||

nt|pelu: hi Jordan and Urban - US - Sweden- Denmark - good cocktail :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3nt by south at the other table|pg||
nt|werge: Should lead to 3 NT with 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: yes it is :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4-2 fit played very well in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnc: The Apteker team is a mixed of South Africa and Sweden|pg||
pc|c8|nt|werge: But there might be a danger - only give away ONE red trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jean |pg||
pc|c4|nt|werge: The job is easier with North as declarer|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jean|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we know what the 3 @C was?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: vProoyen-Verhees play an Italian based strong club with canape opening bids|pg||
nt|patricck: the play shouldn't take long, 2 imps to harangozo|pg||
nt|andyv:  Roland, did W have 1@S available or was that also a transfer?|pg||
nt|patricck: 1 imp sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk3: Hello Calle and Avram|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi Roland and Avram|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: I prefer the OR auction.  There, N rebid 3@C over 2@H and S bid the 3NT.|pg||
nt|werge: East knows, that South has 9 easy tricks|pg||

nt|hantveit: Now south will be pushed to make it. He must take the diamond finesse. I cannot see other ways to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: No other way |pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe south could go wrong if east ducked the heart lead?|pg||
nt|werge: No - he would just fines in @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C would be transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: name for west is STEGAROIU.... BBO nick is pisoy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|april7: either W plays S having the ace of @H or might endplay N to lead away from K of @S, I thing he will choose the later|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: E I mean |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: Verhees only in 5 so he could take the club finesse |pg||
pc|d6|nt|hantveit: he definately should do that :)|pg||
nt|ady: showing long diamonds   - but undefined strength?|pg||
nt|sybarra: which was off |pg||

pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: No, 1@S would be natural|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: - and to win|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a 1-round force|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But since Jens is that strong, he can afford to show his longer suit first|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Martin Wüst from Germany|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and Avram|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt again - but some work|pg||
nt|ady: cant see the problem of playing on spades first|pg||
nt|sybarra: E returned a club |pg||
nt|werge: Oh - even 110|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is something wrong with the spelling of North's name. I'll find out how|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nubmaster: south will be looking for slam here, dont you think? nice cards though|pg||
nt|sybarra: Lets try that website instead of PABF   (sorry)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|werge: This double - just what East was hoping for|pg||
nt|werge: East has 13 loosers|pg||
nt|justin c: if this is a penalty double it looks quite aggressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: No majors call by E.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S is a 40% chance that doesn't make today, however the imp chart for teams encourages you to bid vulnerable games, even at those odds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|april7: on careful defence S should go down in 4@H losing 2@S and 2 @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 1NT, 2NT, 3@C?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C it is|pg||
nt|haans: nothing is really good|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make up to 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: north should surely pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: What has South showed - to me it can just as well go for a 15-17 as for 12-14|pg||
nt|andyv:  choice of games|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of points for n/s but need to stay quietly in game|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nubmaster: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: Zimmerman is ranked  1 and WH is tied for second at moment |pg||
nt|jeanhari: this will just make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hegedus|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There it is|pg||
nt|andyv:  upside down n:)|pg||
nt|patricck: need to stay in 4@H, both 3NT and 5@D would be unlucky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they stop in game I wonder|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: I like the pas from East - 5-5 in major, but too weak - 2@D (Michael) only help opp to find the right play|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: I learned: In the middle = 14-16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Hungarians did in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: East has an easy defence here|pg||
nt|pelu: to bid 2@D = hi opp - can I help u .)|pg||
nt|ady: with K@C onside  had they been breaking 3NT would have made |pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: Looks like 3nt can be made EV Hans? 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades and one heart. |pg||
nt|patricck: nicely done|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes judged to a T|pg||
nt|andyv:  quality of E @h suit made bidding on precarious|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: yes, in pairs you ca be more agressive but no reason to act here...|pg||
nt|werge: West ducks the @H-lead, and best for defence will now be a @S-shiftm killing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe not |pg||

nt|andyv:  E didn't even bother to cue @ss|pg||
nt|patricck: should be routine not to finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Søren Christiansen always takes his time. He is a very competent declarer. Was in the Danish team that won the bronze medal at the Olympoics in Rhodes in 1996|pg||
nt|patricck: but position of A@C would mean declarer is safe in any case|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: If North continues @H, 9 tricks look safe|pg||
nt|hantveit: and south is not overtaking, he might overtake with K|pg||
nt|werge: Sout´s hesitation shows West, that she has K-x|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: In you unblock the King, West is home|pg||
nt|ady: but that would have beden a lucky make|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, good point. And his partner...|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes hard to govdown here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk3: 128 teams are divided into 22 groups. First three from each group will qualify for Swiss A after five rounds. The rest will play in Swiss B. 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32)|pg||
nt|werge: Over now 400 E/W|pg||
nt|werge: What´s problem - with @H 4-3 yoy just loose 4 red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: you|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: the 2@D in Open = 2@HX by East!|pg||
nt|jcwla: I paid my entry fee, I am in there helping them out at these colors. :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR east plays 2@hx|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - 5...|pg||

pc|hK|nt|nubmaster: just after a cue-bid showing M's|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nubmaster: perhaps 2@c wass conventional by EW...?|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding the double - you have an open bridge-book for playing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: At the other table W plats 1NT doubled|pg||
nt|nubmaster: plays|pg||
nt|werge: In fact, the @S Jack is saving a lot for E/W|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: rather easy to see that there are 2 tricks in @d|pg||
nt|werge: But home now|pg||
nt|werge: claim|pg||
nt|hantveit: The contract can always be made, if south is not overtaking the hearts, dec can take the first trick and play diamonds. THAT wuold be a prize play :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|werge: First trick very interesting in this 3 NT...|pg||
nt|patricck: these two teams are tied for 14th=, but just 3 victory points ahead of the cut line|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: Jens Auken was also in the team, but they were not partners|pg||

nt|werge: OK 7 IMPS then|pg||
nt|nubmaster: well played|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 well deserved IMPs there :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in 6 vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 10, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: most don't. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|werge: Flat boards now and then means = good bridge|pg||
nt|hantveit: Interesting hands NS|pg||
nt|werge: I open 1 @H - the "less bad"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You will see them practise a lot on BBO, not least in the JEC mathes. Usernames are sac and jauken|pg||
nt|Walddk4: matches  even|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: and easy 4@s here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ironic i think :) they were lucky... 5 or 10 out seemed more reasonable|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for 1@H here?|pg||
nt|werge: But in France no 1 @H-opening, I thins|pg||
nt|sybarra: very strong field in the tourney |pg||
mb|3N|nt|hantveit: South has a 5 loser hand. North a 6 loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: That´s why he should have won the @c trick earlier and not be squeezed on the @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|desert: not really.....Being vul and facing a passed pd i prefer pass|pg||
nt|hantveit: I agree Hans, I prefer IH also. The hand is too strong to open 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 6), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead impossible to find|pg||
pc|cT|nt|patricck: very straightforward and correct bidding, but not a pleasant spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They stopped in 1NT next door after a strong 1@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nubmaster: 3NT by north after showing @s support in the OR...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: showing 3c support?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: and even that contract did not make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Same lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  may be forced to play hearts correctly for this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But declarer will likely use his entry to dummy to finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT can be made double dummy, but only double dummy, declarer is very unlikely to play for Qxx of hearts offside and AQ of spades with a doubleton diamond |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d spots make leaving entry tempting|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|werge: Seems, that West (and East) have overbid their hands|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: N can't imagine such a weak hand with his partner|pg||
nt|pelu: dont push to hard - u risk to push op in ¤@s - making :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: weak nt opening by E and 3@S the contract in OR|pg||
nt|patricck: very aggressive by East in particular, game is not good, though we have all seen worse....  not even close to making on this layout of course|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnc: South is not so interested in 3NT with this weak hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Balicki Zmudzinski in 6@D on board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A discouraging spade perhaps, the 8 or the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a "correct way to play @H's? if so its now |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: not that great a contract   need spade break plus only to lose 1 diamond trick|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no but the easthand wont pas any invitation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I know Søren too well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  it would seem that you need to play for Qxx in order to have a chance|pg||
pc|c8|nt|werge: I find Wests transfer-bid worse of all - he has nothing but his good health|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has been  employed at my bridge centre for 16 years|pg||
pc|cK|nt|werge: West will start in his BEST minor|pg||
nt|werge: Oh no...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why the @C shift..tap might have been better (not that it matters) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/kjqlr9  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|h2|nt|patricck: yes, I'm not familiar enough with the partnership style to assign blame  :)  but certainly someone overbid |pg||
nt|werge: Worse is, that minus 2 will take several minutes to reach|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hantveit: We are all waiting for the next hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  finesse only works if qxxx is with E....if Qxx, doesn't matter who has that holding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As a spectator rightly points out, the Danish declarer in the other room had a certain route to 7 tricks, but had a blind spot|pg||
nt|patricck: finessing the J works against Qxx and Qxxx with East, while AK and small only works against Qxx in either hand, I think that gives the finesse an 8% edge|pg||
pc|c5|nt|werge: A clever spec: Only @S-lead beats & NT by North|pg||
nt|werge: Double-dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 4), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: 1 @S passed out in OR|pg||
nt|patricck: might take 9 tricks with a safety play in trumps, but if you are in 4@H you can't take that line|pg||
nt|patricck: and still too difficult to dispose of diamonds anyway|pg||

nt|werge: More or less sure NOT to play|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hantveit: :) will probably not be a lot of action here. |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks routine for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead best|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: 4@S and also 5@D is possible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: witn that lucky @d split - 3nt on NS|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4@h by NS here... but they wont find it?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like this 1@S opening?|pg||
nt|ady: will have time for an overtrick of a diamond lead    but could be held to 3 on a sspade lead|pg||
nt|haans: but kind of boring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: keeps it to 9 tricks, otherwise 10|pg||
nt|werge: But E/W in @D seems fair enogh|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|nubmaster: 1 level is ok here.. |pg||
nt|patricck: how to stay out of game with 25 points, or how to steal a 9th trick in hearts if you do bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Should we repeat the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tiny.cc/eegFD  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||

nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a question |pg||
nt|patricck: oops, only 3 spades, need 2 hearts :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: aI open a lot of 11 HCP-hands - but this time closer to pass - bad suit - no Aces and problems to show the good @Cs|pg||
nt|werge: Sure East will bid NOW|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, much to West's disappointment|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may get the @D lead now |pg||
nt|werge: Must be FORCING|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and 3!nt is better than 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Marty Bergen believes, "Virtually any hand that is worth opening will contain at least two quick tricks."|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West passed in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who can lead for aqx of club? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The fact that Jens opened 1@C may persuade North never to lead them|pg||
nt|patricck: nice intermediates in the West hands, but too many honours in short suits....I like the pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has two chances though|pg||
pc|h6|nt|justin c: I think they play that 2@C is either natural and GF or a 9-13 @S raise|pg||
nt|nubmaster: He has showed 9-13 3c support and 5c @c|pg||
nt|justin c: presumably 2@D asked and 2@S showed the good raise|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: did they forget to check aces in CR?|pg||
nt|hantveit: No need, I checked the spectators - no Danish :)|pg||
nt|haans: the use 1@C-1@S as a relay bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: S has to start wildly signaling clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jens will surely return a heart at trick 2, then hope|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He won't get the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: S never in |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but they will have the chance to switch when in with the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another option, and a losing one, is to enter dummy with a diamond and finesse @S10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is a legitimate chance|pg||
nt|patricck: that is what happened in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: I see the first 8 tricks for West -let´s see|pg||
nt|patricck: the cards are friendly for EW|pg||
nt|werge: Lucky, that South has the 8...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: looks llike diamond lead|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: q of @D lead looks a lot more interesting from W  |pg||
nt|andyv:  can always hope @c blocks|pg||
nt|roswolf: the psychological attempt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jens opting for the deceptive line|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jeanhari: so looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or to W I should say |pg||
nt|jeanhari: sorry, 10|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nubmaster: good lead|pg||
nt|werge: Why keep the @D-entry in North - South is short of entries|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|werge: Might bring him 8 tricks, if he plays @c immediately|pg||
nt|jcwla: West might also have handled this hand differently.  An action double instead of 3@S would be my preference having bid 2@S on the previous round.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In OR south bid 1NT showing @hs and a m and thet were in 3@h but east bought the contract there with 3@s.. another push here?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: now N shall play @dK or continue with @s|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, that was a bit sleepy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nubmaster: Q of @c now|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|patricck: it felt as though the K@H might have been a good card at trick 2, but that needs the 9@H to come down, which doesn't happen either|pg||

nt|sybarra: sort of frozen out of both hands  |pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: north should have reflected a little more at trick 2|pg||
mc|9|nt|patricck: North should ask himself why declarer is playing back hearts to let him set up his suit....the only answer possible is that his tricks are set to cash and they must be in @S and ...|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: 2@H is weak|pg||

nt|nubmaster: dont like 1nt with 5-2 in M, atleast not in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point andy|pg||
nt|patricck: always easier to find a logical reason when you can already see the answer, but since the KQ@S and KQ@D are both in dummy the logic seems sound|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: will want to stay as low as possible here i'd think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Normally a little less than a standard weak two opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: are they playing strong @c? So 1@d is nat or 11-13 NT ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The advantage of playing weak jump shifts is that a 2@H rebid becomes invitational and a jump to 3@H game-forcing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: careful play needed, ruffing @S twice in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  2@H     1@H  3@H|pg||

nt|hantveit: good start for dec.|pg||
nt|werge: I would like to play this contract - if I might now and then play from the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another advantage is that it takes room away from the opponents|pg||

pc|h4|nt|hantveit: I think it generally is a bad idea to lead single when you have 4 trumps. Better to attack dia.|pg||
nt|werge: South has only ONE problem - she has no tricks...|pg||
nt|hantveit: lol, a well known problem to us all|pg||
nt|werge: Could have been worse!|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: finess in @c and crossruff  with so solid @h|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: A Roland slam here.|pg||

nt|hantveit: I forgot the bidding in hand 2. East did open pass with a pass hand, so pass system was out the window. :-)|pg||

nt|werge: Could (should) have made this|pg||
nt|nubmaster: another push|pg||
nt|nubmaster: both decl had the opportunity|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes, 6@c makes easily made but imagine south leads a small @h :)|pg||
nt|werge: So Nederland has doubled their lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: Another imp out |pg||
nt|werge: Hard battle for losing 1 IMP|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcwla: Bamberger's on the board with the overtrick IMP on 16.|pg||
nt|werge: Regarding to a spec-voice, East is probably a women|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2@H X and 2@S ?|pg||
nt|pelu: good adwise to S: dont bid :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Let's use up lots of space when we have some points and might actually want to explore for the best contract...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: the action ended by 3@c in OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/mdao4h  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|2C|an|forcing|nt|hantveit: Looks like 11 tricks in a heart contract.|pg||
nt|werge: I would not be very surprised to see a 650 N/S-score here - and a very fast board|pg||
nt|werge: Not much, vulnerable 1 @S...|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: possible slam for NS here|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 3@C in East??? - not me - but I am old :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: a nt game to stay out of  |pg||
nt|werge: Confirmed - we only knew it after the brave 3 @H-opening...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: After seven rounds of Swiss (this is round 6), 27 teams from Swiss A and 5 from Swiss B qualify for the KO phase (Round of 32) tomorrow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Most notable result was that Team Lavazza did not make it to Swiss A|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will take a different bidding sequence to 3 nt |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|justin c: a transfer break from north would help them get there|pg||
nt|jcwla: No.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not in teams...|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 1spade is ok.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|werge: 800 - when I was young|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can see 8 tricks where is 9th?|pg||
nt|haans: mamy always said pass with 8|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c artificial?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and meaning what? |pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: difficult to bid against a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|werge: Should be a standard 650 - or so|pg||
nt|nubmaster: west doubled 2@h at the other table, easy 680 there|pg||
nt|nubmaster: and i'm not "that" old :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: when you were young, they had a different dbl table...|pg||
nt|hantveit: so not 800 :)|pg||
nt|ady: escap a heart lead and 3NT can make|pg||
mb|3C|nt|patricck: West has a very big hand considering how much everyone else is bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: The double of 2 @H ist very clever - for opponents|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the other dutch team high in the rankings lost exactly the same big swings on board 1 and 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just a game-forcing relay I presume. Some play that|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 + clubs gf  I am told |pg||
nt|patricck: getting NT from North was important, a diamond could beat 3NT if played by South|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: y|pg||
nt|werge: Service-double we call them|pg||
nt|sybarra: best hand at the table I only used my "blue card" |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nt is rightsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Current standings in the group: Apteker 87, Welland 86, Begijntje 79, McLeish 78, Dhampur S...M... 52|pg||
nt|desert: Hot X.......who likes it?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andrei Varlan|pg||
nt|sybarra: just a different way to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: but similar |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the other room they had another GF gadget, 1NT over 1@H. That is game-forcing. Very economical|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what do they bid with non GF|pg||
nt|sybarra: just pass? |pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S PRESUMABLY|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes sense (given the system) Geof |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jeanhari: some work for the coaches :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|aupillon: Hello all. Tks Roland|pg||
nt|hantveit: Hi Andrei|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - no 800, 1.100|pg||
nt|sybarra: start clubs or @H's? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: They often pass with 9 or less because the opening is limited to 15. Also, they have a 2@C gadget for invitational hands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many different hand types|pg||
nt|patricck: still need to knock out @C first, so as to have enough entries to lead spades up twice|pg||
nt|sybarra: and so fascinating to see them all in action!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a risk of going down if you play for diamonds to be 4-4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and spurn the @SKJ onside chance|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nubmaster: it wont be anything else but another push, third in a row|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure no X from me - I would wait and X 5@C :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @c now and decl has 3 @d loosers|pg||
nt|desert: Fat chance....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you consider the 3@H advance to be game forcing?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: one on @s but still 2...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: almost gameforcing but they know N has up to 16|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|werge: Should be forbidden|pg||
nt|nubmaster: for us specs yes :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: thinking exactly the same Jean |pg||
nt|andyv:  spade lead in OR made this hand much easier for declarer (W dbld a 2@S bid by S)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: nice defense|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe @D4 now is too revealing|pg||
nt|patricck: absolutely, declarer very likely to go down. In the other room an artificial 2@S was doubled by West so they got off to the wrong lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They lead 4th against NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: first @S finesse coming |pg||
pc|s6|nt|desert: hmmm|pg||
nt|aupillon: If 2 women play like men, these French ladies does|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: Board 8, pls|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: no extra trick but still nice|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @D9 or 10 would have been deceptive, but then again from K109x Christiansen would likely have led the 10|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  coded !9D lead would have made it harder to read|pg||
nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
nt|patricck: excellent declarer play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: -2 and next!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes very well done|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|april7: -3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: does he finesse @D again?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: only 8 after a heart lead so good bidding..|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: on the heart switch may be worried to take 2nd diamond finesse   may settle for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|jeanhari: he will count the hearts still left|pg||
nt|haans: 4|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will finesse if 3|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so zimmermans discard (spade or heart) will make a two trick difference in a way|pg||
nt|haans: play @HJ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: taking his time|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|patricck: and the reward for that excellent play?   LOSE 2 imps  :(|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|nt|patricck: the @C discard was crucial|pg||
nt|roswolf: twas ever thus|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days are like that |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h8|nt|haans: rehi|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not much happened|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|jeanhari: cant see him tae the finesse|pg||
nt|jeanhari: k|pg||
nt|haans: spade K has been played|pg||
nt|jeanhari: think zimmermann discarded spade first|pg||
nt|haans: only 1 imp to fuss about|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they were in 3 nt in the other room making|pg||
nt|jeanhari: v prooijen must be ALMOST sure de Q is on his left|pg||
nt|ady: going to lose imps whatever   in game making OR|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|haans: even if he is wrong he may still get @DA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Zmu-Balicki lucky in 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: spade lead there also |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so this two trick problem is reduced to only one imp|pg||
nt|ady: yes  just a toss up   spade or h eart|pg||

mb|p|nt|aupillon: in my youger days...:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nubmaster: pass? |pg||
nt|hantveit: oh my God - two of them...|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3NT looks difficult as well, even though it made in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is forcing for them. It is not for many players|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: strange pass from W - but maybe only East have the right to overcell :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: you both are talking about younger days... :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: probably no big swing here, playing for the overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: why 2@C???|pg||
nt|werge: East unblocks and has an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|werge: Why not @S Queen.....?|pg||
nt|werge: That´s sleepy bridge - take it or leave it|pg||
nt|werge: North has minors, so S should find the @c-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, he bid 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it does but the defence are forced to open up suits because of the distribution|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: How would you bid the N hand over 1NT?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Ducked by N|pg||
nt|aupillon: eventually|pg||
nt|werge: Problem is, we cannot remember what is going on now - only the past|pg||
nt|sybarra: need an early @D hook |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a very delicate hand to play and I can assure you that it will take time|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm still not past trick one|pg||
nt|roswolf: are there enough tricks i can see how 8 may be made but not 9 - it may take a defensive error|pg||
nt|patricck: I think that 3NT would be dead on a small @S lead and continuation, but yes, the defence has problems if they start with a club|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should be able to win trick and ask S to lead again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: where there is 8.....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: E slightly surprised now?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Rule of 11 revealed that North has no card higher than the 7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: 11-7 = 4   Christiansen can see all 4 in his and partner's hand. Accordingly, North can't beat the 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It is not often that this rule comes into play, but here is an example|pg||
nt|andyv:  revealing @h discard|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the 8 of spades may come to declarer's rescue but it is nip and tuck|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I should have said  11-6 = 5   and declarer can see all 5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or even 11-5 = 6  and he can see all 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Doesnøt matter. The thing is that North can't beat the 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||

nt|hantveit: The other table played 3H -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sorry all,  my time just got crunched ...see you at the PABF  tonight |pg||
pc|h9|nt|werge: Poor South - his last entry|pg||
nt|jcwla: This will not take the Romex award.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|pelu: a small @S - but still a danger of blocking the suit|pg||
nt|nubmaster: more action in OR, there W bid 2@d over 1NT (multi), N doubled and west 3@d (preempt in M). south doubled and west bid 3@s and Smirinov as south bid 4@d by a long thought and North ...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ended it all by 4@h|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|werge: We not only get flat boards - same contract, same declarer. If only one pair would make some transfers...|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: But what else can he do?|pg||

nt|werge: I vote for West, 4 @H, 620|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 5@c a bit saner|pg||
nt|patricck: the lucky spade position will allow 5@C to make, but because EW can force in @H it isn't enough to allow 4@S to make|pg||

mb|3C|nt|chessmaste: 7NT is also easy|pg||

nt|Walddk4: It takes time for Szegedi to count all his keycards it seems|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|werge: Who is E/W - maybe indiscrte, but their family names are hidden|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@D overcall would have led to a different contract.|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, West has an abvious 4H bid with only 5 losers and south giving away the spade K.|pg||
nt|werge: In a match like this, a 7 IMP victory deserves an award|pg||
nt|aupillon: next ( that's Joey silver phrase)|pg||
nt|hantveit: Well, it has not been many interesting hands. Very difficult to get lost|pg||
nt|werge: South opened 2 @S in OR - good luck|pg||
nt|aupillon: Gimme a break : Soulet - Lebel didn't call THE GAME in ! h ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: hearts*|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would pass 3H also. |pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 points and 9 losers - why would I bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be a success for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah then has south forgotten?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hegedus knows that 5@C does not exist by looking at his cards, so he also knows that partner did not take 4@D as rkcb|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@C could be 2 key cards and the Q@C couldn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Adrian Thomas - Wales - Gay Keavney - Ireland|pg||
nt|nubmaster: lucky for NS the @ds break 4-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: another "support opp's" double... what's the meaning by doubling here...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It could, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In that case she should bid 7|pg||
nt|patricck: a bit unlikely to pass at his first turn tho with all that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: he, sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  S might not have passed 1@H with that holding:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|werge: 2 @S = 0-10 with clubs - so Easts best card was devaluated |pg||
nt|aupillon: eventually i play in San remo, teams. And vulnerable i go for the bonus :(|pg||
nt|hantveit: West might play heart ace and another hearts, afraid of the spade ruff.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: last hand no @S-stop - this time no @D-stop - but @D 4-3 = 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|werge: West is Thomas, East Keaveney, Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@H = the @HQ, but no outside kings, so S knows the @DK is missing|pg||
nt|justin c: Jason seems to be giving 7 a look regardless|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not 5@s to show K of @s?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|patricck: Versace will be feeling happy, defending a doubled contract with 6 trumps is always nice|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: he doesn't believe in luck|pg||
nt|april7: only @c lead might hinder|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs are saying this is a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: this depends on the lead, on a non-@C lead 6 could be right|pg||
nt|werge: After West double it´s not a 5 or 7, @C-lead is out of question|pg||
nt|hantveit: I have learned one thing from my father. Look at your cards, ask if you should bid again, if the cards says no, take a green bidding pad that says PAS and put it on the table.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N will be suprised that pard has J of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to Hungary|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q@d makes play of hand very quick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: Still 650 possible|pg||
nt|aupillon: same for me, but things changed i guess|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of need to untangle this a bit (n/s) |pg||
nt|sybarra: for max|pg||
mc|11|nt|werge: Count in @D from North, should lead South in the right direction|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess it was lucky there was an entry to that @DJ10, there didn't have to be on a different trump break|pg||

nt|nubmaster: last one|pg||
nt|justin c: another slam hand|pg||
nt|nubmaster: when in doubt, bid 3NT...|pg||
nt|werge: No big cake here|pg||
nt|hantveit: Last hand arriving, but we have not score from the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: Eugenio did we jump to bd 20? |pg||
nt|sybarra: "sorry pard" |pg||
nt|sybarra: says W |pg||
nt|patricck: VERY sorry pard :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: so v Prooijen took his 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @cs were 3-1...was never making unless E held stiff 10@c|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: lookd like an easy 4@s on NS with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: @S 2-2, how could they know in OR?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I told them|pg||
nt|werge: Nice man, Wald|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I sdaid: this grand slam makes 4 times out of 10, this is one of the 4|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 18 - only a very good defense could defeat 4@H - played by S a winner - By N @SJ to q and K - AND @S2 back to !10 and now ! = -1|pg||
nt|nubmaster: some action here? NS make 5@c...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If W believes in banging down aces, this could be a Roland Slam.|pg||
nt|sybarra: it wasnt the worse overcall in the world |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks....|pg||
mb|2H|an|.|nt|april7: 3@S I propose|pg||
nt|hantveit: there it is, 2nt -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: but on this hand it was |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now. Many thanks to Eugenio, our splendid operator in Sanremo. Well done!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|werge: OK - let´s see it this way. Do´nt bid too GOOD at this board|pg||
nt|werge: 2 NT? Do they play 18-20...?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Shirley Ybarra, Andy Vinock, Patrick Carter and Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
mb|3D|nt|april7: otherwise N might pass|pg||
nt|rnc: He took your advise!|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you |pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: hahaha... but they needed that one though... could be 13 imp here|pg||
nt|hantveit: A desperate invite?|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, but West must at least have considered a double instead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nubmaster: Are they playing lebesohl here?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe X was better |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: he even herd me|pg||
nt|brolucius: With spades agreed, instead of hearts as in the other room, N-S will surely identify that the queen of trumps is missing.|pg||
nt|werge: Bad luck to pay 13 IMP here - maybe|pg||
nt|justin c: the trouble with agreeing @S is that you get to find out the @SQ is missing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: obviously not...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Finally, our gratitude to the EBL (Ton Kooijman) and the FIGB (Massimo Ortensi) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match today in about 25 minutes|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|vugraphztj: had some problem with bbo server|pg||

nt|patricck: a pleasure, very interesting set|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph!  (he has to herd us cats ---commentators I mean) |pg||
nt|andyv:  6@s?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|nubmaster: a good convention to be used at this board, then south maybe can go further with 4@c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnc: Bye and thanks|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play the @SK and the @SJ or @SQ falls from East, you can follow Restricted Choice by finessing the @S10, which increases your chances slightly from that of a 2-2 break. |pg||
nt|patricck: This will drop Romania out of the qualifying places, but they still have time to recover..... Angelini should be able to breathe easy for the last two qualifying matches after this ...|pg||
nt|patricck: win|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|werge: IF  E/W has a 3 NT here - then East has NOT a 1 NT-opening!|pg||
nt|ady: no problems here  J@S  down in 2   and K@D laying well|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: why not? - even oif N has a semi-positiv hand, there are long way to 5@C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: might have had been more difficult with clubs 4-3 and the 8 with west|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: thx also to the specs,  helpful comments and funny also |pg||
nt|sybarra: we should be back shortly |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hantveit: well, you migh be lucky. Can have AKfifth in clubs, dia A and heart A|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|nubmaster: thanks for now... see you in a while again|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: 46% chance of making 5 spade tricks ... which would increase to 57% if one of them held the @sJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nubmaster: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: extra entr disappeared however |pg||
nt|ady: can make 10 now|pg||
nt|ady: unless diamond switch|pg||
