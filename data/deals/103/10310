nt|ritong: 16 being much smaller than 13+13|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once.  Twice in 1 session such good luck is fatal.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but I rather not to have these "lucks" too often.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, a comparison with the other room will reveal to W one of the reasons why it is not a good idea to open 2S on that hand :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: a look at the N hand  does much the same|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have a little symothy with the N opening. i would have much more if her red suits were reversed|pg||
nt|gracelin: but to open 2S with the west hand is comforming their system.  So only the system is to be blamed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, we wouldnt want to do that...|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@s=5@s4m does not force you to open, though|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|ritong: nicolette et aucassin is a medieval roman, never mind guys|pg||
nt|gracelin: so they missed an excellent 6S|pg||
nt|ritong: marshall loves to show off, that is why we like him|pg||
nt|charles_l: a lot of work in 6@s|pg||
nt|charles_l: easy in 4|pg||
nt|gracelin: after the double of 4C, the 6S contract is excellent and easy to make, probably with an overtrick.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very strong balanced hands look good to the one who holds them, but they often make it difficult to reach slam because the other hand does not have enough to be confident of how ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well the hands fit, and typically there is not much room to explore|pg||
