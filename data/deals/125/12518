nt|bessi2: hmm.. he didn't think that through...|pg||
nt|iceking: 300 is around 75% at the moment to NS|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its not an easy hand to judge..|pg||
nt|bessi2: 5@c by west good bid,  but what should it mean.. just void or exclusion blackwood.. i think just void since it is unknown whether he has only hearts or spade fit|pg||
nt|iceking: yes just void so he even almost has value for 6clubs his pd didnt dbl at 3rd level and slam looks very likelly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, but why are NS not bidding up...|pg||
nt|iceking: give pd some sub min hand qj9x x ajxxx jxx and you dont mind that much reach slam |pg||
