nt|gracelin: the Heart return was careless but luckily suth produced trump Q instead of J|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: NTU could get back points if they reach 6H here.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: admittedly, it's a tough task.|pg||
nt|gracelin: In closed room NS did us 4NT to try but still stop short.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: use|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|xenya: 6@H is lucky to make on a @D lead?|pg||
nt|gracelin: north's not opening might make the slam probe difficult.  I have seen players opening 1H/2H/3H/4H.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may simply discard on the first D trick.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, true|pg||
nt|by: somehow 4N in the other table seems like RKCB|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, and stopped short when 2 KC were missing.|pg||
nt|by: not clear what this table's auction meant ...|pg||
nt|gracelin: natural but timid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|by: i never open 2-suited bids when the major is 6 and minor is 5|pg||
nt|by: so easy to miss the 6-2 ....|pg||
nt|gracelin: some might choose to conceal the minor and open 3H or even 4H.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|by: i am afraid i am one of those guys|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am with that group, too.|pg||
nt|by: so NTU-Pac would have been even now, if they had taken all their chances|pg||
nt|gracelin: in 4H declarer may choose a safer line but cross-ruffing to 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|by: to the audience, usually 3@d is invitational and 5-5, so 3@h should be a signoff. -- and a total underbid|pg||

nt|gracelin: declarer may still come to 12 tricks with DA coming down in 3rd round, and trumps 2-2.|pg||
nt|by: declarer should at least lead a club up first|pg||
nt|by: E is welcome to ruff air|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Would have paid off here.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - despite the 3@D bid from N S was headed for slam - would he have bid 6 with two Key Cards (assume 5@C shows one)?|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, because the DA is coming down anyway.|pg||
nt|by: 3@s is pretty iffy|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can make 4S here if he guesses everything. Not many boards left, Lin and Chi.|pg||
nt|by: how does he avoid losing 2@c and 2@h?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gracelin: he can lose only 1H, andin the meantime takes 5S + 4D + 1H(or club)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: ate the 1H opening, south cannot go wrong in H|pg||
nt|gracelin: agter|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS may be shut out completely and let EW steal the hand.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|by: many people would have overcalled 1@s|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, indeed. West in other room didn't respond to the 1H opening which allowed north to come in.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jcwla: OR starting w/23 and 24 - they'll pick up our comparisons when they circle back to 13.|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, declarer still gets his CK, that's his 5th trick so it can go -3 at most |pg||
nt|by: no|pg||
nt|by: i mean if S leads the C8 when we were talking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|by: North plays the @cJ, and E has to let that win or win and have to play a black card|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, declarer must gethis CK and that's his 5th trick and only -3.  Discussion ends here.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|by: ok, my apologies for miscounting|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer already had 4 tricks in the bah and CK would be the 5th for -3.|pg||
nt|xenya: now a good chance for NTU|pg||
nt|by: Note that it is usually a good idea for S to raise directly|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|by: 1@h-2@h-4@s (exclusion RKCB)|pg||
nt|xenya: slam may well be reached here -- |pg||
nt|by: or some such|pg||
nt|gracelin: but only 2H is timid.  May worth an invitatiion even if they don't play Bergen |pg||
nt|xenya: although it does look like a bidding challenge hand|pg||
nt|by: ok, 1@h-2@c|pg||
nt|by: followed by EKC|pg||
mb|4C|an| |mb|p|nt|gracelin: I thk they will get there anyway, Just I don't quite like the 2H single raise.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|xenya: now S's hand has improved enormously|pg||
nt|by: seems like the only chance for them not to get to 6@h is a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|gracelin: South is really timid.  If 4C is a natural slam try, south could bid either 5C or 5H to show his stuff in these 2 suits.|pg||
nt|by: hence the remark about the misunderstanding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT is useless when you have a void|pg||
nt|by: i like 5@h, which says "good trumps, card for clubs"|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south thk 4C is Splinter, then 4H is understandable|pg||

nt|sharkey: agree - Not sure 1S will be able to show his hand now|pg||
nt|sharkey: *S|pg||
nt|sharkey: S is regretting his bid now...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now 4@H sounds like 3 and 3@H could be on two.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H may show stronger hand than 3@H in their system?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: I hope so -- I could see how some people could play it as weak.  You have to be able to bid 3@H with two here.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - and also invite to cue bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised S passed must have enough for slam with @CK @HQ and four trumps...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Well I did not understand the auction on 13 but it was suggested 5@C showed one keycard there, here it's zero.  Maybe it's just straight Blackwood or maybe they weren't on the same ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: page in terms of what was trump in 13 (if anything).|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case barring a misunderstanding here above 4NT the blame for this one goes to South.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Maybe they won't need five more minutes to finish this one?|pg||

nt|gracelin: indeed, 3NT might make on less perfect defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: patrick, can you make 3N?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: not if defenders don't slip.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|by: i mean assuming normal declarer and defence|pg||
nt|gracelin: East may even duck HJ to allow pnly 3 H trucks for declarer.|pg||
nt|gracelin: only 3 H tricks|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|by: maybe best is 1NT for a small plus and 6 IMPs|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|gracelin: normal defense is for eat to lead a club to the Q.  U dn't see 9 tricks from there if defenders don't make major errors.|pg||
nt|by: unclear what those are|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hard to see how 3N can be made -- even if E grabs first @H |pg||
nt|by: i mean 2@c and 2@d|pg||
nt|xenya: the defence should be VERY soft to let it through|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: on a club lead to the Q and no H duck, defenders will be under great pressure not to give declarer a trick in spade.  Need almost perfect discard and defense.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|by: clearly there is misunderstanding in the bidding ....|pg||
nt|gracelin: I thk all spade, D, C lead will doom the contract.|pg||

pc|s7|nt|gracelin: BY, I read your mind before your typong the words.|pg||

nt|gracelin: the SQ play is damaging|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: If  East had followed low then duck the HJ.  Declarer is not out of the woods yet.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, with the very favorable club position, 4S double is probably only one down.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: the QF is a 24 boards KO, so the lagging team needs to recover their deficit in the remaining 12 boards.|pg||

nt|gracelin: I thk declarer only took 11|pg||
nt|by: oh, they corrected|pg||
nt|by: this promises to be a lively board|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: however if S opens 1@C (strong), the @S fit may come to light (previous hand) |pg||
nt|gracelin: hands with a 9-card suit sould be good for both the lagging teams and spectators.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 1@S (5@D)  not unlikely|pg||
nt|by: i wonder how would it be different if N opened 1@h|pg||
nt|gracelin: according to our previous discussion, north hand is a clear cut one opening for most of us.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D can make unless it gets a club lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: I am bidding a pedestrian 5D here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is somewhat wet|pg||
nt|xenya: nightmarish hand, S's|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|by: the east hand isn't much more comfortable|pg||
nt|gracelin: but not 3D then 4D and 5D.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: I will never double this south when I meet him at the table.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Mr Lin is not an overbidder. Maybe 5@D now and a double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be cunning|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How is West supposed to find a club lead?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well, he was right in the sense that 5@D can be set and that 4@S should go down. However, I would have liked to see them beat 5@D first|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|gracelin: So south made the double dummy bid of passing 4S. both 4S and 5D cannot make.|pg||
