pc|c8|nt|jcwla: I hope so -- I could see how some people could play it as weak.  You have to be able to bid 3@H with two here.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: I dont do those "fancy" leads...they never work out for me |pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Well I did not understand the auction on 13 but it was suggested 5@C showed one keycard there, here it's zero.  Maybe it's just straight Blackwood or maybe they weren't on the same ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: sorry my mistake, a simle @H lead for ruff can beat it|pg||

nt|sharkey: Similar problem to Bd 16|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Thus some may open 1 NT if their range 15-17|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, I wud lead H too, not close.|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: the correct answer to the bidding test is 6@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the slam hand shown earlier.  6C makes but not 6S.|pg||
nt|petergill: Last board |pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|gracelin: though successful rate is not high in my earlier prediction.  I am betting they will not reach 6C here.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gracelin: south opened a very heavy 1NT.|pg||

nt|petergill: South has 18.4 points on the Kaplan and Rubens Evaluator at http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|petergill: North thinking - 4@S - or even slam try?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S non-forcing and 3@S non-forcing - tempted the unsuccessful double|pg||
nt|sybarra: in our room   we could not find the cold 6 @c  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: West doubles on the bidding.  He saw 2S as a sign-off and they later reached a game.|pg||
nt|po-s: pretty hard to get to club slam|pg||

nt|petergill: Perhaps West the doubler thought North's thinking was stretching for 4@S but it was actually thinking about a slam try!|pg||
mc|11|nt|gracelin: so CMU will recover 14  badly needed imps. |pg||

nt|othered1: if you want to play slam, it must be in @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: i'm wondering if 2@S is a forcing bid or not|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes that is best spot |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: S knows N and E have near blank hands thus no purpose in bidding with opps Vul despite 18 HCP|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile they've bid to 4@S on 19 -- |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H cue ? by N  ?    do you cooperate now?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@D is imaginative.  A last-train type cue-bid, but why.  Couldn't south be all minors?|pg||
nt|lorderic: Board 6, north didn't find the club lead and 6@S is made|pg||

nt|sharkey: As Jordan pointed out very fortunate hand for EW - exchange @H9 and @H10 the hand will go down|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|s2|pg||

nt|lorderic: for N to bid 6@C even if 4@D is natural|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4@S down 1 on 19 -- so 6 to NTU-PAC and it's a 6-IMP match with 5 to compare.|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: My main partnership (with Paul Gosney) plays that after 1@H (1NT), 2@C by responder shows 5+ spades. So I would bid 2@C over 1NT. |pg||
nt|gracelin: that's a good convention for this deal.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: Lacking that agreement, 2@S by South directly over 1NT is possible. |pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|s4|pc|c6|pg||

pc|s9|mc|8|nt|petergill: If there are no screens and South thought fro some time, South does best strategically not to follow up the pause with a Pass, as a slow Pass puts partner under ethical restriction|pg||

nt|gracelin: good advice, Peter.|pg||
nt|petergill: Qualifying scores were http://club.ntu.edu.tw/ club20084/maj_cup.php |pg||
