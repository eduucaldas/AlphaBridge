mb|2D|nt|petergill: on the last board I mean |pg||
nt|gracelin: a very close double of 2S in close room.  Declarer might have made it .|pg||
mb|2H|nt|by: we heard that there were 50 IMPs charged the other room, as the fate of contract ping-ponged back and force|pg||
nt|by: back and forth|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS reach 3@D, East might double|pg||
nt|petergill: and will West sit such a Double?|pg||
nt|by: this should be a spade raise of some sort but ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|petergill: To me, 2@H simply shows @H. I think West plans to bid more over 3@D. |pg||
nt|by: it's supposed to be a "good" raise -- and it must have been a good raise |pg||
nt|by: since East blithely tried for game|pg||
nt|gracelin: still don't see the 2NT bid.|pg||
nt|petergill: South does best to pass, but might bid 3@C or 3@D|pg||
nt|petergill: if 3@C or 3@D, West does best to pass, but will probably bid something|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H forcing perhaps?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|by: no, 2@h is a good raise of spades, using cue-bid doubles (X=@h|pg||
nt|gracelin: south has best to start doubling.|pg||
nt|by: I think there were no misunderstanding, just overbidding|pg||
nt|petergill: Ok, so everyone except North has bid a lot|pg||
nt|petergill: North's turn now ....|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north passes now, East may go to 4S :)|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|petergill: Then North knows what to do to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Trump lead is best, as it happens|pg||
pc|s6|nt|by: class!|pg||
nt|petergill: Great lead by South|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: South had @H and @C held, NS bid @D, so lead trumps as NS have all the other suits held|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shirley will send a cmmentator over to replace me.  I am going to take a break until the final in the afternoon.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would have paid off here.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - despite the 3@D bid from N S was headed for slam - would he have bid 6 with two Key Cards (assume 5@C shows one)?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Heart will not be beating as fast in 5@H as in 6@H.|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 25 nice HP for NS by all off. Any nice way to get stuf home by best defence?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|by: yes, a spade lead, heart hook, and another spade.  easy :)|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead might make 3NT tough|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|by: i forecast a push|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Got time for the @D set up now|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has only 8 tricks if he goes for @d, so a low heart towards the queen is perhaps the best start|pg||
nt|by: toward?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: Putting in @S10 makes the defence tougher|pg||
nt|by: yes, a heart toward the queen is best if east will follow|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: Finessing into the safe hand, removing the entry to the long spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Club switch still causes problems|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|by: note the sneaking 1@d opening by the NTU north in the other room, typically BTU teams don't do that ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @H not as threatening as club|pg||
nt|rodal f: And didn't find so now a push|pg||
nt|by: still may be 1 IMP to SCU|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: A and the hook?|pg||
nt|by: enough entries here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|by: no need to forego the hook here if you ask me|pg||
nt|petergill: Clear @D's and @HQ is the entry to dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|by: no, you have to forgo that hook, excuse me, i have a brainloss error|pg||
nt|petergill: @H lead at other table at Trick 1, when club opening lead would have been the better guess|pg||
mc|10|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: OR starting w/23 and 24 - they'll pick up our comparisons when they circle back to 13.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: a typical 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Looks like a @S partial here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Kristian is not our operator - the profile has not been changed...|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing looks great for ns |pg||
nt|sybarra: I open the hand 1 @C   |pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D looks strange to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @D looks more precision like|pg||
nt|lorderic: perhaps he wants to avoid a @D lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: good pt. Kuo |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: even @D's not great ....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: I'd wonder about that tactic in 4th seat.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @HQ will be an expensive lead....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: trying to coach a bid out of N |pg||
nt|sybarra: well here "we" are |pg||
nt|lorderic: Wang was my teammate in 2006|pg||
nt|sybarra: so is young also I take it |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: apparently Kristian, Danish operator, is a popular name in Taiwan, may be Roland's doing.... - appearing in both rooms....|pg||
nt|sybarra: still take out |pg||
nt|lorderic: we played World Youth Bridge Cham. in Thailand, under 21|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: not usre I will bid again with S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but also not sure what I would do over 3 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: except beat it |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|jcwla: This one will not take long.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lorderic: E wisely didn't lead a spade, but didn't find the best @C lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this needed a double-dummy @C lead to be in danger|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|othered1: looks right to overtake and play something rounded back|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be concerned (re leading @C) that  N also had clubs |pg||
nt|othered1: overtake with 10?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: poor N has no entry after ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: but undoubled |pg||

pc|h7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: now a mess |pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: not a ruff?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|capercliff: south doubled 3 times then raised partner|pg||
nt|capercliff: guess he liked his hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: well I mentioned before you arrived,  I dont mind the X's but to raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: NOT for me |pg||
pc|c5|nt|capercliff: i agree, but he doesnt have to play it as it happens|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,   :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we arrived "undoubled" |pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W were expecting much more distribution, no way to double|pg||
nt|capercliff: but it is a sticky contract anyway |pg||
nt|lorderic: declare can make 4 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we end playing on this one also LOL|pg||

nt|petergill: I play that if you RKCB or 1430 and find only one of the five keycards/trump queen missing, you are dutybound to bid the slam. Otherwise, you bid the hand some other way - in my ...|pg||
nt|petergill: style, you never use RKCB or 1430 then sign off with only one keycard/trump queen missing|pg||

nt|lorderic: let's see if NS can get there|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Four card support should be shown IMMEDIATELY in my opinion.|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - Not sure 1S will be able to show his hand now|pg||
nt|sharkey: *S|pg||
nt|sharkey: S is regretting his bid now...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now 4@H sounds like 3 and 3@H could be on two.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: just bid it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H may show stronger hand than 3@H in their system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is not the worst 13 I have ever seen (in S)|pg||
nt|capercliff: not an auction for a @h lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and far from best either |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: might he play a, q of sp?|pg||
nt|capercliff: i might lead K@s here, and lose imps of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: he= declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I hope so -- I could see how some people could play it as weak.  You have to be able to bid 3@H with two here.|pg||
mb|4C|an|control|nt|sybarra: I dont do those "fancy" leads...they never work out for me |pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the K@s wouldnt be far off if declarer's black suits were transfered |pg||
nt|capercliff: and would be consistent with the auction|pg||
mb|4D|an|control|mb|p|mb|4H|an|control|mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - and also invite to cue bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised S passed must have enough for slam with @CK @HQ and four trumps...|pg||
nt|capercliff: on this hand the lead is irrelevent|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N looks best, a motif that seems to have run throughout the day's vugraphs.|pg||
mb|4N|an|RKCB|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well I did not understand the auction on 13 but it was suggested 5@C showed one keycard there, here it's zero.  Maybe it's just straight Blackwood or maybe they weren't on the same ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: page in terms of what was trump in 13 (if anything).|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case barring a misunderstanding here above 4NT the blame for this one goes to South.|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder how firmly 3@S sets trumps?  In my style it might have only 3-card support.|pg||
mb|5D|an|0 or 3 Keycards|nt|lorderic: i guess they set trump in 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure why is took his transportaiton  away with the clubs|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Maybe they won't need five more minutes to finish this one?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would read it that way |pg||
nt|othered1: This is a good spot, just not best.  Very rarely will it be punished at imps.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not take long |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: agree - S should be elated when pd bid 4 NT and not stop below slam.  The 1@S bid really created a dilemma|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: declarer might think about potential play if @S are 5-0.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|capercliff: I wouldnt have played the 10@s thats for sure|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: East has a 7-card suit and favorable vul, but the flat shape makes 4@S unresonable.  2@S is pretty conservative with the sound suit, extra card and side K|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@S is just right for me|pg||
nt|othered1: sort of what I was getting at :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - may be 3@D EW|pg||

nt|by: he is the conservative half of the partnership, and he must be thinking atht partner has a 9-count again|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S was 10-14 I think 4+ spades - hence East's quiet passing|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, 2 Aces account for 6 RP and a suit opening.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|by: let's see how this preempt turns out|pg||
nt|by: East could ask with 4@c or 4@d if he wants|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@H looks OK. Being dealer - being not vul - 6/5 shape - these are good conditions for an aggressive preempt|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree.  I also agree the 4H raise instead of some slam try.|pg||
nt|by: but he doesn't, since this is about as good as it gets|pg||
nt|by: i wonder what result in 5@cX|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: if north wants to bid, I would bid 4C over 3H.  Not now.|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will probably set up the side-suit (@d's) first, and be surprised by the 6-0 break|pg||
pc|cK|nt|by: he should still have enough time and tricks?|pg||
nt|by: if he wins and leads a diamond now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, (almost) always bid the first time, not the last time. Give the opponents as many "last guesses" as possible, and avoid giving your own side the last guess. |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|petergill: 4@H looks extremely likely to make|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: He can even duck when the @D comes back if he wants to|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: or duck a @d now = many lines are OK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|by: i am not clear what just happened here|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump switch is best - declarer will rise ace I think. |pg||
nt|by: looks like a full crossruff like without the crossruff|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: 3rd @D goes on @SK, 420|pg||
nt|by: best, like peter said|pg||
nt|by: declarer now wonders if trumps started out 4-0|pg||
nt|by: but how could anything go wrong?|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he also cannot afford a finesse to the HK and another trump.|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence.... NS have a touch of class, e.g. not giving North the immediate @D ruff is what classy defenders do, even if it makes no difference to the trick tally.|pg||

nt|sybarra: also thx to the specs  great comments  we appreciate them |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 3@D on the first board is not bridge.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the organizers for bringing this to bbo  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: What's yr bid as S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@D for me|pg||
nt|by: CGU defeats CMU by a large margin|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to Ed and KUO for your insights and thoughts on the hands.      |pg||
nt|by: actually 34.5 IMPs|pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks Shirley and Ed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcwla: 3@D not on the planet -- 5@D seems routine.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we are back in about 10 min |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @S lead @H Ace diitch @C and more @S....|pg||
nt|othered1: double?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to specs,    great comments,  we appreciate them |pg||
nt|lorderic: this 3@D is much better than last one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes better suit |pg||
pc|s5|nt|by: must be a misclick|pg||
nt|lorderic: the pass by E is too timid IMO|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to those who help bring this fine tourney to BBO  much appreciated by all the fans|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: N is now complaining for not preemting by himself lol|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: 4@S is intended as a cue-bid slam try but might it not be QJ09xxxx and void heart and little else?|pg||
nt|sybarra: frisky?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: 11 IMPs back?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcwla: W will be in shock that this makes after E's reopening X.|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may lead @D after @HAce...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: why did I know L would lead that |pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like 2@H is cold her... 2 or 3 IMP to CGU|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|nt|petergill: 6@H can be defeated by a low club lead to the nine for the @D ruff|pg||
