pc|cJ|nt|iceking: iam not big fan of this bidding why w cant bid normal 1nt looks strange to me|pg||
nt|lml: bidding 1@H on the West hand is in my notes but it always seems to work out horribly when I do it|pg||

nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Martim|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||

nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like the defence will grab 5 tricks, then declarer 2 or 3, then the defence another - and Declarer gets the rest - 1NT making|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||

nt|lml: nope|pg||

nt|jwit: Chance for a pickup here for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jwit: Very strange contract in closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 26 HCP... |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the effect of opening and responding light|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jwit: 26 points and a nine card heart fit!|pg||
nt|iceking: thiefery from ew in closed room|pg||
nt|lml: the three card heart response again!|pg||
nt|lml: in the CR|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: That's exactly why North should come in on his first turn. Opening and response NV can be rubbish|pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 6 spades needs guessing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the youngsters tend to remember these things.  Are NS youngsters?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vinbtech: one of them is surely NOT  he FORGOT ! lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will EW talk NS out of their @H game?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|lestergold: now 6 top losers|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the only one i recognise is David Stevenson from Liverpool|pg||

nt|lml: I think that if he does balance DBL might be better than 1NT.  It should suggest a good hand which has their suits|pg||
nt|lml: Yes they should consider playing 2@H natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|3S|nt|lml: in fact after those boards they should mark it on their card right now|pg||

nt|mmmakela: brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: game not an awful proposition here but doomed with both trump honours offside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i feel uneasy with East's bidding thee|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: 1NT not enough for game ( as i understand it) then he jumps to game |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: seems a shame it's going down |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: on natural methods there is an argument for an invite of 3S rather than a unilateral 4 but west ould probably decline its quite a good contract but unlucky|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Communications are not very fluid for declarer, and the defence will try not to help him, but may be forced to |pg||
nt|mcarroll: S should probably have ducked, even though it was only postponing the problem. what to lead now?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead and -1 I think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcarroll: On board 2 in the Open NS had no difficulty bidding the @H game which was played in 1NT here generating the first significant swing|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y no SJ coming down in 2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s6|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the defence will have to get a @D and will then take the @HA to defeat this contract|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: 11 chunky points and an outside doubleton and also partner has opened second position at unfavourable which means his opening should be robust rather than  light|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: well North didnt have to cash the @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: vul games need to b bid on a sniff at imps so I wouldnt be too harsh about East's bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: This line will result in several down|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: but he did seeing 2@S tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: heart loser goes on diamond and one club goes on long dimaond ad you have to not lose 3 clubs with QJ9 with possibnility of ruffing one in dummt or finessing against ten depending ...|pg||

nt|yo_yo: sort of a gambler's lead?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jwit: 2C might be a relay to 2D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C may be puppet to 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: peter thinking about pree-bal here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but discretion prevails|pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: iam supriced he didnt take any action |pg||
nt|jwit: Probably wasn't sure 2D was going to be passed out.  The way I play 2C could be a signoff at 2D, but could also be the start of an invitational sequence|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|iceking: indeed |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c3|pc|d2|nt|lml: good morning|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|iceking: its still kind of soft imo he might have dbl 1nt or bid 2clubs|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|nt|po-s: weak defence|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but will still defeat the contract|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|chick: so Gudmunder pulling out to a big lead with only 2 more boards to compare|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South would probably not sit for 5@h, doubled or not - he would bid 5@s and then it would be a question of finding a club ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well he sat for it in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: and with the North hand as dummy, that might not be so obvious|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last one of the set|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 16+|pg||

nt|chick: Thanks for an excellent job, Guðni!!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|nt|vugraphzcx: thx you and thx all for watching|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another nasty lead for S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|mmmakela: spade lead against 3 NT and either red suit back shdn't be that hard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room @D10|pg||
nt|yo_yo: played by west|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: not back but NEXT|pg||
nt|dburn: better contract than at the other table, but four rounds of clubs will enable West's @d8 to take a trick|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: so gave the 9th|pg||
nt|chick: he can't look for overtricks now, club finesse out, so will just have to claim 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there is a change in declarers as the hand was played 3NT by w in the OR and was -1 here is being playeed by E |pg||
pc|s3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: A or K was needed for the lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that will be another small gain to Grant Thornton, who will win a low-scoring affair|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: and then only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: on this hand|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|chick: but in general it was the right lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: Declarer is not enjoying this at all|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: made with overtricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphzcx: thx for watching|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ty Gudni|pg||

nt|vugraphzcx: very wlc|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: next round in about 15 min|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, they will win it if their East-West pair bids game on board 7, which is not a foregone conclusion|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: Thank you for watching and the next round will start in less then 15 min hopefully|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok thanks everyone   |pg||
mc|5|nt|vugraphzcx: Final round of the tournament will start after few min|pg||
