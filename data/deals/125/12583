nt|mcarroll: 190 a very uncommon score|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, I hate to lose that argument with pd:)....uh... sorry pd... didn't think you really meant it when you overcalled 1@s....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: 'you don't think much of his overcalls'|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A useful 2 overtrick imps for CBAI|pg||
nt|mcarroll: indeed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they have to play so - if they are there|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  well played, yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: When she saw dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec says EW will get to slam here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ciaran: Of course that is what he played for - trying to tempt a cover and pin the 109 to run the suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: One suited|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whow they were in 4NT in the open room flat board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  I was told, after @d Q lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Another hand where a spade slam may be investigated, but they need to stop at 4S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  seems like a reasonable slam... not sure why it would go down|pg||
nt|athene: how do you fail in 6@H?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: viewgraph probably represented the true state of affairs there...|pg||
nt|andyv:  trumps are 2-2 and only need to ruff 2@cs in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what happened there?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Difficult decision for S now|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  I imagine E tried to ruff a @d low|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes declarer set off ruffing clubs but very carelessly ruffed a diamond with the @H2|pg||
nt|athene: there was a hand in a set earlier this morning where declarer had something like @S63 in dummy and ruffing with the @S6 stopped an overruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts was a sign off but west moves on..|pg||
nt|athene: west is always bidding slam with that hand after 1@H|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @S suit not getting mentioned here so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Got it right|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Good choice - when N could not cue 4D, he needs a lot to make slam|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahhh|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: just a question of six or seven|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: well, asks about the grand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||
nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting push board|pg||
nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thats quite a raise by east on a 5 count but the clues are there - pd at least 6/4 opps bidding @D pd short .. good bid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: @SQ switch causes lots of problems for declarer|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|kdr_fm: both @s onside easy 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: network outage...will update scores at the end|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d4|mc|8|nt|po-s: North might have T9xxx of diamonds|pg||

nt|chick: sad, but a very reasonable play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, but I think Short and Walker will be disapointed with these pushes..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: West did well though to play @dJ and not a lazy 6 might have gone @d 8 safety play ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Followed your advice roland|pg||
nt|davidstern: Slam time|pg||
nt|davidstern: And sacrifice as well|pg||
nt|vinbtech: slam save too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's a more solid-looking weak two |pg||
nt|frankaus: good W2@H|pg||
nt|chick: probably a good weak 2, as opposed to bidding a multi-like 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to set 6@h which is practically cold and find out it's a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: tactical 1@s ... prefering to opening 1@c|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  3@s relay to 3N?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6 clubs from south looks ok now|pg||
nt|andyv:  good 6@c hand here|pg||
nt|athene: many people play it forces 3nt so that north can then show a minor 1 or 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: yes, an opening 2@d says that you haven't got an opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I play it that way|pg||
nt|athene: it looks here as though it's clubs, though|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lucky 12 tricks here with @C breaking and both diamonds onside|pg||
mc|9|nt|mcarroll: In the open Room, EW bid and made 2@S|pg||
nt|eamongall: Oops I slept in |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Eamon|pg||
nt|andyv:  but NS may play it strictly as a @c xfer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Minimum for the strong type|pg||
