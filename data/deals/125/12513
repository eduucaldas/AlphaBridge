mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|gracelin: EW will soon reach 3NT here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gracelin: I will just bid 3NT with the West hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some at problems here if 2@H is force|pg||
nt|by: south wakes up?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: many players would disapprove of the 1D overcall on a mediocre suit and a mediocre hand, especially since it takes away nop bidding space from opps. but passing may result in -400 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when a D lead would beat 3N, and the overcall is relatively safe|pg||
nt|by: 2N says how little he thinks of partner's overcall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have passed to what N did|pg||
nt|gracelin: in that case East has a clear raise.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: 3N is not a good game single dummy, but once N opens it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: you gain some and lose some with the 1D overcall.  But in the long run I think it's worthwhile to join the party.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wanted to go for the edge after pards bid. Let us see|pg||
nt|gracelin: now West has another option.  Double for 500 is also not bad.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|dK|nt|by: why did not EAST double 3NT?|pg||
nt|by: i mean 3@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: I saw a lot of timid actions in these two days.  The youth have really changed.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Holliday for 1 day at NS by no X:(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in certain ways a 1D overcall has more tactical value than a 1H overcall, at least against certain methods. Many pairs play that 1S by responder over a 1H overcall shows 5, so ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: giving them the opportunity to do that may help the opening side. in contrast, 1M over 1D starts at a minimum of four for most pairs, so the 1D overcall does not help them clarify ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the suit length|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's an interesting idea, Marsh.|pg||
nt|by: it's clear that there has been some kind of misinformation claim here|pg||
nt|gracelin: some play 2H sows 5S/4H and 6-9, 2S the same pattern but invitational value.  It seems south doesn't have his points.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can understand why W did not double 3C -- he fears that N has ten or eleven bl;ack cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS are nonvul so the likely one down is not worth doubling for|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|nt|gracelin: I am bidding 3NT over 2H(whatever it is) if I can trust my partner's 1D overcall to be decent.  So if I don't bid game myself I am doubling opponents.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: but the parlay of not bidding 3N and then letting opps play 3C undisturbed is a dangerous way to bid....it just begs opps to put you under pressure as often as they can, because ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you have shown you will wilt|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree with the first part -- wild pandas couldnt stop me from bidding 3N with the W hand. however, the failure to double is at least very consistent with the 2N bid|pg||

pc|d5|pc|sT|pc|cQ|mc|6|nt|gracelin: I thk East could also double 3C if partner's 2NT showed 12-13 HCP with club stopper.|pg||
nt|rodal f: b and senn the result|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr seen|pg||
nt|by: i wonder what the director's ruling was|pg||
nt|gracelin: depend on how North and south each explain the 2H bid.|pg||
nt|by: Result is adjusted to 3N+1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe, but E has a lot of slow stuff, 3C is game, and opps are nonvul so risk/reward ratio is not that great. also, isn;t there a possibility that W's 2N was a bluff?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Vug operator will tell us by normal sevice|pg||

nt|sybarra: re all |pg||
nt|sybarra: they get to do the end plays this time :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: Chang is one of the best female/junior player in taiwan|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: Y.T. Chen|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Y. T   |pg||
nt|lorderic: Yeh's team won the mixed team in 2008, Beijing|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and here we go |pg||
nt|lorderic: here comes the board|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I was commenting for that event |pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@C-1@D-P-2@C-P(or X) and eventually to 3NT.|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if EW can make 3NT (8 red suit tricks and a trick in whichever black suit S leads). Don't know if they can bid it, especially since presumably N will open the bidding - ...|pg||
nt|janm: you said standard, not strong club, right Kuo? So we'd expect the auction to start with 1@c|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|lorderic: right|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lorderic: she has played for U21/U26/ladies team in Taiwan|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt makes on on "lovely laid out " for ew|pg||
nt|janm: Of course EW are lucky that both top spades are with North, but the opening bid makes that more likely than not|pg||
nt|sybarra: have not seen a precision system yet in this room |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Actually NS can make slam here with the fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: we did not know what to call you last set|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: or mosquito |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@H some kind of Tartan|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have been to Taiwan, what is venue for this event?|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's in National Taiwan University, Student Activity Center|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  not sure if I know where that is...... |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it moscito?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Carl.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning Jordan|pg||
nt|lorderic: the moscito pair is in open room EW|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: we have an interesting contract here on first board|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Youthful optimism may lead to slam...?|pg||
nt|sybarra: sp lead?   |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
nt|lorderic: the others play standard 5-card major|pg||
nt|janm: Reasonable by West - check to see if partner can raise hearts and bid 3NT if not|pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo,  we missed them again!  we must do better with our assignments|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lorderic: we don't see much precision pairs in youth team in taiwan now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Would have paid off here.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - despite the 3@D bid from N S was headed for slam - would he have bid 6 with two Key Cards (assume 5@C shows one)?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Heart will not be beating as fast in 5@H as in 6@H.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|lorderic: a spade here can still beat the contract|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|janm: I wonder why - it seems to me as if half of the young players in the US play some kind of strong club system|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Could still have found @H fit after 2@C -- but in any case there is none so score it up.|pg||

nt|by: i don't care if W is a  bluff -> he will run to 3@d anyway, and you are not supposed to play for that|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|by: So, we have an adjusted score: 3N+1 by EW on the last hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: I believe the score adjustment confirmed their was a mis-information and EW was damaged.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure it is just that when he runs the psyche gets exposed|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|by: how did this possibly make 3@h ...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: 3H seems a doubtful call, especially at these colors. far more defensive potential, and less offensive potential, than a 3-bid should have|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|gracelin: SK lead after two high D, or declarer now pins north's 10x of spades.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|hK|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Not best def and on for a might funny one|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: and with J98 of spades and an AK and a possible source of tricks, you might easily play 3H cold for 4S|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, Marsh.  but in their moscito, 2H shows 5-card and a very weak hand. He doesn't have that option.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Invers cut in @S?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|gracelin: low spade to 8 will make him a brilliancy award candidate|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: i also dont have the 2H option in my system for different reasons, but for me 3H is still a very unattractive call due to the dangers mentioned|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SKQ42H75DAKT7C975,SA765HQ632DQJ8CJ4,ST3HJD9653CAKQ832,SJ98HAKT984D42CT6|sv|n|nt|sharkey: so 12 tricks - the @D trick vanished|pg||
nt|sybarra: a fast "next"  |pg||
nt|jcwla: I think that's a good trend, Kuo.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: OR starting w/23 and 24 - they'll pick up our comparisons when they circle back to 13.|pg||
nt|sybarra: no one makes a game here |pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: a typical 3NT here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Aggressive Rule of 2-3-4 opener here.|pg||
nt|janm: I was about to say that he'd cash 9 tricks and then exit in a black suit and probably get a 10th, but he efficiently claimed his sure 9 - we never see matches decided by 1 IMP of ...|pg||
nt|janm: course, so no reason to play for the overtrick (need a smiley for tongue in cheek)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Looks like a @S partial here|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Somewhat odd pass by West - I'd have expected a raise with 4 trumps and no real defense, but he was right since N also passed|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's pass surprises me.  3NT here by N would not have made the right catch.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: Kristian is not our operator - the profile has not been changed...|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing looks great for ns |pg||
nt|sybarra: I open the hand 1 @C   |pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D looks strange to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @D looks more precision like|pg||
nt|lorderic: perhaps he wants to avoid a @D lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: good pt. Kuo |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: even @D's not great ....|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd wonder about that tactic in 4th seat.|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 3 @H is everyone's opening bid (not mine)   but//|pg||
nt|janm: I think this is going to end up -1; can NS make anything?|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's a fair one by the colors|pg||
nt|sybarra: true  with colors|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I would not do it, I never carch a dummy like that |pg||
nt|janm: I think I'd open 2 - it's a little too heavy in defense compared to offense for me to want to open 3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not in love with misstating my number of trump.  I'm willing not to make the preempt on a particular hand - but I don't love to misstate number of trump.  Seems to work out badly ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: often and not ideal for partnership harmony.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: @HQ will be an expensive lead....|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: trying to coach a bid out of N |pg||
nt|sybarra: well here "we" are |pg||
nt|lorderic: Wang was my teammate in 2006|pg||
nt|sybarra: so is young also I take it |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sharkey: apparently Kristian, Danish operator, is a popular name in Taiwan, may be Roland's doing.... - appearing in both rooms....|pg||
nt|sybarra: still take out |pg||
nt|lorderic: we played World Youth Bridge Cham. in Thailand, under 21|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: not usre I will bid again with S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but also not sure what I would do over 3 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: except beat it |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|janm: I think NS can make about 4 @cs (or @ds I guess)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: This one will not take long.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lorderic: E wisely didn't lead a spade, but didn't find the best @C lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this needed a double-dummy @C lead to be in danger|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: looks right to overtake and play something rounded back|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be concerned (re leading @C) that  N also had clubs |pg||
nt|othered1: overtake with 10?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcwla: I definitely want partner taking the appropriate action with their hand based on our combined number of trumps and their values.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: poor N has no entry after ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: but undoubled |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|capercliff: hi folks|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Cliff |pg||
nt|sybarra: and "only 50's"|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|lorderic: the overtake gives an extra @D tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
mc|9|nt|janm: East hoping that the opponents will have to give him a ruff-sluff or open up the spades, which will allow him to make 3 - nicely done|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|by: I think north's bad signalling in diamonds is responsible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this one should be fun:)|pg||
nt|by: you should never play 6 and 5 from 9653 to the first two tricks|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Sr Prival Was the inv cut|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but the vul. protects them.  He might win 10-12 and lose only 4-6.|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Hard hands here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS may get trouble by bidding too high.  But EW will not double them.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: actually going well for NS so far|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C from me and in problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the X by W will slow S down|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|by: do you mean they wilt, Patrick?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: spade length marked at left |pg||

nt|rodal f: Did I see the one @H? No. Was blind|pg||
nt|by: looks like a peaceful down two|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a D lead will let declarer pitch his club.  And if East ducks a low trum lead, the game might make.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still a quest|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would not have minded a 4H opening bid, but i think the way the auction went S had no reason for a belated jump to game|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: W will play heart jack on 1st round|pg||
nt|gracelin: if West didn't cash his CA, he has another entry for a 2nd spade ruff.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are 9HP and single @H wourtk a 2!@C?|pg||

nt|jcwla: Seems could always make w/right view.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Jan is right, WD by E.|pg||
nt|janm: Guess we can't complain about not getting distributional hands here!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: yuk as they say |pg||
nt|jcwla: What do you do with S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: Another slam potential coming up|pg||
mb|1N!|an|!c|nt|lorderic: another interesting board - 11 minors in N and 12 majors in S|pg||
nt|sybarra: its been this way all night, and we saw lots of end plays.....|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1NT shows @cs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcwla: W's double not textbook.|pg||
nt|sybarra: just the bid S wanted to hear |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the 1 nt bid)|pg||
nt|lorderic: my mistake, only 10 minors in N|pg||
nt|sybarra: since I opened I would just bid 2 @H |pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree, Shirley.|pg||
nt|janm: S now has the usual problem when you open a light hand with 56 in the Majors with 1@h - is he good enough for 2@s. Particularly with the DBL, I think not|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I dont mind that opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I dont reverse now  just a simple 2 @H  for me|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcwla: I don't love the opening - seems like you should be able to get it in later usu.|pg||
nt|janm: It certainly seems right to open with 12 cards in the Majors! And although many people would open 1@s with this sort of hand and 56, I don't see how he could do that with 57.|pg||
nt|janm: Wow! 4@h is a big bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: nv, |pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo,  do we have any ladies at this table |pg||
nt|lorderic: is W considering 5@D?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@D perhaps a bit pusillanimous.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think W is |pg||
nt|lorderic: if E has 5cd @D and singleton @h it can be good|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if bidding 5 @D has to be in tempo |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hard to judge "good" and "bad" bidding on freak hands -- often, anything could work out well or badly.|pg||
nt|janm: I think 2@d is very reasonable - he didn't have to bid at all, so it showed some values and reasonable diamonds, which is what he has|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we saw all night (here) day there |pg||
nt|janm: West has a lot of losers to venture an 11 trick game, but he does have good support for partner and doesn't know what's going on with S's bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: W may think his pard has the singleton  |pg||
nt|janm: But no real reason to - N didn't show any support|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcwla: I do not like 1@S.|pg||
nt|sybarra: may land in 3 nt?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N is the top  spot, will be bid i expect|pg||
nt|lorderic: let's see if NS can get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: true Jan  (sorry)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Four card support should be shown IMMEDIATELY in my opinion.|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - Not sure 1S will be able to show his hand now|pg||
nt|sharkey: *S|pg||
nt|sharkey: S is regretting his bid now...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now 4@H sounds like 3 and 3@H could be on two.|pg||
nt|janm: Tough for West to know what's right, but he has turned a plus against 4@h into a minus in 5@d, as long as S is willing to sit for this|pg||
nt|sybarra: X=  pd please dont bid again |pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems S has been unilateral enough, time to let go.|pg||
nt|janm: It's often hard when you've opened a minimum shaped hand to let partner double the opponents, but you just have to - he's already shown his hand, can't bid it again|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: just bid it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H may show stronger hand than 3@H in their system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is not the worst 13 I have ever seen (in S)|pg||
nt|capercliff: not an auction for a @h lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and far from best either |pg||
nt|janm: And he (or she) didn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe S should have opened 4 @H  any one for that?|pg||
nt|lorderic: S is a "she"|pg||
nt|jcwla: If I were going to rebid 4@H on round two with this hand I would just have opened it 4.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Chang end played her way into 3 + contacts in one set |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: might he play a, q of sp?|pg||
nt|capercliff: i might lead K@s here, and lose imps of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: he= declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should have said found the end play  to make the contracts |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: I hope so -- I could see how some people could play it as weak.  You have to be able to bid 3@H with two here.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: I dont do those "fancy" leads...they never work out for me |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|capercliff: the K@s wouldnt be far off if declarer's black suits were transfered |pg||
nt|capercliff: and would be consistent with the auction|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - and also invite to cue bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised S passed must have enough for slam with @CK @HQ and four trumps...|pg||
nt|capercliff: on this hand the lead is irrelevent|pg||

nt|jcwla: 6 to CGU on 1 - their opponents sold out to 3@C/N down 3 - not enough recompense for the 3NT making in here.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|jcwla: Well I did not understand the auction on 13 but it was suggested 5@C showed one keycard there, here it's zero.  Maybe it's just straight Blackwood or maybe they weren't on the same ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: page in terms of what was trump in 13 (if anything).|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case barring a misunderstanding here above 4NT the blame for this one goes to South.|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder how firmly 3@S sets trumps?  In my style it might have only 3-card support.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lorderic: i guess they set trump in 3@S|pg||
nt|janm: That might have been a mistake - now when N gets in with a club, he can play A and a trump and prevent the second club ruff |pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|lorderic: i've heard that the director is called on Board 1 open room|pg||

nt|janm: if he doesn't play 2 rounds of trump now, he knows declarer will be able to ruff 2 clubs in dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: agree - S should be elated when pd bid 4 NT and not stop below slam.  The 1@S bid really created a dilemma|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: declarer might think about potential play if @S are 5-0.|pg||

nt|janm: to pull the last trump and so he'll either have to play a heart to the A or K of spades and ruff a spade - either one gives up his position in that suit|pg||
nt|janm: Do you know what happened that the director had to be called, Kuo?|pg||
nt|lorderic: i have no idea|pg||
nt|janm: And we should give Wang credit for a good play in leading the trumps - it looks clear to us but it's not so clear at the table, after all, declarer started on trumps first|pg||

nt|janm: one on the now good club 9. But that won't work now, since N can lead the 4th trump. I'm sure declarer is now trying to figure out if there's any possible way to squeeze S in the ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shud be makeable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Bad is a good description of south's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: the second pass by west is timid|pg||
nt|lorderic: nV i suppose everyone here would bid it right?|pg||
nt|janm: Now that's a surprise - I thought Chang was deciding between 1NT and DBL, didn't think of pass with 4 spades and 14 HCPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's pass more of a surprise to me.|pg||
nt|janm: I think that NS can make about 3 spades and EW probably 1@h|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1NT on 14 seems esoteric and an Italian-style double to announce opening values was not in the offing.|pg||
nt|janm: It's not an Italian style DBL, the S hand has support for all the unbid suits|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: Someone will probably have to make an aggressive call.|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play it here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 @D?|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@S is cheap|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: this dealer needs some help |pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: As long as E holds off in @H will be hadr to make 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: However, passing with the N hand would not occur to me.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: Not sure what 2@C is - many play it forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: but @S split, so game isn't on EW|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: S bypassed 4 card @S suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS playing weak NT openings perhaps?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: N knows something funny has happened and might be worried that it's E who has substantial extra values - of course having 5 spades is a reason to bid, but he has virtually no ...|pg||
nt|janm: defense and not a lot of offense.|pg||
nt|janm: Still, it's surprising that both of them would choose to pass conservatively on this hand.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The problem with double as S -- and the reason it's not textbook although it works for some -- comes from partner's POV, esp in comp auctions, when they place you on appropriate ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: distribution and bid accordingly -- then you show it up with 4-3-3-3 and it's just not good.|pg||
nt|janm: However, the OR NS did worse by bidding :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|jcwla: Hmm -- I'm not convinced they're on the same page here -- in any case S must be at the tip-top so here we are in 4@H.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: 25 HCP - not sure what 2@H means - two hearts??|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Cant even see possiblities of making this one...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|janm: The OR South overbid with 1NT and then overbid again with 3NT.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: here goes the end play again |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: we may just make this |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: So true.|pg||
nt|janm: My partners don't expect perfect shape if I have decent HCPs - of course you need either solid values or shape for a TO DBL, but I don't think you need both|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|jcwla: I could see about six or seven alternative natural auctions ending in anything from 1NT, 2@H, 2NT, 3NT.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|janm: S now deciding whether she needs to win the diamond now or it will go away (on what I wonder) or whether to hold up to keep declarer from playing the 4th one|pg||

nt|othered1: Lots of players consider thenorth hand a routine weak 2@H.|pg||
nt|janm: Would have done better to hold up, since now declarer can play a diamond to dummy and pitch the club loser on the trump loser, as he has done|pg||
nt|jcwla: Matter of style but I prefer my takeout doubles to be "take out."|pg||

nt|sybarra: KUO,  is Jr. International from Ch. Taipei, we welcome you  and perhaps you know the players|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|by: 2@c = good raise of hearts|pg||
nt|gracelin: if he decides to ruff out DQ in 3 round, and have spade finesse in reserve, he might go down.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gracelin: maybe acadamic, they won't get that high.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: I wud love to see West 3D, East 4H but I know I wud be disappointed.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Not vul at IMPs, I still have great sympathy with passing.|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a very nice result with those cards|pg||
nt|lorderic: the third endplay in this set|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|lorderic: open room reaches 6@S on Board 7|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess if you take all of your tricks, you're allowed to bid it up.|pg||
nt|othered1: doubled?|pg||
nt|janm: Do they also play 24 boards?|pg||
nt|by: this after 12|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lorderic: the auction is not finish|pg||
nt|othered1: For the @C lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: tie match in this set so far|pg||
nt|janm: Sometimes the 3-4 playoff is shorter than the finals|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR N started with 1NT, E raised @H's, and N later came out of the closet w/3@C.|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: If NTU-PAC bids game on 21 match virtually tied|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: This will make a bunch w/this @H position and @C break|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think S shud Pass here and get a @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually 3 @H stoppers|pg||
nt|sybarra: here comes 4 @S  |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually that was a question |pg||
nt|sybarra: although 6 makes |pg||
nt|othered1: if you want to play slam, it must be in @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: i'm wondering if 2@S is a forcing bid or not|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes that is best spot |pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: the third cheap 2@S this set?|pg||
nt|sybarra: SCU  falling more behind  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S knows N and E have near blank hands thus no purpose in bidding with opps Vul despite 18 HCP|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile they've bid to 4@S on 19 -- |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H cue ? by N  ?    do you cooperate now?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@D is imaginative.  A last-train type cue-bid, but why.  Couldn't south be all minors?|pg||
nt|lorderic: Board 6, north didn't find the club lead and 6@S is made|pg||
nt|lorderic: another 13 IMPs to CGU|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcwla: now on to the play.|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's not easy to get 24 IMPs from defending 2@S|pg||
nt|lorderic: nV, undoubled|pg||
nt|janm: I thought the OR EW were playing Moscito - doesn't that include transfer 1 level openings? Or are they just playing a strong club?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lorderic: sorry i mean Board 7|pg||
nt|by: no, honeymoon moscito, 1990 version, not the transfer modern|pg||
nt|janm: OK :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might not X here but surely has an idea of the scoreline.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Unusual auction by N here - I think I like the immediate 1NT chosen in the OR better (although I confess I might just bid 2@c)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|othered1: Do you think north knows what's going on?  If so, why not the @H cue-bid?  |pg||
nt|janm: This isn't going to be a success - the club break will not make N happy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: Oh I would have no problem with taking another call.|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Jordan pointed out very fortunate hand for EW - exchange @H9 and @H10 the hand will go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard, cues, I return the cue "on the way"   to game,   |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|sharkey: Dbl and expect Pd to Pass?|pg||
nt|othered1: or it could be that they play that @C cue-bid implies @H control.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: I don't think it's clear that north knew that south was cue-bidding with huge and long @S support|pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo  your thoughts?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lorderic: 5@C... N: ok i would like to play clubs|pg||

nt|lorderic: N bid a forcing 2@S with only an A and a Q, i don't think it's enough... |pg||
nt|lorderic: for N to bid 6@C even if 4@D is natural|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 here.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: Not sure why N acted over 1NT in OR.|pg||
nt|janm: Another unusual auction in the OR. don't know what N was trying to do|pg||
mb|d|an|1m or Ms (Meckwell dont)|nt|jcwla: 4@S down 1 on 19 -- so 6 to NTU-PAC and it's a 6-IMP match with 5 to compare.|pg||
nt|sharkey: East pushed with his 8 HCP on 19|pg||
nt|sharkey: This shud be a push|pg||
nt|jcwla: Last board of this first set.  Thanks to Roland, our operator, Jan, Kuo, B.Y., Shirley, all specs.|pg||
nt|janm: What's the DBL here? Majors?|pg||
nt|by: Meckwell|pg||
nt|lorderic: dbl show one minor or both major|pg||
nt|by: but i doubt that meck or well would do it ...|pg||
nt|janm: Oh, lots of differnt things then |pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: this 3@D is not my type|pg||
nt|sybarra: a "dashing"  3 @D  not my type either|pg||
nt|othered1: It's a way to bring EW back into the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. with 4 @H's |pg||
nt|sybarra: and few folks play penalty X's here so....|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|lorderic: although N didn't need much for a slam|pg||
mb|2H|nt|janm: I usually like to bid with Majors over a strong NT, but this isn't the hand to do it on - too much defense, too little shape, too little offense. |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: well this is my favo time to lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: none of pards suit...|pg||
nt|othered1: I play penalty doubles here (you gotta be right some of the time)|pg||
nt|sybarra: why penalty here Ed?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after 3 @d you play penalty not neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Wrong again...|pg||
nt|jcwla: It c--it c--it can't be.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Oof.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Vul both N and S shud try for game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|janm: Not unreasonable by E opposite Majors - if partner has a bad hand, the opponents can probably make 3NT and if partner has a good hand, we might make 4@s. If he knew partner would ...|pg||
nt|janm: DBL on this hand, though...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: So it looks as if we'll end with some more IMPs to BTU, who will go into the second half comfortably in front|pg||
nt|jcwla: So often on VG each hand's actions in isolation can be defended, but the two don't go together.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: 2@H not one of the choices.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: rabbi at work :)|pg||

pc|h7|nt|gracelin: Declarer cannot let south get in, S10 through will get defenders 4 tricks in spade.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so waiting denies certain handtypes?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: West cannot have both majors.  He would open 1NT with that.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|by: 1@s denies @h, so no @h fit|pg||

nt|marlowepi: ok thx|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|lorderic: thanks Shirley and Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 3@D not on the planet -- 5@D seems routine.|pg||
nt|janm: That's a matter of partnership agreement - some of us consider that the lower the card we lead the better our holding, so the 2 would suggest an original 5-card holding (remember ...|pg||
nt|janm: that from N's point of view, S might have led from 98x, so N couldn't afford the J back|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: we are back in about 10 min |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @S lead @H Ace diitch @C and more @S....|pg||

nt|janm: That's the first soft result we've seen from this NS pair|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: 4@S is intended as a cue-bid slam try but might it not be QJ09xxxx and void heart and little else?|pg||
nt|sybarra: frisky?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 11 IMPs back?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: W will be in shock that this makes after E's reopening X.|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may lead @D after @HAce...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: why did I know L would lead that |pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like 2@H is cold her... 2 or 3 IMP to CGU|pg||
nt|by: NS was not a regular pairing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: W has not shown anything in responder's bid major, nor has E made any kind of inquiry.  @H lead good choice and when it works gets in a little psychological effect too.|pg||
