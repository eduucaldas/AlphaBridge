pc|sQ|nt|iceking: this was well judged from w i think i would have had hard time stop here|pg||
nt|iceking: good afternoon |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - East certainly didn't hold back in the auction|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: well judged all round - 5@Hx looks like 800 on best defence|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that you always get best defence, of course....|pg||
nt|iceking: if 2d was forcing i dont fault east for 4h its his only chance to show shortness and it might be the key reach slam |pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon another Mike here hi Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What was 2@H all about. Known 10-card fit and just 2@H?? Must have been tactical|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: hi Magnus|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
mc|11|nt|mdgraham: and QJx in pard's other suit - 4@H for me! |pg||
nt|iceking: no idea why 2h looks like clear 4h to me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: best defence against 5@H shouldn't be too didfficult to find|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: wow, there's a hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: be surprised if e/w find this perfecto club slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: the only way you get to these slams is to punt them|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|iceking: i dont like 3clubs here should bid 4clubs typical hand for that auction|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: wow did he really bid 6clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for east to know how hard his two small spades are working|pg||
nt|xenya: surprised, Mike?|pg||
nt|iceking: i mean his hand could be worth nothing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: well i expected maybe a 'punt' but from west not east|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Vlad|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: hi :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: like to have agreater undertsanding of the auction how did east know his hand was worth slam|pg||
nt|iceking: east bidding is just mad |pg||
nt|lestergold: mad but earns the mps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ill take a break, see you later. Have fun|pg||
nt|xenya: hello :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye for now Roland|pg||
pc|s6|nt|iceking: later roland|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: these hands are very hard unless you are playing some very complicated relay system (and the opponents leave you alone in the auction)  |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: Bye Roland|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|c8|pc|d5|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: mind you east has presumably made three denials and west is still making slam tries so perhaps east wasnt that made|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|iceking: east has no control and his pd didnt bid 4club direct|pg||
nt|lestergold: he had club tolerance and a ruffing value after all!!|pg||
nt|xenya: also W shunned from 3N -- at pairs that must be significant|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: dull 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a relaxing hand after all that exciotement|pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt probably stenberg swedish convention 3club any min |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: NS must be very cautious bidders if that South hand is a minimum|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|iceking: 3club is hcp respond shows like 11-bad 15|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|iceking: 3d askes and s would have responded 3nt short spades but vs 11-15 n wasnt interested|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
mc|11|pg||

mb|1D|nt|iceking: 650 so far is around 70% to ns|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: E?W can compete wll in diamodns an interesting hand|pg||
nt|iceking: board before 6club making only 60% so far|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: and first board 5d making 75% to ew|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: 5D only one off if the club J is picked|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: however at unfavourable not many will risk it|pg||
nt|iceking: but its impossible for ew to bid more|pg||
nt|iceking: nobady has value for that|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: 420 is 55% for ns here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but yesterdayi saw the most conservative player of all time fellow commentator David Edwin raise a vulnerbale overcall to five level holding two jacks|pg||
nt|iceking: only 3 pairs have bid to 5 level |pg||
nt|lestergold: and that was at imps!|pg||
nt|iceking: so this round was very even for these 2 pairs |pg||
nt|lestergold: well there are always some and if any of them get the club guess right I will be impressed and they will earn a lot of mps|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: spec asked what are Miltons?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||

pc|hT|pc|d5|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: I assume a long departed early US expert|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|iceking: 1-3-5-7 count is still used for some players here in iceland but most use milton points|pg||
mc|10|nt|iceking: each round is 4 boards we have monrad system and we are showing table one so that means NS will always be the leaders|pg||

nt|iceking: http://reykjavikbridgefestival.com/index.php?m=D1&id=M_PAIRS2010&iid=IF_OPENPAIRS2010&m=D1|pg||
nt|iceking: but that doesnt mean pair number 2 will play vs pair number 1 as you can only play once with the same pair |pg||
nt|iceking: so late in this tourney might even happen pair number 20 has to play on table one its possible situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzcw: I have to shut down and load the next boards, next round starts in 3|pg||
