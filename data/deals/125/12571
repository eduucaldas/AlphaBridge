nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
mb|1H|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now we will compare the scores|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that last board may well produce a swing - as even 3@s on spot on defenc cant make|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcarroll: 3@D = transfer|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
mb|d|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can well start with taking first 5 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good double - wrong ace for a maximum penalty godd still going down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not yet though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi James, Martin and specs I'm Frank from hot Norway. Just -23C now:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: A bit unfortunate - the bidding looks reasonable, unlucky to find the trumps stacked. So first imps to CBAIlookk|pg||
pc|dT|nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|s5|nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|chick: could it show something in hearts besides?|pg||

nt|mcarroll: After 3 frantic boards - a little placidity?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the open room, N made 5@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS rather got away with that I'm afraid..|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well played to flatten the board|pg||

nt|vugraphzdz: dispute resolved - scores remain the same|pg||

nt|andyv:  sometimes the obvious escapes us at the table|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2S is the last making contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|james_h: but bidding 2@d here is a poor IMPS bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Hang on a min Rodal :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|james_h: we'll give you 2 more hands|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that S in Open did not bid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: east liked the hidden diamond fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this one really does require a lot of work|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davidstern: Hi all|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  in modern bidding, strong dbl on 1N is out of date |pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: This will make if declarer is careful in the trump suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks only and no real pressure on E/W - i cant see a 9th ?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes in first position, but a balancing dbl over 2@H is very much in vogue|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still may be OK if he runs a heart from dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: well, whether South runs or not depends on your parameters for doubling 1NT   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: whereas west cards were in spades where he thought they werent|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: Me neither|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: with a flattish 1 count u know this is not a gr8 spot|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|mcarroll: Unless the defence slip|pg||
nt|davidstern: The defence have now put this at risk by forcing declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|james_h: 1imp pick up here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: agreed, if you are certain partner cannot hold (for example) AKQJ sixth  plus an ace |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ciaran: Surprisingly, north didn't overcall at the other table|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  this auction needs to go back to the drawing board|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: just as well Scotland defended well in CR...|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: U have counted the months?:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice @S fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 1@C either 11-13 balanced or strong|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is a good lead it seems|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5 tricks in NT |pg||
mb|2S|nt|james_h: 2@c shows strong,without fit (in std carrot)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: west hand is a problem hand for the weak nters as you can (and they have) missed their spade fit.  With such decent @s's i'd have opened 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: on repeated trump leads this can fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I dont believe South has shown his clubs naturally, he may have implied them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be implied now so 4@C to come?|pg||
nt|james_h: the fact the 3h is not alerted makes me think its just natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Late alert of 3H|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|james_h: ok, south must have shown clubs |pg||
nt|po-s: he has shown clubs when he doesn´t rebid NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the 4@D cue does not improve the E hand so they quit in time|pg||
nt|davidstern: Combined 24 cound stopped well short |pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  W must be happy with this lead, not @d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Hei Peo|pg||
nt|james_h: I think McG will drive this bus home now in the snow|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and a 9 card minor fit to boot as well|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  lacking the spot cards, 4th best (or low for some) is the best lead with the W cards in @ds|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer try to steal a spade to make?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: though 3n is far from easy; a tempo behind imo|pg||

nt|james_h: sorry Rodal, this it too tame for me|pg||
nt|james_h: I demand more "fast lane" hands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: but this time the @S save is too expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And might even aggravate the opps into the grand|pg||
nt|po-s: spade save is 2000 I think|pg||
nt|po-s: and 7clubs more|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1700 might enough|pg||
nt|james_h: West is considering her options|pg||
nt|po-s: right, I counted 6 spade tricks, forgot the ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  no reason for W to fly with the Ace|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @HA there's no rush anyway|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, should have hoped for a missguess it seems..|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|davidstern: But need to get there |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: How are you going to bid a grand slam with any accuracy when opps bid spades like mad as happened in the other matches?|pg||
nt|james_h: opening 1@c with this hand when looking at the NS (terrifying animals :) ) may not be appealing|pg||
nt|po-s: is 2C clubs or strong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Very favourable layout here for E/W - @SQJ doubleton, @DQ9 onside, @C 3-3, @HJ right|pg||
mb|3C|nt|james_h: clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: By exlution blackwood EW should have a easy line til 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR somehow found and made 3@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: E worth an invite with two Axxx suits opposite a 15-17 NT, |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|james_h: its an underbid but she gets a chance to rev theing up now|pg||
nt|james_h: things|pg||
nt|po-s: I doubt that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising S did not show both Majors?|pg||
nt|james_h: lets see|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: P??|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 2@C really a limited opening? I mean, after all she has a 3 loser hand. Impossible to catch up later I predict. I agree with PO|pg||
nt|james_h: Ciara(West) in crying|pg||
nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 21 points and the opps have ignored you ... and found a fit ... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good sign for finding fit with partner - N must be short in @h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game in @c looks attractive|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: only fit left is @C's  - I like A 2NT gets the values across and N is marked with a few @s's on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they dont have the theoretical points required, but maybe they will take the view that 3NT may be as likely as 2?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Will probably stop in 2N and be thankful to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona: yep, spade now gives south some losing options...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: not sure of the EW system here....2@D either a straightforward Multi (so to speak) or possibly a bad-suit weak two|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|andyv:  idee fixe|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S plays 4NT in Open|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: told 2@D=5-7, 5+cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red lead brings 8th trick, what about 9th?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure about the 3@h bid seems a bit much - then again 3@s looks like a make and opposite @sHx even with the known 4+ @s with east woukd have good chances|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: sorry, 0-7 hcp|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: when you try a speculative lead and declarer ducks, you always hope you found a good thing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: S really doesn't want to lead any suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: What was Hamilton's 2D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Some alerts have not been entered in this auction|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: Can certainly understand this auction - north unfoirtunately has a very good 2@S bid and east has a small amount of interest only|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|po-s: Probably there was a West face when Pass came back|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, the crux of the matter is that the West hand is too good for 2@C|pg||
nt|james_h: lol PO|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why W is so reluctant to lead pd's suit|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, E seemed to encourage, and if so maybe wrong..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If the @C's broke 2/2 and hugh was able to sneak the @c9 into dummy this would make as it is hes blocked|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcarroll: 2@C is 5 card Stayman so 2@D denies|pg||
pc|h9|pc|cJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: in which case there's far less long-term future in spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: possible end play here - W is probably going to discard 3@h and now @ha and another should produce 2@d tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kdr_fm: using the entry to finesse @D and play for split @d honours it looks like|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: west is sure the missing spades are 5-4, rather than 6-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 more rounds of @c would have been better |pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed......will claim at the end|pg||

mb|p|nt|ciaran: Of course that is what he played for - trying to tempt a cover and pin the 109 to run the suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: One suited|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whow they were in 4NT in the open room flat board|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  I was told, after @d Q lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|ciaran: Another hand where a spade slam may be investigated, but they need to stop at 4S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  seems like a reasonable slam... not sure why it would go down|pg||
nt|athene: how do you fail in 6@H?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: viewgraph probably represented the true state of affairs there...|pg||
nt|andyv:  trumps are 2-2 and only need to ruff 2@cs in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what happened there?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Difficult decision for S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  I imagine E tried to ruff a @d low|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: yes declarer set off ruffing clubs but very carelessly ruffed a diamond with the @H2|pg||
nt|athene: there was a hand in a set earlier this morning where declarer had something like @S63 in dummy and ruffing with the @S6 stopped an overruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts was a sign off but west moves on..|pg||
nt|athene: west is always bidding slam with that hand after 1@H|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||
nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting push board|pg||
nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well a couple of missed chances for Scotland here...|pg||

mb|d|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzgh: She did|pg||

nt|davidstern: Indeed |pg||
nt|vinbtech: Hobson's Choice really|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and comes to the same 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: thanks Christine|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT by south not seeing all the hands seems a fair spot|pg||
nt|davidstern: Are EW playing strong club?|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  with 19hcp, S is not going away|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Open Room must have crashed, so we are not getting comparisons, but they bid and made 4@S on this board|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2H is a good result for N/S since it looks like E/W will make 2S, though it might be hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S asking for a @S stop|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|athene: 2@S is the best they can do at this point i guess|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2C from N forces 2D from S, and 2H is then to play|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: missing pass over 3@S by North |pg||

nt|andyv:  won't get there|pg||
nt|athene: but they can't get there|pg||

pc|h6|nt|athene: east should have bid 2@D then redoubled that, to show 44 majors|pg||

nt|ciaran: May not have been E thinking - they are playing with screens|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  the Italian teams of the 60s made a fortune by not opening 1N with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: alternatively east could redouble|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wanted to declare himself - didn't want the lead coming through all his tenaces|pg||

nt|athene: but EW could still organise it so that they scramble to 2@S by east|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d5|nt|athene: for example let's say east bids 2@D then redoubles|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: What about conceding two diamonds and claim?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: yes, an opening 2@d says that you haven't got an opening bid|pg||
