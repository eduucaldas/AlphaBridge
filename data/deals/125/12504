nt|janm: From now on we should have comparisons from the other room, unless our table is very fast|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South would have liked North to re-open with a double in the closed room, but he did not have the values for it|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|gracelin: East hand looks a reasonable 3D opening to me.|pg||
nt|janm: Our EW seem to open fairly light (of course this time he's in 3rd seat) - it'll be easier for NS to get in the auction over 1@d|pg||
nt|janm: I agree, Patrick, I'd certainly open 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: How many hearts can NS make? 1 club & 7 or 8 hearts, I guess, so 2 or 3 depending whether they lead a trump|pg||
nt|gracelin: but only when I am not Vul. I saw people opening 3D with less even at Vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Oh, this is interesting!|pg||
nt|gracelin: now it's more interest to project how many trick south can take at 1D|pg||

nt|janm: Guess it didn't occur to N that E would also pass :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A trump lead is recommended when partner passes a take-out double at the 1-level. East promises a suit that's good enough to pull declarer's trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|by: DONT was still quite popular in taiwan|pg||
nt|gracelin: Not me, Jan. I will open at 3rd seat, but not first seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both majors, nice shape|pg||

nt|by: Note that in the other table, south doubled to show both majors in balcing seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think this is a standard 1@S for Meckwell for example|pg||
nt|janm: An alert spec points out that declarer was playing for 3-3 hearts instead of setting up the diamond, which would fail if spades weren't splitting 4-4|pg||

pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Isn't it, Walter?|pg||

nt|by: There is precision and there is PRECISION|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT seems a little aggressive by West, at least if his opening was 15-17. But we all know that A's are worth more than 4 HCPs, so perhaps 3 aces and 2 4-card suits is really a ...|pg||
nt|janm: maximum|pg||
nt|by: Patrick plays Precision.  Meckwell play PRECISION.|pg||

nt|by: it's looking like 3N might make now|pg||
nt|janm: I don't think 3NT is going to succeed here - defense now has 4 spades to go with the diamond A and S will presumably cash them as soon as declarer plays diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|nt|by: 4 spades?|pg||

nt|by: doesn't declarer have two spade stops as soon as north lead @st|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 2nd club play is meaningless if declaqrer knows 2C is DONT, better play a low D and try to end-play south in the end.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|gracelin: declarer will soon discover south's exact distribution.  I guess he will make this.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, and might have read books on Restricted Choice|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Finally we get to see if E-W play natural or strong club|pg||

nt|janm: Does 7@d make even on a trump lead? |pg||
mb|3H|mb|4D|nt|by: oh wait|pg||
nt|gracelin: I guess so, declarer ca use two spade entries to ruff out the club honor, and back to hand to draw the last trump with a H ruff.|pg||
nt|by: i think you can do a double @c ruffing hook|pg||
nt|by: so it is cold|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You don't need spades|pg||
mb|4H|nt|by: I think he is an entry short|pg||
mb|5C|nt|janm: You don't need the spades only because the AK of clubs are onside, though, so it isn't as good a contract as it looks at first, if you could use the spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|by: cough, Jan, this is a colllegiate event?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Did I see 4@D over 4@D first? I think I did, should not be possible. Software bug|pg||
nt|gracelin: to use sades alone you would need 7 trump tricks to go.  That's not possible. |pg||
nt|janm: Even Juniors :) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am certain I saw 4@D from South over East's 4@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then a quick undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I did several specs tell me|pg||
nt|janm: If S is willing to bid to 4@h, maybe he should have bid 3@h over 1@s?|pg||

nt|gracelin: 5C X is a good Vul. sacrifice against a non-Vul. game.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|janm: And S definitely has a lot more offense than defense when his partner shows clubs and hearts|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|janm: I like East's DBL here - seems as if passing (as they did in the other room) is pretty conservative|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On the closed room auction|pg||

nt|Walddk2: By 8 miles|pg||
nt|by: that's almost a game force, Patrick?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|janm: I agree - I guess one of the two hands has to be underbid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Over the double I mean, not by East now|pg||
nt|gracelin: or a 2C cue.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|janm: East has certainly done all he should - now maybe West will wake up and bid 4?|pg||
nt|by: I am not sure, many kids in taiwan plays that 2@s simply shows 4 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: couldn't imagine West not bidding 4S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S can even survive a heart ruff. Shows how good it is on moderate values|pg||
mb|4S|nt|janm: At both tables, S let the vulnerability keep them from raising clubs the first round and now felt they had to make up for it, I think|pg||
nt|by: he might be instead 4@d, trying to help partner if they bid five|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, 4@d would be a good bid on the way to 4@s to show partner where his side values are|pg||
nt|gracelin: But this East will still double 5C if north bids it.|pg||
nt|janm: This auction has  a very different feel from the one in the other room - it's going to be hard for NS to bid 5@c here, isn't it?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|janm: Wrong again :)|pg||
nt|by: it seems to me that N doesn't need that much to make 5@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: yes, according to Theory of Exhaustion, both North and south get exhausted after the early rounds bids.|pg||

nt|janm: 9-1/2 HCPs|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's looks right to me. 9 1/2 pts.|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|janm: But both West's opened - do you like the 1@s overcall or the 1NT chosen in the other room?|pg||

nt|gracelin: I like 1S much more, but a few thk it too strong for a simple overcall|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Qxx+KQx+Qx+QJxxx  not even close to an opener|pg||
nt|janm: The problem with 1NT is that it's really a very suit-y hand (2 doubletons, A's outside the spade suit). The problem with 1@s is this - you don't feel that you've shown your hand, ...|pg||
nt|janm: but it isn't really good enough for 1@s and then 2NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|janm: Probably 2@h was alerted just because it's a game force - certainly this is the sort of hand where it's nice to be able to establish a force and show your good suit early and ...|pg||
nt|janm: without getting too high|pg||
nt|gracelin: this event used to attract some 30-40 teams but there are only about 16 this year.  The top 8 qualified for the QF now playing.|pg||
nt|janm: Why do you think there are fewer this year, Patrick?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am told that the team names are reversed on the scoreboard. N-S actually play for Frank-B, and vice versa|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: Can't be rectified while the table is open, sorry|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am not sure. But there's no cash prize and only honor for the competitors.  Maybe not enough incentive.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: East still doesn't know about the spade tricks, but he's willing to take the chance and bid Blackwood and presumably settle for 6@h when he's off a keycard|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, I fully agree|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: So please tell us what  NTHU  and  CGU   stand for, Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a challenge for NS to bid a red suit slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: Are the names BBO nicknames? Don't look to me like "real" names|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm: This one is a lot harder to bid than the last one, especially when the opponents open the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frank-B from NTHU             Golden Retriever from CGU    I was told|pg||
nt|gracelin: I'll check the half time but now I really don't know what CGU and NTHU stand for.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Interestingly, 6@H can be defeated (double dummy), 6@D can't|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, Jan. These name must be their bbo ID's.  All these boys(or girls) play a lot on bbo.|pg||
nt|janm: S will probably take the push to the 5 level (presumably with 5@d) but I'd be surprised if NS bid slam here - do you think they should have tried for it?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: NTHU = National Tsing Hua University; CGU = Chang Gung University|pg||
nt|janm: Ah, N took the push, still not going to get them to slam though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice with helpful spectators, thx everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I too think this is a very tough slam to bid, especially after the initial 4H response.  North's raise to 5H is brave but south has no ambition on slam in the beginning|pg||
nt|janm: It's too bad that we don't get a link to their BBO profiles on Vugraph - then we'd know more about them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we would all have beaten 6@H, would we not?|pg||
