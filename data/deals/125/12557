nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s8|nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||

nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: but if 1@D showed spades, it seems odd that East didn't bid over it|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d3|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, his side didn't find the vulnerabl sacrifice located at the other table|pg||

nt|dburn: which became a better sacrifice still when no one doubled it|pg||

nt|chick: so Gudmunder pulling out to a big lead with only 2 more boards to compare|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South would probably not sit for 5@h, doubled or not - he would bid 5@s and then it would be a question of finding a club ruff to beat it|pg||

pc|c4|nt|mmmakela: not back but NEXT|pg||
nt|dburn: better contract than at the other table, but four rounds of clubs will enable West's @d8 to take a trick|pg||
