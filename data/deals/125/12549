nt|lml: which is 1NT higher than 1 would like to be|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtr: Good passive lead  Usually correct against this sort of auction|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and West knows, that partner has a limited strength|pg||
nt|lml: this will not be a piece of cake|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a lot of guessing to do|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||

pc|d2|nt|lml: and then guess spades|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|sJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  THIS play was the absolut best, gentlemen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No @S-finesse needed|pg||
nt|lml: once West rose on the first diamond the hand wasn't too hard|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this play is OK with 3-3 hearts, not so good without it|pg||
nt|lml: if West ducks the first diamond the hand is a bit tougher|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Does not change, whether West rises or no - same play as here|pg||
nt|dburn: although blocked hearts also possible in some 4-2 distributions|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: I like the 3@c opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @S???|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: oh, 6@s is OK looking just at the North-South hands - with the East-West hands as they are, it is somewhat less OK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Agree...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But South must be close to slam efter two doubles by North|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is that they might play in spades, if South decides to pull this second double|pg||
nt|jtr: South likes his xxx@c|pg||
nt|jtr: If he bids anything i am sure it will be 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: still, if he doesn't then 5@c doubled also OK given the result at the other table|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: Decided to take the (little) money|pg||
nt|dburn: why should he bid 6@c and not 5@s?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  How David - they have 680|pg||
nt|jtr: Why mess around guessing an 11 trick contract?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Credit to Sigurbjörn for his 3@C|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  Oh - you prefer 300 to 680|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||

nt|lml: 3NT has some play|pg||
nt|jtr: But playable|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hawe45:  After NorthÂ´s double, you might get the @C-suit right in 3 NT|pg||
nt|jtr: @cK is a big card so i guess East will raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||

nt|jtr: But, as Hans said, he might guess the @c anyway|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: one tiny push towards the finesse is that as you say cashing out might not be trivial even when if it loses|pg||
nt|lml: obviously it would be when north has the club and the AKQ of hearts but maybe not otherwise|pg||
nt|jtr: True|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You can see, that Norths has doublev on about a small dozen of HCP, so @C-suit should be playey with a finesse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  played|pg||
nt|jtr: He also has the chance of 3-3@ss if the @cs dont work from the top|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  The reason, that West can bid on a hand that poor, is that no penalty double exists|pg||
