mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|dburn: courageous, vulnerable facing a passed partner, but hoping said partner could bid spades|pg||
nt|dburn: or it not, put down a few high cards and a few diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: or failing that, that his opponents would misjudge and bid 5@h anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wikner and Bertheau are both brilliant chess players with a high ELO rating (or used to have at least)|pg||

mb|2D|nt|dburn: his actual choice resulted in a swing of about 600 points, not undeservedly|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@D to play opposite 11-13 balanced. 1@C is two-way|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 17+ any shape the other option|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok against 2-way @C I understand|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it is not so silly to double a two-way club with something like a weak no trump|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So Wikner will bid again, the only question is what|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn: possible to combine that with a 1@d overcall that shows a "real" takeout double of clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Tough to beat this|pg||
nt|mmmakela: H A not easy to find?|pg||
