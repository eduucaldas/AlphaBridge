nt|iceking: oops that was expensive |pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: he has|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks like one of those games that you might not bid if you had the auction to yourself|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: s could have just covered no entry home|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm this could get too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must be getting old - whatever it is, I don't like it |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N there are theoretcially ninje tricks available but there are communication probs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: cant set up spade and get to east's hand to enjoy long spade|pg||
nt|iceking: depends on style here if 2sp shows 5sp 4plus minor weak hand i think w probably should just pass here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you could make it maybe with a slow club as the ninth trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would be funny if East had a singleton club and long diamonds |pg||
nt|iceking: this will make |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N will probably go down as it id reasonable to play on @Ds|pg||
nt|iceking: n might return diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that covers all bases - it will either make or it won't |pg||
nt|iceking: but he has 15hcp and there are 9 in dummy he should know pd is blanked|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: it may not be obvious to depend on the heart finesse for a trick when diamonds develop on 3/3 break or 4/2 break with someone holding doubleton honour|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: btter odds than a finnesse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|iceking: now there is no guess |pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: still only eight tricks on top|pg||
nt|xenya: would be surprised if it made|pg||
nt|lestergold: taking a losing heart finesse will also involve losing the cashing top spade its not that attractive|pg||
nt|iceking: spade spade and claim |pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps i'm missing something|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: i tythink you are missing a ninth trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes can overtake spade q i missed that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: yes -- S shows out -- i overlooked that|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|iceking: j9 of spades are dropping you can overtake q with k|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||

nt|mdgraham: in the tournament web site - excellent photos - but some of the players look a bit grim  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 6S for max mps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: 7S of course|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: only six, Mike?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: just counted|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: bet not many reach the best spot|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: come on South - 5@D |pg||
nt|iceking: 4d from s or|pg||
nt|iceking: 4d more like it hand 2 bal for 5d|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S have excellent save i 8@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, guess 5@D is pushing it a bit far |pg||
nt|iceking: 6clubs from w seems reasonable now|pg||
nt|lestergold: not everyone will overcall a dimaond with the north hand and not everyobe will be opening 1C with west depending on system|pg||
nt|iceking: might be stupid play in 6sp give pd qxxx kj9x qx xxx exs |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: of the three making slams 6@c 6@s 7@s 6@c scoring the least mps|pg||
nt|iceking: 5sp not a text book bid should ask for diamond control hand like akjx a xx aqjxxx exs |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@S certainly introduces scope for confusion|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 5S do you not think that east could raise this to 6 as he didnt even promise 4 spades and he has club q too|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont understand why w cant just bid 6clubs here it looks so logical to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: I measn he must reas his pard for an absolute monster to put in a 5S bid at unfavourable in this auction not just 4S but freely bid 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: i blamer east here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a spec says that East should bid 6@S - West can't be misisng KQJ spades and have two diamond losers. I agree |pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: West described his hand in my view|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt 5@S was meant as "did 6 with good spades" -- looks reasonable on this auction|pg||
pc|s6|nt|iceking: i dont like the idea w is aiming for spade slam with AT of hearts he might have discards |pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: those jumpy bids - like 5@S there - do seem rather buck-passers. Or rather blame-passers  |pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: I think that it was an imaginative bid in a space deprived auction and that east had a clear cut bid of 6 with apologies for probably missing seven!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: partner, it was OBVIOUS I meant it as (insert meaning here) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: 3h sry i dont get it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: wellE/W wont be earning many mps for this feeble effort|pg||
nt|iceking: 6h 5 conrols and a stiff i woudlnt even mess around just bid 4h |pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: indeed ... seems a bit cautious|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iceking: what is he playing for pd has qxx in spades and kqxx in clubs looks just mad to bid 3h here either 3d or 4h no other option|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has given cue bid support and  east has great suit controls and shape for this overcall|pg||
mc|10|nt|mdgraham: well, that should consolidate NS's lead quite nicely|pg||
nt|lestergold: east to blame again in my view|pg||
nt|iceking: no results so for this round i will post some number soon as something happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we can imagine the results for the last two hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: not good for e/w understatement|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably two 90% scores|pg||
nt|lestergold: thereabouts|pg||
nt|iceking: and it wasnt becouse of bad luck sry to say|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was because of hicken bidding by east|pg||
nt|lestergold: chicken exit bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mind you, some might get to 7@C, which has zero play|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed not many i would have thought|pg||
nt|iceking: slam was both fault east should have figured kqjx was enuff for slam and w should have never bid bridge bid pd can stop under slam |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as we all know, any plus score at pairs rarely earns a zero|pg||
nt|lestergold: its obvious that the club suit is needed for discards when seven is baswed on the great spade fit|pg||
nt|iceking: bridgemate might be not working no results from this round|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW will be quite glad of that. |pg||
nt|lestergold: bridgemate might have had a fatal heart attack after last two|pg||
nt|iceking: something is wrong |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW in 9th place.|pg||
nt|iceking: NS still have a big lead over 2 boards |pg||
nt|iceking: 170 last board was 20% for ew|pg||

mb|1D|nt|iceking: 50 down in 3nt was worse 15% |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: looks like 4H for N/S 4S too expensive even at these colours for e/w|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceking: 450 was good score 65% or so|pg||
nt|lestergold: but east is there and plenty will sac in 4S no doubt|pg||
nt|iceking: so ns had monster round last one|pg||

nt|lestergold: for uis t6o play merry hell with|pg||
nt|iceking: should east really bid 3sp does he want to table this hand down in 4sp dbl i doubt it|pg||
nt|lestergold: I would keep my trap very shut personally with that defacto 4333 yarborough|pg||
nt|iceking: even he has 4card support has no ruffing value no cards its just asking for trouple i think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: me too|pg||

nt|lestergold: mps here on whetehr or not the heart q is picked up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: but the 3@S bid might work out quite well -- makes @Hs guess very difficult|pg||
nt|iceking: only question is will he guess hearts |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: spade opvercall hints at shortage in hearts|pg||

nt|iceking: yes alot of poor bridge bids can work well nature of the game bridge|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: ten also restricted choice |pg||
nt|lestergold: tank time i think hell finnegle it|pg||
nt|iceking: he will play for hearts 2-2 here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but woth a singleton @H W might have taken a save|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed so he cant really guess this right|pg||
mc|10|pg||

nt|iceking: 2nt invit or better |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and you can be sure that some wont avoid it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|drewsky: test|pg||
nt|iceking: this is poor s should just jump to 5club voidwood |pg||
nt|drewsky: I must admit I would have bid 5@C over 2NT|pg||
nt|iceking: 3h shows good hand and short clubs 4club would have shown void|pg||
nt|lestergold: if playing voidwood seems right|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|iceking: and now there is no voidwood 5club just shows void |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: teetering on the brink|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|iceking: i know there methods rather well and 3h was poor choice now its guess time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and fell over|pg||
nt|lestergold: I was going to say the followingt well stopped! they explored sensibly|pg||
nt|xenya: might as well bid 6@S at once i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: but south having found that partner had no more to say after 5H still countermanded him and bid the six|pg||
nt|lestergold: very poor|pg||
nt|iceking: no S has one of those hand why people play RKCB|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: if you are going to ignore your pard yes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: you ordered pard to cue anything he had|pg||
nt|iceking: 4club void then 4nt is little better then voidwood though becouse of few reasons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mind you, can anyone here honestly say that they have NEVER bid a slam off the ace-king of trumps? |pg||
nt|lestergold: he showed his dim ace you asked him about his spdaes by cuing the third suit he denied anything high there|pg||
pg||
qx|o7|st||md|1SJ64H732DA94CJ985,SK7HAJ96DQT753CA7,SAT95HT4D82CQT643,SQ832HKQ85DKJ6CK2|sv|b|nt|lestergold: you ignored him and bid the slam anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad bridge |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, Mike|pg||
mb|1H|nt|iceking: yes but S broke one of the basic rules he didnt check keycards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|iceking: his hand was only about keycards nothing else|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|drewsky: My teammates one bid 6@H with a 5-5 fit missing the Ace, King, and Queen....and the suit broke 3-0|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: ok he took another route but having taken that route he didnt act on what he heard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|iceking: that was bad luck though drew:)|pg||
nt|drewsky: But er won the match :)|pg||
nt|iceking: are these players not playing mps why isnt east trying to end in 3nt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: coffee break hand|pg||

nt|iceking: well he could have tryed to figure the hand out my point is|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|iceking: can always bid 4h later if pd not nt interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here is a 4H thgat may score better in 3N |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|iceking: well w would never suggest nt anyway this time |pg||

nt|iceking: 1h-2club-2nt-3nt sexy auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hearts are likely running and outside hios quacks suggest no trumps|pg||
nt|iceking: protect qx i spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3H poor bid simple|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceking: yes no words for 3h good dummy in 3nt alot of loosers 6 possible top winners|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: why protect qx when pard has bid no trumps likely to have a useful holding in the suit hes expecting to be led|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|iceking: lestergold 1h-2clubs-2nt now |pg||
nt|iceking: if pd bids 3nt now do you really dislike it i dont think so|pg||
nt|drewsky: Lets not get carried away.....1@H-2@C-2@H is the normal start|pg||

mc|10|nt|lestergold: Well next is UK pair altho  Malinowski is a world class player hailing from Poland he lives in London|pg||
nt|lestergold: de Botton is the head of her own team and is a well known sponsor but a very experienced high stake money player who Im told is a much improved player in recent times|pg||
nt|xenya: they are in 2nd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still a big gap between 1st and 2nd though |pg||
nt|lestergold: Specs shoudl remember that there is a lot of sponsorship in bridge and without sponsors bridge would literally be very much poorer|pg||
nt|xenya: http://reykjavikbridgefestival.com/index.php?m=D2&id=M_PAIRS2010&iid=IF_OPENPAIRS2010  for running scores|pg||
nt|lestergold: There are several sponsors in the UK but nothing like the scale of things in the US|pg||

nt|ady: south is on lead against 3@S   likely to lead a top heart   so will need to find a quick diamond switch to get it down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 7LTC, E should think he was a favorite to make 3S, so at MPs the double seems in order even though opps are NV. after all, if NS are going to make 4H you have an extremely low ...|pg||
