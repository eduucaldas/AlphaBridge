mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: 2nt probably shows 22-23 hcp|pg||
nt|xenya: i think N was marked with length in @Ds on the lead, which makes finesse even more attractive|pg||
nt|iceking: its standard in sweden to play 2nt stronger and put 20-21 hands into 2clubs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: any idea why North removed to 4@H in the other room after 2NT-3NT?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||

mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: nothing|pg||

nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y a lucky break|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: dont want to lead from honors behind the big NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is mps not right to push for dodgy games|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: it's teams|pg||

nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: 6 spades needs guessing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the youngsters tend to remember these things.  Are NS youngsters?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vinbtech: one of them is surely NOT  he FORGOT ! lol|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|lestergold: now 6 top losers|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the only one i recognise is David Stevenson from Liverpool|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: yes 2h down 4 when 2sp is probably making|pg||
nt|xenya: but 2@D seems to be systemic, and you should be prepared to lose a few imps occasionally if you use the gadget |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|iceking: 2d was both majors |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I used to play that gadget (well, we opened 2@H not 2@D) - but the uncertainty about the degree of fit (as there) got too much   |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: seems a shame it's going down |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: on natural methods there is an argument for an invite of 3S rather than a unilateral 4 but west ould probably decline its quite a good contract but unlucky|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: 11 chunky points and an outside doubleton and also partner has opened second position at unfavourable which means his opening should be robust rather than  light|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: well North didnt have to cash the @C|pg||
