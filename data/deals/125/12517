mb|1H|mb|3C|nt|iceking: 140 is around 45% to NS at the moment|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: low point count slam NS it seems..|pg||
nt|iceking: w will at least go to 5sp |pg||
nt|iceking: probably 6 |pg||
nt|bessi2: he will surely bid 4@c now|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|bessi2: hmm.. 5@s more appropriate if xx in clubs|pg||
nt|iceking: yes|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|wilkinsona: I would have thought 5 spades asks for a club stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: me 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: S really should not pass 3club dbl |pg||
nt|iceking: 4d or 5clubs |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however diamond needed it seems..|pg||
nt|bessi2: south will surely dbl this|pg||
nt|iceking: very very odd |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and dont really see why south didnt mention the suit|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|bessi2: indeed.. as has been pointed out to me 5@c by west would have been a good bid |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: right, heart..|pg||

pc|s2|pc|c8|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
mc|9|nt|iceking: here w didnt think S didnt support clubs probably doesnt have 4 with void in hearts and north had 1d and 5h so ruff with ace of spades has to be wrong|pg||
nt|bessi2: hmm.. he didn't think that through...|pg||
nt|iceking: 300 is around 75% at the moment to NS|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its not an easy hand to judge..|pg||
nt|bessi2: 5@c by west good bid,  but what should it mean.. just void or exclusion blackwood.. i think just void since it is unknown whether he has only hearts or spade fit|pg||
nt|iceking: yes just void so he even almost has value for 6clubs his pd didnt dbl at 3rd level and slam looks very likelly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, but why are NS not bidding up...|pg||
nt|iceking: give pd some sub min hand qj9x x ajxxx jxx and you dont mind that much reach slam |pg||
