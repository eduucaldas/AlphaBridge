nt|rnmalik: Hi MMM:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi RNM!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: hi and welcome to round 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: make that *cant |pg||
nt|sybarra: now to bridge |pg||
nt|lestergold: thats optimistic Shirley|pg||
nt|ady: part score in hearts for n/s  |pg||
nt|sybarra: can they stay out of game?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they should|pg||
nt|ady: I would have tht so|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 opposite 8 no great distribution |pg||
nt|ady: 1H    2H       should end the aucyion    unless e/w get into the action   |pg||
nt|sybarra: South will like hand with the 4 @H  we shall see |pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason at all for anyone other than a certain member of my club who hasnt yet heard of part scores would be in game|pg||
nt|sybarra: i @H, p 2 @H and W may decide to bid 2 nt  |pg||
nt|lestergold: so push them to 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: we see that game is actually only a bit less than 50%|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: part score   likely 1NT   e/w|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: E/W are playing prec|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: it is not the worse game any of us have been in |pg||
nt|ady: with the spades coming in for 4 tricks  4@H then is only on trump finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: about 40% but not biddable|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: but I start with 2 @H also |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ady: maybe 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: rehi Gudni!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: With N hand I would prefer opening 1@D and now 4@C to avoid the reverse|pg||
nt|sybarra: as predicted :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well not a very fascinating hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I would've bid 4 H as E 1st round|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 @C was 16+ any|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: oh I see thanks|pg||
nt|lestergold: not likely to produce swings|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: please|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: I wonder if declarer will play the spades 4-2 on the bidding    should not really as if spades dont break still can get J@C right|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we can hardly keep the specs interested with hands like this taking a day to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch has solved all problems|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: yawn |pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c4|nt|xenya: well W rates to be richer in high cards, so it looks natural to go for a @H finesse|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed have a feeling he will get this right|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: an endplay is possible but that comes down to the same thing|pg||

nt|mmmakela: ????|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -2 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes been fixed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can some fun happen EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: N/S can manage 3N|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: from the N side |pg||
nt|sybarra: (best)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not wasting time in the bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: easy 3 nt/4 H/ 5 @C NS here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes, 12 tricks in @h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mmmakela: not 4 H, club ruffs|pg||
nt|lestergold: feom either side a spade 2h  a club 5 dims however there is the losing option of the club finesse rather than heart unlikely with the intervention|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: NS are in the right contract and that is what matters|pg||
nt|ady: can see 8  unless there is a throw-in to get 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: 1NT 2-3 controls and force normaly|pg||
nt|sybarra: deep breath and a @H hook? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (or close eyes) |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vinbtech: not everybody's 1H OC for sure|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: again nothing really to the hand in practice ducking spades for a couple of rounds means that  a heart to the ten  even if it lost east would be out of spades|pg||
nt|ady: sorry with heart hookd 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: strange overcall by south|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: however could be entry problems in that case|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: you was right Frank!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: I don´t think there is any problems to make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still some communication problems. @H is best at E|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: say the heart was wrong then east would get in and switch to a club. the @d A would have already been used to take heart finesse then there would be no further entry to cash the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: thrid heart after the ace had been unblocked|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|ady: this looks like it will drift down 1 |pg||
nt|ady: big pressure on west  running 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: every card  is on side and @h 3-2|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: so in fact declarer does actually need the  heart finesse to be righjt on best defence|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: might be able to produce an end play on south|pg||
nt|ady: play remaining trumps now  |pg||
pc|c5|pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: For running scores: http://www.swangames.com/magic/magic/www.php?csm=Match&nsid=239|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: still one trick short with that|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y but still will be a trick short; E getting squeezed before S does|pg||
nt|ady: only real hope is 3 club tricks    and that is not there|pg||
nt|vinbtech: the endplay will produce only the 9th trick|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: E can claim 0|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability west could have bid missing one of the side Ks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: so declare still has something to think about|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: nice play|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||

nt|lestergold: option|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: e/w will likely reach 4@S       may be tough to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure n/s can handle much more that 1 nt  +1 |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 nt|pg||

pc|cK|pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: now a spade in case E has @C A|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 18 (you and I have mentioned)  can not follow play on movie, but my guess is he took @H hook |pg||

nt|sybarra: 4 @S (fast arrival) to shut the bidding OFF|pg||
nt|lestergold: easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: however perhaps 3n is the better contract because i has play when spades do not break which is lets face it most of the time|pg||

pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: can make now with @S guess|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ady: not sure 3NT comfortable if spades dint break  even after no heart lead   heart switch from north may do damage    may just lose 2 clubs and 3 hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes going for a safe route to tenm tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sA|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: now its is irrelevant whether spades breal or not|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: nasty problem for North|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: not clear for everyone what 4d should mean here choice of games another option and would be popular for many|pg||
nt|daman: he had no reason not o|pg||
nt|daman: to*|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: that's not the lead that hurts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may help|pg||
nt|iceking: still not home or|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: well he had a choice i think between 7 very good clubs and 5 bad spades|pg||
nt|iceking: yes i agree i think i would have bid 4clubs here with north hand not 3sp|pg||
nt|daman: he only had 6 @Cs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: sorry, 6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|iceking: this looks like in trouple for sure |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S would still leave room for 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: they looked like 7 :)|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont think he can make this down 1 for sure |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: no, the breaks are just too bad|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: very tricky, yes|pg||
nt|daman: tricky   but not enough tricks|pg||

nt|ady: 7NT best|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 7S is doomed|pg||
nt|ady: just have to avoid 7 spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: of course S thinks E has more than 1 dia|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: last board today|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Last for today and more to come tomorrow. THX all|pg||
nt|lestergold: here is achance for n/s NOT to bid a dodgy slam and gain imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzcx: yes start tomorrow 11 gmt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzcx: 11 am Icelandic time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not awful ruffing finesse in clubs or ruffing out K@c would make unfortunately neither working here|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 2S mean here?|pg||
nt|lml: hi Mike good morning|pg||
nt|ady: on the face of it not that bad a slam    both hearts and clubs break badly|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi LInda welcome |pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Linda|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|lml: I would be quite happy to be in slam for sure|pg||
nt|lml: until the end of the hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|mmmakela: 3 hearts limit here |pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok so north never bid anything|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with the bid 1@S @H never came in play-S could DBL 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: not in my book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Guöni for exselent work. Thx also to all specs and Ralf|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: last board of this round and then lunch break|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the trump holdings can be weakened also in the communication and ruffing process here even when lub ruffs out|pg||
nt|ady: if south had K@H instead of K@D    then excellent slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: we will start after 14:45 Icelandic time on round 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes then settinmg up the hearts becomes much more viable line|pg||
nt|lml: still its better than 50% even as it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: betetr no Linda i dont think so|pg||
nt|lml: well the ruffing finesse is 50%|pg||
nt|lml: and if trump break you can try to ruff the club out at least once|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but then trumps may break 4/0 and cause problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes it less than 50%|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ady: wont end in spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but could bid 2 hearts now|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|rnmalik: with this quality of @S I would DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: more likely in C|pg||
nt|lestergold: also west may be short clubs holding A9xx over dummy with short clubs|pg||
nt|ady: hand 23 6@D=2 cost 13 imps  though  the 4@S could have beden beaten on 10@D lead|pg||
nt|lml: well I dont think so.  I think the other chances are enough and you may handle a 4-0 spade break.  I will work it out later and maybe blog it|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now they helped defence for -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: All OK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think 5NT must show 3 controls and Q@C   or a 6th club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: choise of 7 clubs understandable  west cannot know of spade queen in east hand |pg||
nt|vinbtech: thats the last board for this round i guess|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and pass partners club response?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its not a lot less but it is less for sure|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: I dont know but I will later today.  Too hard to do on the fly|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is not one of the distributions that works|pg||
nt|lestergold: if you assume that its 50 50 i the only consideration is a finesse position than its less than 50 i any other possibility could lose a trick even the possibility of a 6/0 heart ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: break and a n early ruff count as reducing the odds|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he duck this?  does it do any good?|pg||
nt|lml: you will just have to read my blog to see what I come up with|pg||
nt|lml: no it doesnt really help to duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: clearly here there are possible problems other than rudffing out the club and dissapointingly and not sutrprisingly they are in the slam|pg||
nt|lml: he needs the club suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i will read your blog bu the way itsw a horrible word(blog) and my English teachers never taught me it whenI was at school|pg||
nt|lml: if he spades spots were a tenny bit better he might be able to crossruff for 8 tricks but not here|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like bog with an l|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|vinbtech: ty all; and goodbye|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes --|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: may need a ruff  or maybe set up spades in a club contract to make 13 tricks|pg||
nt|vinbtech: ty BBO ; ty Iceland Express BF|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: thx for watching|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@D at S?|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|ady: in a mess here even if K@C is rt|pg||
nt|lml: well he hoped that hearts might work and if not he would try the ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: thank you David thats what ive been trying to tell Linda but she insists shell blog us out of that idea|pg||
nt|ady: now trump back and cant maked other than stiff K@C|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In that eventuality P would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: next round will start in 10-15 min compering time schedule|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why? say he has 2-3 4-4 with xxxx in dias, then he bids 2 clubs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|h6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: the communication problems were always potentially there on thi  hand with the unrobust spade suit|pg||
