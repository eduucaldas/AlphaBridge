mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're headed for an easy 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|joemanjo: EW play stong club|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: NS okay Standard methods|pg||
pc|cK|nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: apologies, alerts in the wrong place.|pg||
nt|lestergold: A duck of this club- a continuation will lead to an overtrick|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes shd be a flat bd which is a good news for Khandelwals|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible without @C system for north to be declarer, but on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|joemanjo: +120 in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: tricks missed due to late start....catching up with the score|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: short @S and not min|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: now that E sees that he set up the spades, he has to start grabbing tricks before losers can be pitched|pg||
nt|kaapo: Clubs will easily bring enough tricks for EW and luckily South hasn't got too high a heart in order to get a chance to play twice through West|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries, N must try to get to partner's hand again for another @H through|pg||
nt|col3435: if East is showing his shape this could turn out well|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ten tricks on top and 2 diamond ruffs bring it to twelve. 4-0 clubs shouldn't do much harm|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joemanjo: Both sides play Standard with variations|pg||
pc|sA|nt|burypies: tajemnicza 8@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully 4@H was alerted too :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or are they playing with screens?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Edwin a highly respected senior founded and was co owner of my club for some twenty years|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: needs C A right here for starters,now might even make this akward contract|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kaapo: North might have some slam ambitions, if there are no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: north has shown 1-4 in majors with 5+@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack, Staffan|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play...c\will claim at the end|pg||
nt|joemanjo: All cards are favourable, lack of entries in West hand is the immediate issue. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcphee: all over now|pg||
nt|varange: Ralf Willquist will be able to fill us in on most of the play as he knows the players|pg||
nt|varange: and our operator at the venue, Steffan, will keep us updated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake to reach 6@s here. -2 if they can find the @c ruff on NS|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|burypies: Weijknis wiedzia³ ze 2! to dwukolorówka?|pg||
nt|burypies: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: tak wyjanione przed wistem|pg||
nt|burypies: je¿eli tak powinien zagraæ D@d|pg||
nt|burypies: wiedzia³ ¿e  rozgrywaj¹cy ma singla @d|pg||
nt|kaapo: I believe NS play 2-way club. North would open 1@C with 11-13 balanced, so he has kind of maximum|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I surely would because now 1 @S was forcing in my book and he passed!|pg||
nt|kaapo: I tried commentating in Swedish too, but my typing was a bit too slow in that language. I might do better now that PO is playing, though ;)|pg||
nt|varange: should be bid - ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I doubt even Roland would approve of this one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no screens, no alert since swedish rules say no alerting above 3nt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kaapo: Ok, then no alerts beyond 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: opps had probably got the idea by that point anyway :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kaapo: A kib suggests that 4@H was RKC in clubs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will end up making 5@S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|varange: what systems do they play Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Staffan!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North may be AshiM Mukherjee - if so he is a player in the Indian Railways B team.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Eginton has been a major figure in bridge and bridge administration for many years was recently chai of England selectors.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|col3435: mm. So presumably 3@h showed 4414 exactly|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|xenya: should make with a careful play though, and he is on the right track|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|col3435: easy with spades breaking - but how would you play if South had five?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: strong @c from both pairs  - Staffan?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW does and I thing NS too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, strong club, 17+, from both as far as i can see|pg||
nt|kaapo: The web site for the tournament is here http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Edwin is endplayed here |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores there too|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump and @C hook |pg||
nt|xenya: but this line fails -- |pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why he decided to shorten himself in trumps, losing control|pg||
nt|joemanjo: a club ruff and favourable trump break seals the contract for East|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|varange: NT is 14-16?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: guess does not matter as Ashim has only 2 @HS|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kaapo: It's very normal in Sweden to play 3rd and 5th leads, even against notrumps. Nyström - Wrang seem not to do it, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I would say most swedes play 3rd-5th vs suit and 4th vs NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kaapo: And you can see that it's quite close in the top|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
mc|11|nt|mmmakela: u right Kari 1c includes 10-12 nt so I take back my words|pg||
nt|hlortz: e was endplayed in 3 suits - unusual that|pg||
nt|lestergold: had to give overtrick onme way or the other west could have played a diamond i think that prevents the endplay|pg||

mb|1S!|an|diamonds|nt|athene: cautious pass from south - 1@H looks the mainstream action|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D!|an|weakest way to bid 3!d|nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a major|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcmax: East would have to avoid a passive trump lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a<nd shows 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is specifically diamonds - and has to be, surely, for 3@D not to be insane :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jcmax: South's original pass now made a fit-showing 3@H bid very easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Only the vulnerability deterred South from bidding 1@H.|pg||
nt|jcmax: When you don't bid a suit at a lower level given the opportunity, but then bit it later at a higher level, it usually means fit with partner's suit|pg||
nt|daman: a backhanded fit-jump|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Both sides have four losers in their short suits.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and the favoriates are trailing makes it more interesting|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW partnership is quite a long standing one in Indian Bridge. East, Mr Ashok Goel is the CEO of Dhampur Sugar Mills and sponsor for their team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: scores updated|pg||
nt|joemanjo: hi all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi manoj|pg||
nt|joemanjo: good start by the trailing team chalking up 10 of the deficit in the first board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: heart back only delays it i think|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Raju|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: yes, 26 imps can be found in 14 boards without doing much more than playing good bridge and getting a little lucky to have active hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score battle N/S can make a lucky 3S e/w 3 of a minor|pg||
mb|2H|an|good raise of clubs|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
mb|3C|an|good raise of hearts|nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
nt|joemanjo: u can follow this tourney at the following website|pg||
nt|joemanjo: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Yashwant_Rao_Holkar/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 4@S may be reached here too. |pg||
mb|d|an|shows good clubs|nt|lestergold: and Howard trumps the unassuming cue bid with one of his own!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes subhash took a not so unreasonable line rather than Relying on 50% @H Q in|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious no 1@s overcall by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: N-s have a good @S partial|pg||
nt|joemanjo: ah that 3@s made it simple|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Had East not opened, NS may have wandered into a 4@s game.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now they may settle in @s partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 4C undoubled is actually a good result for one off for E/W|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am told NS play VERY sound overcalls - and it surely seems so|pg||
nt|joemanjo: wow|pg||
nt|joemanjo: good lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4C x is par something that is not often achieved at the table|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but any ruff By E will only promote a trunmp for def|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW Bidding will certainly help the declarer in bringing off the 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @C lead or shift wud restrict to 3 or else 4 makable|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C makes but it's not great. It takes more than the heart finesse|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: That's a *really* positional style|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|varange: choices choices|pg||
nt|xenya: all S's honours work and he knows it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo: @H8 looked discouraging|pg||
nt|chick: club switch still isn't clear though|pg||

pc|h6|nt|chick: W might Q-ask |pg||
nt|kaapo: In case I was about right about the early bids, 3@H could be a re-tranafer and 3NT some kind of slam try follows by two cue bids|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist had an even more straightforward sequence to 7@H|pg||
nt|col3435: but here west shows out, and if he allows the @h7 to score it's all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: west has the option of discarding 2 diamonds on the 3rd and 4th round of spade, denying the 6of H to score|pg||

pc|cT|nt|ryskiel_: moimi prywatnymi faworytami s¹ licytacje sprzedajace te same walory po kilkakroæ|pg||

mb|d|nt|varange: and hearts|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: trf to @H this 4@D I guess|pg||
nt|joemanjo: maybe not, @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: so 1D shows nothing about @Ds but atleast 1 or both Majors|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a 2@S doubled made by bappa in Other room making things difficult for MMS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo: Unlikely they'd get that high, though, unless really pushed|pg||
nt|mcphee: does the 2@S bid show game interest for @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S was pass/correct. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@D, I believe, shows about 11-16 with 4+@D and an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: N will expect partner to have @s singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-15 actually|pg||
nt|mcphee: or just an invitation + for @H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but @d is better|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do i start with a Roland slam :) ?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: dont think subhsah will take any action|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: supp dbl in spades|pg||
nt|chick: do you suppose 1@H is transfer advance showing spades?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nyström made a slight overbid with 4@D, but his @DAQ had grown in strength over 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Wrang explained the 4@D wrong it seems, 4@D showed game forcing without short D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: with spade support of course|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D Multi, showing a weak two in either of the majors (or perhaps some strong hand)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1nt denies Major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|othered1: Nicely j udged lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with this slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually a good slam... need only to find @Hq|pg||
nt|joemanjo: xfer helped there, else spade lead wd immediately put trumps under pressure.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes for sure|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kaapo: Ok, some downgrading due to singleton J|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D limits the hand further down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: max 14-15 |pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks are available, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's around 50%, not bad at all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe even better with the 9 card fit|pg||
nt|joemanjo: whew|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bowles is not finding the world's greatest leads at present|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: now @d are 2-2, but if 3-1?|pg||
nt|varange: better slams are those that make :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: super fast play - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I am sure that DBL was intended as competitive but was left in assuming penalty|pg||
nt|othered1: East's sound opening may cover west's quick trickless double.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E knew 4-3 spades but didn't have a better option|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice 4@H bid from PO|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a correct point of view, but not fair in all aspects:)|pg||
nt|varange: <-- being facetious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's 53%, singleton queen or 2-2, but ....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe north shd have started a cuebid with 3@S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: can survive DD tuff tho|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzbf: to zadzwoñ do niego i powiedz :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: declarer well placed here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzpx: 4@H showed a good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps West could bid a minor suit to suggest a maximum with hearts?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 8 teams remain in the top division so there's lot to play for even for Örebridgen. They're currently 6th, 4.5 VPs ahead of the 8th positioned team|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores via http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|suketbombi: lead is not bad here and subhash has 2 entries to short Trump the dummy  but can get 2 Hearts and @D if correctly played|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: lots of good slams fails - and some bad ones make - i for 1 bid far to many  slams|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|varange: how would one know when one bids too many slams?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: That lead is good. Now 10 wll be difficult.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room, West doubled 2@S and his poor partner is now in 2NT, mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow u have the %s at the tip of your fingers Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskey - play out of turn - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know when to bid my 12.89% slams|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has not much options unless he thinks @HS are 4-4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has to try the @S finnesse first to know his target of @D tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: no one did, this hand is a nightmare in any contract|pg||
nt|col3435: (and 5VPs ahead of 9th)|pg||
nt|lestergold: It was ugly but he is  justc about minimum for that bid to be permitted it doesn promise a goodm hand just a courtesy repsponse upwards with support for the unbid suits|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: bo tylko siê Wacek denerwuje :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well clubs are 3-2 and the A right|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kaapo: I'm not very fond of West's 2@S but perhaps that was another small deception: he was trying to convince NS they should go to 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably depends on what north things their lead style would imply here.    To my eyes, 7 is an interesting card|pg||
nt|joemanjo: thgt spade wd come back|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d2|nt|mcphee: one entry short to make 6 I think|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|burypies: jak siê k³óci to widaæ ¿e nie kuma to po co dzwoniæ|pg||
nt|kaapo: Interesting treatment. I've seen someone use 4@C and 4@D here as support bids, one promising @D cue, the other denying|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|kaapo: He could squeeze East if nothing else works (double dummy) :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: dble dummy yes, or last resort|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Ma trzy dojcia do sto³u - 11 lew powinno byc|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if he ducks this will get a @D back and has to decide|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now cakewalk|pg||
nt|othered1: doubling does let partner infer on other hands that you have absolutley nothing or a trap pass :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: if so, it certainly worked :)|pg||

nt|suketbombi: bridge made easy by subhash|pg||

nt|mmmakela: now big problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: i would say he had big problems from the start... :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: W is worried about 6 @s's from N, perhaps?|pg||

nt|jcmax: @SQ looks like quite an obvious singleton.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might be vaguely thinking about scissors coup ideas - throwing dummy's spades on diamonds to stop the south entry|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|mc|9|nt|daman: an exciting push|pg||
nt|athene: well, Coyle didn't put his partner under pressure and/or give west a chance to duck in clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: North avoided one problem that Bill mentioned, by leading a low club instead of the queen.|pg||
nt|athene: he had the whole defence planned out at trick 1|pg||
nt|daman: exactly    making no mistakes|pg||
nt|daman: a wily veteran|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the first half in this room coming up in just a moment. Many thanks to Guy Hart, our splendid operator at TGR's in London|pg||
nt|daman: yes  Bravo Guy|pg||

nt|chick: that will be flat I think ... should be in 3N and cannot make without xray vision|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm i may have x-ray, but i see 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|yuval10: even after J@c has won :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: That had some potential for our first swing board|pg||
nt|kaapo:  15 was push: down one in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can make 6@S even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then again maybe 3@H was weak|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@H=4@H with 0-6 hcp.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 3@H less than 6 pts-- then it was an underbid to my eyes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@C by e-w makable here|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW can reach a thin 4@h here.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: we can now say Great performance by MMS specialy Vijay Bhaiya playing Throughout  in a 4 member team but are now tired and to me the match is over I dare say|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: Bowles did indeed bid 3NT with a singleton king|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvid: 1@D is 4+ and always unbalanced|pg||
nt|chick: in the previous hand?|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite an interesting hand here|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: naprawdê Misiak z Antoniewiczem bardzo dobrze graj¹ |pg||

nt|kaapo: Another friendly layout?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kaapo: For EW in a contract declared ny East|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N must save|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will be a easy  hand for declarer with everything working|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win the ace. Ruff one heart after giving up one and squeeze South in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may get to 3 nt here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no singleton?|pg||
nt|othered1: do you repoen as easat?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: closed room auction may be repeated here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Would you overcall 3@C?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@C is showing the majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: this one is nice 3N if they can bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: Staffan does wisely and concentrates on the board actually being played. That's a good advice for any bridge player :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now tough for S|pg||
nt|frankaus: now the save|pg||
nt|kaapo: If NS are good guessers, they could make 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s looks like a fair-chance contract but both A@D offside and 4-1 trump will doom it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dbl or 2@C graham ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, either could be right. 2@C has the advantage of bidding the good suit... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 12-15 no major or 4-3-3-3 if there is a major|pg||
nt|joemanjo: oh well |pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: raz Witek siê pogubi³ na tej rozgrywce ale ogólnie naprawdê bardzo dobrze|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that was about today's snooker match|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S promising 10-12 NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will W balance?|pg||
nt|chick: I would|pg||
nt|arvid: I would|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess I would too|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unapparently 4@C is asking to pick a major|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass  at 50s would be my action 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not the expected one|pg||
nt|kaapo: 10 down = 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: -10  = 500|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 H dbld cheaper|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes but hard to  be certain its not 800|pg||
nt|mmmakela: come on after 4 @C!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, win @SA, then ruff a @H and eventually there is a squeeze against S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @C for me anyday|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a trf to @C if superaccepted even 4@S on a carefull handling will make|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kaapo: The web site (mostly in Swedish) is here somewhere: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S to queen, then run 7|pg||
nt|othered1: would be nice if west can bid 2@D for longer suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@C is majors  2@D pick yours|pg||
nt|suketbombi: dont think kamal will move here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: would you?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after the pause is a club lead ethical?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But just 50 each|pg||
nt|col3435: ok, I guess even on three rounds of diamonds declarer would probably go down there.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Subash no doubt thought he always can put Satya back to @c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: 2@D was some kind of Multi: showing a weak two bid in either major (or possibly some strong hand)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they will land in 2@h now instead of 2@s, if S had opened with 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South has all the important cards. @CQJ and @HKQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Is south thinking of doing something?  Did north's original pass show some values?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: time for red card|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: Po przepuszczeniu @H Damy Kasprzak zmieni³ wista na @S !!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@H was a simple reverse, a little light but with nice 3-card support for partner and great controls|pg||
nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||
nt|varange: friendly breaks either way|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he guess it that would be something :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double shows the three-suiter and is possibly more flexible, and would therefore score 10/10 in a bidding competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 5 - game missed at othert table as well|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt knowing there is a minor fit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y e-w play Demicoma 1nt denies 4 card major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: it is about a 50% game after pd gived you full 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not sure, 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|suketbombi: only interest left is to know who is that +1 which Subhash will call up and tell me:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|abunio: raz tez Misiak umozliwil piekna rozgrywke, ale na pewno niebyl to blad prosty|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if Lebens this promises values(3@C)|pg||
nt|mcphee: they blew n/s out of 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C is only 5-card - d is best|pg||
nt|hawe45:  D|pg||
nt|othered1: "Knowing" may be a bit strong, if south could have 4=3=3=3 with 4-card major|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok but they got 4 for there 200|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 9 IMPs gift to trailing team|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but with these suit discrepancies I would bid 2@C - always a good overcall of 1@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes that is rare N is known to take chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so then very nice auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: will be nervous about the @D situation|pg||
nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
nt|joemanjo: lol|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton @S lead will beat 4@H looks like|pg||
nt|lestergold: This can be beaten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it actually should be|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unlucky of course as its a very good contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he has only 3 carder @S and a very weak 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will do very well to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: everyone is happy here|pg||
nt|hlortz: if n later leads Q@C and w ducks S will need to rise Ace to give the ruff.|pg||
nt|lestergold: good point|pg||
nt|hlortz: tho prehaps just clearing 3 rounds of trump will leave declarer a @D loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: but south should be able to count west's hand for a stiff club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but, on the bidding, he may well do so - no, he has gone passive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's good - being happy is better than being miserable|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now @d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|burypies: a przeciwnicy siê szarpi¹ |pg||
nt|kaapo: How do you like 2@D (either direct or in the pass out seat)?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|lestergold: Eggers thought lead from QJ holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: What is Howard thinking about?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: S can discard it on 3rd C(DQ)|pg||
nt|varange: keyboard stuck?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: very risky|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kamal Mukherjee has been 1 of the top Indian players for a long, long time..|pg||
nt|joemanjo: both sides playing with 4 members. guess some of the Bridge is part of the strain of continuous play|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzpx: 7 and K is pretty far from eachother... |pg||

nt|frankaus: need to go soon  - dinner time here tu for your company|pg||
nt|varange: thanks Frank|pg||
nt|varange: what's for dinner?|pg||

nt|varange: ah OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: sunday is not epicurian - quice + frankfurt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and my money is on him to pull off this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: play out of turn...will claim at the end.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play out of turn? We have heard that before. They can't keep doing that, surely|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what a pity... great hand for timing in declarer play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You lost the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: yes...dummy played before his own turn|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: play 2 @C and then the 2nd @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but east can take the @Ha and clear @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @S ruff in Dummy will promote def trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joemanjo: Did Satya expect only 4 trumps with Kamal?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|col3435: that would take some good guessing too :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after the 2@d bid i think it's normal line|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps you can go for TX @d as well....you have to chose|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @D10 singleton is useful |pg||

nt|othered1: What was that play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskeyed....claim at the end.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie well, should make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assumoing South plays low from dummy, there will be a Resticted Choice position on the next round of trumps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Principle of Restricted Choice= 10 imps in the Out column |pg||
nt|suketbombi: we are stuck here?|pg||

nt|jcmax: @S means: please don't!|pg||
nt|athene: that club split enabled declarer to play his avoidance and time it correctly|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@Hs on a @S guess played by Subhash if trumps 3-2 can try for @C Q 3 times before commiting to the @S guess not a bad slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT seems an interesting choice - I was thinking about 2NT or 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they won't get any here I fancy - this looks the flattest 4@S imaginable |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashok is likely to pass this|pg||

nt|varange: that 4NT+2 got them 11 imps; 7@d-1 at the other table|pg||
nt|joemanjo: East has an easy defense if he starts off with @h honour|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead can hold 3N to 4|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: I have to leave you now, Graham|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx all and happy viewing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Sunil|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sveta Bodrenkova|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cheers Sunil|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all, hi Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: 2 down without breathing hard and more if declarer discards wrong.|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't like 1@D opening, but perhaps it's forced if you are not prepared to support  1@S response|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tuff options for N here 3nt works fine here but|pg||
nt|suketbombi: crucial bd can be 13 imps here or there|pg||
nt|suketbombi: pick a slam happy to be in 6@H|pg||
nt|joemanjo: a heavy balancing postiion 1N in the other room by East when 1@S was passed around|pg||
nt|joemanjo: That put paid to all game ambitions there|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: 1@s by³by w stylu Darlesu:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: zasuwaj¹ tak, ¿ebym nie nad¹¿y³...|pg||
nt|kaapo: I might open 4NT if that shows both minors too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C probably a precision-like bid showing 5-6 clubs and a 4 card major|pg||
nt|varange: one of our specs is having confit du canard - hmmmm, yummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps best lead. declarer has to do all the work himself|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: nice and neutral|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You have to bid 3@H, really.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Lebensohl is a very good gimmick that can be used in many various situations|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really like this?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 down on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D X will be a poor compensation for NS|pg||
nt|col3435: ah, the danger of bidding grands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, the players at the other table knew about the 6-2 in @d and bid 7. Bridge isnt fair... :)|pg||
nt|varange: dontcha hate it when underbids get the imps?|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah multi|pg||
nt|hlortz: nah..|pg||
nt|hlortz: ok 18-20 bal or 4by1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: It's a nearly perfect fit NS, and neither one knows about the other's singleton|pg||
nt|varange: too true Staffan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may get a @S lead and atrick wud be returned in @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: a perfectly normal contract but the 5/1 diamond break means declarer has to look for a ninth trick elsewhere|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: nice stab for n/s, just no tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe he can work some end play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and how W has to attack trumps immediately|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  showed 4 Hearts and up to 10 hcp|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the vital imp|pg||
nt|othered1: We're going through some relays and responses, it seems.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: there are various combitions available to Ashim this will take long for sure|pg||
nt|suketbombi: combinations |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @S underlead certain:0|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sumit will do it on this auction|pg||
nt|joemanjo: nice lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: quite a bid in red with W hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: start with @CK:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :(|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now satya on his own here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will try for @C q three times and then close his eyes and Guess @ss|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if only Ashim had made that cold 4@S the match wud have been closer good lead satya will be welcomed by T|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @ST from Subhash|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: i kart nie pokazuj¹, które zagrywaj¹, chyba siê obra¿ê :)|pg||
nt|varange: they're playing this in 1NT East at the other table and the 4@h was lead|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Satya had only 3 suits to lead from. Either @h or @c wd have given the tempo away.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|burypies: wytrzymaj do koñca|pg||
nt|abunio: dawac po lapach!!!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|varange: led|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will que bid 4@D now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: he may survive it|pg||
nt|chick: N needs to cash his @HA to avoid crashing it with one of S's honors|pg||
nt|chick: it looks like a good hand, but still have to trust partner|pg||
nt|arvid: good lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: should try @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is hopeless of course|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh ace asking:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|chick: then switch to a spade and start tapping declarer|pg||
nt|arvid: now this will be 4 or 5 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I´ve played several speedys and I am used to winning speedys :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: in @C presumably before defenders establish 5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: either 4 or 1 @s.... looks like P not an option|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to keep the loss as minimal as possible|pg||
pc|d6|nt|varange: bye bye diamond loser|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: y, 1nt-8-13, 2H-4@H 8-10, 2nt no @S support|pg||
nt|suketbombi: next please|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3 idiots led a @C there I guess and got caught in a @C @s sq to allow 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: elsewhere only really being lubs|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: I agree with you there, Markku|pg||
nt|chick: leb is a convention that no one should be without.  it seems a bit complex at first look, but it is extremely valuable|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: tricks missed claiming at the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortuantyely the defenders will get to 5 tricks first|pg||
nt|hlortz: y 2@H 2@C 1@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: eggsactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: declarer can't even do an avoidance play to get west on lea with no hearts left|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Lebensohl.html|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sorry this was too easy:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kaapo: I thought you might be good at it ;)|pg||
nt|chick: needs to duck and hope for KQ10 in W|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 4@C donno but looks like aces |pg||
nt|suketbombi: must be the only way to allow 7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: because east has SA as an entry anyway|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: after S's 4 H N just can't dbl imho, must bid 5/6 H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzpx: last time Ida Grönkvist picked me out for a speedy knowing i was the fastest one around... and we sure won at 67% too :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: The idea in a Speedy Gonzales bridge competition is that there's only a ridiculously short time per board to play|pg||
nt|arvid: sorry only 3, but much more difficult for east-west if south is declarer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will concede 2 tricks ina hurry to make 5|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|mcphee: this lets them show where they live as defenders|pg||
nt|yuval10: needed to play @d for -1, it seem|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Babesh quick to encourage @Ss|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: time to cash 3 dias|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will test @S once break you have 8 tricks in bag strip squeeze the @@@C bidder  but not here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: imo S shd have 4 spades here if not strong enough to bid forward after pds 2 @S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|varange: it'll make on the throw-in|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: N made a practical bid -- as many would i think|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tie here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: Couldn´t N see that he should be endplayed and won @d9 with @dA?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 5 IMPs for Skalman on board 17: 4@S without a double in the open|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2 @Hs 2@DS and 2 @S to loose|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo: Yes, was rather aggressive take out double|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|suketbombi: so only 2 imps good rescue by satya 1@S dbl wud have been 500|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @HK and @D exit he is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskeyed-claiming at the end|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: that's a very good clue, by the way.... when a defender cashes the trump A and then switches, it's often a singleton, so you can figure you have a bad split|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes W knows all the cards now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Running scores, tider och annan info: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||

nt|kaapo: Board 17 was 5 IMPs for Näsby. They made 1NT in both rooms (in Open with an over trick)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sorry, here with OT|pg||
nt|joemanjo: East gave up after the lead.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: N was showing @Ss & @Cs, so should he pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spade 7 might come to value here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sry, this was partly in Swedish, no big deal I hope|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not originally Cornelia, just clubs|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: no hurry of course |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: and S did right by ruffing low|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d9|nt|kaapo: Either 6+@C or 5 and a major, is the usual even though a bit outdated style in strong/2-way club systems|pg||

nt|chick: defenders and declarer both played that very well|pg||
nt|mmmakela: EW has done quite well internationally lately|pg||
nt|chick: I'll bet it means, the info is here :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sylvan keeps getting a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would bid 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: Aces and singleton a re great combination|pg||
nt|varange: 4@sE in the OR|pg||
nt|varange: and another interesting layout ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: players taking a break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: could be that vital imp to texan aces here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 2 smokers there|pg||
nt|othered1: another easy game, likely making 4 since there's no clear reason to guess trumps correctly|pg||
nt|othered1: And no reason to overbid, unless somehow @D are thought to provide tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: auction will be 1@H- 2@H  and W will settle for 4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even if E gets agressive with a Nt will get a 2@D response and will bid 3@H but sighn off after the que bid from W|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: awaiting S at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: resuming play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no dhampur ahead |pg||
nt|vugraphzck: E thought the contract was 6 nt and claimed by error|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Satya's lead saved the board for his teammates less than accurate closed room bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: hmm 1@c?|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 3!N has no play even if @Cs are 2-2|pg||
nt|joemanjo: we shd see action on this one|pg||
mb|1D|nt|suketbombi: too too strong for the multi 2@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will rst in 4@H now|pg||
nt|suketbombi: rest|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1NT seems fine on the East cards|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he's a girl's best friend :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is about 11-16 with 4+@D and suggests an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: 19 @S nice card for S hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: shall i ask him cornelia? :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Surprising no pre-empt from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, @c and some strenght against @s and distribution |pg||
nt|suketbombi: the old trusted 3nt best here for N-S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@D a great and a superior slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S could bud an optimistic 3N here 24 combined with 5 card  susts around and good intermediates|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: 3 good spades|pg||
nt|kaapo: East has an interesting opening bid choice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes he decided to underbid this|pg||
mb|d|nt|col3435: on bd6, if East continued hearts, declarer would probably play another club with West showing out. Then west would be marked with all the cards in spades and diamonds, and it seems ...|pg||
nt|col3435: declarer could throw him in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has plenty to raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you six-card major is raised - bid game|pg||
mb|1S|an|denies 3 hearts|nt|burypies: lewy policzyl , ma wysiadywac nadróbkê?|pg||
nt|abunio: 5584519|pg||
nt|chick: only partscores available here|pg||
nt|chick: 2N lebensohl again|pg||
nt|mmmakela: leb again|pg||
nt|chick: asking partner to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@S I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW reached their limit, what about NS?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Jm has not finished:(|pg||
nt|othered1: but west has done more and east has a maximum, so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: would you show majs or treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: strange pass by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You can understand why South bids 3@D, even though imho it is an overbid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashim will stick? any way 4nt makes too|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will attack with @Ds knowing Thak|pg||
nt|joemanjo: everyone had something to say so far|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately 9 tricks shouldnt be available on reasonable defence|pg||
mb|1N|nt|varange: can you explain Ralf?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, push-em-up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...onward and possibly upward.... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes K bendre is Kaustub Bendre and in Kibz bendre is his father|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and direct 3 @C promising pos values|pg||
nt|chick: "transfer" implies that you have the suit.   in this case, it's more like a "relay" to clubs, with many possible hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: East had a very maximal hand and support for whatever suit West has and tries for game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tries?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, Cornelia, but many play real transfers in this position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: East though seems unaware of that his partner has made a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Your using keyboard input, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: *You're|pg||
nt|frankaus: nil vul is not so good to preempt|pg||
nt|kaapo: I didn't expect 2NT if EW play strong club, but I guess it's still an option|pg||
nt|mmmakela: grandmaproof 3 nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West takes the bait|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy 200?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking hard|pg||
nt|suketbombi: in good time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but seriously, East only bid 2@H |pg||
nt|suketbombi: safe to release ot this wud be 10 or even 1 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: N-E discussing|pg||
nt|suketbombi: e checking weather 3nt implied any @H support  N says Search Me:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|abunio: sorry, private|pg||
nt|burypies: w jakim kierunku zmierzaja?|pg||
nt|chick: majors|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S lead will bring the 8th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: And if there are 8 there are 9, as the saying goes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's teams, so not that important - as long as South is not tempted to bid 3@S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Asihm's dbl with singlesuited hand in the first round put him in a spot later|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: A ³adsna? Warto dzwoniæ?|pg||
nt|chick: in competitive bidding, I think need to give as many options to partner as you can|pg||
nt|kaapo: 800 may have been very expensive, because EW's 4@S didn't seem easy at all|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C strong - 1@D weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, but looking at the wrong hand as well... :)|pg||
nt|varange: says he, belatedly :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could expect partner with relatively long @c and @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: oh ok|pg||
mb|3N|nt|abunio: nie, do mojej mamy:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: O, sorry...|pg||
nt|chick: if pard is not intereted, then can bid hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: another friendly layout 4@D 2@C 1@H 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|col3435: very much so :)|pg||
nt|col3435: nice though|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: double showed @Hs -- it would seem natural to bid your @S at that point|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe the overcall will help west get trumps right|pg||
nt|othered1: for the requisite 1 imp per board|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: ok, but that's not lebensohl (for the benefit of kibs)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, good to make the distinction clear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not true Kaapo, most play leb here|pg||
nt|mcphee: this game may go down|pg||
nt|kaapo: As you see, D and S are adjacent on the keyboard. Easy to make "typos" if using keyboard input when operating :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, and all 13 cards are next to eachother so it´s easy to have a "clickos" for that :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead bad for the N hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, you've been doing marvellously well :)|pg||
nt|varange: :) dang|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps some kind of transfer|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no alert on 1NT at least so I dont think they play it as transfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and a singleton @D lead may confirm the trump position for OT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N likes the lead but...|pg||
nt|col3435: good prediction - spade lead didn't look clear to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: as long as EW cash their minor winners, this cannot make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might use Lebensohl here. If it's in use, then South's 3@D shows some values; he'd bid 2NT with a very weak hand|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: east: spade lead is awkward for defence if west putsu p SJ =- declarer has 9 tricks then|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have in the open auction started the same way but finished with south's 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: here Howard felt he had enough for a try and that was always going to be accepted withSouth's good 9 count|pg||
nt|hlortz: n took a rosy view to raise, all his honors in his long suits looked bullish|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: I hate playing in 4-2 when 6-1 was available(ok extreme case but 4-3 is probable)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: wow 6@c punt in the other room|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: well club lead looks normal and beats this out of hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|abunio: mama ladna, nie ma sprawy, tylko zajeta:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Mike Gold twierdzi, ¿e w Polsce dodaje sie 3BA do od¿ywek dzieciecych...|pg||
nt|kaapo: @DJ would suffer the same, too|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|chick: often opponents will compete, taking partner off the hook|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1-suiter for me|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is inducing Thak to cash his @H or underlead it:(|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @D can only be good for declerar here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: and even if 4-2, opps cannot double (else you run to hearts)|pg||
nt|varange: then the DBL must have some unknown meaning|pg||
nt|varange: how would S interpret the 3@d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure imp for texans|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|arvid: even if south is showing some values with 3@D I think his hand is too good|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, and club is worse!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chick: and to paraphrase your comment:   I hate playing in a 6-1 when 4-4 was available :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any opinions from kibs? majors or 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  small club from table?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops what was that play of @Sa?|pg||
nt|lestergold: West correctly ducking to maintain communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: and declarer is left without any recourse for a ninth trick|pg||
nt|hlortz: needs the @D finesse even with @S coming in so he will probably try for 5 @D tricks 1st in which case no need teh @S finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: with west having all the entries he could have cleared clubs himself in case east only started with 2 - but declarer's 10 and Q suggest east has another one to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: West doesnt have the diamonds so the duck is surely correct and safest|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kaapo: Most do, but many don't :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 9 and next, cant take the spade hook|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: south will be a bit surprised when his partnern supports his spades :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Lavec: Johan Sylvan didn't consider the West hand with queens and jacks worth a move on board 5. They played at 2@S|pg||

nt|kaapo: At least that was how I played it|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess he could try something|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@C could be 2 cards, either natural unbalanced, or balanced|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd rather West bid 3@d the first time|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: ok sound contract, 5 can be in jeopardy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kaapo: I see, tack Staffan|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT apparently shows a balanced hand, and now 4@C looks like a control bid with @H support|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has a chance tho but unlikely since if he concedes @Cs will loose 3 @Hs a @c and a@S|pg||
nt|lml: and good evening to you|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|varange: here's the knr hand evaluator for the East hand|pg||

nt|varange: 19.85 HCP|pg||

nt|suketbombi: followed by @SJ and dec has some work will eventualy make this|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|cA|nt|varange: yes, provided the X promised spades|pg||
nt|varange: how many will declarer be off?|pg||
nt|varange: 3?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kaapo: Yes, lots of working finesses too|pg||
nt|kaapo: If @Hs are 4-1, you might still make 6NT while 6@H fails|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: he has to get the ruff with a low trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so South has to lead @SQ (no entry to dummy) and West has to duck it - very difficult |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @SJ has to be ducked by JM|pg||
nt|othered1: But possible, as play of interion @S would be very tricky from AQJ|pg||
nt|othered1: interior|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking.....|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) you need to know your customer|pg||
nt|lml: I think North has to just bid game as he did here.  South can't possible realize that what he has is useful|pg||
nt|lml: North has a huge hand really|pg||
nt|lml: of course the spades are friendly which is going to make this pretty easy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: perfect for action dbl/2 NT choose the minor|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: If 2N is Jacoby, 3N shows 14-15.  |pg||

nt|kaapo: It seems South is just relaying here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|suketbombi: easy now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kaapo: 5@H likely normal RKCB response, two key cards without the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, but I think they will play @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not tested|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: needed a H lead and cashout|pg||
nt|chick: needed a heart back, now S can pitch the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was too late|pg||
nt|kaapo: South had no fast entry to dummy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it was too late when east returned a club. East could return a diamond since South has no direct entry to dummy for a club finesse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|burypies: po kierowym tak|pg||
nt|kaapo: And North has likely described his full shape by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: North has shown 4315, 8-9p|pg||
nt|lestergold: techinically of cours its e/ws hand in 3|pg||
mc|8|nt|kaapo: And strength within one point range (likely restricted due to not opening the bidding)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ed Schapiro prefers 5@C to 3NT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well played sumit|pg||
nt|lml: diamonds 3-2, spades 3-3 with split honors ... piece of cake|pg||

nt|mdgraham: superficially, yes :) but one result is worse than the other, depending on your point of view  |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what is the probability of finding all 13 cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure|pg||
pc|cK|nt|col3435: well, like that, evidently :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after Pass by S i think she MUST bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: By eptying the box save 7@S and 7NT|pg||
nt|col3435: if pass is forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: the play will be interesting...... she might know that W has only 3 @s's from the bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: she can ruff 2 @d's..... and see that E has 3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  ok the result wud be the same  460|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the other semis lot of Puneiets have been asking as there latest Hero kaustub bendre is batlling out against MMS|pg||
nt|lml: it might have worked better for east west if east had bid 1@S over 1@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: North seems to have a chance for 10 tricks, if he raises the heart suit first|pg||
nt|yuval10: i belive she'll make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: sry HE will make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: because S is declarer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Cilla might make a comment about him never presenting a good dummy, and her showing an example :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S will like the dummy he'll see :)  he knows it's a reasonable grand, now only have to make!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would Haglund bid 6@S with @CQx?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: here too they wud think 10 imps gone|pg||
pc|c3|nt|burypies: czasami nawet Witek ma piki|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently their 2NT opening was something like 22-24|pg||
nt|mmmakela: -1|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 2@C followed by 2NT would be say 20-21|pg||
nt|varange: agreed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sridhar your Favoraite pd Sudhir Inamdar has come out of retirement and playing in other room|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he will lead 2 rather than unconfortable 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: play out of turn....claiming at the end|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must have a lot of shape for that|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead @d will make it easier for him |pg||
nt|lml: East also might have made a move over 2NT or balanced|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|kaapo: This seems to lose 2 spades, @D and @C|pg||
nt|kaapo: After North's fine spade switch|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: this works to kill the diamonds, but let's W have 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: might endplay North|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: lucky layout for EW|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2 bds i Imp subhash must be aware the match is close specialy after the 6@H went dn here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@c was an auto-splinter (a splinter agreeing my suit), but the values outside are quite soft|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, that last board - why did East play a club back after the @SA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cant blame Edwin for finding second best lead only lead tov pose a little challenge is a heart of course but woulodnt defeat the contract|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes although obvious many wouldn't make it|pg||
mc|11|nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Skalman on boards 19 (stopped at 3@S) and 20 (3NT went down)|pg||

nt|brolucius: I'm sorry, my last comment was nonsense (as a few tactful kibitzers may have noticed). That is what happens when you play the strong 1NT and the 1NT rebid is therefore weak. ...|pg||

nt|kaapo: After all, other table did avoid 3NT on board 5: East doubed 1@D and EW found their @S fit. Without a stopper, NS settled for 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2-way clubbers were able to stop low here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HQ makes this an excellent club slam|pg||
nt|col3435: another flat game here?|pg||
nt|varange: is this within their NT range?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Moving on to last two boards|pg||
nt|joemanjo: @c lead wd have put maximum pressure though|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer didn't know that -- was he playing for 5 @Ds coming in? -- anyhow, good @D duck by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the West hand is quite suitable|pg||
nt|othered1: 23 imps in 4 boards is a challenge|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they need 24 imps in 4 bds now|pg||
nt|vasanti: he runs away with 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: yup....all playing the last few tricks fast|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so 2 imps now 2 bds sounds like cricket 20/20|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  no the auction was 1@C from Subhash and so on|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: depends on the standings... :) so i have no idea|pg||
nt|varange: nope|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nicely executed good to watch |pg||
nt|joemanjo: other room played in 3N which is also equally dull|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nothing is routinr maoj they will never get @S fit|pg||
mb|1S|an|either no major, <inv, or GF with D|nt|varange: yes, another push methinks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kaapo: Anyhow, we're on the last two boards and have comparisons from the open room|pg||
nt|kaapo: Richie Reisig, who by the way has partnered PO, might approve of 1@D, even if it were natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: And the score table looks still very interesting|pg||
nt|suketbombi: good reslt for e-w in other romm they have to get to this lucky game tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I agree with east's pass.  With 3 spades South knew his partner didnt have a trap pass|pg||
nt|lml: and so he didnt protect|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|frankaus: brb|pg||

nt|kaapo: Lower still, here|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: a teraz co bêdzie ? Witek 10 ma|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running a little late in this room as the next match is scheduled to start half past the hour|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oldfashioned nt dbl|pg||
nt|kaapo: AKQx makes for a perfect overcall suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: board inverted. player names will differ|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chick: 5@D certainly looks like a good contract, but will likely fail with the spade finesse off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That won't happen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: "who says that crime doesn´t pay" from Bridge in the menagery (about Hidgeous Hog)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I'd have guessed North would open 1NT. Perhaps they play 15-17 1NT in third and fourth seat|pg||
nt|chick: and a non-transfer runout|pg||
nt|joemanjo: when in doubt ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D looks the sensible contract here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzpx: they play 14-16NT. Dont know why Olof didnt go for 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist also missed the slam on board 7, playing at the 5 level...|pg||
nt|kaapo: However it was doubled, with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which was worth 11 IMPs, as you can see in the movie|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can find Running Scores via a link here: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky hardly describes it|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok they will surely make this probably with an ot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: S's dbl???|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose most are old-fashioned with doubles facing a weak NT (if it was one) :)|pg||
nt|chick: balance of points double maybe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: too risky in my book|pg||
nt|suketbombi: trump lead by Subhash:(|pg||

nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
nt|othered1: that's certainly a good start for declarer, if he guesses @S correctly|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt better you can suffer a @H ruff in @Ss|pg||

pc|s2|nt|burypies: ale sobie poradzi³|pg||
nt|varange: 20HCP|pg||
nt|col3435: could be +1 ...|pg||

pc|s4|nt|joemanjo: the 'wish I were taking my nap" hands.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Exactly the same auction so far but then Åsmo chickened out|pg||

pc|sA|nt|rnc: Next match on vugraph (round 10) starts at 21.00: BK Lavec "Smile" (with Peter Fredin-Magnus Lindkvist) vs Näsby BS |pg||
nt|kaapo: Gärds - Malmström found a slam that didn't make|pg||
nt|kaapo: They chose 6@C and lost 17 IMPs|pg||

pc|s9|nt|kaapo: We are on two last boards of the set and have comparisons from the open room|pg||

nt|col3435: nope, well cashed, pity it's not MPs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: no|pg||

pc|d5|nt|lml: 3 or 4 it seems ,, depending on the diamond play|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk4: The fact that Ejnell did not cue bid spades should have been encouraging for East I think. Then his high cards must be in the right places|pg||

nt|vugraphzck: nope. still thinking. small discussion at the table.|pg||
nt|lml: discussion between hands is usually not a good sign|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 3N (preempt or gambling?) was opened in the other room. North with controls in all suits should have perhaps DBLed and waited.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Once he bid 4S, South took a shot at slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Tack så mycket Staffan Hed, bra jobbat!|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: not that early, about 7.50am.. :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: only -4|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mmmakela: hard to match the OR result here|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|kaapo: Um, sorry, 1@C may have been strong for EW :)|pg||

pc|hA|nt|kaapo: Hmm, have they incorporated transfers into the system?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@S might show something like 8-12 here|pg||

nt|lml: this is fine anyways|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello William|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: hi everyone - this table was 5 boards ahead at the break so a slight delay restarting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this all comes down to how much trouble south can cause with his trump holding|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|patricck: If you diagnosed the trump position 4@H can be made here|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|athene: @HA and another is down immediately; the missing @H8 might influence declarer's decision a bit, perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 3@h shows 1-4-4-4|pg||
nt|athene: there are lots of ways to play this heart suit - you might lead small from west and then judge what to do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The bad communications will perhaps make playing trumps with 2 losses|pg||
nt|athene: for example lead to the @H10 and then if that loses to the @HJ, finesse south for the @HK too|pg||
nt|athene: if you think north will fly in with the @HK when he has it (especially @HKx) this gives you decent odds|pg||
nt|athene: but at this level you expect north to play low even from @HKx, most of the time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with that William|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and at least from Coyle|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|patricck: That line still effectively gives you better odds than the Ace and another play, but Ralf is right....there are communication issues here as well|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: the other interesting play is, if declarer leads to the @H10, you win the @HK as south|pg||

nt|lml: 6@S is a great score north south wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good 6@C slam missed there|pg||
nt|othered1: By today's standards almost everyone has an opening of some sort, except maybe west in 4th seat (though with 3 quick tricks and some shape, I'd open it)|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: it was pause Pause Pause & pause|pg||
nt|lml: if spades break and no diamond ruff there are always 12 tricks |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sfoxa:  or even grand - if declarer will be brave and carefull enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is prepared to play in 3@H if North has hearts |pg||
nt|lml: if east-west stop biddng before 6 I think north south will too|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Now, how do Ew apply th ebrakes to the auction?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joemanjo: needs immediate @d play to beat 4@h.|pg||
nt|lml: how did he do that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@H can be beaten -- but might prove tough to achieve that|pg||
nt|joemanjo: may not be found.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@C on spade finesse - dubious proposition|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, but if you are on 7th level - you have no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that double can be either for take-out or penalty - let us hope EW play it as take-out |pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: @CA, then find the @D switch |pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: fancy the @D 9 lead?|pg||
nt|othered1: Why, orther than it works here?|pg||
nt|lml: okay partner MAY have a heart void.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I'f I'm leading a doubleton, it would likely be @C|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now making:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 12 imps and Hope is eternal|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes, each pair has to elaborate agreement for such case|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably East had no descriptive bid in the direct seat |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  multi is really popular, so you have to foresee your defence |pg||
nt|suketbombi: can make rather|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: yes, there are many defences on the market|pg||
nt|lml: I agree if East hadn't bid then South had no way to bid 6.  But even with that bid it is an amazing leap|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a routine 4H contract will be reached routine bidding of course the play not so routine|pg||
nt|lestergold: a question of how Edwin tackles the trumps|pg||

nt|lestergold: there were risks in playing on clubs to get to ummy|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: this seems to work quite well: dbl=t/o of spades, 2@H=t/o of hearts. So here East could double|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which at least gets the hand off your chest at the two-level|pg||
nt|lestergold: Better to have played last heart and allowed declarer to play in no trumps|pg||

nt|athene: what's wrong with 1nt?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Better than 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: unfortunately for EW, east might be a bit too weak to go stayman so the hearts might be lost|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: When you bid 2@C with a hand like that, there is a risk that you will miss a 4-4 heart fit because advancer is not strong enough to bid|pg||
nt|athene: i guess a fair 7-count is enough facing a 1nt overcall - that's a good 15 up to about 18, isn't it, for most people?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: no time to get the clubs going, but this lead is still very nice for declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: lets face it 4@H wouldn't necessarily have made anyway...delcarer still had to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever leads his partner's minor after a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you don't even need a stop:) let alone a double stop :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion it´s not impossible to ask for majors on E and perhaps play a major contrace on 4-3|pg||

mb|4N|nt|athene: this is a good example of how, when partner pre-empts and you have a very weak hand with a big fit, just bidding 4 can be more destructive than bidding 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: the point is, if you bid 5, and last player bids 5 over you, that shows a decent hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if you bd just 4, and they bid 4 of a major over it, that can be anything|pg||
nt|athene: because people will bid 4 of a major far more freely than 5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Oh, did he show one by mistake?|pg||

nt|patricck: agreed Roland|pg||
nt|athene: these advance cue-bids are very dodgy - in my experience partner never knows what is going on - but here it worked out ok|pg||
nt|athene: south might just decide to bash in the slam over 2@H - the point being, you will make it even if you are off @CAK, a lot of the time|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: a spec suggests that 2@H agrees hearts so it's easy from there|pg||
nt|patricck: It is a reasonable slam, although one that might easily go down on some days.....with the magic @C position of course today it doesn't really matter what declarer chooses to play ...|pg||
nt|patricck: for he will be alright|pg||

mb|p|mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: very true|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|athene: mind you, north is so strong, you would expect them to get there somehow even without 3@C as an option|pg||

nt|vugraphzcv: north is in the tank again|pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, w ithout south's @HQ, not easy to show, 7@C allows ruff-out of @H suit, if necessary.|pg||

nt|othered1: do we know what the unalerted bids m ean here?  Is 4@D just a cue-bid, for example?|pg||
nt|gambit: very tough |pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: we'll have to wait till end of auction - prob not natural but no alerting above 3nt of course|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: I'm told, authoritatively, that 4@D is cue and 5N cue for @S|pg||

nt|othered1: 2@d multiway, 2@h relay 2NT 11-14 bal|pg||
nt|hlortz: the old-fashioned auction was more efficacious|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 imps the price|pg||
nt|gambit: heart lead, best shot at a trick (ruff) , not this time |pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzcv: can predict a quick claim|pg||
nt|gambit: LOL|pg||
nt|othered1: When you have trumps set on the second round of the bidding, things get easier.   Same effect may have happened here, but something wasn't shown along the way.   For example, south ...|pg||
nt|othered1: had a very maximum hand for slam play for the 2N rebid.|pg||
