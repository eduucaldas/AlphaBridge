nt|sybarra: re all |pg||
nt|sybarra: they get to do the end plays this time :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: Chang is one of the best female/junior player in taiwan|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: Y.T. Chen|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Y. T   |pg||
nt|lorderic: Yeh's team won the mixed team in 2008, Beijing|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and here we go |pg||
nt|lorderic: here comes the board|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I was commenting for that event |pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@C-1@D-P-2@C-P(or X) and eventually to 3NT.|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if EW can make 3NT (8 red suit tricks and a trick in whichever black suit S leads). Don't know if they can bid it, especially since presumably N will open the bidding - ...|pg||
nt|janm: you said standard, not strong club, right Kuo? So we'd expect the auction to start with 1@c|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|lorderic: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: she has played for U21/U26/ladies team in Taiwan|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt makes on on "lovely laid out " for ew|pg||
nt|janm: Of course EW are lucky that both top spades are with North, but the opening bid makes that more likely than not|pg||
nt|sybarra: have not seen a precision system yet in this room |pg||
nt|jcwla: Could have sworn score was different but away we go.|pg||
mb|1H!|an|4+!s|nt|sharkey: Actually NS can make slam here with the fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we did not know what to call you last set|pg||
nt|lorderic: welcome back|pg||
nt|lorderic: we can see that the MOSCITO pair change to close room|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Kuo, Hi Carl.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: or mosquito |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@H some kind of Tartan|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have been to Taiwan, what is venue for this event?|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's in National Taiwan University, Student Activity Center|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  not sure if I know where that is...... |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it moscito?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning Jordan|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi Kuo|pg||
nt|lorderic: Hi Jordan and Carl|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 again.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Carl.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning Jordan|pg||
nt|lorderic: the moscito pair is in open room EW|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|lorderic: we have an interesting contract here on first board|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like they've ended in a comfortable strain|pg||
nt|lorderic: BTU leads 16 IMP in the first half|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: Youthful optimism may lead to slam...?|pg||
nt|sybarra: sp lead?   |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
nt|lorderic: the others play standard 5-card major|pg||
nt|janm: Reasonable by West - check to see if partner can raise hearts and bid 3NT if not|pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo,  we missed them again!  we must do better with our assignments|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lorderic: we don't see much precision pairs in youth team in taiwan now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: Would have paid off here.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - despite the 3@D bid from N S was headed for slam - would he have bid 6 with two Key Cards (assume 5@C shows one)?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Heart will not be beating as fast in 5@H as in 6@H.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|lorderic: a spade here can still beat the contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: I wonder why - it seems to me as if half of the young players in the US play some kind of strong club system|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: Could still have found @H fit after 2@C -- but in any case there is none so score it up.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Neither W nor E could act.  The OR will start w/23 and 24 and pick up our comparisons when they circle back to 13 - that's the plan, anyway.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|othered1: now makes it, s ince north didn't tap declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|sharkey: Kristian, our excellent operator, advises both pairs play natural systems - would perhaps expect Precision to be popular here|pg||
nt|lorderic: oops|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: mistimed it right there|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer tapping self  |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|mc|6|pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4S76H84DA9754C8532,SK5432HAKQD8CKJT6,SAQT8HJT95DKT6CA4,SJ9H7632DQJ32CQ97|sv|n|nt|sharkey: so 12 tricks - the @D trick vanished|pg||
nt|sybarra: a fast "next"  |pg||
nt|jcwla: I think that's a good trend, Kuo.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Now slam?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: OR starting w/23 and 24 - they'll pick up our comparisons when they circle back to 13.|pg||
nt|sybarra: no one makes a game here |pg||
nt|jcwla: Bidding challenge here.|pg||
nt|lorderic: i was told that the actual score is 36:12|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lorderic: a typical 3NT here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Aggressive Rule of 2-3-4 opener here.|pg||
nt|janm: I was about to say that he'd cash 9 tricks and then exit in a black suit and probably get a 10th, but he efficiently claimed his sure 9 - we never see matches decided by 1 IMP of ...|pg||
nt|janm: course, so no reason to play for the overtrick (need a smiley for tongue in cheek)|pg||
nt|lorderic: 8 IMPs carryover for BTU|pg||
nt|jcwla: No challenge at all - this will be quick.|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - Preempts may aid NS..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: yes, we forget to put the carryovers on|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Looks like a @S partial here|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|janm: Somewhat odd pass by West - I'd have expected a raise with 4 trumps and no real defense, but he was right since N also passed|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's pass surprises me.  3NT here by N would not have made the right catch.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Kristian is not our operator - the profile has not been changed...|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing looks great for ns |pg||
nt|sybarra: I open the hand 1 @C   |pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D looks strange to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @D looks more precision like|pg||
nt|lorderic: perhaps he wants to avoid a @D lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: good pt. Kuo |pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzcd: it is now 36:12|pg||
nt|jcwla: BTU-Y had a full 8-IMP carryover from their round robin match against CGU.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: even @D's not great ....|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@H shows @S fit|pg||
mb|4N|an|RKCB|nt|othered1: I'd wonder about that tactic in 4th seat.|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 3 @H is everyone's opening bid (not mine)   but//|pg||
nt|janm: I think this is going to end up -1; can NS make anything?|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's a fair one by the colors|pg||
nt|sybarra: true  with colors|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I would not do it, I never carch a dummy like that |pg||
nt|janm: I think I'd open 2 - it's a little too heavy in defense compared to offense for me to want to open 3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not in love with misstating my number of trump.  I'm willing not to make the preempt on a particular hand - but I don't love to misstate number of trump.  Seems to work out badly ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: often and not ideal for partnership harmony.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @HQ will be an expensive lead....|pg||
mb|5D|an|0 or 3 keycards|mb|p|nt|sybarra: trying to coach a bid out of N |pg||
nt|sybarra: well here "we" are |pg||
nt|lorderic: Wang was my teammate in 2006|pg||
nt|sybarra: so is young also I take it |pg||
mb|6S|nt|sharkey: apparently Kristian, Danish operator, is a popular name in Taiwan, may be Roland's doing.... - appearing in both rooms....|pg||
nt|sybarra: still take out |pg||
nt|lorderic: we played World Youth Bridge Cham. in Thailand, under 21|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not usre I will bid again with S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but also not sure what I would do over 3 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: except beat it |pg||
nt|sharkey: S will not stop below slam now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: I think NS can make about 4 @cs (or @ds I guess)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Missing one so 6@S it is and with no @D ruff coming we're on to 15.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: This one will not take long.|pg||
nt|lorderic: quick claim, i like it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lorderic: E wisely didn't lead a spade, but didn't find the best @C lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this needed a double-dummy @C lead to be in danger|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: looks right to overtake and play something rounded back|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be concerned (re leading @C) that  N also had clubs |pg||
nt|othered1: overtake with 10?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: I definitely want partner taking the appropriate action with their hand based on our combined number of trumps and their values.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: poor N has no entry after ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: but undoubled |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi folks|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Cliff |pg||
nt|sybarra: and "only 50's"|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: the overtake gives an extra @D tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|janm: East hoping that the opponents will have to give him a ruff-sluff or open up the spades, which will allow him to make 3 - nicely done|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
mc|12|pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SAK952HQ7DAQ2CA86,SQ6H854DJT9863CK3,SJT843HT93D5CJ542,S7HAKJ62DK74CQT97|sv|e|nt|lorderic: here comes a slam for NS|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems could always make w/right view.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Jan is right, WD by E.|pg||
nt|janm: Guess we can't complain about not getting distributional hands here!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: yuk as they say |pg||
nt|jcwla: What do you do with S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Another slam potential coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam may not be so easy to bid without the preempt - likely to be duplicated OR|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|lorderic: another interesting board - 11 minors in N and 12 majors in S|pg||
nt|sybarra: its been this way all night, and we saw lots of end plays.....|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1NT shows @cs|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: W's double not textbook.|pg||
nt|sybarra: just the bid S wanted to hear |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the 1 nt bid)|pg||
nt|lorderic: my mistake, only 10 minors in N|pg||
nt|sybarra: since I opened I would just bid 2 @H |pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree, Shirley.|pg||
nt|janm: S now has the usual problem when you open a light hand with 56 in the Majors with 1@h - is he good enough for 2@s. Particularly with the DBL, I think not|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I dont mind that opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I dont reverse now  just a simple 2 @H  for me|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcwla: I don't love the opening - seems like you should be able to get it in later usu.|pg||
nt|janm: It certainly seems right to open with 12 cards in the Majors! And although many people would open 1@s with this sort of hand and 56, I don't see how he could do that with 57.|pg||
nt|janm: Wow! 4@h is a big bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: nv, |pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo,  do we have any ladies at this table |pg||
nt|lorderic: is W considering 5@D?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@D perhaps a bit pusillanimous.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think W is |pg||
nt|lorderic: if E has 5cd @D and singleton @h it can be good|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if bidding 5 @D has to be in tempo |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hard to judge "good" and "bad" bidding on freak hands -- often, anything could work out well or badly.|pg||
nt|janm: I think 2@d is very reasonable - he didn't have to bid at all, so it showed some values and reasonable diamonds, which is what he has|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we saw all night (here) day there |pg||
nt|janm: West has a lot of losers to venture an 11 trick game, but he does have good support for partner and doesn't know what's going on with S's bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: W may think his pard has the singleton  |pg||
nt|janm: But no real reason to - N didn't show any support|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I do not like 1@S.|pg||
nt|sybarra: may land in 3 nt?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N is the top  spot, will be bid i expect|pg||
nt|lorderic: let's see if NS can get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: true Jan  (sorry)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S - shud bid it at these colors|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@S would be very nice result here.|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@H shows 13-15 with 3 cd @S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|jcwla: Four card support should be shown IMMEDIATELY in my opinion.|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - Not sure 1S will be able to show his hand now|pg||
nt|sharkey: *S|pg||
nt|sharkey: S is regretting his bid now...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now 4@H sounds like 3 and 3@H could be on two.|pg||
nt|janm: Tough for West to know what's right, but he has turned a plus against 4@h into a minus in 5@d, as long as S is willing to sit for this|pg||
nt|sybarra: X=  pd please dont bid again |pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems S has been unilateral enough, time to let go.|pg||
nt|janm: It's often hard when you've opened a minimum shaped hand to let partner double the opponents, but you just have to - he's already shown his hand, can't bid it again|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H conventional - showing a type @S raise I assume|pg||
nt|lorderic: yes you're right|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ty Kuo|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: just bid it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H may show stronger hand than 3@H in their system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is not the worst 13 I have ever seen (in S)|pg||
nt|capercliff: not an auction for a @h lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and far from best either |pg||
nt|janm: And he (or she) didn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe S should have opened 4 @H  any one for that?|pg||
nt|lorderic: S is a "she"|pg||
nt|jcwla: If I were going to rebid 4@H on round two with this hand I would just have opened it 4.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Chang end played her way into 3 + contacts in one set |pg||
nt|sharkey: They don't use support xx?|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1@D denies 4 cd Major|pg||
nt|sharkey: N doesnt like the shape 6322 I think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: might he play a, q of sp?|pg||
nt|capercliff: i might lead K@s here, and lose imps of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: he= declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should have said found the end play  to make the contracts |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I hope so -- I could see how some people could play it as weak.  You have to be able to bid 3@H with two here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I dont do those "fancy" leads...they never work out for me |pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the K@s wouldnt be far off if declarer's black suits were transfered |pg||
nt|capercliff: and would be consistent with the auction|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - and also invite to cue bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised S passed must have enough for slam with @CK @HQ and four trumps...|pg||
nt|capercliff: on this hand the lead is irrelevent|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N looks best, a motif that seems to have run throughout the day's vugraphs.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 to CGU on 1 - their opponents sold out to 3@C/N down 3 - not enough recompense for the 3NT making in here.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Well I did not understand the auction on 13 but it was suggested 5@C showed one keycard there, here it's zero.  Maybe it's just straight Blackwood or maybe they weren't on the same ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: page in terms of what was trump in 13 (if anything).|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case barring a misunderstanding here above 4NT the blame for this one goes to South.|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder how firmly 3@S sets trumps?  In my style it might have only 3-card support.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lorderic: i guess they set trump in 3@S|pg||
nt|janm: That might have been a mistake - now when N gets in with a club, he can play A and a trump and prevent the second club ruff |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why is took his transportaiton  away with the clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: This shud be quick too Jordan|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|lorderic: i've heard that the director is called on Board 1 open room|pg||
nt|janm: So we'll get farther and farther ahead of them I guess - good for the Open Room audience to have comparisons|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe they won't need five more minutes to finish this one?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would read it that way |pg||
nt|othered1: This is a good spot, just not best.  Very rarely will it be punished at imps.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not take long |pg||
nt|janm: This is a time when N should stop and think about declarer's tricks - it might seem right to play a heart through in case partner needs it, but there's no rush - on the other hand, ...|pg||
nt|janm: if he doesn't play 2 rounds of trump now, he knows declarer will be able to ruff 2 clubs in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: agree - S should be elated when pd bid 4 NT and not stop below slam.  The 1@S bid really created a dilemma|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: declarer might think about potential play if @S are 5-0.|pg||
nt|lorderic: for the new ones: NS play MOSCITO: a highly artificial system with strong club and 4 card major|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|capercliff: I wouldnt have played the 10@s thats for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: or even 4-1 could be yukky |pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: wd|pg||
nt|lorderic: the score is adjusted to 3NT in board 1 open room|pg||
nt|jcwla: With an overtrick - so it's 1 to BTU-Y, up 9-0.|pg||
nt|janm: Is there any way for declarer to endplay S in the Majors for a pitch? I don't think so - that early diamond play is costing again - he can ruff a club but then has to come to hand ...|pg||
nt|janm: to pull the last trump and so he'll either have to play a heart to the A or K of spades and ruff a spade - either one gives up his position in that suit|pg||
nt|janm: Do you know what happened that the director had to be called, Kuo?|pg||
nt|lorderic: i have no idea|pg||
nt|janm: And we should give Wang credit for a good play in leading the trumps - it looks clear to us but it's not so clear at the table, after all, declarer started on trumps first|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2 a push at 3@H making.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|capercliff: i like your idea Shirley|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|janm: If east hadn't played that first trump, he could take advantage of the club 10 having dropped by playing the J of clubs and pitching dummy's third heart, then pitching the second ...|pg||
nt|janm: one on the now good club 9. But that won't work now, since N can lead the 4th trump. I'm sure declarer is now trying to figure out if there's any possible way to squeeze S in the ...|pg||
nt|janm: Majors|pg||
mc|10|nt|janm: Same auction also - both Easts chose to open 3@h on the hand in first seat favorable|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SAJT9HQDJ853CJ872,SK8543HAK642DCK96,S72HJ853DAQ9CAQT5,SQ6HT97DKT7642C43|sv|b|nt|jcwla: So much for feeding the OR a bunch of comparisons.|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW play natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: EW play natural, NS play MOSCITO|pg||
nt|lorderic: EW play standard 5 card major|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ty|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shud be makeable here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Bad is a good description of south's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|othered1: the second pass by west is timid|pg||
nt|lorderic: nV i suppose everyone here would bid it right?|pg||
nt|janm: Now that's a surprise - I thought Chang was deciding between 1NT and DBL, didn't think of pass with 4 spades and 14 HCPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's pass more of a surprise to me.|pg||
nt|janm: I think that NS can make about 3 spades and EW probably 1@h|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1NT on 14 seems esoteric and an Italian-style double to announce opening values was not in the offing.|pg||
nt|janm: It's not an Italian style DBL, the S hand has support for all the unbid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Someone will probably have to make an aggressive call.|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play it here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 @D?|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@S is cheap|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this dealer needs some help |pg||
nt|sharkey: View West's original Pass dont thin E will push here|pg||
nt|sharkey: *think|pg||
nt|sharkey: Does W have a problem?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: W was asking S for something|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: As long as E holds off in @H will be hadr to make 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: However, passing with the N hand would not occur to me.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|sharkey: Not sure what 2@C is - many play it forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: but @S split, so game isn't on EW|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: S bypassed 4 card @S suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS playing weak NT openings perhaps?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lorderic: should be no problem for 1NT... only the matter of overtricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|janm: N knows something funny has happened and might be worried that it's E who has substantial extra values - of course having 5 spades is a reason to bid, but he has virtually no ...|pg||
nt|janm: defense and not a lot of offense.|pg||
nt|janm: Still, it's surprising that both of them would choose to pass conservatively on this hand.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The problem with double as S -- and the reason it's not textbook although it works for some -- comes from partner's POV, esp in comp auctions, when they place you on appropriate ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: distribution and bid accordingly -- then you show it up with 4-3-3-3 and it's just not good.|pg||
nt|janm: However, the OR NS did worse by bidding :)|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hmm -- I'm not convinced they're on the same page here -- in any case S must be at the tip-top so here we are in 4@H.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|sharkey: 25 HCP - not sure what 2@H means - two hearts??|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: Cant even see possiblities of making this one...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|janm: The OR South overbid with 1NT and then overbid again with 3NT.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: here goes the end play again |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: The lead has pretty much placed all the honor cards - except @CJ|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may just make this |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|jcwla: So true.|pg||
nt|janm: My partners don't expect perfect shape if I have decent HCPs - of course you need either solid values or shape for a TO DBL, but I don't think you need both|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lorderic: and E finds it quickly|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - so 8 or 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: I could see about six or seven alternative natural auctions ending in anything from 1NT, 2@H, 2NT, 3NT.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|janm: S now deciding whether she needs to win the diamond now or it will go away (on what I wonder) or whether to hold up to keep declarer from playing the 4th one|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: welcome Ed Shapiro |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|jcwla: How does pd know whether you have decent values when you've made a double and they're now in the hot seat and have to make a decision?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: we have South as endplay expert here  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: I think 3 NT will be the contract other room with 25 HCP between them |pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|pg||

nt|jcwla: What is the rebid problem?|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 1@D - 1@H - 1@S - 1 NT - ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure what's the better way|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of players consider thenorth hand a routine weak 2@H.|pg||
nt|janm: Would have done better to hold up, since now declarer can play a diamond to dummy and pitch the club loser on the trump loser, as he has done|pg||
nt|jcwla: Matter of style but I prefer my takeout doubles to be "take out."|pg||
nt|janm: So more IMPs for BTU, those mainly because the OR CGU pair bid too much|pg||
nt|jcwla: This one starting to resemble Henin-Zheng at 19-0.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: not in first chair for me with 4 @s |pg||
nt|othered1: North took my action|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: But NS will get to game after south overcalls 1N|pg||
nt|janm: Still a lot of boards, but not that many with only 24 board match|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: 4@H or 5@D playable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I wouldn't call a third-bid problem a rebid problem, nor would I put down a singleton after bidding as if I held a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome LI -Hsiang |pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs have tools to let north make a good decision on game here.|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 comparisons to go, this is still a very competitive match.|pg||
nt|lorderic: again, 1@D denies 4 card major|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: 2@C shows?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lorderic: 2@C shows @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: of course....|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@D means "nothing special"|pg||
nt|sharkey: so 11-14 balanced probably?|pg||
nt|lorderic: could be less. the minimum opening by NS could be only with AKQ|pg||
mb|d|nt|lorderic: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The reason there is some problem after the first four bids is because there is not a big fit -- this is also why there are problems making game on the cards.  I would have more ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: sympathy for 1@D-1@H-1S-1NT than the actual auction.|pg||
nt|sharkey: What do you suggest?|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi!|pg||
nt|othered1: west continues to take a pretty conservative view of his hand.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 here and 1@S the spot.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: I hope that's forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not a fun W hand to lead from here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: KUO,  is Jr. International from Ch. Taipei, we welcome you  and perhaps you know the players|pg||
nt|janm: This should make, but may not be easy - diamond to the A, diamond ruff, then I guess Heart A, Heart Q to the K, and then declarer has to decide how to play the black suits|pg||
nt|sharkey: How many points does 2@C show?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: last chance for a plus|pg||
nt|othered1: EW|pg||
nt|lorderic: dbl shows strength and NS decide to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: feels endplayed...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they say "Houston we have arrived" |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Underlead the "right" ace...|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S make this ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: the first plus score for EW this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: cud be off 2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|othered1: If you have seen hands that BBO commentators think justify a 1N overcall with a small singleton in a major, you can appreciate north's problem.  My partner won't have a stiff, so ...|pg||
nt|othered1: considerations are different.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Just 2 IMPs exchanged on 13-15.  OR got all the way to 4@H on 15.|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS is a decent female pair from CGU|pg||
nt|lorderic: we've seen a couple nice endplays |pg||
nt|lorderic: it's the best score for NS -- only if they don't misdefend|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janm: Of course, the A of diamonds isn't at all obvious - East could have a doubleton and West certainly knows he doesn't have any other entry - the question is whether East would really ...|pg||
nt|janm: lead a doubleton @d into declarer's first suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ding seems to be expert at end play (or at least thus far) |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: just did|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lorderic: only -1 now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: roughly 10 tricks now without the @H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: On Bd 15 N bid 4@C in OR after Pd's raise to 2@H - 3@C may have worked better|pg||
nt|lorderic: you didn't see much female bridge players in Taiwan|pg||
nt|othered1: There's one trick gone for the defense -- south can pitch 1@D on @H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: Why is that?|pg||
nt|lorderic: but we're glad to have some in our semifinal tables|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharkey: easy with all four hands in view - S had a very difficult problem|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: 2@D, rather|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lorderic: SCU stop at 5@S on Board 15, 13 IMPs to BTU|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|janm: So much for the diamond ruff. It looked to West as if declarer was going to ruff hearts so he'd better get trumps going, which wasn't a bad idea,|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: so off 1|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: with opening bid,  will she take the @D finesse |pg||
nt|sybarra: not needed now |pg||
nt|sybarra: as Joey Silver say NEXT |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcwla: N cannot match the OR score.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|jcwla: WD by W.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer seems to be on the way to making 3; maybe even 4 if he ducks this diamond|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s2|pc|c8|nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: 5 more to BTU-Y on 13 when CGU's N failed in the 1NT that S made here.|pg||

nt|sharkey: Score says 8|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 here but freaky.|pg||
nt|othered1: west might play 1@S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo,  we have not seen much re systems...do you know?|pg||
nt|jcwla: So CGU on the board w/2.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Still think @H return better - required one of the honors with N|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Another Rule of 2-3-4 opener here.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: East has a 7-card suit and favorable vul, but the flat shape makes 4@S unresonable.  2@S is pretty conservative with the sound suit, extra card and side K|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@S is just right for me|pg||
nt|othered1: sort of what I was getting at :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - opening lead hurt on Bd 13|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS will end up in 4@S which will fail|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@H by EW is also good|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud have bid with S hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: which makes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: yes - may be 3@D EW|pg||
nt|janm: Once again, declarer claims when there was a serious chance for an overtrick. Each time it's cost an IMP|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lorderic: another cheap 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: non vul, not X's  |pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be all bad |pg||
nt|othered1: and it looks like 8 tricks, with the @S9 coming down.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep magic flop  (as they say in poker)|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has a good hand view Pd's preempt |pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: not necessarily the least east would like to see.  It may force some plays early (but will be successful)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Was kind of an odd trick all around.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: now what to lead from N?|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt W sees dummy much |pg||
nt|othered1: I hadn't given any thought to immediate action by east at these colors when I guessed it could end in 1@S|pg||
nt|lorderic: both table in this match play standard 5-card major|pg||
nt|sybarra: and nice of ace of clubs being on side also |pg||
mb|5H|nt|sharkey: What's E to do after pd reopening Dbl?|pg||
nt|sharkey: We'll never know :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: This seemed more probable -- W has nothing more to say.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I told Ed  seemed not precision ...so thx|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@s good sac vs 4@H|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sharkey: Agree... - EW is in a good spot|pg||
nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'm with you, Carl.  I would feel terrible right now with S hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: one NTU pair in the other semifinal play MOSCITO|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow,  that is fun to comment on |pg||
nt|lorderic: hopefully we can have them on vugraph later|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes,  there is another session yet  |pg||
nt|othered1: That can be interesting, lots of variants to MOSCITO, some more exciting than others, as I recall.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another partscore hand here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Making 2 or 3 probably, depending on whether EW get the diamonds going|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Off 1 I think...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Not dead yet.|pg||
nt|othered1: well, declarer did have a @C guess to make|pg||
pc|h5|nt|janm: The club ruff, if they take it, will be with a natural trump trick, but it was still the most attractive lead for West - if East had the diamond A instead of the KJ, he could have ...|pg||
nt|janm: gotten 2 club ruffs|pg||
nt|janm: The OR EW did very well to beat 2@s, unless I'm missing something - it seems as if declarer has 5 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond and 1 club|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like a 4-IMP pickup for BTU-Y |pg||
nt|lorderic: surprised that 2@S goes down at the other table|pg||
nt|janm: I don't see how any of those tricks can go away after this start - maybe A and a club and then a diamond back would have worked|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: E has to return trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - may make|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|othered1: andmayve north should have given more thought at trick 1 what he will play on @DJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|janm: Although I still only see 5 tricks for EW and 8 for NS - must be missing something.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lorderic: it's not my faver to open 3@C Vul from E hand|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: on @CJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcwla: @C and @C ruff, then @D back, won with A, pitch @D on @CQ, ruffed by W, back to a @D in E for another @C, ruffed and overruffed w/@HA to come.|pg||
nt|lorderic: the declare uppercut himself|pg||
nt|janm: Playing the club Q was a mistake there, but it wasn't obvious that it would cost|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|janm: East should probably play a discouraging heart here and West should lead a diamond, but I don't think anything matters (unless East pitches a club and west leads the A of hearts so ...|pg||
nt|janm: declarer can play the K and have 2 dummy entries to ruff out and use the clubs|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|janm: The diamond pitch makes blocks the EW diamonds, but I don't think that's good enough to give declarer an overtrick. Still, this will be another small pickup for BTU|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lorderic: surprise! but the contract is still safe|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|nt|janm: S trying - ruff the club, then probably spades, hoping something will develop|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: if playing the "rabbi's rule"  can make 6 @S here |pg||
nt|jcwla: 7-bid MOSCITO auction to 2NT in OR.|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's very difficult to stay in 1NT if you don't play some kind of strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: rabbi's rule,  play ace when King is singleton |pg||
nt|lorderic: another partscore here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: first they have to avoid a club lead|pg||
nt|lorderic: even MOSCITO bid to 2NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another 20/20 -- have been a ton of them|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: North's 2@C bid appears to be the key bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Instead of 1 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes yess |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt notice |pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, but with 11 trumps there may be other reasons to find the play.  Rabbis do it with 4 or 5 trumps out, on their good days.|pg||
nt|janm: EW in the other room playing a strong club, but couldn't stop below 2NT anyway. Here EW will presumably also get to 2NT but it will be faster|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|lorderic: wow|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lorderic: pass 4@S with 12 red cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: likely to go down as dbl finesse in @C failing|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's kind of a "natural" bidding, which you don't see much in MOSCITO|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe feared pushing to slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo, you are jr right  so we would expect you to bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I thought that Moscito included a strong club? Or is it 2-under 1 bids?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Looks like NS can make 3@H|pg||
nt|jcwla: Is W at top of their NT range?|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's a strong club. they have chance to stop in 1NT|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1@H = @H, 2@H = @H, that's it|pg||
nt|sharkey: not a bad contract though|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Would think so for a simple get-out by E.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to be 3/3 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: a plus score on this board is good|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: although being Senior,  I might bid again |pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like a flat 3NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: If 15-17 wud you super accept as W?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcwla: Not I.|pg||
nt|sharkey: me neither|pg||
pc|cT|nt|janm: Maybe the Kokish-like auction to 1NT (1@c-1@d-1@h-1@s-1NT) doesn't show quite this much|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcwla: Different pairs have different meanings for leads of different high honors against NT.  As with many things, just be on same page w/pd.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: why long @C suit rather than short @D?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: and hts 3/3 also, how convenient|pg||
nt|sybarra: (hands are rarely like this for me )|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1@C-1@D-1@H-1@S-1NT show 18 21 in the other table|pg||
nt|janm: This will probably be a push - looks as if EW have only 7 tricks and NS can get to 6|pg||
nt|lorderic: i'm no tsure why W didn|pg||
nt|lorderic: ...didn't bid 1NT after 1@S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|janm: The W hand is really worth more than 21 though - so many primes. I'd agree with treating it as 22-24 if that's what they did|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: Can always say lost finesse through opening bidder|pg||
nt|othered1: at comparison|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: There is no substitute for that fourth trump when E doesn't have the hand you're catering to -- nor are you going to miss anything w/3 trump when E can't act over 2@S. |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Kaplan-Rubens hand evaluator evaluates it to 20.60.|pg||

nt|janm: spade ducking|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: think I want to play 4 @H with the tap |pg||

pc|s8|nt|sharkey: 1@C Undo?|pg||

nt|lorderic: some action here|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hard to stop any lower - E has some work to do|pg||
nt|jcwla: A really ugly vul weak 2 but it sure did its job.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: N sensibly skips over the diamonds to show the 4-card Major, and S has to decide between 2 and 3 @ss|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: potential easy overtrick now, so east will take Q and 10 tricks.  Next|pg||
