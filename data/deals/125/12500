nt|ahollan1: welcome one of the winners of this year's Senior Swiss -- Bruce Neill|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't see any evidence that NS play light opening bids, but they do play hand evaluation|pg||

nt|rodal f: N got for the 2NT it seems|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR S for not holding open?. Can't by the cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Did North really double 3@C? It seems almost unbelievable that he did not pass. |pg||
nt|petergill: West was happy, but, probably affected by eh "all doubles are take-out" virus that exists in Sydney Australia, East removed the Double of 3@D. |pg||
nt|peachy: excitement from the start|pg||
nt|poohbear: Well is it clear that its a forcing auction? I suspect the hand with 2 aces will dbl but bidding 4@cs is asking them to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Smirnov will play a @H hoping his partner has the ace|pg||
nt|jcwla: @HJ back here -- would be enough on a slightly different layout.|pg||
nt|petergill: Alex Smirnov is trying to figure out - if partner has @HAxx, how do I tell him I have @HJ109 and @DA, not @HKJ10?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|gavin:  my feelings change strongly if edgtton was vulnerable.  The problem with opening 4 card majors when you are vul in 3rd chair is often you end up playing a 4-3 fit in 2, or even 3 when the opponents overcall and your partner  has a limit raise|pg||
nt|jcwla: What lead do you make?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poohbear: 9 @c|pg||

mb|d|nt|petergill: Even if he only tries for game, North will bid 4@S|pg||

nt|petergill: NS have 4 losers in 4@S|pg||

nt|petergill: The 6@S slam going down in the other room might cost the match, but who knows?|pg||

mb|p|pc|hK|nt|petergill: I went down in a makeable slam near the end of our 2 imp loss to Milne earlier in these Finals, so I sympathise with Whibley. |pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|gavin:  north has a powerfull hand if his partner invites, he is already limited to 12-14 points, very rarely unbalanced|pg||
nt|petergill: The youths will almost certainly reach 4@S, so this looks like a bad board for Bilal|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|rodal f: As it also use to be non vul by all hands. Have not meet them so fare|pg||

nt|petergill: Brightling should have picked the clubs I think ,after the accurate count signal by East, who was likely to have 3@D's, 6@H's (else 5@H by East), 2@S's and thus only 2 clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or a other variant|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: disaster! Andy and adam have missed the 6@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: So right u are. I missed it:(|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|petergill: On Bd 25, Nabil Edgtton's decision to upgrade his acey 17 count and not open a 15-17 1NT gained 11 more imps for his side|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: 1@S alerted? @H@D?|pg||
nt|bg: here is a pickup for Noble NS in other room reached wrong contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: and only made 4!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 more De Livera, 37-3 this set|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: 2@D = one major suit|pg||
nt|petergill: playing Multilandy|pg||
nt|gavin:  that being said i would have bid stayman with the 7 count in the other room|pg||
nt|gavin:  on board 25 that is|pg||
nt|gavin:  you can pass a 2H response, not a bad invite over 2D and game over 2S|pg||
nt|gavin:  Ten of clubs is a great card|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gavin:  T9 of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: When we drove down to Canberra, Tony Nunn asked me where I would seed this young Milne team. The seeding committee went for 14 out of 188 teams, Tony went for seed 7 and I went for ...|pg||
nt|petergill: seed 5, I think.   |pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 29, Smirnov at Trick 1 played @H3 as UD count and (simultaneous) suit pref for clubs not @D|pg||

nt|jcwla: OR|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gavin:  it wont be hard for them to find out they are missing a spade control if they have a cuebidding auction here|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps better is 4@H (not 4@D) cue by N to find out about spade control?|pg||
nt|gavin:  yes peter i like 4@H a lot thats really smart|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H South, 5@C North, Pass?|pg||
nt|petergill: = what NS needs now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: or if South plays another @D ..... |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: @D5 = suit pref for clubs I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: @D5 for @C.|pg||
nt|petergill: another @d would be curtains for NS|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcwla: Generally when dummy hits w/stiff -- high for high side suit, low for low, middle for continue or trump.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: I miss more than u so do'nt worrie:) AND FOR SHURE|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: May we see 10IMP for NS and a new leader?|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: no reason to think that|pg||
mb|2C|an|Alert|nt|kiwibridge: slam can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: This looks like a very boring 3NT|pg||

mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|davidstern: My experience over 45 years is play it the same regardless|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: perhaps 9 imps on Bd 28 and perhaps 8 imps on Bd 32, hard to find many other imps likely for Milne = De Livera looking good |pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sometimes the opps change their play based on what they think you might do|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I agree 100.00000000% with David|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: Eh la la -- include me out.|pg||
nt|davidstern: Now I know I am right|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: by some standards, S has an opening bid, even at these colours|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: 7@H is best|pg||
nt|davidstern: I have the Gill seal of approval|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I think 7NT is best peter|pg||
nt|petergill: The 7NT reached at the other table was decidedly inferior to 7@H|pg||
nt|davidstern: Either major suit or club finesse |pg||
mb|4N|nt|petergill: Flat board if @H lead at Trick 1, probably an imp to EW on this lead|pg||
nt|peachy: I think it is time to congratulate the Milne team, well done|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry miscount|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 7@H = claim |pg||
nt|davidstern: 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: unless @H 5-0|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: LTC is right, no rebid problems, you get to bid the suit you want led, adequate defense, etc.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5-0 @h and 5-1 @s beats 7 @h|pg||
nt|davidstern: But as we can see nothing will matter|pg||
nt|poohbear: if @c finesse off|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is all about getting there|pg||
nt|petergill: 5D = 3 |pg||
nt|petergill: They play 1430|pg||
nt|davidstern: Wrong person asking best if guy with @HJ asks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Now this could get them back into the match :)|pg||
nt|petergill: East wondering about 7@H or 7NT - @HJ is the card that makes 7@H better than 7NT|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Yes, great job.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with great luck this could make|pg||
mb|7H|nt|bg: interesting play here careful defense may set this one trick|pg||
nt|petergill: West, having @HJ, will bid 7@H now|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bingo we have a winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Will east trust that 7@H shows @HJ?|pg||
nt|davidstern: He should |pg||
nt|davidstern: Smirnov knew what he was doing and best to trust him|pg||
nt|petergill: Without @HJ, with @HAx, East would bid something else over 5NT. |pg||
nt|poohbear: If spades were solid He would bid 7@c offering choices|pg||
nt|davidstern: Good bid that would be indeed|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: just tell yourself "if i had the king of hearts it would probably be wasted anyway with my luck", so open|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: or maybe just 7@s|pg||
nt|davidstern: Oh well good when it doesnt matter|pg||
