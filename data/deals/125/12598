nt|mmmakela: hi RNM!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: hi and welcome to round 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: make that *cant |pg||
nt|sybarra: now to bridge |pg||
nt|lestergold: thats optimistic Shirley|pg||
nt|ady: part score in hearts for n/s  |pg||
nt|sybarra: can they stay out of game?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they should|pg||
nt|ady: I would have tht so|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 opposite 8 no great distribution |pg||
nt|ady: 1H    2H       should end the aucyion    unless e/w get into the action   |pg||
nt|sybarra: South will like hand with the 4 @H  we shall see |pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason at all for anyone other than a certain member of my club who hasnt yet heard of part scores would be in game|pg||
nt|sybarra: i @H, p 2 @H and W may decide to bid 2 nt  |pg||
nt|lestergold: so push them to 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: we see that game is actually only a bit less than 50%|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon Kath, Mike and spe|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from snowy Manchester|pg||
nt|lestergold: excellent slam to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: hello|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess lots os snow in Reykjavik too|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: nobb hehe|pg||
nt|lestergold: heart slam makes diamond doesnt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: part score   likely 1NT   e/w|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: E/W are playing prec|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: it is not the worse game any of us have been in |pg||
nt|ady: with the spades coming in for 4 tricks  4@H then is only on trump finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: about 40% but not biddable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but I start with 2 @H also |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: maybe 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: rehi Gudni!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: With N hand I would prefer opening 1@D and now 4@C to avoid the reverse|pg||
nt|sybarra: as predicted :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: well not a very fascinating hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: I would've bid 4 H as E 1st round|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 @C was 16+ any|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oh I see thanks|pg||
nt|lestergold: not likely to produce swings|pg||
nt|sybarra: too early to say NEXT  but next |pg||
nt|lestergold: east might have tried if pard has top hearts or even missing top heart but holding spade ace.... what about a key card enquiry 5 level looks pretty safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: not likely to jump to 4 hearts without good five carder|pg||
nt|ralfwil: enough entries to ruff a @s and no @c finess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: and only need to ruff one pesky spade|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wouldnt you bid 4@H on K10xxxxx  and nothing?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and the @h can be 4-1 and still make 12 tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk4: and Gudni, our operator|pg||

nt|lestergold: please|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: I wonder if declarer will play the spades 4-2 on the bidding    should not really as if spades dont break still can get J@C right|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we can hardly keep the specs interested with hands like this taking a day to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch has solved all problems|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: yawn |pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: Hello Frank and Gudni|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: and also 4 H as W after pd's 3 H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: no because why would i want to go negative when its our hand if south passes over the double i can expect top buy the hand in a heart part score for as plus score|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|h5|pc|s7|pg||

nt|rodal f: Can some fun happen EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: N/S can manage 3N|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: the swedes start could be better.....|pg||
mb|1H|an|hearts or spads|nt|sybarra: from the N side |pg||
nt|sybarra: (best)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: not wasting time in the bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: easy 3 nt/4 H/ 5 @C NS here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes, 12 tricks in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: not 4 H, club ruffs|pg||
nt|lestergold: feom either side a spade 2h  a club 5 dims however there is the losing option of the club finesse rather than heart unlikely with the intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: NS are in the right contract and that is what matters|pg||
nt|ady: can see 8  unless there is a throw-in to get 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: 1NT 2-3 controls and force normaly|pg||
nt|sybarra: deep breath and a @H hook? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (or close eyes) |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|vinbtech: not everybody's 1H OC for sure|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: again nothing really to the hand in practice ducking spades for a couple of rounds means that  a heart to the ten  even if it lost east would be out of spades|pg||
nt|ady: sorry with heart hookd 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: strange overcall by south|pg||
nt|lestergold: this needs to be defended carefully it looks beatable providing e/w dont get busy and know when to hold off the K@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: however could be entry problems in that case|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: you was right Frank!|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t think there is any problems to make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still some communication problems. @H is best at E|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: of course defence are tending to be endplayed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: east must duck and has|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: say the heart was wrong then east would get in and switch to a club. the @d A would have already been used to take heart finesse then there would be no further entry to cash the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: thrid heart after the ace had been unblocked|pg||
nt|lestergold: ach he had to cover that one!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no cover???|pg||
nt|lestergold: was it a grosvenor|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer cant believe he didnt cover with such a holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: so he may get'grosvenored here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like it will drift down 1 |pg||
nt|ady: big pressure on west  running 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing west for kq tight|pg||
nt|lestergold: not sucvh a bad non cover then!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: every card  is on side and @h 3-2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: so in fact declarer does actually need the  heart finesse to be righjt on best defence|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: might be able to produce an end play on south|pg||
nt|ady: play remaining trumps now  |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now things dont look so rosy for declarer|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: For running scores: http://www.swangames.com/magic/magic/www.php?csm=Match&nsid=239|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|ady: still one trick short with that|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y but still will be a trick short; E getting squeezed before S does|pg||
nt|ady: only real hope is 3 club tricks    and that is not there|pg||
nt|vinbtech: the endplay will produce only the 9th trick|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: E can claim 0|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability west could have bid missing one of the side Ks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: so declare still has something to think about|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|ady: nice play|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Miami coup:)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|ady: with J@C gone|pg||

nt|lestergold: here was a great example of the difference between commentating and playing!|pg||
nt|ady: played east for K@H    was an option|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: a real genuine yarborough not even a ten odds of almost 2000 to1 they say|pg||
mb|1S|an|0-3|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: well the yarborough wont be going down on the table its gonna be the tate gallery on display folks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: a 2 loser hand has South|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: however he could have discarded a heart on the last dim and then west had to either ditch spade q or bared a K however declarer's line wasnt absurd by any means he had a losing ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: option|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w will likely reach 4@S       may be tough to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure n/s can handle much more that 1 nt  +1 |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not 11 winners unfortunately for him|pg||
nt|lestergold: Magnusson thinks its going off with his great spade holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 4 @S loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may be rewound|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: well in my firday night monmey game it would have been a 'stand chair'[ redouble|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so par contract because 4 H makes|pg||

pc|cA|nt|lestergold: or affect the result on this hand|pg||

nt|ralfwil: is this correct? 12 tricks now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcx: yes +2 sorry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: south is picking up some nice hands|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: its a goulash of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 18  other room made 3 nt |pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe east felt taht a dim ruff was a chance but east needed to play west for ace of hearts in any case so shouldc have played heart for a ruff then tried for the di ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as a coffe board NS|pg||
mb|1D|an|3-9|nt|sybarra: @S's likely to win (imo)|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: 3 H EW absolute limit here and that needs some guessing|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks with both majors behaving|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: pass by W was very timid|pg||
nt|lestergold: can 6S be defeated here?|pg||
nt|ady: 13 if club not cashed|pg||
nt|lestergold: no!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what about RDBL from S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And S get satisfied by the NT bid comming|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dangerous double that by East|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: n/s  close on 4@S     4-1 split makes it difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy one to bid tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like redouble the problem is that 1dim redoubled isnt a game contract!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if fact impossible  |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lestergold: needs hearts and spade to both break|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Well. I might was a bit early. Why not 3@D after the forcing from S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I dont think W can move|pg||
nt|lestergold: two suits both breaking 3/2 brings odds down probably to around 50% odd|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Non Vul should have bid @H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but overtricks....|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the overtricks it may score better tho|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: yes sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes 2 or 3 over doesn it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and North could stand it too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at least 2 overtricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: not often seen at this level would have been fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: er not for Eliasson tho|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: must go down|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3@D from me|pg||
nt|ady: A@C lead for example  12 tricks if spades break    also 12 tricks on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a non dim lead it needs club ace on side|pg||
nt|lestergold: has ll tricks without end play as long as he wins a club trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes you are right david cos cl;ub goes on heart|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh they got to 6@S at the other table|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|rodal f: 1@S for minors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "catch all" 1 @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate what are theodds of two suits braking 3/2 and do you think any pair would reach 6S legitimately|pg||
nt|lestergold: as card lie N/S can make 11 tricks in a minor suit|pg||
mb|2C|an|non forcing|nt|ady: cant see merit in the opening   |pg||
nt|lestergold: well certainly in diamonds clubs a bit more prefcarious|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C a relay?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|rodal f: Found the best lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: But did 1@S give E the signal he needed for play @H right?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont open any hand like that in SECOND position at nany vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: check back|pg||
nt|mmmakela: here needs spade guess in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: assume 2NT shows a good raise in clubs  and a raise to 3@C would be weaker|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 9 tricks the limit here; assuming correct guess in S |pg||
nt|ady: this will be down 1 at least|pg||
nt|lestergold: wrong denomination!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: now a string of cues coming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@C/@D/@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: unless S thinks this only invite|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d is much better than 5@c|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wrong level|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S at favevul have 'sacrificed' - a phantom if they go off but i think it can make but what a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d is rather easy but 5@c will go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps it cant make becfause of cummunication problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: can ruff this heart entwer hand with a diamond play as low club ruff the heart continuation but then declarer is stuck in dummy with no way back to hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 2@C was non forcing I dont see how South can bid  5|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has taken a view to 'sacrifice' at favourable vulnerability or at least to take 'insurance' i dont think thats unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: these freely bid vul games usually make ok here 4h is off  as it happens  if the opps dims were 3/1 instead of 2/2it would make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps there is tempo enough for N to avoid 2 trumph losses tricks and also a @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i wouldnt have come in even at fave vul with such a terrible suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: N is thinking|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|nt|ady: 3NT was made hand 18 in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is optimistic!|pg||
nt|lestergold: second position should always be sound for very good theoretical reasons|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the opening has led to ano play game of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 18 (you and I have mentioned)  can not follow play on movie, but my guess is he took @H hook |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: when opener has passed tyhe odds increase enormously that it ios your hand so it is not desiarble to mislead your pard who may well have the best hand at the table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet he is, awful hand to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: better to have supported dims maybe just a quite 2d bid at that stage but i8 suppose 1d by osuth didnt guiarantee diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @D finesse now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may well tocreate an extra entry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: voids are great when you have lots of trumps  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: did, because he absolute max|pg||
nt|mmmakela: system mixup|pg||
nt|rnmalik: once it is decided that 4@S would be played then no harm to cue bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: S thought game invite, N bid as slam invite|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i knew it|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: well this lead will beat it |pg||
nt|lestergold: normally great when the void is in the short trump hand so you cant be forced lengthwise however here its a disaster and that play to the @d J was correct but unfortunate|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: and which lead wont beat it Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: true :)|pg||
nt|ady: cant see anything but down 2 on any lead|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: WHT the 10?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: now rhere is an endplay against S. A @c shift was needed from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos it should never have been bid in the first place|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: should have continued the forced on dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 2@s no prob but  1N had no chance on a spade lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vinbtech: 1N was high enough i guess ; of course the H109 dropping considerably helping E's cause|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure I am making the point clearly,  the X has more points than bidding  |pg||

mb|1H|an|non balanced hand|nt|vinbtech: 2 A missing; will rest in 5C here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 imp is sometimes very decisive|pg||
nt|mmmakela: strange N passed in these zones|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than 4@h from S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: So EW fighted til 5@D and got of the hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: don't like 3 @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont make neg. X with 6 points |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: bad suit, dbl better although only 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: N/S may have 26 combined miltons but no game |pg||
mb|3S|an|cue spade and both minors|nt|ady: west needs to cash a@H quickly to stop an overtrick in 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: incidentally not all play this my son bids a spade with 4 only does not reccomend going vis neg double in this sort of  situiation|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then there are those that X denies 4 @S,  (as reminded by spec) |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes as i have said|pg||
nt|lestergold: in effect|pg||
nt|lestergold: only at 1 level|pg||
nt|ady: mis fitting  25 combined pts    not sure where the overtrick came from in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead maybe|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s cold with the 3/3 break|pg||
nt|sybarra: which is was |pg||
nt|lestergold: so likely to be flat unless n/s treat it a s a bidding competition hand!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|mmmakela: 543 in unbid suits|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think NS will bid 5@d and a small win|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: after X E could bid 3@C or Pass|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yup|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ady: east on lead  so heart lead required|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vinbtech: S has to decide whether N can have 2A for his 5C bid (no 4N)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: i think not|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: in 3N 9 tops |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S (fast arrival) to shut the bidding OFF|pg||
nt|lestergold: easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: however perhaps 3n is the better contract because i has play when spades do not break which is lets face it most of the time|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D has 3 off thwe top unavoidable losers whereas 3N makes on a 3/3 club break|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vinbtech: not that 6C didnt have any chances|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vinbtech: needed H or C lead from E to defeat|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: on a non heart lead there is certainly time to develop and enjoy the clubs when they break 3/2 as here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vinbtech: wd by all in the end|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: might still try and set up clubs here but will worry about entry problems|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well I don't like 3 NT either but south was mercyful|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think the defence would allow 3NT to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: no ity doesnt make because the clubs are 4/2|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: the point im making is that 3N is a better contract than 5D|pg||

nt|ady: 7NT best|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 7S is doomed|pg||
nt|ady: just have to avoid 7 spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: of course S thinks E has more than 1 dia|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: last board today|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with Mike. 3nt will make if @c are 3-3 and 5@d has no chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 5D as cards lie is only one off|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: Last for today and more to come tomorrow. THX all|pg||
nt|lestergold: here is achance for n/s NOT to bid a dodgy slam and gain imps|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzcx: yes start tomorrow 11 gmt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzcx: 11 am Icelandic time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not awful ruffing finesse in clubs or ruffing out K@c would make unfortunately neither working here|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 2S mean here?|pg||
nt|lml: hi Mike good morning|pg||
nt|ady: on the face of it not that bad a slam    both hearts and clubs break badly|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi LInda welcome |pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Linda|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|lml: I would be quite happy to be in slam for sure|pg||
nt|lml: until the end of the hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|mmmakela: 3 hearts limit here |pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok so north never bid anything|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with the bid 1@S @H never came in play-S could DBL 1@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: silly 3@s in my opinion|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the suit is too weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: second best spot!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Westy wisely 'forgot' to double|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mmmakela: not in my book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Guöni for exselent work. Thx also to all specs and Ralf|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: last board of this round and then lunch break|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the trump holdings can be weakened also in the communication and ruffing process here even when lub ruffs out|pg||
nt|ady: if south had K@H instead of K@D    then excellent slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: we will start after 14:45 Icelandic time on round 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes then settinmg up the hearts becomes much more viable line|pg||
nt|lml: still its better than 50% even as it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: betetr no Linda i dont think so|pg||
nt|lml: well the ruffing finesse is 50%|pg||
nt|lml: and if trump break you can try to ruff the club out at least once|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but then trumps may break 4/0 and cause problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes it less than 50%|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: wont end in spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but could bid 2 hearts now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: with this quality of @S I would DBL|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vinbtech: more likely in C|pg||
nt|lestergold: also west may be short clubs holding A9xx over dummy with short clubs|pg||
nt|ady: hand 23 6@D=2 cost 13 imps  though  the 4@S could have beden beaten on 10@D lead|pg||
nt|lml: well I dont think so.  I think the other chances are enough and you may handle a 4-0 spade break.  I will work it out later and maybe blog it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now they helped defence for -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: All OK?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not agree with south's action here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: think 5NT must show 3 controls and Q@C   or a 6th club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: choise of 7 clubs understandable  west cannot know of spade queen in east hand |pg||
nt|vinbtech: thats the last board for this round i guess|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and pass partners club response?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its not a lot less but it is less for sure|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: I dont know but I will later today.  Too hard to do on the fly|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is not one of the distributions that works|pg||
nt|lestergold: if you assume that its 50 50 i the only consideration is a finesse position than its less than 50 i any other possibility could lose a trick even the possibility of a 6/0 heart ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: break and a n early ruff count as reducing the odds|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he duck this?  does it do any good?|pg||
nt|lml: you will just have to read my blog to see what I come up with|pg||
nt|lml: no it doesnt really help to duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: clearly here there are possible problems other than rudffing out the club and dissapointingly and not sutrprisingly they are in the slam|pg||
nt|lml: he needs the club suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i will read your blog bu the way itsw a horrible word(blog) and my English teachers never taught me it whenI was at school|pg||
nt|lml: if he spades spots were a tenny bit better he might be able to crossruff for 8 tricks but not here|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like bog with an l|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vinbtech: ty all; and goodbye|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes --|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what would you do instead?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: may need a ruff  or maybe set up spades in a club contract to make 13 tricks|pg||
nt|vinbtech: ty BBO ; ty Iceland Express BF|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: thx for watching|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|lml: it took me years to figure out what a blog was... what do you mean an online diary... who would want to read that|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: pass or 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner is known to be weakish and best to leave it alone the ur suit is not good enough to show now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think South bid on in case North didnt have @H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That´s what I ment with silly 3@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: waht about if north didnt havce spades which in fact north indeed hasnt got|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mmmakela: you might play in 4-2 clubs then in worst case|pg||
nt|lestergold: west i think has one or two tho|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: some of us do it for living |pg||
nt|sybarra: for my think thank |pg||

pc|d3|nt|ady: in a mess here even if K@C is rt|pg||
nt|lml: well he hoped that hearts might work and if not he would try the ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: thank you David thats what ive been trying to tell Linda but she insists shell blog us out of that idea|pg||
nt|ady: now trump back and cant maked other than stiff K@C|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: In that eventuality P would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: next round will start in 10-15 min compering time schedule|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why? say he has 2-3 4-4 with xxxx in dias, then he bids 2 clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well West could double @S but not @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he was happy|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|mc|7|nt|lestergold: well im not sure about this he knows that south cannot make any tricks in his bvest suit if played in a heart contract and perhaps the double is not that awful|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: thx all for watching and hope you had as good day as I did|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all and see you on BBO|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx all thx excellent operator and thx fellow commentators|pg||
