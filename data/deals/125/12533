mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lestergold: However e/w are up to an experienced international partnership who have evn played i believe in thye bermuda bowl |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the english played in a moysian fit|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: likely to be a similar result to OR|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: certainly played in many major international events and rcently as i said brought back a gold medal from Brazil no mean achievement|pg||
nt|ady: reached 4@S   on 4-3 fit in OR      3NT  with the 5 heart tricks available will make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mayors: XX = 1@h response, 1@h probably 3 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Heather Dhondy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Are EW hooked of now? Y|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  man's decision from S - let's see how would be the play|pg||
nt|ppiglett: What was Rdble - T/f?|pg||
nt|mayors: yes xfer|pg||
nt|heatherd: Hi All|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2N rebid would be simpler but maybe Brunner isthinking of possibility of club slam|pg||
nt|ady: may judge to play in clubs    |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jackthelad: nice lie of the cards for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: redouble show hearts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W can make 3N or 4S 3n seems a more normal spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 will be tempting if 3n is bypassed and it makes of course on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: would 2NT be forcing?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: e/w   may stop short of game     not that unreaasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: enjoying being npc heather?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north would be able to double for a dim lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes 4+ @hs|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
pc|d2|nt|heatherd: I'm not doing it until the 2nd weekend. Hopefully I'll be taking over with the team in a good position!|pg||
nt|roswolf: this auction is meandering somewhat|pg||
nt|lestergold: well David its a combined 26 count and thats dabgerous not to play gam,e at teams|pg||
nt|lestergold: and unusual|pg||
pc|d8|nt|heatherd: I'm sure EW will wind up in 3NT somehow|pg||
nt|ady: there is 26 hcp   between them   but it appears they are not definately aware   and the hands dont fit well|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are right david no it wouldnt it was a silly suggestion|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: well he has passed|pg||
nt|heatherd: OK, wrong again!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially with E playing heart 8|pg||
nt|mayors: The red honours lay very well for NS|pg||
nt|ady: club lead makes life difficult|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes 2@h more awkward than 2@d, a bit surpised crouch preferred @hs|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The hand lies will for 2H, on the nose for 110 and a flat board my prediction. Any wagers?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Hugh must go looking for a diamond ruff holding trump control|pg||
nt|mayors: I expect 8 tricks I think|pg||
nt|ppiglett: might sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: might go wrong on a club lead  and further club s from defence|pg||
nt|mayors: On club lead may play to ruff three clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Wont get the ruff, I agree club will put S under pressure|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: well they are not going to recove their deficit playing games in part sxcores even if the games dont come with a bank of scotland guarantee|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thye are on the way|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well Holland play Brunner for the KD|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: should stop now    but if diamonds are led cant afford a misguess in clubs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well no reason not to play for drop in clubs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: dims wont be led|pg||
nt|ady: should be if cu bids are to be trusted|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: commentators curse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: England will lose 3 imps at best|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: always going to make with spade ten doubleton|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe altho dims was fitrst suit bid by dummy the cue bids identified the weakness|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even on club lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: the scottish e/w have been somewhat subdued in this match so far|pg||
nt|heatherd: It seems to me that West should be driving game after partner's 2@d bid - clearly showing extras|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: im not doing too well today|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: I agree Heather|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|eggy: not too shy with his WJO style, Crouch !|pg||
nt|jbgood: seems like a good suit compared to what you may see|pg||
nt|dburn: may possibly result in East-West reaching 4@s, perhaps the least comfortable game contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: W will suggest 3 nt now|pg||
nt|dburn: he might do, but those diamonds have become a cause for concern|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure - but still|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: good decision|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|jbgood: best defense is to cash 3 dis - not now|pg||
nt|dburn: and North, having bid 3@d for the lead, forgot to lead one|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|dburn: so Hastings has the rest|pg||
nt|eggy: indeed, although I auppose that the diamond position would mean that the defence couldn't force enough anyway in 4S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||

nt|marlowepi: would be made without the present|pg||
nt|mayors: No I don't think so|pg||
nt|mayors: South always was going to score a second @s trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the extra whammy of playingt in a nisht machen part score|pg||
nt|heatherd: He could have bid 3@d though|pg||
nt|lestergold: he had plenty of bids better than pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: i sympathise|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: neck und neck now|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for theIrish|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|heatherd: Another promising result for Englad here.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like 3s because it cant be nmisunderstood |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and could be here|pg||
nt|lestergold: too|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: one of the defenders needed a 14th club|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie 6 of red infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: 2@c another xfer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Take second spade, play the king and a heart to the ten and cash the DQ - one down no?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N will be fine|pg||
nt|heatherd: 10@d lead in the other room, thank you very much!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 3N a better contract than 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lucky for the english|pg||
nt|ady: 5C got through in OR     north lead a diamond|pg||
nt|heatherd: Much better.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt is where you would choose to play i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by south any red slam is excellent|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i could get to like this |pg||
nt|jackthelad: interesting decison to open 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and without the opening bid, game could easily be missed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in 3rd seat - looks well |pg||
nt|april7: thats right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems normal to open 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not good strategy to advertise weakness in 3rd seat facing a passed hand, esp at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame the 5C bid with a top heavy hand fearful of letting opps in with the majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: even no trumps|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   or 6NT from south unbeatable   6NT best|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jackthelad: wouldn't occur to me....rubber or imps....bash|pg||
nt|mayors: No, west had 4 spades and can only get rid of one of the @d Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N completely frigid against any lie|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|ady: on some lays 3NT would go down with 5 of a minor making|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not today|pg||
nt|lestergold: Many would take same action as Crouch did|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT bid makes it clear --maybe 3@D after 1NT would show 6-5|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ppiglett: You're right sorry|pg||
nt|ady: some imps for england here    irosh down in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: harder to bid no trump slam as point count only 30|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: oops|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 6D looks like a reasonable contract to reach|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: what happened here operator is this for real?|pg||
nt|ady: partnership misunderstanding     lucky for England|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: South's sighs tell me yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: good try by Price|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: North's 3D forcing in my book|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: it's like a speedball|pg||
nt|lestergold: but pards hearts not god enough|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzgk: you missed a lot at the start|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of all weak 2 bids, 2H is the least effective. less preemptive than 2S, and unlike 2D it helps the opps by reducing their principal targets to just ONE major and NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|heatherd: Yes. If East hadn't had the 10@h this was needed.|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially after 2S force|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mayors: 3@h showed a mixed raise about 6-8 with 4 trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s6|nt|heatherd: Over trick now, and 1 back to Scotland|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jackthelad: was an auto 3 to me|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  weak 2 means you are pre-empting, W hand is good for own play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: 5 imps |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 8 times outa 10 the opps will find their fit over 1|pg||

mb|1S|nt|dburn: 2@d is naturalish - opening bid values with 6+ diamonds or 5-4 in the minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: 2@h is natural with either hearts or a game force in support of diamonds, or in this case both|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: and slam is cold in three denominations, but better played by South - no difference here, of course|pg||
nt|dburn: the difficulty will be for Patterson to discover that South has the black suits not only stopped, but controlled|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @h now -. and 4 @d over 3 nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that if he bids 4@d and hears 4@s, he won't know about clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: y - not easy|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about 3@s at all|pg||
nt|eggy: Still with only a 4 count possible in the reds, He knows that a t least a King and an Ace are pretty likely|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|westjava: S found his best lead!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: the system has created a problem - I guess S could not rebid 2 NT over the 2@h realy|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble now is that North has no way to tell whether South's spades are KJx or QJx|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|dburn: but if they were the latter, five would be going down, so he might as well have bid six|pg||
nt|westjava: no way to go hoe...|pg||
nt|westjava: home|pg||
pc|d4|nt|westjava: just hope the same lead at other table|pg||

nt|lestergold: Price is correct to try and beat contract if its possible he will usually find the right card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: S muttering|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mayors: Catchall @d from south|pg||
nt|lestergold: both blaming each other?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: can't hear N!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: I see Price Simpson play a fairly natural system with 4 card majors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: of course they are both outstanding money players|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: offense-defense ratio is not skewed toward former, may turn plus into minus (maybe a big one), may push opps to a game they wont bid if i open ne|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another swing to england here|pg||
nt|ady: England did well to buy in 2@S OR     3@D for e/w makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if Simpson plays 3NT    defence might win leading a spade    |pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: 3NT might well show this  with three card support in the old days --suspect it means somehting else now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mayors: 2@d shows @hs, Crouch/Patterson play transfers in just about every conceivable situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will need to play K@H to make 3NT   |pg||
nt|garnetts: also like the OR it is wrong sided |pg||
mb|p|nt|heatherd: Spade lead will give problems.|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead    and heart back   and 2nd spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead as expected on the auction|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: Crouch at fave vul made a very aggressice major suit showing bid with then 5 count eh was dealt and hit gold dust with pard|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: spades 5-3   would have made life more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if East will lead Q@D|pg||
nt|mayors: Might do, must be thinking about it|pg||
nt|heatherd: Weak NT auction in the other room gave no info for the lead.|pg||
nt|garnetts: The down side of playing a 3NT gadget then |pg||
nt|lestergold: west must win first heart|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ppiglett: definitely thinking about it - yes|pg||

nt|ady: Q@H|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Who was Rusinov?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: true and south was certain to hold 3/4 diamonds from the bidding, more likely to be 4.|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: weak no trump by the look of it - 2@c probably majors|pg||
nt|jbgood: must admit I have some sympathy for this kibs' statement: too much science, odds with jump to 6 straight away|pg||
nt|eggy: Patterson would like to make a try, but that will get him too high|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3@s was a complete mystery - don't know why he could not bid 3@h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: but no doubt the dreaded Crouch has some meaning for that unrelated to hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Perhaps he was trying to see if he got a double and then let that affect his decision|pg||

nt|lestergold: trappy hand for E/W the duplication in cluibs meaning their points arent pulling their full weight|pg||
nt|heatherd: Tricky hand this. Values for game, but nothing obvious on.|pg||
nt|ady: England tried the only game with a chance in OR  |pg||
nt|heatherd: 4@h has more play|pg||
nt|lestergold: crouch's bid was reasonable his pard wa marked with strength|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: Michelle said she wasn't going to risk it - just claimed +1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: 4@H   unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: seems like some accident in OR     this should be another sing for England|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: well N/S can make a slam but if they dont this will be expensive for N Ireland|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ppiglett: very|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade and diamond high cards badly placed|pg||
nt|lestergold: reaching 4S seems fairly likely as in open|pg||
nt|lestergold: Campbell opening 3 with the festering west hand vul is one thing but standing the double of 3N!! chm....|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on a good day it might roll in but with spaes breaking 4/2 no chance here|pg||
nt|paulales: think you are in the right country - it is -15 here :( and by all accounts not much better in England|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: Looks like downgrade from North they play 14/16 NT 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy to bid thias pretty good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with double fit identifie should get there|pg||

pc|hK|nt|jackthelad: WOW...no mucking about !|pg||

pc|h5|nt|paulales: sorry|pg||
