mb|1S|nt|dburn: 2@d is naturalish - opening bid values with 6+ diamonds or 5-4 in the minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: 2@h is natural with either hearts or a game force in support of diamonds, or in this case both|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: and slam is cold in three denominations, but better played by South - no difference here, of course|pg||
nt|dburn: the difficulty will be for Patterson to discover that South has the black suits not only stopped, but controlled|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @h now -. and 4 @d over 3 nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that if he bids 4@d and hears 4@s, he won't know about clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: y - not easy|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about 3@s at all|pg||
nt|eggy: Still with only a 4 count possible in the reds, He knows that a t least a King and an Ace are pretty likely|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|westjava: S found his best lead!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: the system has created a problem - I guess S could not rebid 2 NT over the 2@h realy|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble now is that North has no way to tell whether South's spades are KJx or QJx|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|dburn: but if they were the latter, five would be going down, so he might as well have bid six|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Nigel Rosendorff|pg||
nt|nigel: Hi all:) Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi Nigel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Panelewen has no attractive switch. He doesn't know that anything works, except a club of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West is giving due consideration to trick 2.  I would suggest a heart|pg||
nt|nigel: It may be possible to end play West if the defence is less than perfect|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: A heart would be bad if North has exactly AJ10.  But the risk in a diamond (or spade) switch seems much greater|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: weak no trump by the look of it - 2@c probably majors|pg||
nt|jbgood: must admit I have some sympathy for this kibs' statement: too much science, odds with jump to 6 straight away|pg||
nt|eggy: Patterson would like to make a try, but that will get him too high|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3@s was a complete mystery - don't know why he could not bid 3@h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: but no doubt the dreaded Crouch has some meaning for that unrelated to hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Perhaps he was trying to see if he got a double and then let that affect his decision|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: 1S, 1@H, 4@D, 2@C|pg||
