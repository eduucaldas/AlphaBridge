nt|gracelin: I believe north's 1NT denied 3-card spade as well.|pg||
nt|gracelin: will bid 1S with 3-card, and 2S with 4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: yes, still 2@S appears to be a better contract here|pg||

nt|sybarra: re all |pg||
nt|sybarra: they get to do the end plays this time :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: Chang is one of the best female/junior player in taiwan|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: Y.T. Chen|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Y. T   |pg||
nt|lorderic: Yeh's team won the mixed team in 2008, Beijing|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and here we go |pg||
nt|lorderic: here comes the board|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I was commenting for that event |pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@C-1@D-P-2@C-P(or X) and eventually to 3NT.|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if EW can make 3NT (8 red suit tricks and a trick in whichever black suit S leads). Don't know if they can bid it, especially since presumably N will open the bidding - ...|pg||
nt|janm: you said standard, not strong club, right Kuo? So we'd expect the auction to start with 1@c|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|lorderic: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: she has played for U21/U26/ladies team in Taiwan|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt makes on on "lovely laid out " for ew|pg||
nt|janm: Of course EW are lucky that both top spades are with North, but the opening bid makes that more likely than not|pg||
nt|sybarra: have not seen a precision system yet in this room |pg||
nt|jcwla: Could have sworn score was different but away we go.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: Actually NS can make slam here with the fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we did not know what to call you last set|pg||
nt|lorderic: welcome back|pg||
nt|lorderic: we can see that the MOSCITO pair change to close room|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Kuo, Hi Carl.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or mosquito |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@H some kind of Tartan|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have been to Taiwan, what is venue for this event?|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's in National Taiwan University, Student Activity Center|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  not sure if I know where that is...... |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it moscito?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning Jordan|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi Kuo|pg||
nt|lorderic: Hi Jordan and Carl|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 again.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Carl.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning Jordan|pg||
nt|lorderic: the moscito pair is in open room EW|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: we have an interesting contract here on first board|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like they've ended in a comfortable strain|pg||
nt|lorderic: BTU leads 16 IMP in the first half|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: Youthful optimism may lead to slam...?|pg||
nt|sybarra: sp lead?   |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
nt|lorderic: the others play standard 5-card major|pg||
nt|janm: Reasonable by West - check to see if partner can raise hearts and bid 3NT if not|pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo,  we missed them again!  we must do better with our assignments|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lorderic: we don't see much precision pairs in youth team in taiwan now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would have paid off here.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - despite the 3@D bid from N S was headed for slam - would he have bid 6 with two Key Cards (assume 5@C shows one)?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: Heart will not be beating as fast in 5@H as in 6@H.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lorderic: a spade here can still beat the contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: I wonder why - it seems to me as if half of the young players in the US play some kind of strong club system|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcwla: Could still have found @H fit after 2@C -- but in any case there is none so score it up.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Neither W nor E could act.  The OR will start w/23 and 24 and pick up our comparisons when they circle back to 13 - that's the plan, anyway.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|gracelin: bidding is the more difficult part of this hand.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: the closed room bidding seems sensble to me.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and maybe copied here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, well done|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: the one thing that south shud not do is to thk for a while before passing.  Glad south passed in tempo here.|pg||

nt|sybarra: a fast "next"  |pg||
nt|jcwla: I think that's a good trend, Kuo.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Now slam?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: OR starting w/23 and 24 - they'll pick up our comparisons when they circle back to 13.|pg||
nt|sybarra: no one makes a game here |pg||
nt|jcwla: Bidding challenge here.|pg||
nt|lorderic: i was told that the actual score is 36:12|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lorderic: a typical 3NT here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Aggressive Rule of 2-3-4 opener here.|pg||
nt|janm: I was about to say that he'd cash 9 tricks and then exit in a black suit and probably get a 10th, but he efficiently claimed his sure 9 - we never see matches decided by 1 IMP of ...|pg||
nt|janm: course, so no reason to play for the overtrick (need a smiley for tongue in cheek)|pg||
nt|lorderic: 8 IMPs carryover for BTU|pg||
nt|jcwla: No challenge at all - this will be quick.|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - Preempts may aid NS..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: yes, we forget to put the carryovers on|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Looks like a @S partial here|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|janm: Somewhat odd pass by West - I'd have expected a raise with 4 trumps and no real defense, but he was right since N also passed|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's pass surprises me.  3NT here by N would not have made the right catch.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Kristian is not our operator - the profile has not been changed...|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing looks great for ns |pg||
nt|sybarra: I open the hand 1 @C   |pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D looks strange to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @D looks more precision like|pg||
nt|lorderic: perhaps he wants to avoid a @D lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: good pt. Kuo |pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzcd: it is now 36:12|pg||
nt|jcwla: BTU-Y had a full 8-IMP carryover from their round robin match against CGU.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: even @D's not great ....|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@H shows @S fit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|othered1: I'd wonder about that tactic in 4th seat.|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 3 @H is everyone's opening bid (not mine)   but//|pg||
nt|janm: I think this is going to end up -1; can NS make anything?|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's a fair one by the colors|pg||
nt|sybarra: true  with colors|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I would not do it, I never carch a dummy like that |pg||
nt|janm: I think I'd open 2 - it's a little too heavy in defense compared to offense for me to want to open 3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not in love with misstating my number of trump.  I'm willing not to make the preempt on a particular hand - but I don't love to misstate number of trump.  Seems to work out badly ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: often and not ideal for partnership harmony.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @HQ will be an expensive lead....|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: trying to coach a bid out of N |pg||
nt|sybarra: well here "we" are |pg||
nt|lorderic: Wang was my teammate in 2006|pg||
nt|sybarra: so is young also I take it |pg||
mb|6S|nt|sharkey: apparently Kristian, Danish operator, is a popular name in Taiwan, may be Roland's doing.... - appearing in both rooms....|pg||
nt|sybarra: still take out |pg||
nt|lorderic: we played World Youth Bridge Cham. in Thailand, under 21|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not usre I will bid again with S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but also not sure what I would do over 3 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: except beat it |pg||
nt|sharkey: S will not stop below slam now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: I think NS can make about 4 @cs (or @ds I guess)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Missing one so 6@S it is and with no @D ruff coming we're on to 15.|pg||
mc|12|nt|jcwla: This one will not take long.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|gracelin: expect 3H and 3S.  Up to north to decide.|pg||
nt|by: wouldn't 3@s be purely competitive?  i think it is to south to decide|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Tao is worth an invitational jump to 3@S. 1@C is more encouraging that 1@D was in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|xenya: if N bids 3@S now as he should S might raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|by: no, 1@c is bid on all weak no-trumps|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|jcwla: Jan is right, WD by E.|pg||
nt|janm: Guess we can't complain about not getting distributional hands here!|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sybarra: yuk as they say |pg||
nt|jcwla: What do you do with S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Another slam potential coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam may not be so easy to bid without the preempt - likely to be duplicated OR|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lorderic: another interesting board - 11 minors in N and 12 majors in S|pg||
nt|sybarra: its been this way all night, and we saw lots of end plays.....|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1NT shows @cs|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: W's double not textbook.|pg||
nt|sybarra: just the bid S wanted to hear |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the 1 nt bid)|pg||
nt|lorderic: my mistake, only 10 minors in N|pg||
nt|sybarra: since I opened I would just bid 2 @H |pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree, Shirley.|pg||
nt|janm: S now has the usual problem when you open a light hand with 56 in the Majors with 1@h - is he good enough for 2@s. Particularly with the DBL, I think not|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I dont mind that opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I dont reverse now  just a simple 2 @H  for me|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jcwla: I don't love the opening - seems like you should be able to get it in later usu.|pg||
nt|janm: It certainly seems right to open with 12 cards in the Majors! And although many people would open 1@s with this sort of hand and 56, I don't see how he could do that with 57.|pg||
nt|janm: Wow! 4@h is a big bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: nv, |pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo,  do we have any ladies at this table |pg||
nt|lorderic: is W considering 5@D?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@D perhaps a bit pusillanimous.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think W is |pg||
nt|lorderic: if E has 5cd @D and singleton @h it can be good|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if bidding 5 @D has to be in tempo |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hard to judge "good" and "bad" bidding on freak hands -- often, anything could work out well or badly.|pg||
nt|janm: I think 2@d is very reasonable - he didn't have to bid at all, so it showed some values and reasonable diamonds, which is what he has|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we saw all night (here) day there |pg||
nt|janm: West has a lot of losers to venture an 11 trick game, but he does have good support for partner and doesn't know what's going on with S's bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: W may think his pard has the singleton  |pg||
nt|janm: But no real reason to - N didn't show any support|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I do not like 1@S.|pg||
nt|sybarra: may land in 3 nt?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N is the top  spot, will be bid i expect|pg||
nt|lorderic: let's see if NS can get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: true Jan  (sorry)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S - shud bid it at these colors|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@S would be very nice result here.|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@H shows 13-15 with 3 cd @S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|jcwla: Four card support should be shown IMMEDIATELY in my opinion.|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - Not sure 1S will be able to show his hand now|pg||
nt|sharkey: *S|pg||
nt|sharkey: S is regretting his bid now...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now 4@H sounds like 3 and 3@H could be on two.|pg||
nt|janm: Tough for West to know what's right, but he has turned a plus against 4@h into a minus in 5@d, as long as S is willing to sit for this|pg||
nt|sybarra: X=  pd please dont bid again |pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems S has been unilateral enough, time to let go.|pg||
nt|janm: It's often hard when you've opened a minimum shaped hand to let partner double the opponents, but you just have to - he's already shown his hand, can't bid it again|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H conventional - showing a type @S raise I assume|pg||
nt|lorderic: yes you're right|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ty Kuo|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: just bid it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H may show stronger hand than 3@H in their system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is not the worst 13 I have ever seen (in S)|pg||
nt|capercliff: not an auction for a @h lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and far from best either |pg||
nt|janm: And he (or she) didn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe S should have opened 4 @H  any one for that?|pg||
nt|lorderic: S is a "she"|pg||
nt|jcwla: If I were going to rebid 4@H on round two with this hand I would just have opened it 4.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Chang end played her way into 3 + contacts in one set |pg||
nt|sharkey: They don't use support xx?|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1@D denies 4 cd Major|pg||
nt|sharkey: N doesnt like the shape 6322 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might he play a, q of sp?|pg||
nt|capercliff: i might lead K@s here, and lose imps of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: he= declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should have said found the end play  to make the contracts |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I hope so -- I could see how some people could play it as weak.  You have to be able to bid 3@H with two here.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: I dont do those "fancy" leads...they never work out for me |pg||
pc|h5|nt|capercliff: the K@s wouldnt be far off if declarer's black suits were transfered |pg||
nt|capercliff: and would be consistent with the auction|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|sharkey: yes - and also invite to cue bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised S passed must have enough for slam with @CK @HQ and four trumps...|pg||
nt|capercliff: on this hand the lead is irrelevent|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N looks best, a motif that seems to have run throughout the day's vugraphs.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 to CGU on 1 - their opponents sold out to 3@C/N down 3 - not enough recompense for the 3NT making in here.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well I did not understand the auction on 13 but it was suggested 5@C showed one keycard there, here it's zero.  Maybe it's just straight Blackwood or maybe they weren't on the same ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: page in terms of what was trump in 13 (if anything).|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case barring a misunderstanding here above 4NT the blame for this one goes to South.|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder how firmly 3@S sets trumps?  In my style it might have only 3-card support.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lorderic: i guess they set trump in 3@S|pg||
nt|janm: That might have been a mistake - now when N gets in with a club, he can play A and a trump and prevent the second club ruff |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: not sure why is took his transportaiton  away with the clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: This shud be quick too Jordan|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lorderic: i've heard that the director is called on Board 1 open room|pg||
nt|janm: So we'll get farther and farther ahead of them I guess - good for the Open Room audience to have comparisons|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Maybe they won't need five more minutes to finish this one?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would read it that way |pg||
nt|othered1: This is a good spot, just not best.  Very rarely will it be punished at imps.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not take long |pg||
nt|janm: This is a time when N should stop and think about declarer's tricks - it might seem right to play a heart through in case partner needs it, but there's no rush - on the other hand, ...|pg||
nt|janm: if he doesn't play 2 rounds of trump now, he knows declarer will be able to ruff 2 clubs in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: agree - S should be elated when pd bid 4 NT and not stop below slam.  The 1@S bid really created a dilemma|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer might think about potential play if @S are 5-0.|pg||
nt|lorderic: for the new ones: NS play MOSCITO: a highly artificial system with strong club and 4 card major|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|capercliff: I wouldnt have played the 10@s thats for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: or even 4-1 could be yukky |pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcwla: wd|pg||
nt|lorderic: the score is adjusted to 3NT in board 1 open room|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shud be makeable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Bad is a good description of south's hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|othered1: the second pass by west is timid|pg||
nt|lorderic: nV i suppose everyone here would bid it right?|pg||
nt|janm: Now that's a surprise - I thought Chang was deciding between 1NT and DBL, didn't think of pass with 4 spades and 14 HCPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's pass more of a surprise to me.|pg||
nt|janm: I think that NS can make about 3 spades and EW probably 1@h|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1NT on 14 seems esoteric and an Italian-style double to announce opening values was not in the offing.|pg||
nt|janm: It's not an Italian style DBL, the S hand has support for all the unbid suits|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: Someone will probably have to make an aggressive call.|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play it here|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: this dealer needs some help |pg||

nt|sharkey: Does W have a problem?|pg||

nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: As long as E holds off in @H will be hadr to make 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: However, passing with the N hand would not occur to me.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|sharkey: Not sure what 2@C is - many play it forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: but @S split, so game isn't on EW|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: S bypassed 4 card @S suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS playing weak NT openings perhaps?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: should be no problem for 1NT... only the matter of overtricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: N knows something funny has happened and might be worried that it's E who has substantial extra values - of course having 5 spades is a reason to bid, but he has virtually no ...|pg||
nt|janm: defense and not a lot of offense.|pg||
nt|janm: Still, it's surprising that both of them would choose to pass conservatively on this hand.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The problem with double as S -- and the reason it's not textbook although it works for some -- comes from partner's POV, esp in comp auctions, when they place you on appropriate ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: distribution and bid accordingly -- then you show it up with 4-3-3-3 and it's just not good.|pg||
nt|janm: However, the OR NS did worse by bidding :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|jcwla: Hmm -- I'm not convinced they're on the same page here -- in any case S must be at the tip-top so here we are in 4@H.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|sharkey: 25 HCP - not sure what 2@H means - two hearts??|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: Cant even see possiblities of making this one...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|janm: The OR South overbid with 1NT and then overbid again with 3NT.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: here goes the end play again |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: The lead has pretty much placed all the honor cards - except @CJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: we may just make this |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: So true.|pg||
nt|janm: My partners don't expect perfect shape if I have decent HCPs - of course you need either solid values or shape for a TO DBL, but I don't think you need both|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lorderic: and E finds it quickly|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - so 8 or 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|jcwla: I could see about six or seven alternative natural auctions ending in anything from 1NT, 2@H, 2NT, 3NT.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dA|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but will they get there ?|pg||
nt|gracelin: I hope East will not lead a small spade against 3NT|pg||
nt|by: No, 1@d simply denies 4 card major, 2@c shows @d with 9+ hcp, X means "for penalty if you have at least two spades"|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|by: are you sure that 3N makes after the spade lead?|pg||
nt|gracelin: but why south want to penalize opponent in 2-level when partner also have a double spade is beyond me.|pg||
nt|by: I don't pretend to read their minds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if he takes the right red suit fin by, but that is double dummy|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, by, 1S + 4H + 2D + 2C = 9|pg||

mb|d|nt|lorderic: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The reason there is some problem after the first four bids is because there is not a big fit -- this is also why there are problems making game on the cards.  I would have more ...|pg||

nt|sharkey: What do you suggest?|pg||

pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Just 2 IMPs exchanged on 13-15.  OR got all the way to 4@H on 15.|pg||

nt|lorderic: it's the best score for NS -- only if they don't misdefend|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: now what to lead from N?|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt W sees dummy much |pg||
nt|othered1: I hadn't given any thought to immediate action by east at these colors when I guessed it could end in 1@S|pg||
nt|lorderic: both table in this match play standard 5-card major|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes,  there is another session yet  |pg||
nt|othered1: That can be interesting, lots of variants to MOSCITO, some more exciting than others, as I recall.|pg||

nt|othered1: well, declarer did have a @C guess to make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: The club ruff, if they take it, will be with a natural trump trick, but it was still the most attractive lead for West - if East had the diamond A instead of the KJ, he could have ...|pg||
nt|janm: gotten 2 club ruffs|pg||
nt|janm: The OR EW did very well to beat 2@s, unless I'm missing something - it seems as if declarer has 5 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond and 1 club|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like a 4-IMP pickup for BTU-Y |pg||
nt|lorderic: surprised that 2@S goes down at the other table|pg||
nt|janm: I don't see how any of those tricks can go away after this start - maybe A and a club and then a diamond back would have worked|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: E has to return trumph|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||

nt|lorderic: the declare uppercut himself|pg||

nt|janm: declarer can play the K and have 2 dummy entries to ruff out and use the clubs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|janm: The diamond pitch makes blocks the EW diamonds, but I don't think that's good enough to give declarer an overtrick. Still, this will be another small pickup for BTU|pg||

nt|othered1: Yes, but with 11 trumps there may be other reasons to find the play.  Rabbis do it with 4 or 5 trumps out, on their good days.|pg||

nt|jcwla: reverse W's @C's and @D's..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lorderic: NS reach the better contract, and the lead is good for them|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll bet GIB can make this fairly easily.  But GIB peeks.   This isn't going to be all that easy.|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a lot to do |pg||
nt|janm: Bidding 1@s in response to 1@c with this West hand carries the Walsh concept of bidding 4 card Majors too far I think - it doesn't make sense to skip over a 6 card diamond suit ...|pg||
nt|janm: with a good hand.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@S was @D.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Then 2@S natural @S bid.|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|janm: Oh, sorry, they're playing some sort of transfer responses to 1@c and 1@s showed diamonds. I still don't like it (playing transfer responses I'd bid 1@h to show 4+ spades) but it's ...|pg||
nt|janm: not as bad as I thought at first|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR is finished -- we welcome all those who have joined us slowpokes here in the CR.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lorderic: draw two round of trumps, if @H 3-2, ducking a spade take the contract home|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if they cash 2 @C? |pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: So sensibly leads the unbid suit and this will be another pickup for the leaders|pg||
nt|janm: Notice that 5@d makes - if West's auction suggested something like 6-4 in diamonds and spades, maybe E shouldn't have been in such a rush to bid 3NT with Axx in hearts|pg||
nt|by: Jan, you would not show the long suit first? I think E should have supported diamonds and get to a staid, safe 5@d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janm: The way I play transfer responses to 1@c, 1@s denies a 4-card Major, so I'd show the Major first, but I definitely agree that E should at least have made an attempt to get to ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||

nt|othered1: This isn't home yet, is it?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|sharkey: On Bd 16 the bidding problem arises after 1@D-1@H-1@S-1 NT - ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In my view....|pg||
nt|jcwla: At matchpoints I'd say it's clear to pass after that start.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|janm: Oops - something went wrong in the NS carding (that 2 of hearts back must have looked to S as if N had shortness and East actually had his 3NT bid with 4 good hearts|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|xenya: slam might not be too easy to bid here -- a lot depends on E's opening|pg||
nt|gracelin: all 3NT, 4S, 5D game contracts make so it's hard for BTU to lose imp on this last board.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|xenya: 1@S should do the job i think|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|gracelin: the one contract they should avoid is 6NT.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|xenya: hmm|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sunsamvar: i much rather prefer the 1@S opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|gracelin: E needs to bid 6D to save the day, or West may choose 6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|xenya: i don't understand why E didn't support @Ds|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can accept the 2S rebid, surpressing the D, but after 3D, East must raise D, probably via 4H splinter.|pg||
nt|xenya: but she can do that now|pg||
nt|gracelin: it seems to me now West's 4NT was quantitaive.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and when East showed club support (5C), he bid slam there.  |pg||
mb|6S|nt|sunsamvar: oops|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|gracelin: but East of course took 4NT as RKC for spades.  Luckily for them. 6S is ok, but might  West choose 6NT in this confused auction.?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: snatched defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|gracelin: now only 7D can save the day.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: what a shame.  I expected a huge swing in favor of NTU turned to be a disaster.|pg||
nt|by: they hate you :)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|by: wait a moment|pg||

pc|h5|pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||

nt|othered1: For the @C lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: tie match in this set so far|pg||
nt|janm: Sometimes the 3-4 playoff is shorter than the finals|pg||
nt|jcwla: In OR N started with 1NT, E raised @H's, and N later came out of the closet w/3@C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: If NTU-PAC bids game on 21 match virtually tied|pg||
nt|lorderic: is that a pass or correct?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hope E understands..|pg||
nt|lorderic: i doubt E knows that|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcwla: This will make a bunch w/this @H position and @C break|pg||

nt|othered1: if you want to play slam, it must be in @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: i'm wondering if 2@S is a forcing bid or not|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes that is best spot |pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: the third cheap 2@S this set?|pg||
nt|sybarra: SCU  falling more behind  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S knows N and E have near blank hands thus no purpose in bidding with opps Vul despite 18 HCP|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile they've bid to 4@S on 19 -- |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H cue ? by N  ?    do you cooperate now?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@D is imaginative.  A last-train type cue-bid, but why.  Couldn't south be all minors?|pg||
nt|lorderic: Board 6, north didn't find the club lead and 6@S is made|pg||
nt|lorderic: another 13 IMPs to CGU|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: now on to the play.|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's not easy to get 24 IMPs from defending 2@S|pg||
nt|lorderic: nV, undoubled|pg||
nt|janm: I thought the OR EW were playing Moscito - doesn't that include transfer 1 level openings? Or are they just playing a strong club?|pg||
nt|lorderic: he does|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lorderic: sorry i mean Board 7|pg||
nt|by: no, honeymoon moscito, 1990 version, not the transfer modern|pg||
nt|janm: OK :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might not X here but surely has an idea of the scoreline.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|janm: Unusual auction by N here - I think I like the immediate 1NT chosen in the OR better (although I confess I might just bid 2@c)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow with this scoreline I would have expected slam.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: Do you think north knows what's going on?  If so, why not the @H cue-bid?  |pg||
nt|janm: This isn't going to be a success - the club break will not make N happy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcwla: Oh I would have no problem with taking another call.|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Jordan pointed out very fortunate hand for EW - exchange @H9 and @H10 the hand will go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard, cues, I return the cue "on the way"   to game,   |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: Dbl and expect Pd to Pass?|pg||
nt|othered1: or it could be that they play that @C cue-bid implies @H control.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: would be making 7 with this lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: I don't think it's clear that north knew that south was cue-bidding with huge and long @S support|pg||
nt|sybarra: Kuo  your thoughts?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lorderic: 5@C... N: ok i would like to play clubs|pg||
nt|lorderic: CGU didn't take the chance to have some swing|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d9|nt|janm: So this will be -2 for 9 IMPs to CGU|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h4|pc|d8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: maybe should bid 6 @c ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: coiuld be that south worked out that north didn't know she had already shown @S support, so just took the practical bid.  It simply isn't a winner here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: think  going down now |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jcwla: There was a reasonable chance that their method might get them to a slam that the other pair just might miss.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lorderic: this 3@D is not my type|pg||

nt|othered1: It's a way to bring EW back into the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. with 4 @H's |pg||
nt|sybarra: and few folks play penalty X's here so....|pg||
nt|jcwla: And here's another swing chance for CGU.|pg||
mb|2C!|an|GF+|nt|lorderic: can CGU pick it up?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: although N didn't need much for a slam|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: I usually like to bid with Majors over a strong NT, but this isn't the hand to do it on - too much defense, too little shape, too little offense. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: well this is my favo time to lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: none of pards suit...|pg||
nt|othered1: I play penalty doubles here (you gotta be right some of the time)|pg||
nt|sybarra: why penalty here Ed?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after 3 @d you play penalty not neg|pg||
nt|sharkey: They'll pick up IMPs on 17|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C shows GF natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Wrong again...|pg||
nt|jcwla: It c--it c--it can't be.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jcwla: Oof.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Vul both N and S shud try for game|pg||
mb|5H|nt|janm: Not unreasonable by E opposite Majors - if partner has a bad hand, the opponents can probably make 3NT and if partner has a good hand, we might make 4@s. If he knew partner would ...|pg||
nt|janm: DBL on this hand, though...|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: So it looks as if we'll end with some more IMPs to BTU, who will go into the second half comfortably in front|pg||
nt|jcwla: So often on VG each hand's actions in isolation can be defended, but the two don't go together.|pg||
nt|jcwla: N/S in 3NT on 17 in OR and E did not lead @S from AKJ-sixth.|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|gracelin: if we give CGU 13 imps for the missing slam on board 23, the match is really close.|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx to our wonderful operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to Ed and Kuo for joining me  we appreciate you time and insights |pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks Shirley and Ed!|pg||
nt|sybarra: also thx to the specs  great comments  we appreciate them |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|jcwla: 3@D on the first board is not bridge.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the organizers for bringing this to bbo  |pg||
nt|sharkey: Last board here - 5 more OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: What's yr bid as S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@D for me|pg||
nt|by: CGU defeats CMU by a large margin|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to Ed and KUO for your insights and thoughts on the hands.      |pg||
nt|by: actually 34.5 IMPs|pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks Shirley and Ed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Last one in here.  We'll all be watching the results come in but meanwhile big thanks to Roland, Carl, Kuo, our operator and all specs.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Congrats to both teams.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Mundane 4@S I think|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|jcwla: 3@D not on the planet -- 5@D seems routine.|pg||
nt|janm: That's a matter of partnership agreement - some of us consider that the lower the card we lead the better our holding, so the 2 would suggest an original 5-card holding (remember ...|pg||
nt|janm: that from N's point of view, S might have led from 98x, so N couldn't afford the J back|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we are back in about 10 min |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sharkey: @S lead @H Ace diitch @C and more @S....|pg||
nt|othered1: double?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to specs,    great comments,  we appreciate them |pg||
nt|lorderic: this 3@D is much better than last one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes better suit |pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@D shows 3+@Ss and a good hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|by: must be a misclick|pg||
nt|lorderic: the pass by E is too timid IMO|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to those who help bring this fine tourney to BBO  much appreciated by all the fans|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: N is now complaining for not preemting by himself lol|pg||
nt|janm: That's the first soft result we've seen from this NS pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S is intended as a cue-bid slam try but might it not be QJ09xxxx and void heart and little else?|pg||
nt|sybarra: frisky?|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@H shows non-minimum, usually 4cd @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: 11 IMPs back?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: W will be in shock that this makes after E's reopening X.|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may lead @D after @HAce...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: why did I know L would lead that |pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like 2@H is cold her... 2 or 3 IMP to CGU|pg||
nt|by: NS was not a regular pairing|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok.... - more IMPs to CGU?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: W has not shown anything in responder's bid major, nor has E made any kind of inquiry.  @H lead good choice and when it works gets in a little psychological effect too.|pg||
nt|lorderic: not really. 3NT is cold due to @D4-4 |pg||
nt|lorderic: at best 2 IMPs to CGU|pg||
nt|sharkey: S needs a @C lead...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: 6@H can be defeated by a low club lead to the nine for the @D ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ask and thou shall receive....|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Lead from nothing, get nothing."|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|lorderic: a club lead would be 11 tricks and a push|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: good bye @D |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Instead 3 more IMPs to the leaders...|pg||
nt|sybarra: but we arrived undoubled|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: North-south played well and in good fortune this set.|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe @D this time? on spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" =n/s|pg||
pc|s5|mc|10|nt|sharkey: sry - made?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Carl, Roland, our operator and all specs.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hello?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Thank you all|pg||
nt|jcwla: OK thx all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: THX for all the comentators|pg||
nt|lorderic: no double, no trouble|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 9 easy tricks once the clubl finesse wins and then will have to decide whether to take a diamond finesse for 10 - probably not a good idea with the possibility that NS ...|pg||
nt|janm: can take 4 spade tricks if they win a diamond before declarer has taken his 9|pg||
nt|by: only in south, Jan|pg||
nt|lorderic: S plays safely by putting on @HA|pg||
nt|lorderic: so 1IMP to CGU|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all -- for now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|lorderic: that's all for CR, thanks Jordan and Carl!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: thank for all the commentators and specs, this is the end of the final in CR|pg||
