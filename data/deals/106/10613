nt|Vugraphu1: Glasson asks about carding: "standard"|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: I wonder if 2@S showed 6.  If so, maybe 3N was possible over 3@S (if 3N would be natural.)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: dim lead looks normal on auction|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead isn't easy at all to find on this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: an aggressive player as west may have doubled 3c for the lead but that his its risks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: no east cannot be blamed for leading the unbid suit|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, if you double it, it's nice to have some confidence you can beat it, or at least hold redoubled overtricks.|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lestergold: would have made no difference on actual hand but could have on another day|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz checks that 1NT is strong and Sutherlin says it is|pg||
nt|othered1: how will south act?|pg||
nt|lestergold: excfellent roland slam for e/w|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|fabsayc: you mean 6@D by east?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz wrote a long note to Sutherlin - I can't see it, but probably spades and another or spades and a minor|pg||
nt|dburn: slam? what slam?|pg||
nt|othered1: really?  It doesn't make, does it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: only needs dims behaving hearts 3/3 and heart finesse and no damaging club lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts 3/2|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d by East is down on a club lead, 6@d by West is down on a heart lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: 12.85% plus maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|amr: not even that high|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but there is a 12% chance defense goes wrong, so it qualifies|pg||
nt|lestergold: its terribloe andhopeless david but its a roland slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: maybe not ok|pg||
nt|dburn: the defining feature of a Roland slam is that it should make|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: but in practice all slams that can make on a lie of the cards and a misdefence qualify|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like best lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: however back at this particular ranch what are the chances now for 4h making?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Glasson asks Mancuso what the NT range is: "15-17"|pg||
nt|dburn: slim and none, and Slim just left town|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, very slim|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|amr: better than the -3 in the Closed room|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: slimmer than u david and certainly slimmer than me!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: -1 looks to be par|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: ouch|pg||
nt|othered1: 150 seems like a nice result for NS in closed room|pg||
nt|dburn: well, when declarer sees the trump split, she may not play diamonds to best advantage|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: a dim finesse would look to be with the a priori odds|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: Did south show a second suit with 2@S?  If so, @D misguess isn't automatic|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: but thats counterbalanced by the spade bid|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: not playing a strong club system, many would open south opposite  a passe pard with 4S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now the issue is avoiding getting too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|othered1: the right 8 count makes slam easily opposite south, so 4@S is a pro-am bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but there is a danger in opening spade of pass out with 4 cold too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: old fashion precision asking bids would work on this hand, starting with 2@H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can Bachi find extra values?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smart can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Doesn't that show 11-12 with a C stopper?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: if you double 2@H please hide  = no more bidding|pg||
nt|april7: now they are overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... tougher if you take a point or two away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's see|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use 11-14 NT openings so this show 15 - 17(18)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: precion at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: precision|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: the 2NT bid was not the best idea|pg||

pc|c7|nt|rodal f: Was a spot for 6@S here. Still tough @S are 1-4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: the X was also wrong, because E makes it now and W WAS FORCED  TO CONTINUE BIDDING ANYWAY|pg||

nt|kareno: When I played with Peggy, we would open that west hand 1@s.  |pg||
nt|lestergold: not if west cashes heart ace|pg||
nt|kareno: That's my preference as my partners know :)|pg||
nt|kareno: true :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should be able to c that a spade concedes the rest|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sutherlin has put her cards down and is considering carefully|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, they play standard carding so her partner hasn't got the spade ace.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|mc|9|nt|sharynr: cant risk the duck|pg||
nt|sharynr: even though the table action dictates otherwise|pg||

nt|benjent: Question about where this event leads...|pg||
nt|rodal f: For vug TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|1C|nt|april7: although bad @S position, still 10 tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|haans: needed for ruffi8ng|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north's first club spot showed count, then the 2nd one could be for suit preference|pg||
nt|april7: but then its to late|pg||
nt|roman505:  The rest of our team were all under 30, Nye-Ware and Geromboux-Griffiths|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|april7: e goes all the way|pg||
nt|gracelin: at least let declarer find the double dummy play|pg||
nt|benjent: The Australian system awards Playoff Points for wins and high finishes in national events|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: 2NT are to hard in S now but would have woorked|pg||
nt|benjent: Afetr a bruising year, we have a playoff for the national team(s) amongst the highest playoff-point-scorers|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I spent around 30 years "learning" 3014 ... my brain has only a set number of system changes in it, and I am not going to spend one of them on this pointless exercise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Roland. Normaly 1403 fit the cards better the 0314|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be a + for NS anyway I belive:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: A practic bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: N is wondering whats going on|pg||
nt|haans: 4NT?|pg||
nt|benjent: The winners of this event get about 3/4 of the points needed for the playoff|pg||
nt|kiddd: ???|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: clubs + shorter diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My wife plays 1430 except in clubs.  My comment is: "what a schemozzle"|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got the spot.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: better :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|april7: 2 down on @C lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: De Luca trying to put sand in the machine|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|april7: @C switch!!|pg||
nt|haans: what has happened to Blackwood you may ask? finding game more important|pg||
nt|april7: it makes on a non @C lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: And next by 11 I belive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11 o'clock?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: declarer still needs to guess spade|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Rodal, I reckon you would be great on Twitter|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|benjent: Good X of 4@s by Smolanko to get his side in the game|pg||
nt|roman505:  Another straightforward hand after the early excitement, but I think we will have more to come|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: low high signal!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Y. But I belive 4 @S are -1 so + already after the bid from W|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: 0230 in Denmark|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 11:30|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nearly as they should have bidded 3NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: because after 3 rounds of trump, he has only one trump left and has two losers to cover|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My watch must be fast ...|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|haans: they almost made 4@H almost|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pc|d7|nt|april7: its agood save against 4 @S|pg||
nt|april7: can't duck this and take second, then must also duck second|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|gracelin: if West wins this and shift to Heart, north needs to take HA and play a spade to A immediately, |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|april7: y|pg||
nt|haans: decl knows (:) wast hane only 1 spade|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: 20 looks like a might funny board|pg||

nt|rodal f: Might Bill. Are not inside that web page:)|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|rodal f: I have some problems by net so some min was dumped y:(|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gracelin: it's agood try by playing spade first, but he need to guess the spade situation|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kareno: With this lead she can make it!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe with an overtrick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: club switch and wont risk it for the novertrick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: I don't understand why no club lead, though.  South is known to have good spades.  Peggy is adament, however, about not 'leading for partner' in 3nt.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north is known not to have anything in clubs also|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone else consider overcalling with that east hand?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: so the club does look marked|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharynr: i think at reversed vulnerability i would overcall 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfavourable im not too happy about a weak jump overcall otherwise id be inclined|pg||
nt|kareno: I think at any I would :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: NO not a WJO - you have a transferable value with the ace of spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: Just a simple 2@c overcall to get your suit in when you have an entry as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well when i do ajxx sitting over and opener making a reopening double and partner goes down with misfitting yarband i go for 1100|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c over call i have more sympathy with but pard may expect more|pg||
nt|kareno: Versus a more normal continuation where the auction continues and you have gotten your suit in?|pg||
nt|lestergold: this heart finesse is forced now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: off surely now|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||

pc|dT|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: west was guaranteed to have had led from reasonable spades|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: so a trick had to be lost to the qs|pg||
mc|7|nt|Vugraphu1: Short bathroom break|pg||
nt|lestergold: that must have been fatigue|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure of it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its 5a.m. here in blighty and i think id better have a hit the sack attempt|pg||
nt|kareno: Was it really down 2??|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan?  Down 1 or 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: specs complaining we are being too kind|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: we're back|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: It was down 2 - she didn't take the club A|pg||
nt|lestergold: they want us to call a bad error what i is bad bridge not apologise for tyired players but frankly i always get absolutely exhausted towards the end of a long days bridge|pg||

nt|benjent: All finished in the other room, but 2 left here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gracelin: if spades break 4-1, it's 3 : 2 that west's singleton is a small one rather than an honor.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sa 10 - ACT 30 so fare at the set, and a new leader|pg||
nt|rodal f: For people who are interested at resaults from J26 Europa: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=22|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|april7: N could bid now a preemtive 3@C,not 2|pg||
nt|benjent: Bookallil-Fischer won't like their finish in the Open Room - 22 imps out|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice @H on bad @C of|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S|pg||
nt|roman505:  Everything lay well for declarer on the last hand, but biding 3NT was unlikely on their auction. |pg||
nt|roman505:  SA may reach three here though.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: negative = spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: For set the contract down it was needed a @S lead I belive|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but do they have 8 but not 9???|pg||
nt|gracelin: depending on the range of 2NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|april7: then S might stop in 4|pg||
nt|roman505:  If they do, it may wrap up the match|pg||
nt|roman505:  No!|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: West will bid game if 2NT shows 22+|pg||
nt|april7: then its GF, but with 22???|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C easy puppet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 or 11 tricks depending on how well he guesses hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are home now|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|april7: but 5 is ok, Qof @D could be ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clubs a non-issue on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: I wonder if Smolanko had a little try for game, and gave it up after a 2@d minimum response|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS to gain 1 IMP more?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think so - looks like 9 tricks are available|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: New @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Kan kill it by a neew @C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: not necessary game forcing, just showed some range and West thought his 3 is enough for game.|pg||
nt|haans: sort of agree with you but Mackwell boys never passed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: duck first @H|pg||
nt|gracelin: then you lose your own club suit.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same but J21: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=22|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: decarer will probably play hearts to be 4-4, and guess spade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|benjent: Playing safe with the @hK, and back to 8 tricks...|pg||

nt|haans: dummy is 3 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: N must step in in @S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He should probably continue clubs after drawing trumps - might have an endplay in some scenarios|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, if West started with @CK10x, he would be endplayed|pg||
nt|roman505:  Not much Bagchi can do here|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at least to The Australian Federation - BBO by all there nice people. ( Wald are at sleep) We was Bjørn and Frank from norway trying to help|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||
nt|super nova: Just thinking about the extra 6% that bill mentioned|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: But you can pick up singleton J or Q with North|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|elivero: And thx to Frank that use so mucth of his time for uss here,,thx Frank|pg||

nt|Walddk2: if you guess it|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would play it that way based on restricted choice if an honour was played from N|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|benjent: Low @d to the J looks like the best ployt to create tricks, but doesn't work here|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or. Best small @D|pg||

nt|rodal f: And afterthe ques. 5@H = do u like ure quality at @H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to stop at 4|pg||
nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Perhaps as commented elsewhere, it is often unwise to use 4NT with weak trumps.|pg||
