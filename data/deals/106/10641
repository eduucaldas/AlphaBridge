nt|kaapo: And 2@D probably a multi style, showing a long major|pg||
nt|tomi2: Max Ellerbeck did :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: I would. Maybe South is worried about @Hxxx but that wouldn't detour me in not doubling. By X-ing you get 3 suits across|pg||

nt|Gerben42: good one for your system talk: is 2NT natural here or does it show no preference...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The U26 Open category has a day off today, hence they don't have running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: south is now "endplayed" I think he should try some kind of 2NT bid and wait for something good to happen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for me 2NT is not natural in auctions where one opp opened and the other bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, then Nab will bid 3@D and will become declarer, thats the best that can happen to south :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: only one level higher|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bazý ellerde vugraf operatörleri oynanan kartlarý yanlýþ girebiliyorlar ama sonradan düzeltiyorlar|pg||

nt|mdgraham: pull out the old blunderbuss and bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: dbl probably (I can doulbe one of the suits) |pg||
nt|mamos: NS lopk a little high already|pg||
nt|mamos: hi shirley|pg||
nt|mamos: realistically West has little choice but to sell out to this|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that easy to think game with E,,, I wouldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 3H =inv 5-5|pg||
nt|ozgull: açýk odadan anladýðýmýz gibi ingilizler 12-14 NT oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|kastan88: misfit on NS, possible that West will start doubling now|pg||
nt|kastan88: he was faster (West)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Simonsen is thinking|pg||
nt|andy_h: Very nice treatment of the 2NT bid in competition - showing 2 places to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a @H lead might end it anyway|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d alerted as Walsh i assume|pg||
nt|ronpa: No reason to do something else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here, of course, 3NT may be a club stop and running diamonds, so it is not so clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @C10 and a small spade from dummy?|pg||
nt|mamos: he'sd like to do something  but what ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can imagine S being especially unlucky, given his semi-wasted @S values|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I personally wouldn't have bid with N's hand. All it's going to do is that it may excited partner (when you don't really want to given the void in clubs). Given N has 3spadeds ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: (marking shortage with partner) then S may still re-open|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i wouldnt have doubled in N either... what if pd simply has 12 HCP and good 6-card @C, I dont want to be anywhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl of 3@S = dont lead that pd|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the question here is what happens at the 6 level|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphztr: Decl can't handle the Jxxx with W|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes they play walsh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead in either major gives a trick|pg||
nt|ronpa: and 3NT from West seat is cold on any lead|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Jacki: Please let me know if you need to be ungagged|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so the way is free for quite some undertricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: X must be some game invitation|pg||

nt|rodal f: And Jankova are on the line by the other huge hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Sweden is tied on the 4th place and Latvia tied on the 7th|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will lead spades anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: this spot looks just fine|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: it says: 17+ 1@c with nebulous 1@D, 5card M's|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ozgull: ingiltere'de beginnerlara 1NT açýþý 12-14 tür diye gösterildiði için öyle tahmin ettim|pg||
nt|MolvaM: vugrafta daha sýk yer alabilmemiz için takýmýmýzýn klasmanda yükselmesi gerek|pg||
nt|yuval10: N did well to remove the 3NT, but 5@disn't likely to make either|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi all|pg||
nt|waso: hiii|pg||
nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice fit EW but no slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can watch Max Ellerbeck's nice defense to 3@S in the movie, he found the @C ruff in 2nd trick accorcing to their signaling methods and so they defeated 3@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: It appers that NS could make 7@D|pg||

nt|tomi2: Dutch EW did well to stop in game here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||

nt|henryb: cards lie very well for N-S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: the 9 showed the @C switch?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't really blame West for passing 2@C. Maybe East should have opened - his hand sure looked like an opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, time to wake up, jan|pg||
nt|elbec: manno and di franco play weak no trump "Nightmare" style|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N EW has play|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@C looks unlikely to stop EW bidding the game in a major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you are French, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either: 12-14 bal OR natural 12+ OR 18+ any distr.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: and the 3@C bid showed the @D suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dutch EW did not stop in game after all...|pg||
nt|minnie lee: results: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|yuval10: E did very well here to judge that her cards in the minors worth a game|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet East thought that his side was in a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|ritong: if you don t , yopu might get caught in a bad spiral|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo: My second guess is that NS play polish club|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S is nonforicig, W will not believe|pg||

nt|mariner1: Hi all! Welcome to the 22nd European Youth Championships from Poiana, Brasov,|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2N here is a good raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|ozgull: juniors ta belli olmaz:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk fýrsatta key card sorulmasý gereken bir el ama asýl sorun grandþlem var ise onu kaçýrmamak|pg||
nt|waso: very lucky stayman here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: You don't, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N actually alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As being @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: pass or correct?|pg||
nt|henryb: to respond or not to respond, that is the question|pg||
mb|r|nt|sybarra: interesting |pg||
nt|ronpa: nice agreement of 3@H to play, but only 8 trix because of bad @H break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like five rapid losers|pg||
nt|charles_l: what style is that?|pg||
nt|mamos: West has some problem now a very good hand opposite a double at this level|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some more specs have comed. Web page for the turney: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
mb|2H|nt|elbec: 1@c is 15+ with 4or+@c or 15-17 balanced or 24+any|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with three trumps..|pg||
nt|mariner1: like a limit in Sayc|pg||
mb|3S|nt|waso: maybe 1nt 16-18|pg||
nt|mamos: should East advance?   I don't think so he has bid his hand alresdy|pg||
nt|mariner1: A@D right, even Q10x @S right, this will make game|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room France is in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: very conservative 2 passes by S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey açýsýndan grandþlemin anahtarý minör renklerdeki yan onörler|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where 1@C could be of several varieties|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here minimum balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@S losing 2@H and a 1C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm was watching BBO TV and it looked like... sry|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Nab using Sabine's tactic: bid 2@D over 1@C whenever possible :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: West probabbly will do better confirming his spade fit some way|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D from North?|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" may be playing at different level here  bets on over/under?|pg||
nt|gulyas: they may bid the slam after all:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Catalin (Romania) is our superb operator, Hi  Catalin!|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Charles Leong|pg||

mb|3N|nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure what went wrong here though|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think Sandra response was for Aces...|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard for me to imagine the E aimed to ask for aces...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: & but 4NT was Blackwood:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Cliff Gillis|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi all, sory about a few problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: we are already at board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bir þekilde karo üzerinden keycard sormayý denkleþtirmek iyi fikir olabilir|pg||
nt|ozgull: karo k pik as olsa mesala 13 hcp|pg||
nt|eerbil: Ingiliz takýmý zon durumuna göre deðiþken 1NT açýþý kullanýyor gibiler, uygun zon durumu 10-12 olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: böylece koz dam'ýný da öðrenebilir|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Latvia dont alert the 3-rd dbl:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what would 2NT after 2@S have been? |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2NT does not exist but must be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curiously, the scoring system seems to believe there hasn't been an exchange of IMPs yet in this match|pg||
nt|ronpa: 2@S also goes down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hi Charles1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||
nt|waso: yes|pg||
nt|waso: one of each|pg||
nt|wwalter: 3@h was a little optimistic :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: team style|pg||
nt|kaapo: A kibitzer has read in the bulletin, that NS would play strong club|pg||
nt|kastan88: interesting, how now EW will find their spades game, I would bid 2nd round 2@S with E hand, IMO showing 7...20 with 5-card @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hard decision 4 Mr. Lauks|pg||
nt|kastan88: now it is hard to West find good bid another than pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he will bid 4 sp?:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but 4@H only 3 down|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr even 2 down only|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi I'm Frank from Norway, Welcome also to Geir:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi Rodal & ty|pg||
nt|ritong: i think south would have bid if her LHO wasn t a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: like 1@d, then pass any bid|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming it is not a super forcing one:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: Burda 4NT briaz karýþýk gibi|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 5@C now... well, 3@S may even be better news|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H now? or what?|pg||
nt|frusco: sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North tell that South has four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure,  does that sound like @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE communicating in writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it all cues?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@S is cue, but does it SHOW or DENY @S control?:)|pg||
nt|frusco: 4@d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after the support |pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a head start for Sweden I see|pg||
nt|othered1: Reasonable spot and good lead.|pg||
nt|elbec: manno has already an important international experience, while di franco is at his first important junior event, after playing a lot for schools|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so as usual my expected result did not happen - when Czech allowed to play 6Dx|pg||
pc|hK|nt|waso: NV|pg||
nt|wwalter: not in white :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like to follow all tables. Open this and bookmark it: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if it does not exist, natural and forcing then|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'was not'|pg||
nt|capercliff: they bid slam on brd 1|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@s better than some of my slams|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphztr: -2?|pg||
nt|waso: but still EW  must defend well|pg||
nt|syl: GM all|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Click the running scores link in bold black at the top of the table to go to running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would think now W has a strong hand with clubs but maybe I am wrong and they have additional agreements|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, S certainly has some nice cards now, obv N was trying for slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: or lets say makeable stop |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ozgull: açýk odada þehmus 3h diyip sonra as sormuþ ortak kantitatif anlamasýn diye|pg||
nt|poohbear: The 5@d save was worth 3 imps against game but it got its huge reward when it forced EW into a minus positon|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing 5@D by N|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume 3rd best from 4 is their agreement, or is it always 3rd best?|pg||
nt|elbec: yes 3rd or 5th|pg||
nt|pelu: ok we are with u now|pg||
nt|mariner1: np thanks!|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Bas, are there screens?|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes and this is making now|pg||
nt|pelu: shift to @SK|pg||
nt|pelu: then it is double dummy to let the K hold the trick - |pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|sybarra: (imo)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Screens running between ES and WN|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he didn't|pg||
pc|s9|nt|waso: NOW   no hope|pg||
nt|gh1: I think 1 down in 4dia,|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: or more?|pg||
nt|tomi2: and I would think as west that my partner does not have the @D stopped after 3@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so flat board... |pg||
nt|tomi2: they will not be the only ones in that slam... |pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2@S is nonforcing, what hand would West need for slam anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|pelu: and a ruff will deefeat|pg||
pc|sK|nt|charles_l: now S has no entry|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer needs 2 entries to hand to play @Ss twice (he can't cash AK of hearts)|pg||
nt|othered1: @D to 9 won't be a winner|pg||
nt|xenya: but you are right, Charles -- now it's easier|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that is|pg||
nt|charles_l: might just concede 2@s, but very hairy with round suits threatening|pg||
nt|xenya: for example, he can just play @Ss now, but how does he know?|pg||
nt|xenya: echo, sorry|pg||
nt|charles_l: exactly :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|poohbear: dbled?|pg||
nt|gh1: good def fore -1|pg||
nt|pelu: wd by East|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphztr: yep good defence|pg||
nt|elbec: considering how cards lay, only the 3@s is the losing card|pg||
nt|charles_l: ed spotted it|pg||
nt|xenya: the only thing he shouldn't do is to finesse @Ds -- oh he has done just that|pg||
nt|charles_l: but with modern science we stay in 5@s off 1kc and trump Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ray Håkonsen|pg||

pc|s8|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi commentators|pg||
nt|tomi2: I always ask myself why 900 kibs come to OR and only 100 to closed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the name 'closed' is turning them away|pg||
nt|gracelin: normally specs follow the players they know|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, we have the Norwegian Star Lindqvist playing there, but of course our players here are also top players|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this event they dont start with board 18 so you dont get extra results from altrady played hands|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm|pg||
nt|gulyas: so this will be 6 IMPs to Poland|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|davidb: H& ruff be Dk best|pg||
nt|kaapo: It might be interesting to see, what number of hearts different juniors bid on the East hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the up trick |pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: I understand both Norway and Poland are strong in U26 and did well in the 1st WMSG last Oct.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Sten Bjertnes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|charles_l: was a tricky hand|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like the 3@H call in Open Room looking for game......|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d9|nt|rayhaa: in open east preempted 3@c, so easier to find @sQ, but danger for @s 4-1|pg||
nt|rayhaa: west sry|pg||
nt|charles_l: now @d hoping W can ruff?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2: Norway hat an excellent start in this event, but I remember 2 years ago it was the same and they dropped a bit - but I expect they learned from that and will be more concentrated ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: all through this event|pg||
nt|frusco: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: now he needs a miracle in @S and north's play is irrelevant, since he has 3 more black tricks coming|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S - 2n - 3@H - 4@S|pg||
nt|sten: hi everybody|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East should have signalled for diamonds with his choice of hearts on 3rd round|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so maybe E hand is too weak for 2@S?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|nt|davidb: now may make|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: yep srry|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/VGRama/minirama.html  - currrent vugraph|pg||
nt|mariner1: match (rotates)|pg||
nt|mamos: another high level hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW looking for tricks 8 and 9 here I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a nice lead from Lidqvist|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South will be satisfied to emerge with 5 tricks|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|poohbear: EW will need to get @cs going to beat game on this hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be a routine game |pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like a routine 3NT EW, with @Cs and @Ds both being very favorable it will be 11 tricks here as well|pg||
nt|capercliff: just|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: slam on a finesse |pg||
mb|1H|nt|poohbear: 4@hs would make if the @d finesse was on|pg||
nt|waso: tell us about them?|pg||
nt|syl: easy PLAY|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS should end up at 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can only imagine Barry Rigal's witty comments on this in the Vugraph theater|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we can get coffee?|pg||
nt|othered1: with north passing, EW may find a losing 3N|pg||
nt|elbec: only 7 tricks in NT for EW... let's see what happen|pg||
nt|charles_l: i thought all junirs open all flat 11s|pg||
nt|pelu: Norway are No 3 in the standing - only 1 VP after Germany - Denmark No 9 - but in the run - 6 wins in a row - average 20-10!|pg||
nt|mariner1: well EW can make 4 here I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes any big win can really help either team|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Hey Sten :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: 24 puanla 3nt. fena deðil|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might win 2@D, 1@C and 1@S to beat it|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphztr: I wonder what 2@S is, I think it's invitational|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h limit + probably|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|gulyas: you can even get lunch if you are fast enough:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: I doubt they can beat 1@H more than 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 @C scores how much?|pg||
nt|henryb: nice catch|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Bill|pg||
nt|sten: hi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Ment Berg|pg||
nt|sten: Not so good start for Norway here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Sten:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same start as u often use to have?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant see anything except 3N T but East is contemplating more|pg||
nt|sten: well not exactly|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4NT will be just a little exciting but safe|pg||
mb|r|nt|poohbear: not clear they get there|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has a very good cards so i guess he'll bid game|pg||
nt|ronpa: so 2@S went 2 off and first imps to turkey. and now comes a flat 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 580 or 980|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h looks normal|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tomi2: somebody has information about his point range here?|pg||
nt|tomi2: looks like|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I hardly know any U26 players playing non-weak jumps lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer break?|pg||
nt|othered1: with that opening, there's a chance to stay out, but still one high|pg||
nt|elbec: Di franco passed with an 11 HCPs count even with 2 aces (not following Bava's law). They're very serious about 1nt range (12-14)|pg||
nt|othered1: with rounded suit lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with bidding do you expect the k of @C with W?|pg||
nt|mamos: in fact it's a 5/7 hand I think|pg||
mb|d!|nt|poohbear: without an early @c play declarer can set up a pitch in the @d suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they get there|pg||
nt|syl: first big event for all4|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or jump|pg||
nt|mamos: so West's 2NT showed a Spade raise and North has cue-bid   - South  won't like his J high suit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N move again?  he really has a monster |pg||
nt|mamos: i think so Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: undo|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphztr: & good bridge|pg||
nt|syl: in OR nonstandard partnership..|pg||
nt|waso: here regular pds|pg||
nt|sybarra: talk about a no brainer hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer must realize there's no chance E would've led Q from AQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: sweden alert Pass from west|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop -- best EW could do|pg||
nt|mariner1: now to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club lead will solve a guess three|pg||
mb|p|nt|waso: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like some 2 way checkbac auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D seems to be a GF chec back or relay|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 2@D is artifical and gameforcing, says nothing about @D's|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well this seems bullet proof for NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT was in fact suggested by a kib|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can refil coffee 's |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, yeah|pg||
nt|poohbear: not exactly a nobrainer 6C could have been bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no brainer in 3 nt  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but you are right Barry |pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps. Should that be East's bid? |pg||
nt|tomi2: I like that range, it gives you room in other auctions because there your bids are either NF or GF, like 1@D - 1@S - 2@C - 3@S... you can set a force here without using 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: was that a joke Bas?|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, E spoiled that, now we have to settle for 660 and coffee|pg||
nt|ritong: bas retranscripts undirect infos|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean in NT|pg||
nt|pelu: only one lead can defeat: lead @H4!!! and u will have a trick on @HJ :):)|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows where all the spots are|pg||
nt|mamos: but South wont be encouraged I think|pg||
nt|mamos: @SA doesnt seem to be a very valuable card (indeed it isnt)|pg||
nt|mariner1: lead helps some|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South goes for the four-carder, which doesn't give declarer anything he can't get anyway |pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 6S on a 4-3?- some relays bbefore 3NT I expect|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: should be a normal board|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the players must've heard him/her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Other room roads splitted at 2@C. There 2@D|pg||
nt|gh1: i think is dificult too bid 7 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep |pg||
nt|ronpa: I think they play 3@H shows min with 4@H's and 2NT shows the better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not many still play 3@h as maxi and 4 card fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe it s with 5 cards:)|pg||
nt|ritong: threatened with a @c ruff, declarer might go for the trumps and claim 9|pg||
nt|othered1: This should go quickly, if NS can run @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to set up K@D for a @S pitch....|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: need a @c lead or a @s lead and a @c shift|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the defense to prevail|pg||
nt|gracelin: usually it's played over a 1NT rebid, but here they extended to any rebid.|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he will support partnesr spades showing 4 card support and 12+hcp whil a direct jump to 4@S would indicate more shape and less high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: could beat it with a low H lead |pg||
nt|tomi2: spade bids below 4@S would have been invitational to slam after 2@D|pg||
nt|gracelin: but really tough under the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: but after south bid strong and his screenmate even thinks now ot go on maybe east should try some agressive lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: Any other lead will see 4S home|pg||
nt|tomi2: "they are thinking of taking more than 10 tricks and I must hold them to 9 - then I need some miracle"|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr. Simonsen does not appear to like passing just yet|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it's always the case when opponent bid to a game|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know if N/S are a long time partnership?|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably " i want @h lead"|pg||
nt|sten: and France is up to a good start|pg||
pc|hK|nt|syl: the pld rebid problem: 1@d-1@S-? 1444|pg||
nt|rodal f: E are asking in 4NT so exlution gone there|pg||
nt|gh1: stop in 6dia in open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think the better bidding is 3diam not 3 clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 6@D|pg||
nt|frusco: eheheh |pg||
nt|ritong: he is not at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: im trying to work out if 6@s can be made|pg||
nt|capercliff: I think it can on a squeeze|pg||
nt|charles_l: as a junior i played 1n=14-16, so i opened all 11s :)|pg||
nt|elbec: nice lead by andrea|pg||
pc|hA|nt|MolvaM: kör ataðýna zorlanýr mý?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not that I play it myself, but there's a decent case for playing these 2M jumps as invitational - in that if you have an invitational hand, you don't need to bid 1@S as, if the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: auction gets competitive, you may need to guess whether to still bid 3@S or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@d with the E hand, maxi, 4 card fit, doubleton @d|pg||
nt|frusco: the mouse is alive...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphztr: do U think they know abou diam fit?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: they will|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he reverse the @c play?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe north took 4@S as some splinter bid for either hearts or dias or so? I am just suggesting|pg||
nt|gracelin: As thomas said, south will bid less spades after 2D if he has slam ambition|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'about'|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why don't E show the @D support?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: when?|pg||
nt|gh1: i think he bid 4dia now|pg||
nt|yuval10: that surely made declarer's work even easier|pg||
nt|mamos: North doesn't care|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H? |pg||
pc|h2|nt|waso: u teach bridge at schools?|pg||
nt|syl: *old|pg||
nt|syl: nope|pg||
nt|waso: only clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: do U think 3clubs is diam support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S only shot is for k of @C to be on side |pg||
nt|sybarra: but has to time getting to his hand carefully |pg||
nt|mamos: North has bid slam opposite a negative double right this time but a little adventurous perhaps :)  I'm getting old|pg||
nt|sybarra: what a result in the other room! |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: also k of  @D |pg||
nt|mamos: lol      |pg||
nt|mamos: well looking at North and South (if you were awake and alert) you might as well be in seven as six|pg||
nt|sybarra: and nice 7 since it makes |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not that I really want to be in it) |pg||
nt|h bertens: prefer 6@H, always make without a @D lead, looks good contract to me|pg||
pc|h5|nt|davidb: same bidding same contract in OR|pg||
nt|ozgull: direkt 2NT birþeye tranfer olduðu için böyle yapmak zorunda olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 kör, 2 karo ve 1 trefl lövesi?|pg||
nt|eerbil: kör ataðý gelse de defans trefl lövesine yetiþemiyor|pg||
nt|gracelin: or north treated 4S as kick-back with Heart agreed ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: zatorski chose the safe way of just raising to 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Skjetne is surprised to have the tray returned back empty|pg||
nt|andy_h: One major downside of course, is that you prevent partner from describing the nature of their hand as 2M takes up a lot of room.|pg||
nt|capercliff: N cannot protect both @h and @c, but perhaps he is pitching after dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: sonuç olarak bu borddan kaybýmýz olmayacaðýný görmek iyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: oynayan kör as alýnca yerden karo oynayýp 10'lu empasý yapmasý gerek|pg||
nt|ozgull: en azýndan karoyu bilmesi lazým|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|tomi2: because partner did not reverse and they are plying together just this year because Wiankowskis Partner is too old for this event|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|poohbear: has an awfully good hand opposite a strong JS|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: I prefer 3H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Itake that as color. Might they have an other deel|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|rodal f: deal|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no deal|pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h ruff and claim|pg||
nt|mariner1: with a @H lead he can pull 2 trumps and lead @D..... has time to now pitch @S or @c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: 7 of @cs is a discovery play for the Q. Ruso trusts partner didnt underlead the ace|pg||

nt|tomi2: this will be of course a huge swing for poland|pg||
nt|gracelin: at least 13 imps|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will blame their coach for this kind of accident.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, but they should work on their system and this is one of the fragment you should have agreed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: which is why you dont play 2@S as GF :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|capercliff: 6@c as it happens has no chance at all|pg||
nt|charles_l: strong def - E cannot reach @hA in time|pg||
nt|mariner1: he might get @c right when he sees @H break though a bit late|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|poohbear: So no need to play the King|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@h for me is mini with 4 cards|pg||

nt|mikael_w: and hi cliff|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N was made on 3 in OR -- declarer played @DA, then small to the Q, dropping the Jack|pg||

nt|sybarra: nah  its bridge! |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Who expects to go down 800 and gain 6 IMPs?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess the 2 first-round controls made it 1@S, with 6412 I would go 2@H|pg||
nt|mildredb: some really foul breaking suits |pg||
nt|andy_h: Bad breaks for whoever becomes declarer|pg||
nt|tomi2: wonder if South said "thank you partner" when his dummy came down in OR|pg||
nt|henryb: but lead said no stiff club, unless it was led -- and then he could not help it|pg||
nt|athene: and it's possible things might escalate|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ar5 the other room play 2@S now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At5|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: I think EW play 10-13 1NT when non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|kastan88: if partner has 2 diamond tricks, then this 2@S is down, if not, even @H ducking not better, just easy to count declarer's distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shitshappening:)|pg||
nt|gh1: Ax in H ig spade lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Near by 3NT but 2 are enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not necessarily a quality|pg||
nt|ronpa: I wonder if NS play transfers now|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh they do|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they do|pg||
nt|ronpa: so X = 4+ @H's while 1@H would show @S suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and also they are good players|pg||
nt|elbec: 3rd position light opening by andrea. 1@d shows 4+@d in an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mamos: it might be easy to bid 3NT here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|poohbear: 3@c is a " mixed raise " 6-8 points and 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gracelin: now south is stuck with no chance to ask for a club stopper|pg||
nt|tomi2: just bid 3NT and pray :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Brave young man will bid 3NT himself.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they dont know that yet|pg||

nt|sybarra: or over beers later |pg||

nt|gulyas: gazilli in action?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be Gazilli|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi Mikael|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure that is the right play though -- after 2 rounds of @Cs|pg||
mb|p!|nt|kaapo: They might stop at 3@H|pg||

nt|rodal f: A good try also in 3@SNS|pg||

nt|Gerben42: only can E act ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I have been told there has been a revoke in OR|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c means " i have a good hand but no convenient bid"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so whats wrong with 2 @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ozgull: 11 daha çok iyi baþladýk|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or 4 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just forcing |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have not have time ro look ar rhe systems, Do E/W play 12-14 nt ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a sort of phantom save here in 4@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a doubble score for Nor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the weak jump poses a recurring problem for North- bid 3S with a 2S bid or pass and guess what to do when South reopens with a double|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so 4 IMP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well said Victor|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: good lead .needs 10 only to be a good one better than Sp|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is braver and bid the higher contract|pg||
nt|kastan88: now @D shift?|pg||
nt|gh1: now a x and 3H:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: -1 looks very cheap|pg||
nt|tomi2: and after my p bids 3@S I would not say thank you partner as south!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@S was easy to Dbl, maybe a Dbl of 2@H would have been already correct|pg||
nt|ritong: and 3@h tends to show 5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H would not give credit to his 18 count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: allows a jump to 3@H to show 5/5 shape at least|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: And how do you bid a 14 HCP 5-4 @S-@C?|pg||
nt|capercliff: can anyone tell me what E/W are playing?|pg||
nt|capercliff: could be precision|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes, strong @c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3 imps to Russia on 4, for stopping one level lower|pg||
nt|elbec: enjoy your dinner charles.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Charles|pg||
nt|othered1: bye, Charles!|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Game is decent but would go down unless declarer could ferret out the offside singleton King|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both major suits are nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|ort21: tx |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S should deny as many as three hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: S denied 3+ cards in @H i believe|pg||
nt|ritong: personnally i open 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: I wonder whether 4@d shows a void|pg||
nt|ritong: when east is short in @ds with a good hand, all his features necessarily work good, from west s point of view|pg||
nt|athene: you are right this is a part-score hand, but lots of part-score hands are played in 4@H or above, these days :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no dbl so might work|pg||
nt|charles_l: many methods - smolen etc to bid to 4@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the origin of the Curse is unknown, although the most popular explanation is that the orders for the Battle of Culloden were written on the @D9 |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_playing_card_nicknames Nine_higher_card|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: not impossible if he finds out about Souths honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: well whatever works in your system |pg||
nt|ritong: but i do not play gazzilli|pg||
nt|ritong: i play "ritong", modestly lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 @H to me does not promise 5 |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Di Franco looking rather agitated|pg||
nt|mdgraham: every convention has a price|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mildredb: i would play X of 3@D as penalty by west|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's a bit unclear whether E should act over (3@D)-P-(P)-   (I wouldn't) but now the 3@S makes it easier!|pg||
nt|yuval10: some may think that the bidding was switched, but it wasn't...|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have to give up something to gain something|pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as you and pard play same system |pg||
nt|ritong: give up on weak two is not such a big deal|pg||
nt|capercliff: it is im informed, with transfers usually|pg||
nt|ritong: it certainly doesn t henry|pg||
nt|henryb: it could, with 3@d showing a stiff|pg||
nt|ritong: good point|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: I am confident that my former junior partner would have bid 3nt, so I hope he is sitting south in his match :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but even if south declarered 3NT, West might cash CK then shift to HQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same two down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora has his head on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As soon as the @SJ came down Nab thanked :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think I would lead a club in this auction, trying to get "natural" tricks first|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as I said, I would dbl 2@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after that, the party starts :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: as EW play mini-NT |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is comfy - take a club ruff in dummy |pg||
nt|mikael_w: But even whith strong @c E:s hand sure look like a NT-opening |pg||
nt|elbec: nice contract by manno di franco|pg||
nt|h bertens: dbl...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kastan88: yeah, it is easy to say here, if we can see all hands, not easy to find right switch for West|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Good X, 4@S should go off a few|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so |pg||
nt|yuval10: and yet another disaster for Sweden in the OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should make nicely|pg||
nt|henryb: but no; 6@d showed the void|pg||
nt|henryb: I think a @s lead beats 7|pg||
nt|othered1: and not very aggressive bidding by west.|pg||
nt|elbec: EW could make 10 tricks in @h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gracelin: bidding was wierd in closed room.  North opened 2C and NS stopped in 4D.|pg||
nt|ritong: also, you can have multi 2@d and 2@c for any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is a good treatment to play 1M-1NT-2NT as forcing to game, with 54, or 6+ in your main suit, and jump shifts showing 55 and also GF|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 4 very unlucky for Dutch because even small slam would have gained imps at most matches|pg||
pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem bu elden 11 kazanacaklarýný düþünmüyordur herhalde.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Don't agree with 4@S btw|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: I meant in ope room|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was for both majors weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: sinche they bid 3 suits and my partner also I think club is the one I can expect to get most|pg||
nt|ritong: o_0?|pg||
nt|henryb: 7@h surely|pg||
nt|henryb: this was well bid|pg||
nt|ritong: not dow<n yet|pg||
nt|henryb: operator; 7@d is a very unlikely bid|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|poohbear: South should try to conceal honors by winning the Ace of ! and returning the Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N bid 1H with 3 cards. Maybe is transfer for spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I lie:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|poohbear: @cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: So there isn't much in the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: just ruff it!|pg||
nt|charles_l: potential loser in each suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: Stafie's pard opened the bidding and he has good hand with K of @S,   and will look for signal for entry |pg||
nt|tomi2: hope W will not play @SA|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes looks like it would qualify for a 14-16|pg||
nt|ritong: but if declarer tries to join his hand via @c J...|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if @H back might not have been more effective.  Now just play @D|pg||
nt|othered1: Take 8 tricks. losing only 3@S (regardless split) and two rounded|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra has left to procure drinks (barefooted)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm not sure what was the 1@h overcall by N in the OR, a psych possible, over 1@c strong when P is passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: white lie. now relatively easy: @d ruff, @s, @d ruff @hQ, @sA, draw trumps and claim|pg||
nt|athene: both north and south are maximum for passing over 4@H, i think|pg||
nt|h bertens: this one also not very lucky, could go down 4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: sorry She |pg||
nt|rodal f: Home if J@C are to be found|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42: Tomi he played before :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it backfired big time|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kastan88: now @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: last week I pinned two singleton honors with my partners, I am expert in this :)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: East had to win 1st diamond|pg||

nt|sten: the contract is safe now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|Gerben42: 300 extra now :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yuval10: i think it was a psych,hence S's 2@h|pg||
nt|rayhaa: had to duck @d Q to have a chance for 11|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has seen 12 points in south. If he sees the QJ of @h or if he sees no overuff in @ds then he prob gets it right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: On the previous 2 boards Russia scored 7 then 12|pg||
nt|gh1: and -1|pg||
nt|gulyas: gazilli fills another gap, where you are 16-18(19), and try to figure out what and how high to play (2@D usually shows 8+, and sets a GF)|pg||
nt|henryb: to explain the auction: 4N was "Roman key card blackwood", 5@c showed one or four of the 5 keys, 5@d asked about the @hQ, 6@d said "I've got that and a surprise in @d|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently W couldn't raise 1@H as that would show a strong hand, and he was reluctant to go the three level later |pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: yes terrible holding in everysuit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: S should play another @H now|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|mildredb: wow, no one has a void :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and things starts very well for the 5th seeded team|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am realy glad when I see this realy young players stop and think hard whith only 6 cards left and then do the right thing|pg||
nt|pelu: S could X - but she dont wont pd to bid |pg||
nt|charles_l: but +620?|pg||
nt|charles_l: np|pg||
nt|mamos: a sixth trick salvaged but 5 imps away|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a play and made 6 in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: I think 3@S was an overbid too, for that matter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW looks right here|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mariner1: hi all, in from the Open|pg||
nt|waso: 5c  -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam time|pg||
nt|henryb: and only if South has them|pg||
nt|ritong: however, the "bad spiral" we talked about previously seems to get in place|pg||
nt|mariner1: must have been a @c lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: in fact S led Q@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidb: great  grand ! but not easy to reach even 6 .perfect fit. void vs o points|pg||
nt|tomi2: watching the other results on hand 5 you see some could stop in 2@S or 3@D and did not get doubled, only 3@S and upwards got punished|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think nobody was going to double 3@D here too|pg||
nt|hedyg: bergen raise|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@C is 6-9 and 4@S's, and he has to be carefull|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they dont explain|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam is down on A@d and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only alert|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are right, only explain if asked|pg||
nt|ronpa: Bar might try 3@H now and padon will accept with 4@D, this might lead to slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi  wk in one major |pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h would be the best contract normally|pg||
nt|athene: yes, north can show diamonds but east will just bid quite a lot of spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S leads might cause a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H and 3N makes EW with a few correct guesses|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H and Q@S right, along with the Aces|pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: why -1|pg||
nt|waso: 6c|pg||
nt|waso: 6c -1   |pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry Bar is thinking not Cicek|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bar= Tarnovski|pg||
nt|arigun: @d lead will not be too difficult|pg||
nt|athene: and west will raise that to quite a lot more spades|pg||
nt|pelu: no 2@D (or 2@H) here from East = both majors - it a convention from Norway (Ekren)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: 6@D on board 3 has was bid 5 times out of 20|pg||
nt|poohbear: u mean 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think thats ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing same contract previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S thinking of a splinter?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 4@D - reckon that should show the ace|pg||
nt|ronpa: 4@D just says I accept invitation and have a good hand|pg||
nt|ronpa: he will bid 3@S with min and 4@S is medium hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a funky multi |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good defence is to play double as 13-15 approx or any 20+|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hand is really a bunch of junk |pg||
nt|mikael_w: 5@c seems to be a decent contract|pg||
nt|elbec: let's see what happens now? would the bidding finish?|pg||
nt|athene: normally a 5-5 shape is very powerful if you have a known fit|pg||
nt|athene: but here, east goes a little more cautiously|pg||
nt|athene: having the 1@H bid over him is very bad|pg||
nt|athene: it means, not only are the hearts useless as a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: but it will be hard to ruff them in dummy without getting over-ruffs|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess @S leads do not work either as N does not have enough entries to lead more|pg||
nt|mariner1: than 2 times|pg||
nt|mamos: will a club ruff scupper 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: not easy for defenders I think it will make|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results (or play when available) in other room CLICK  "MOVIE" on TOOLBAR|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: will see|pg||
nt|waso: i dont believe east will pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4H?|pg||
nt|waso: east will play the hand  5c  or 6c  |pg||
nt|syl: what about 5@C in 1. seat|pg||
nt|kaapo: *was bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: J@C was found? Adrian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: kind of Last Train, then|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ozturk woke up|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no diamond lead now...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit late for that, really|pg||
nt|ronpa: this hand is super maximum, also Q@H looks good after 3@H bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure @d lead still|pg||
nt|xenya: an awkward hand for natural methods|pg||
nt|charles_l: EW must find game here|pg||
nt|rayhaa: makes on @d finesse|pg||
nt|charles_l: @cA in S too|pg||
nt|mariner1: and then OPEN or CLOSED|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I believe Ruso should bid to define her hand once partner responds. I would bid 2@c'|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she bid 3diam|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not good|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5clubs in 1st seat|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe without the ace of diam|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 pairs collected 1100 defending against 2@HX|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally West @D was 32, so was difficult to East assume, that partner 2 is from doubleton, probably Jxx|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D shows 5+ cards (if bal 12-14) or 4+ unbal in their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then North can get into the act and SOuht won't have this guess as to whether to re-open or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: any gazilli experts in the audience? I was asked what you do with 5@S-4@C wk (my guess was 2@D showing either minor)|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contract have bad breaks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but whith this layout in @c it will be tough offcurse|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||
nt|mildredb: probably 7 back now|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep but ruff?|pg||
nt|ronpa: other table bid the slam and @D was led so chance for another big pickup for Israel|pg||
nt|ritong: poor sikora must be muttering some black polish just now|pg||
nt|henryb: At the other table the Norwegian pair managed to go 3 down in 6@h|pg||
nt|elbec: unusual or natural 2nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder what 2N is -- just natural?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: me too:)|pg||
nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney tahmin ediyorum þu anda çok moralliler|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D for me is an underbid but it works out well here|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N of course is rigid|pg||
nt|henryb: sorry, the dutch pair.|pg||
nt|ritong: we had translated:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe its a mistake or a lie from operator:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no alert for 2nt|pg||
nt|othered1: If east had extras, 3@H would be attractive here, but the double really didn't help EW|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is obviously a splinter raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: but she lead a club|pg||
nt|syl: @d trap may avoided.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hanna gabor thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think she dont like 3sp bid|pg||
nt|syl: 3@H rebid would have been the simplest|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep she have right hand on the head|pg||
nt|yuval10: making 10 tricks in @s is a lot...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h looks like going down|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has to play @d after he wins the first @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: too many conventional bidding for Sweden ... I think...|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, "wk"?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, 12-14, say|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 11-14, I s'pose|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is probably not the first time W has played in his singleton trump suit in hand |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohh my, the result from OR will not be easy to match here|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck a @s and W is dead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N with W seems like it eats up a lot of room here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1 down looks the only result expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well W must not have realized the 2@S was a game try here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bazý çiftler kontrdan sonraki koz tutuþlarýný göstermek için transferli deklareler oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|eerbil: Arda'nýn kontrdan sonra eðer transfer oynuyorlarsa iyi kör yükseltmesi anlamýnda 2@d demesi daha iyi olurdu|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: aie|pg||
nt|syl: 5@C NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: with those weak spots, I would not be interested to penalize opponents in 2D, so would Cue 3D instead.|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, all tabes should find a slam here|pg||
nt|kaapo: North would now like to ask for aces outside of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully landing in a safe 4 @H now |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind, 4@CX lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry was my mistake:(|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 NT DBL|pg||
nt|athene: @HA or @CQ lead both set up marked finesses|pg||
nt|athene: either a normal club finesse or a ruffing heart finesse|pg||
pc|sT|nt|raghavan: Hello, I am Ragavan from chennai of India |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have bid 3N over the 2@S,,, showing my minor cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhtemelen arda ciçek bu konv oynamýyor|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: my partner will never play me for support and 3 aces, maybe he will even pass 2@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the best dession from N. Will cost some IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|capercliff: E will double this|pg||
nt|capercliff: and S might just pull to 5@c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, W is dead, nut not easy to find 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: so better not cash the @d K now, although i find it very difficult|pg||
nt|henryb: took a short break to watch the sprint finish of today's Tour stage|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure about their signals|pg||
nt|henryb: won again by Mark Cavendish|pg||
nt|elbec: meanwhile 11 more mps to italy thanks to 4@h made|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - quite descriptive though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphztr: srry 4 undo|pg||
nt|waso: now  4h   5c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let see.....|pg||
nt|ronpa: south did his part of the job now all up to north|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: I wonder if W thought they were showing a constructive raise of 2@H and E missed|pg||
nt|mariner1: it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (refresh often)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told 2@C is EITHER 16+, or natural|pg||
nt|ritong: if you adopt 2M openings as showing M+@c, you have to give up on natural weak 2 or two suited 2M openings, that is clear|pg||
nt|athene: an amusing symmetrical position in the red suits|pg||
nt|athene: stiff Q, J109 opposite and a ruffing finesse potential|pg||
nt|athene: and findable too on the bidding|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the ruffing finesse in @H should be all he needs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, absolutely no problem coming to eleven tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4sp?!|pg||
nt|ronpa: bar will play the 8|pg||
nt|othered1: This auction sounds like one you might double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: go to http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm  -  Tournament Site|pg||

nt|mariner1: there is the Scourge again :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|MolvaM: veya arda elini beðenmedi.  demek arda'ya daha iyi eller geliyormuþ|pg||
nt|eerbil: kuzey'in deklaresini anlamak gerçekten güç, 2.kontr ile zaten gücünü belirtmiþti|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet özgür bakanýn dediði gibi belki de 2@h = iyisi   dir|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|capercliff: note the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|ritong: no fun:)|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's bidding was not very convincing, to say the least|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I think west hand didn't merit action over 3@S.  Before that just tough.|pg||
nt|elbec: lead from the longest suit and 6 tricks arriving for the defence|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: passsssssssssssssssssss   south |pg||
nt|sybarra: your hand didnt get any better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, South has a 13-count....but if you pass you will face this "re-open or not" guess every time|pg||
nt|ritong: 2M openings = M+@cs, medium|pg||
nt|capercliff: most would hammer away with 2,3, or even 4@s opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|othered1: But lucky for North, who had no guarantee @S weren't running with one loser, to find @C J in south|pg||
nt|elbec: but di franco need to duck with its king of heart|pg||
nt|mamos: wow Russia on fire in OR 4@S =|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: declarer can draw three rounds of trumps and take the ruffing finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and then south gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|athene: that's one possibility|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: How can he go on without a @S control?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: Tx|pg||
nt|waso: no idea whats 4sp   but im sure   it was the only bid to make east bid 6c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: anyway the Director Mr. Dumitrasciuc is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: called by Chaugny|pg||
nt|syl: maybe sort of answer|pg||
nt|waso: i've been told that 4c is  RKCB|pg||
nt|waso: so 4sp shows 2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep 4 spade was answer for aces:)|pg||
nt|waso: another 12 imps 4 France|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the director is still here|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might escape now|pg||
nt|ronpa: good try but not enough|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphztr: good lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4 hungary:)|pg||
nt|syl: pseudo endplay against N?|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed, and if south CJ were CK, we would miss a cold 6H|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no one (like pard) cued the @S |pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: right click my name JOIN|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only one club|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S plays a @s though....|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s / @d defeat the contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: S must know that E has 2@c's|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4NT would not be a great idea, because if partner responds 1 key card, you cannot tell if it's the @SA or the @CK|pg||
nt|ritong: did ushovdt finish well?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: youthful exuberance? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Need to cover |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she's trying to catch something?|pg||
nt|gh1: was a strange x with AQJ in H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|prasenjit1: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: needs ace and spade to beat it |pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphztr: Heya Prasenjit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this works |pg||
nt|rayhaa: only challenge wld been a @s lead and @h 4-1|pg||
nt|mariner1: saving 6 @H for entry back to dummy after eliminating @D I think|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|davidb: N do not have an easy bid . 5 can be overboard.|pg||
nt|ozgull: ingilizler de bir önceki maç irlanda yý yendiði için biraz rahatlýk var gibi:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: her 2 masada da ingilizlerin oynayýp batmasý iyi midir sayýn yorumcular?  :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: misspoke - probably 7 more for Germany|pg||
nt|elbec: nice duck|pg||
pc|s3|nt|raghavan: Declarer has to give a Spade and a Diamond |pg||
nt|kastan88: 1st push in this match|pg||
nt|othered1: I think declarer's now out for -1|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: Welcome  Prasenjit|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did well, and now there's no entry for dummy's @s's|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can hold his losses to 2 @H and a @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when dummy has a singleton the defence usually signal with a suit preference - although its difficult when partner may nit have much length in the suit led|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: OR played 2@d, easier there|pg||
nt|capercliff: im surprised S decided to play 4@h actually|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it|pg||
nt|elbec: only if di franco cashes now ace of spades|pg||
nt|elbec: other wise ace of heart, diamond to the jack and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess if he ducks he can have later exit problems|pg||
nt|ort21: someone have live result?|pg||
nt|athene: now the clubs are blocked for the squeeze on south|pg||
nt|rayhaa: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1   Running scores|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs the ruffing finesse in diamonds for the 11th|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eerbil: 5 imp kadar iyi :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|gulyas: so you rebid 2@C with a wk 54, then bid 2@S over 2@D to show the wk hand type|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c ambiguous is gazzilli, and is the reason i moderately appreciate it, since it is not that easy to handle|pg||
nt|begse: can make by endplaying|pg||
nt|begse: he seems to be on the right way|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ruff 2 spades and diam|pg||
nt|henryb: tailed off; Tyler Farrat, the young American, finished second|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=17&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|ritong: so cav in green again, rite?|pg||
nt|henryb: yep, with I think about a 10 or 15 point margin|pg||
nt|charles_l: but 3x@d allows @s pitch before trum;ps drawn (i think)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome Mike Gold|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: will be 1 down|pg||
nt|charles_l: hi rag|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i would expect a bit more for 3@D, but that's just me...|pg||
nt|capercliff: south would have liked to play small from dummy there, but there are entry problems|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think S here shod have understand why W let E to be on the lead, big chanse he has void @d. E Dbl @d bid in the bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But if he plays @c now that trick might come back|pg||
pc|h6|nt|spaima: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=18&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|begse: cant now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mistake|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|capercliff: each undertrick doesnt cost that much as it happens, but declarer doesnt know that|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence|pg||
nt|elbec: yes|pg||
nt|elbec: this is what we call a razor stroke :) everything perfect by north|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|sybarra: I think E expected the K of @S in dummy |pg||
nt|xenya: now W has to cash the high spades, then endplay N with a club for 1 off|pg||
nt|othered1: a lot easier had south found @CJ at trick 1, fairly clear after double, I'd think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphztr: nice play Ekaterina|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a 9er and 3 IMP for Russia|pg||
nt|othered1: but west may play north shorter in @S for the double|pg||

nt|sybarra: interesting push |pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, now that we learned gazilli, on to the next board:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not yet in my repotoire|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I was joking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hard to play|pg||
nt|capercliff: 64 imps tossed around in 6 boards, steady stuff|pg||
nt|ritong: huge|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, back to biz|pg||
nt|elbec: eight hundred for Italy...|pg||
nt|athene: the @DK from north on the first round of the suit really pinpointed the @DA though|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
nt|athene: so not too tricky|pg||
nt|athene: north might have been better-off to play the @DA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS this time|pg||
nt|charles_l: picked up an imp|pg||
nt|rayhaa: next round is France - Norway, and just now Norway i 2nd is 14VP behind France|pg||
nt|h bertens: not so easy to bid slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL worked well in S as he knew W had no sources of outside tricks......|pg||
nt|sten: they are playing very fast in CR|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT - p - p - majors fromE?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Russia had best begin to turn this critical match around soon.|pg||
nt|athene: i see it's a 4major theme match so far :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: some of these doubles seem more like pairs than teams |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: interesting cards breaks here|pg||
nt|kastan88: Running scores for Open class: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=8&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice club suits being dealt today |pg||
nt|andy_h: Conflicting factors now with N's hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this hand is tricky in 2/1, you have to decide if this is GF or inv. before seeing partners 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Positives: Good 5card suit, QT9 (good) support and a singleton.  Negatives: Singleton King and only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would bid some kind of systematic bid that does not allow my partner to pass before game is reached and try to show my hearts too|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you mean 2@H :)|pg||
nt|henryb: will tell you shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: so I start with 2@H and bid 4@S later|pg||
nt|yuval10: costs 2 imps.... +7 instead +9|pg||
nt|elbec: and third live place for Italy|pg||
nt|elbec: manno will show a balanced game forcing hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: do you dbl or 2@c with |pg||
nt|charles_l: N?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|charles_l: looks like some excitement|pg||
nt|raghavan: a slam hand - let us enjoy how they reach slam and make|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Nice slam with A @H onside|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h is normal here but the breaks are really cruel|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C could be a 18-19 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S best NS spot|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont think this has been a -30 performance so far but the Russian NS in the oR having a fabulous set  will it last?|pg||
nt|mariner1: does seem 3@D has a play though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gracelin: bery rare to see a passed out board in youth eent.  They get matured|pg||
nt|gracelin: very|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps NS bid another 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although it might not be that great on a @C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: quiet auction|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has play, to say the least|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that seems increasingly popular these days|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S must be playing a variable NT - South opened on a poor 11 not vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: well, we know the basics|pg||
nt|mariner1: how does E take that DBL?|pg||
nt|rayhaa: i bid 2@c and hope to get a chance to show @s|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mariner1: 1@C is Polish @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: only making game for n/s 4s tho 5dims can be let thru|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D probably showed H, and 2H confirmed 4-card support|pg||
nt|gracelin: With half his honors in opponents' suit, south better contend with 3H or a try|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S vuln from West, how many points in @S will put North into partner's hand?|pg||
nt|tomi2: now south solved noth's problem :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: will someone crack this one?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W can make 5@d here double dummy|pg||
nt|elbec: "Whist" bidding for manno|pg||
nt|charles_l: me too. i definitely prefer pd to lead @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: W maybe should bid 3@c over XX?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Unless you lead a @H 6@D is only 1100 v. 1370:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is a forcing Pass by E|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu arada girls romanya ya karþý 30 - 5 önde|pg||
nt|rodal f: If N was active now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2NT could be GF also, seems like 4@S kills a lot of space|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, south has a decent hand if partner wants to investigate slam|pg||
mb|5S|nt|poohbear: I think 2C may be either natural or a balanced GF|pg||
nt|kastan88: test time now: what is meaning of pass over 2@S doubled|pg||
nt|rayhaa: dont u want opps to pass out 3@h with south hand?|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes i would love them to|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well south having shown his spades first presumably this will be played in spades now|pg||
nt|eerbil: sanýrsam bu elden kaybedeceðiz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elde karo pozisyonu nedeni ile þlem sorunsuz|pg||
nt|begse: sanslý bi slem |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT too much if they open this light|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3NT and 3@D both can be defeated|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@D by S here silences W|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H was brave and the winning action although !nt is down on an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|sten: something strange happened in the declarer play in OR on board 5 ... he went down in 2 spades|pg||
mb|6H|nt|begse: gitmemek hatta 5 e cýkmamak lazým|pg||
nt|syl: wrong sided so|pg||
nt|syl: may even fail|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1NT from Aurelie!!!:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Board 6 is at the moment recorded as round pass in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: a director asked to look at my movie and went to check|pg||
nt|kaapo: That shuold be fixed soon, when they actually play the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a diamond lead you can make it on cross-ruff, but it requires that you cash clubs first. So you need clubs to break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you play a second diamond like declarer did in the other room, South will pitch a club and you go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will play trumps after Q@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and then after 2nd @d S can ruff and play trumps again|pg||
nt|yuval10: will it matters?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@Hx was t/o, and the rest is automatic:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant argue with the bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, also missed the 4@S, tough hand to land right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 5@S can make too though|pg||
nt|lestergold: after 4d it wa surely correct fopr north to give preference to spades he had al reay bid the pips off a 6 card heart suit with poor intermediates|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure that is possible either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity for a swing here unless north 'corrects' to spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe 2 clubs is checkback|pg||
nt|kastan88: and that's it, if partner not having any points in spades, where are his 12 points for opening?, still could ask for aces, IMO|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Lauks and the two aces from his hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and he said: one down will be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should become a flat board by normal defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: and 4@h is very close as well with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually the same 11 tricks are available in both suits|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the problem is that in 4@h you have NO entry to dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: in Open Room S bid @S twice and they still did not get to 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: a spade lead, club shift and duck, will beat even 3H|pg||
nt|kastan88: here is clear, that NS  have not the same pinion about pass over 2@S doubled from South hand. But such situations need to agree exactly. showing this 1 stopper or half stopper or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: nothin in spades, or just minimum hand whatever, but agreement needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @c artificial game force huub? |pg||
nt|h bertens: yes|pg||
nt|h bertens: 2d any min not 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: its pretty much 16+ with @c, what he has|pg||
nt|gracelin: This maximum defense is in fact a reasonable one|pg||
nt|kaapo: On this lead, EW could keep South out of his hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr for mistyping. opinion , not pinion :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps 4-1, he cannot get his @Ds good and enjoy them too|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, Hungarian schoolkids are running riot against France (41-0 so far), and leading the pack! Making me very proud:)|pg||
nt|ritong: are you coaching them, daniel?|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, just rooting for them:)|pg||
nt|ritong: oki:)|pg||
nt|charles_l: E should bid 1@h not XX, just in case it comes back at the 3/4@s level|pg||
nt|mamos: i'd expect this salm to be widely bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3 rds of clubs - then d then 4th club - North ruffs high and declrer pitches spade -|pg||
pc|sT|nt|charles_l: (assuming polish @c)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Not much excitement - only they have not reached a makeable C slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a none @c lead allows a make|pg||
nt|mariner1: non|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Jones ha to find the killing club lead |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s will not fare well\|pg||
nt|kaapo: But @Hs are splitting, too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C looks like conventional stayman|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H shows @S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphztr: interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: play the @dK from hand is a little to much double dummy I think|pg||
nt|athene: Smolen over 2NT is something you lose if you play puppet|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass??|pg||
nt|athene: but it is quite valuable|pg||
nt|pelu: ????|pg||
nt|mariner1: surely S did not pass|pg||
nt|mamos: slam even|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: and he has|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with that lead not much declarer can do to avoid going 2 off|pg||
nt|poohbear: Best to win in Dummy and play a @c to try to negotiate a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: alternatively if you trust the lead you can draw trumps and if 3-2 play for 4 @d tricks and then lead a @c off dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Brian Senior is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: making pictures|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a jr event!|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a senior moment :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might gain some IMPs again for Russia. @H lead? Seemed normal for me!|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room in 3@H which is also a tough contract|pg||
nt|charles_l: XX to me shows defending interest|pg||
nt|sybarra: finding the @D cards is the difficulty |pg||
nt|h bertens: more chance on a natural auction|pg||
pg||

nt|ahollan1: i don't like the cue-bid option but the others both make sense -- just need to agree with partner|pg||
nt|3for3: QJx of trump is a great filler for a known 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that @C suit either worth a lot or almost nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Must be useful opposite a balanced hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D doesn't guarantee any points [unlike after Precision 2@C]|pg||

nt|odysseus69: declarer can make 9 tricks nowi see that South went down in 2S on previous board -surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mariner1: well 5@H did not fare well in Open Room, seems that had a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: well somehow managed to go 2 off in 5h in open|pg||

nt|kastan88: but same thing happened in Open Room, after both opps showed spades, North couldn't believe partner is without 2 aces...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did u know that: Albania are 120 people at there federation, while Turkey are 1.050.000 members?|pg||
nt|gh1: A Roland slm here make with a dia lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Romania: 500-1000 members|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @S+m apparently|pg||
nt|tomi2: let's see if they find their @H fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Muiderberg used against a Dutch pair, the irony :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: a very agressive opening with 7-4 with a major but might work well here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I like this boys|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H here is a @S transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: S wondering where all the bidding is coming from|pg||
nt|athene: there are so many transfers used these days i think any regular partnership needs some generic agreements|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mariner1: a trump lead here is best vs @H|pg||
nt|eerbil: açanýn karo kontrolü olmadýðýný ve dengeli eli olduðunu bilirken iyi bir þlem deðil bence|pg||
nt|gh1: or spade J|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR i guess natural 1NT opening and all pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: a different story here though|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Less than an IMP per board is little by U26 standards :)|pg||
nt|athene: the basic thing you have to discuss is:-|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6@s is 50%|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: clubs lie badly too many losers in the black s in east's hand to be dealt with bearing in mind a 3/1 rump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am glad to see people can still double for penalty, eapecially by the youth.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt =weak with both minors |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not a very useful convention in my opinion|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some 700 I belive Adrian|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not exactly muiderberg|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H is both majors weak for our pair too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT is probably a maximum with @D as sidesuit|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2@C shows @H and another suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South wants to double, you can feel it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *an IMP|pg||
nt|athene: if you double a transfer is it showing the suit bid, or is it t/o of the promised suit?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mikael Westerlund|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|davidb: E  does not like XXX in Spades ..|pg||
nt|lestergold: and over ruff threats in dims|pg||
nt|poohbear: another competitive battle at the game level here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, is South's double for penalty?|pg||
nt|elbec: aggressive bidding by di franco|pg||
nt|mariner1: everyone in auction should be a warning to everyone :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 7+ hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the modern style is 3H on East but maybe I am out of touch|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: normal to be in 4@h down here|pg||
nt|charles_l: esp at imps|pg||
nt|raghavan: If they do not cash D - 4H makes = 1 Spade loser+1H+1D( 1 Diamond goes in Clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they should be warned about the breaks now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: goodness, 5@c |pg||
nt|ronpa: east wants to X 5@C|pg||
nt|capercliff: do well to stay low here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. is south's double here hearts, or t/o of spades?|pg||
nt|athene: of course, these two meanings overlap to an extent|pg||
nt|athene: but it's important to discuss them i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: now we see if S believes everyone|pg||
nt|pelu: the standard are: X of a conventional bid = the suit|pg||
nt|rayhaa: hi Mikael|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|charles_l: hello|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|MolvaM: bu kontr negatif sanýrým ama tutulsa fena olmaz|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice play by west in the open room for 3nt=|pg||
nt|kastan88: still correct was to use somewhere blackwood type bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr:   NT = pass or correct|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: only pass possible response... 3NT wont have problems|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to E, 3NT showed a 4-card, however, I could not deduct which|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohoh!|pg||
nt|othered1: north bids 3@H and south passes?|pg||
nt|elbec: after inital pass...|pg||
nt|othered1: That feels like a deep view, even with possible @S duplication|pg||
nt|elbec: he is probabli thinking that they could have mirror like hands|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's right on this hand|pg||
nt|xenya: well he can't quite raise to 4@H after N's initial pass?|pg||
nt|rayhaa: will bid it too|pg||
nt|mamos: yes artificial responses dont seem to have worked well here  - old fogey rule ok |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes can they stop now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: getting to 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D was natural, most of the time with 5 cards|pg||
nt|kaapo: I like to play that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: has its moments  |pg||
nt|tomi2: If there are any kids (below 18 years) watching this vugraph, I must warn you not to watch open room's auction and play in the next board|pg||
nt|Gerben42: helpful lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: can make 5@H 5@S 3@D now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had 1 chance to beat it, which was pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice table!!!|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h is par|pg||
mb|4D|nt|davidb: the question if 3H shows shape as well or can be x H |pg||
nt|ronpa: he still didnt make it, he has to play very carefully|pg||
nt|hedyg: why double? for 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|ritong: starting with @c A, u never know|pg||
nt|henryb: Hushovd finished 5th|pg||
nt|athene: one school of thought says that you have a convenient cue-bid available as a t/o double, so X should just show the suit bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a good game for Norway- both players werevery conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: Yes, maybe difficult for w to play a @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E not happy with partner's bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open  east bid 5h in front of partner against 5dims partner may have found a different action|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Leaders|pg||
nt|poohbear: once again we see Ruso fail to bid at a cheap level|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear this Dbl will excite partner enuff|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mostly to expose psychs like this 1@S by Arvidsson|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: expose he did. find the right level he didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it with a european pard |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This is going to be bloody|pg||
nt|arigun: possible to make 5@c |pg||
nt|ritong: nice spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Houston we have landed |pg||
nt|xenya: but he can!|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Not much of a hesitation there|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|raghavan: The final bid optimum and correct|pg||

nt|lestergold: ten tricks easy on that route|pg||
nt|MolvaM: deklaran yeri görünce pik vale sorunum var diye düþünecek ama biz biliyoruz ki sorunu yok :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, need to duck the spade opening lead and made some good guessing later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont understand one club opeing for Latvia|pg||
nt|athene: right; but not everyone plays this way |pg||
nt|mariner1: can he make this?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E needs to lead a @H|pg||
nt|athene: for example lauria-versace play (1NT) pass (2@H) X = t/o of spades, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H looks like a law violation to me|pg||
nt|athene: bidding 3 over 3 with only 8-card fits around|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this should give England  about 11 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: no should have the timing|pg||
nt|mariner1: now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north ducking wont help him|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know why E doesnt bid it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmmmm bu da ilginç|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the quality for Romania have raised well the last years, as Bulgaria. Romania nr. 5 in Beijing open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes and I think we do a great job here at Brasov:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a Flaw violation :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and? - the Law is 50-60% so..|pg||
nt|athene: and south has a pretty defensive hand quite apart from only having five hearts|pg||
nt|athene: stiff diamond, slow black cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Suggestion of Total Tricks? :)|pg||
nt|athene: The Guideline of Total Tricks :)|pg||
nt|pelu: a free 2@H by pd - S dont know that N only have 3 small @Hs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it wld have sold as well with that title|pg||
nt|athene: well, this comes back to the point i was suggesting earlier|pg||
nt|athene: if south's double showed real hearts (i.e. 5+) then north's 2@H is quite likely to be only three|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 6 clubs with double finn on hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get ugly |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Indeed - no guarantee of a diamond trick|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly needs @s 2/2 or @h Kx, a rather good proposition|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to lukasz brede|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: in comp with concentrated honors her hand is not a sub minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 3H:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe checking to see if W has 6 @ss|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Dummy walked away (wisely)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Henri|pg||
nt|Gerben42: note that on a @C lead, @CAK, south will be squeezed in the red suits to make 11|pg||
nt|ronpa: Other table playing 5@C undbled|pg||
nt|ronpa: he doesnt know that West had only 7 diamonds for his opening, it will take a big effort to make this hand|pg||
nt|lokaty: hello everyone|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: but still a victory for Russia since 4@s is touch and go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 15 sene kadar önce bu tür ataklar yapmayý seven bir parterim vardý.... hala var  :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar agresif bir atak için bir sebep göremiyorum bu elde|pg||
nt|kastan88: EW using I aasume polish Club based system, tho 1@C is 11...14 bal or all hands 18+|pg||
nt|kastan88: 'assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to the EW cc, 2@S is indeed a 5+M4+m|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: açýktan 3 imp verip ataðý geri almak mümkün olabilmeli bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was forcing with clubs, since he is GF he chose to show clubs instead of hearts to establish the force|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they were in a forcing situation and double by Sikora is a suggestion to play there|pg||
nt|gracelin: I like that|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like -2 here|pg||
nt|capercliff: both tables opened 1N, not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|capercliff: i'm assuming they are playing 12-?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this will work out fine and give 5 IMP back to the swedes, brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: death by aces now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: hiya buddy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi luke :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Lukasz :)|pg||
nt|ritong: c mon, piotr, 4/0 breaks occur:)|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed. thats about the fifth time I have seen that combination misplayed|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: signals?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, sikora thought about it in his grand|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is a bit on the greedy side i think|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but it doesn't figure to be redoubled with those trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphztr: switch to clubs...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 14-16|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H now?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: bad return the club|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence are throwing tricks at declarer likethey were growing on terees|pg||
nt|lestergold: trees|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are gona play for the Iasi tean in ure 1. div the comming season. So see u there Adrian|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good 4 you|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Lukasz|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ronpa: now to make he has to play low club and finnesse to ruff last diamond with the @C ace|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|elbec: queen of diamonds was almost impossible|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: yes, the @DQ would have been nice -- for the defence|pg||
nt|elbec: really strange switch|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|vugraphztr: I'd like to bet that W has no clue his partner started with @HAK9xxx|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6/8 @d will enable the contract to make|pg||
nt|ronpa: has to find a way to reduce his trumps in hand for coup|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he must take hi's spades now|pg||
nt|hedyg: still has a @D loser|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think he has to play his @H before to ruff some in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: take spades ruff diam with the ace and 7 of club|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is -1|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes thats the winning line|pg||
nt|ronpa: no thas made|pg||
nt|hedyg: will lose 1@H and 1@c that way|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to ruff both the spade and the Diam in dummy to make|pg||
nt|ronpa: why lose club? he will endplay him with @H for the last 2 tricks in club|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|poohbear: nope|pg||
nt|poohbear: trumps not short enuff|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh true he still has @H to exit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will have a heart exit|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Barry, welcome|pg||
nt|ronpa: true|pg||
nt|poohbear: hi|pg||
nt|ronpa: should play J@H now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer essentially needs to crossruff|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room played very well and went 1 down, didnt guess clubs were 4-0 (wasnt dbled)|pg||
nt|ronpa: so lets see if this will turn to be 2 imps to Israel or 11 to turkey|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double here was a bit greedy|pg||
nt|ronpa: we will discuss that after the hand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is considering all options|pg||
nt|hedyg: that takes a while|pg||
nt|capercliff: oh i've been corrected, EAST opened 1N in the open room|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8 cards in @c, only 7 in @s, so playing on @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Grosset is thinking........|pg||
nt|xenya: now it makes easily|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: hi Adrian|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they he is in dumming |pg||
nt|athene: it's often hard in defence|pg||
nt|athene: to work out whether to give partner ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: if he has good trumps, it might be the very last thing he wants|pg||
nt|mariner1: sort of a systemic fix, if you open light (and I do) you need to have controls in place|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|pelu: so down 1|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mariner1: to ask opening quality|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphztr: hi HedyG|pg||
nt|capercliff: adventerous|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|capercliff: hi Joe|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well cardplay here is a little sloppy |pg||
nt|yuval10: S shouldn't have cashed A@s|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer is still ok . can set up pirtches|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking...|pg||
nt|gracelin: if West knows to underlead diamond for a club ruff it wuld be -3, let's see if he can find it|pg||
nt|ritong: so the rule of thumb " with 6/4 go ahead" proves right one more time|pg||
nt|sybarra: saying is  6/4 bid one more?|pg||
nt|ritong: sorta:)|pg||
nt|lokaty: but the winner of this board was Sikora with brave decision|pg||
nt|elbec: this looks very strange!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a good board for the Czech.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|MolvaM: deklaran kör vermemeyi becerebilirmiyim diye düþündü bir an ama vazgeçip makul oynadý|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: manno not very happy about partner's small spades order of play|pg||
mc|11|nt|mariner1: critical play here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ?|pg||
nt|ronpa: so 2 more imps to Israel|pg||
nt|poohbear: Need to exit @h win the spade return in dummy . ruff a heart  . play spades ruffing the 4th in dummy . Threaten to ruff @h with 8 of @c  and then ruff the last @d in dummy setting ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: up trump coup|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he forget to catch the Q of spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: was too late|pg||

nt|mariner1: well played|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it was badly defended im not sure it was well played tho Rob|pg||
nt|gracelin: on the trump return, if declarer finessed, then West needs to underlead D for -3|pg||
nt|kaapo: On 7, the Swedish pair is at 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I must say, X was a coward's bid! lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ernst just offered everyone a cracker "don't tell them about this :)"|pg||
nt|yuval10: she could've just finesse @h in the end position|pg||
nt|hedyg: too much excitement for 2 imps, not worth the double|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|capercliff: as it happens the 1N bid forced N/S into a hopeless game|pg||
nt|capercliff: routine 4@s?|pg||
nt|capercliff: not routine to bid it of course|pg||
nt|santyclz: Very limited values, By no means automatic to reach.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Mikael|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have just found out N is Cecilia R. I thought it was Cillas yougrt brother|pg||
nt|mikael_w: younger|pg||
nt|henryb: they are too young to believe in bad breaks|pg||
nt|xenya: well we are looking at all four hands -- no doubt S had some reason for the @C switch|pg||
nt|mamos: declare making sure of nine tricks bagged eleven|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days things just go your way |pg||
nt|mariner1: here they could use 2n to ask if above minimum|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last are able at 4 I belive?|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|raghavan: 21 vs 19 points should be in a part score|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 2@D both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi   wk in a major |pg||
nt|yuval10: we'll never know what she did, i guess....but anyway well played|pg||
nt|ritong: started with @c J, but boom|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. one of my parenrships uses that. |pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Youths are wonderful - taking up newer bidding ideas|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S sure seems to have a play here|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was laydown|pg||
nt|waso: good result for France from the open room|pg||
nt|kastan88: tx, Adrian|pg||
nt|mamos: well this looks like 3NT NS after Stayman|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the bold 2H bid on last gained 6 imps|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|davidb: normal game in H .  |pg||
nt|syl: @D lead beats the @S game here|pg||
nt|tomi2: normaly I would say we are missing an undo|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I know nordic bidding methods :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: wlc|pg||
nt|mikael_w: you have to do the trunph right here to make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: unfortunately,  "style" points dont count on the imp scale |pg||
nt|sybarra: but Poland won big on the bd|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Manno just called the TD|pg||
nt|sybarra: for last bd?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: He was pointing at the lower left of the cc, the TD just took him away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: They were whispering, couldn't hear|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C now from north perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: make sure of the right strain|pg||
mb|1N|nt|waso: they led A H  and heart|pg||
nt|syl: so the @D loser disappeared...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 4 @D asks pard to bid major |pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is really a lot with S hand (imo)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Romania is coming back, but the 1100 will be devastating|pg||
nt|othered1: looking for side suit preference on trump ace lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2d= both majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 2 sp= Muideberg?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite flat boards so fare:( But Russia can gain a IMP. 11 in @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2000 = ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: She's watching now|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h  wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer or? |pg||
nt|ritong: probably pass or double and 3@h by east|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@H probably a rubensohl version, showing 5+@Ss and inv+ values|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt not best idea |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here it looks ok to play 4 @s|pg||
nt|rayhaa: u have to bid it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: whith the @c layout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as there is no point using 2NT as natural once you have located a 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|sten: and Norway is only 4VP ahead of Israel in the fight for the silver|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andy_h: And again, bad breaks for whoever the declarer is |pg||
nt|tomi2: Toke Hoffmeister just turned 17 I was told|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: That's double pool right there o.O|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and after that 1 NT it might be tough|pg||
nt|capercliff: depends what defensive tricks they cash|pg||
nt|athene: even with a slightly weaker hand, it's right to overbid a bit to make sure at least you play the right suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so a chance for Greece to pull it back to close|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|gulyas: if NS plays strong @C|pg||
nt|ritong: a good move, though|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @h sort of put sand in the works |pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has low chances, needs to drop @c K|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD examining the notes|pg||
nt|santyclz: On the other hand, it's the type of auction that usually warrents a trump lead.|pg||
nt|capercliff: if E wins a @c with the Q might be easier|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I agree, If N is playing 4@s there is a natural trumpg lead from E|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: this contract depends basically on which hand the hearts are played from|pg||
nt|lestergold: the natural play of a heart up to the KQ loses of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D sets up GF with 5+@D|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: It most definitely is, pd is 6-10 (usually)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This will also be set by a few|pg||
nt|gh1: good 3S not easy fore ØV now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to come online no.|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s and 3N both fairly cold|pg||
nt|othered1: A from AK even in trumps?|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@s shows 0-4 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: well Ekrens 2@d is not new|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing silence by W|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|eerbil: 26 onör ile 1nt'de kalmalarý ilginç|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiliz takýmýnýn balans ayarý bozuk|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was forcing, either Polish or Precision - we aren't quite sure - and 1@D some negative reply|pg||
nt|gh1: not so good 4s, but maybee not x|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X will cost at the 4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even 3N making is 17 imps|pg||
nt|capercliff: if West can win a trick with the K@c before trumps are tackled, indeed he will get the finesse wrong|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: i mean who is going to play a heart tghe other way then losing the chance of finessing against the tenof hearts if th hearts break 4/1 the other way|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3 nt with lots of chances after the @c lead and the king wins|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S is either a 4 dard suit, or a hand like this missing a @H stopper or strong (18+) with spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: they found their best contract.|pg||
nt|kastan88: NS play some 5-card Majors, better minors, (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and me sleeping:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: this is too fast 4 me:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am told by specs that 1@C is either 15+ with @Cs, or 15-17 BAL, or 24+ any hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D (2@C) X is always tricky because partner doesn't have to have both majors (as here)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no 5 diam or clubs ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they chose to play 4@S, this does not need hearts to break 4-3 but has some other dangers|pg||
nt|kaapo: This lead presents a trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this looks like another potential gain for Czech  team|pg||
mb|p!|nt|babydolldk: On board 7 they bid 6@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: But if 2D is both Majors - the hand must be a real opening hand - or else difficult for respondaseer to judge - as in this c|pg||
nt|davidb: should misgueese all to go down|pg||
nt|elbec: now di franco showed 5+@h 15-17|pg||
nt|xenya: but S has 5!|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@s is asking|pg||
nt|mamos: and the defence are well placed to win 5 tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@H is cold on any lead|pg||
nt|kaapo: And also an entry to the North hand, unless East playes low, as he did|pg||
nt|yuval10: a slight overbidding by NS here...|pg||
nt|yuval10: N probably thought S has more for his X and 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: but the lucky position in the @c suit might enable it through|pg||
nt|ronpa: a @D lead might make declarer some troubles this lead will make it easy |pg||
nt|poohbear: easy?|pg||
nt|ronpa: (*er) ::)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why N would play for the drop, 4 @S safer|pg||
nt|gulyas: there, they got to the top spot after all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Screen opened and closed again|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, if 1@c can t be garbage, then 3@h is much more justified|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Manno was pointing at the part where it says what EW agreements are over strong artificial openings|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, now they have reatch the 4@s, rhis will be intresting|pg||
nt|elbec: 2nt denies 4 spades|pg||
pc|c7|nt|poohbear: maybe best to win the @c and return a @c immediately|pg||
nt|tomi2: 17 IMPs for Germany if they make and 19 if not, so the whole play is like fighting for overticks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just got confirmation Tomi, just turned 17|pg||
nt|capercliff: not the best lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: W will likely be presumed to have the @ck from no @c honor lead.|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N possible  also|pg||
nt|sten: sure is|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that switch shrieks of ace underlead- otherwise too dangerous to open up clubs|pg||
nt|sten: the opening prepared for the good game contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by carryover they are under bought Israel and Italy if I'm not wrong. But a smaal win against France|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if declarer tries to cross ruff he is doomed- he needs to play West for club ace|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: There the Norwegians where lucky. Decerved? My viue NO|pg||
nt|usla: a dbl cost Norway 5imp, now not dbl cost Russia 9|pg||
nt|capercliff: now its trivial|pg||
nt|elbec: yes i know... maybe he didn't like his spades... i can't understand|pg||
nt|elbec: or he's "tilted" :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is a good contract here -- doomed though|pg||
nt|mikael_w: No hesitation there eather :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 NT looks alot tuogher I think|pg||
nt|h bertens: carefull defence could defeat this contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|MolvaM: bu elde bizimkilerin 3ntye rahat gitmelerini bekliyoruz|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice leads by W , declarer might need to finesse @c right away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD told Sikora to keep the notes for her, and told the players to resume play|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@D was a definite alternative with that south hand (assuming 1@D shows diamonds)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: fly it!|pg||
nt|frusco: now can take ace|pg||
pc|c6|nt|elbec: horrible 3nt here|pg||
nt|xenya: absolutely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: manno also explained 1@S as 0-4 @ss|pg||
nt|elbec: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: so it looks like he did it on purpose|pg||
nt|othered1: auction looks alm ost random and certainly doesn't show the methods off well at all.|pg||
nt|elbec: he had a spade in the clubs maybe :)|pg||
nt|elbec: would have you doubled 2@c asking with West hand?|pg||
nt|othered1: Almost looks like south was seeking a way out after misdescribing the hand initially.  As a rule, it works best to play that there's no way  to correct an error, with partner's ...|pg||
nt|othered1: cooperation.  Just make a decision yourself, if you can, and go on to the next hand.|pg||
nt|mamos: West's chance|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: i predict a push|pg||
nt|gracelin: only 5-1 trump or 5-0 diamonds can cause troubles|pg||
nt|poohbear: off to a good start. |pg||
nt|ronpa: other table is in 2NT so a chance for big swing|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer carefully ducks a@h into the safe hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: brb|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|raghavan: in this case|pg||
nt|MolvaM: böylece þlemi telafi etmiþ oluruz|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|gulyas: no overtrick now|pg||
nt|frusco: fear of west ruff|pg||
nt|frusco: after bid 2@h|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N would not occur to me with South. I would want to five partner a chance to show a sixth heart or three spades|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps this is the best chance |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|Gerben42: doesnt look like making from here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D are high but stuck in the unreachable south hand|pg||
nt|minnie lee: he needs to finesse to the @c9|pg||
nt|elbec: he was lucky that they can't make 4@s|pg||
nt|othered1: very|pg||
nt|mamos: yes well done|pg||
nt|h bertens: now he will make i think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: he was lucky no 9 or 10@H in S|pg||
nt|ronpa: he still has to guess at the end who has the K@D, can try to endplay south with the clubs and K@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: since N did not play back a @c he has none|pg||
nt|poohbear: so no declarer can cash majors and in the end exit a @s . He will make the hand as long as North has 1 @d honor|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: now the losing heart play|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: will have 2 entries for it with the K@d and the @s ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good defence |pg||
nt|yuval10: he presumably knows that @s's are 4-3 from the bidding|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant believe E underled the A@d here, Is this true?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|athene: you might still be able to back into 4-4 heart fit if partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: sorry, 4-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|pelu: spec to the danes: Nicki Sørensen won to days et6ape in Tour de France!!!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can make 11 by playing flat-out, of course|pg||
nt|athene: @SK, @HA, @SA, heart finesse|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N needs @cHx in W i think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|davidb: now 5 |pg||
nt|sybarra2: but 4 sp cold for e/w?|pg||
nt|yuval10: good def, but declarer can still make|pg||
nt|henryb: give partner|pg||
nt|h bertens: well done|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: zonda olmadýðý için sadece 6 puan ama olsun|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can endplay N in @s and let him play @d and make a guess|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@d both majors is usually played weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: ...|pg||
nt|ort21: someone have live result|pg||
nt|ort21: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind that Gerben :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: no guess|pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook was simply dangerous, wasn t it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so claim |pg||
nt|frusco: but risk if A@d in Est|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we are resulting,  but seems to me take club ace and draw trump is safer |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The problem appears to be that the cc doesn't show what 2@H meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult position - would look silly if the @CA got ruffed |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm Mike .....that would be yuckky |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NS are offered time now, to agree upon a defense against overcalls not listed on the cc|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: There was a claim btw, but I missed the   of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: game |pg||
nt|sybarra: no OT's |pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, if east churlishly turns up with the @HQ, you go a lot down|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: well, they seem to have done ok by the seat of their pants on this one |pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Hi Silviu:) Welcome u are.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: well, the problem is you have to bid 3@d in tthat case, and you cannot trust pard s bid, whatever it will be, since he is stuck with no @d stopper|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@H looks right here|pg||
nt|gracelin: In a bidding challenge they will surely get the top mark by choosing 4S|pg||
nt|tomi2: in fact 3nt will make most of the times, because hearts can also split badly but block or ... if you bid 3nt fast they might lead something else, say the leader has Kx in hearts ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and partner AQxxx|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but after heart weakness exposed, I like Sikora's choice|pg||
nt|tomi2: sure|pg||
nt|tomi2: will we ever play board 10? that was an interesting one|pg||
nt|gracelin: a good result for Norway in the closed room|pg||

nt|kaapo: At the other table, the Latvian West led the singleton @D8 against 4@S on  7|pg||
nt|kaapo: His partner won with @DQ - but the 8 was difficult to read|pg||
nt|kaapo: So instead of taking the ace and giving a ruff, he shifted to hearts and the declarer has a chance|pg||

nt|kaapo: Our operator was needed elsewhere - thus the break|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully we'll soon be able to get back to business|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW are likely to play some number of NT on this board|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 2NT, if West opens a 14-16 1NT and East invites|pg||
nt|kaapo: And it might just about make 8 tricks|pg||

nt|kaapo: Rather bid 3NT straight away|pg||

nt|Gerben42: if so, why didnt Robert pass - when opps find 3@C there is still time for 3@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the lure of the vulnerable game strikes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: signal|pg||
nt|poohbear: There is a case for Ruso to balance since partner prob has some values and likely a stiff @h in that case|pg||

nt|ritong: :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: N taking a long time thinking...|pg||
nt|charles_l: Q and @d to kill the entry|pg||
nt|raghavan: East asked his partner to transfer to Spade. West should do so. He can bid 3Nt with a fit in Spades AXX.|pg||
nt|davidb: now Sp can declarer  problems|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere kaptaný maçtan sonra soyunma odasýnda baðýracak. rua 2liden rua omuzlamak yasak diye|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need a natural raise of the fourth suit as a fit there can easily be lost|pg||
nt|xenya: well this gives declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|mariner1: I use 12 as my cut off VUL, also play transfers VUL|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|davidb: should not throw D !|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT in OR was -3|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead was 4th best @s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gracelin: just 1 imp as I have predicted|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphztr: club?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no...|pg||
nt|ritong: manno has a good idea about hands now|pg||
nt|elbec: while they're on this boring contract, can i ask somebody from russia how do girls lastname suffixes work? do they just add an "A"?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: the @c shift probably comes from 4 cards when dummy has 4 of them|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer tries to cater with @sHx anywhere, looks ok|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|charles_l: now fairly clear @sA was single|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the trump lead has made things awkward|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: bbosunu yeni açanlar için belirtelim. türk milli tk kaptaný ise milli oyuncularýmýzdan yusuf sohtorik|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kendisi þu an romanyada hem U26 hem de Kýzlar takýmýmýzýn kaptanlýðýný yapýyor|pg||
nt|elbec: i was also curious about that :)|pg||
nt|elbec: just "a" or sometimes also "ova"?|pg||
nt|xenya: -a, normally |pg||
nt|elbec: meanwhile manno di franco wheren't able to switch to clubs and now ew have 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes was excellent choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either that or it's defensive  |pg||
nt|Gerben42: he can continue with trump now, partner still stops @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but if South doesn't bid clubs at the 2-level, will he do so at the three-level?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: so west is very likely to hold 4@ds|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Gerben42: poor choice in @D cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: Poland is also blitzing Romania, boath have +42 or 43 now |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Decl led from the wrong hand here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Leading @H9 from dummy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: accepted?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yup, @D5 by N|pg||
nt|tomi2: same with France and Hungary, 4 teams leading the provisional ranking with 24 VP|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Hopefully we will get some more exsiting board by the 10 left. To many flat hands|pg||
nt|othered1: There may be more discussion between N and S here.  Second @S play by declarer seemed to clarify defense|pg||
nt|xenya: well the duck was clearly wrong|pg||
nt|sten: 2 down now unless|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: so another 10 imps for Italy is on hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: last chance for a @D ruff and overruff for just -3|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|davidb: will need a guess now|pg||
nt|ritong: diling|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|raghavan: another Spade|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this hand plays nicely |pg||
nt|xenya: as the defence has another suit to open|pg||
nt|othered1: Ping-pong result here.  Final ping by south|pg||
pc|c5|nt|waso: first big swing for Hungary|pg||
nt|waso: 13 imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not getting any easier |pg||
nt|elbec: They don't play "Smith" convention... as my friend bava says it helps a lot!|pg||
nt|elbec: now i'm afraid they'll fire their "lupara" :)|pg||
nt|othered1: simple attitude by north, clarified by east's second @S play, should have helped|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree in IMPS its probably best not to use the lower range RED|pg||
pc|c2|nt|charles_l: after X, pass with 2 and 3@s with 3 is recommended|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lokaty: had to play for the endplay, now defeat possibly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: small heart from dummy may have been better|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphztr: ms Hoderova thinking now...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shes picked the K then the 7 several times now|pg||
nt|raghavan: Play A and back a c|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, I would have expected a @H off of dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West does not know the Rabbi's rule- when the king is singleton play the Ace|pg||

nt|ritong: might have worked finding opener with say @h Jxx and no @s loser, but, as any very marginal shot, this unlikely, so costs on the long run|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Do they play 2-way Stayman?|pg||
nt|elbec: we're too italian for that :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|capercliff: and a pretty skimpy invite opposite 11-13|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: 7c is a good proposition if West has Kxx of clubs instead|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is alerted because they respond 2@C also on balanced hands even with spade fit, so it could be on 2 cards only|pg||
nt|gracelin: so only 4C confirmed the club fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2nt is forcing and 3@C confirms some support|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C confirms the fit, 4@H is a cuebid|pg||
nt|tomi2: and i got a hint from on of their teammembers, that 4@S is blackwood for clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Did I see 2@S first?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I have been informed that this partnership does not raise frequently on 3 cards, thx to Gerbrand (you're to old for schools now? sad:( )|pg||
nt|Gerben42: lets see if declarer can guess @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: and @D (restricted choice says finesse 2nd round)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this should be less than the cost of a game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|poohbear: well not quite both but something extra|pg||
nt|ritong: most likely, can t imagine a convention hiding majors|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|poohbear: which finesse taken?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Adrian?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he dont try |pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry 6@d tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: cant count :P|pg||
nt|MolvaM: karoya devam?|pg||
nt|ozgull: ama boþlanýrsa yapar|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel has been the hottest team over the last 5 matches. They got off to a weak start but are rapidly moving up the standings|pg||
nt|ronpa: declacrer started with low @C from hand to guard against @C's 4-0 on his right but all the ways leads to 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.pattayabridge.com/conventions/KokishRelay_main.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: hop!|pg||
nt|ritong: moi?:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|eerbil: arda küçük karo oynarsa ve oynayan alýrsa :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama gene de 5 löve çýkmayacak defansta|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4nt = 1 or 4 keycards in clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: seems right, that 4S didn't like a cue bid :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: so if West could show 2 key-card with a 5D reply, East would bid 7C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kastan88: curtains, claim 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but after you see the singleton @S, he probably doesnt have singleton @D as well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|syl: pulll alll the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: first good news|pg||
nt|syl: but 1|pg||

nt|mdgraham: exit @CK, and declarer has all his own work to do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has shown @CAK, @hKQ, so West may get the trumps right|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphztr: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: sorry, private|pg||
nt|athene: @HA strange|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though south was still hoping his partner actually held hearts|pg||

pc|h5|nt|syl: from dummmy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This line is a little scary, but everything works|pg||
nt|sybarra: the mad scramble now |pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: well done|pg||

nt|mikael_w: 20 and 1 IMP it looks like|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|andy_h: Even if they do raise frequently, I think I'd still prefer to play in a suit contract given the unbalanced nature of the hand. May be able to get some ruffs in hand and in dummy as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: well (opponents rarely lead trumps in these type of auctions)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|syl: lets see some partials...|pg||
nt|gracelin: a wild hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Great|pg||
nt|kaapo: I won't have to start explaining about different NT ranges then :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ok, so Sweden brought 13 IMPs for making 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N/E taking a break, getting water :P|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *:)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: taking small break here folks  not to worry |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: K, there we go|pg||
nt|gh1: Juniors no stop in 3club:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Rusch could have opened @D's for partner for -2 I think, but thats "only" one non vul undertrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: may be disappointed with that score|pg||
nt|gulyas: mad scramble? I call it the 'greedy algorythm':)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Look at the Hungary kids go! 25-5 against France!|pg||
nt|ritong: i love that one:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they are so closed...|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@h is good here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not so well done on the diamond exit, alas|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yep wrong again from me|pg||
nt|usla: part scores time and see not happy juniors:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I anticipate a transfer:)|pg||
nt|ritong: ergl|pg||
nt|ritong: not that one:(|pg||
nt|gulyas: yay, go kids!:)|pg||
nt|lokaty: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: boo lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: top of the leaderboard, too|pg||
nt|mamos: ok  so maybe the bit oif luck the Dutch needed top  Club lead certainly helped|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was not expecting them to reach 4S - they got there easily when North bid 2S over oppo's 1NT|pg||
nt|sten: Norway this time|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tomi2: this is a very nice board, difficult decisions to make for all players involved|pg||
nt|kaapo: And another 6 for bidding 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a very good results for Sweden in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol Henri :) @H|pg||
nt|ritong: eheheh|pg||
nt|sybarra: well guys,  my lunch date is away from my pc.....need to leave |pg||
nt|gulyas: 25-4 in the meantime, sorry Henri:)|pg||
nt|ritong: strange|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|poohbear: You specs arent paying attn . usually 20 people jump on me :P|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess the limits are 4S for NS and 5D for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: but surely they will bid higher than that|pg||
nt|rodal f: U remember from own exsperiens? And ure still hard by ure biddings:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all,   have fun!|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye Sherl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Shirley|pg||
nt|ritong: i would open 1 NT with no soul state|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all @H@H|pg||
nt|frusco: bye shi|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Take care Shirley!|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao bella|pg||
nt|frusco: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@h is pretty good after the opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Marion is thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, naturally|pg||
mb|2S|nt|charles_l: 3@s cue and RKC?|pg||
nt|h bertens: lead did not matter even simple make on trump lead|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|davidb: 4spX is par in this board|pg||
nt|poohbear: North should bid 2@c only|pg||
nt|MolvaM: üçüncüden oyun açanda 13 kart bulunmasý yeterlidir konvansiyonu bu|pg||
nt|gracelin: as spec pointed out, even 4S maybe difficult for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess south will not give up yet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, 4@S 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S can have longer @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S is alerted because a) it can have longer @D and b) it can be on 3 cards sometimes|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT with 13 to 9 is never obvious|pg||
nt|ritong: the bid is problematic|pg||
nt|athene: on that auction south might have tried 3@S over 3@H but it's pretty rare you have a 4-4 spade fit after pd bids both red suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N does get it done quick here|pg||
nt|athene: you are supposed to have 4333 and soft values for 3nt and south sure has that|pg||
nt|athene: those cards are so soft you could use them to stuff pillows|pg||
nt|pelu: but what is Ns problem??|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has good count however N would have to have a lot of controls to make above 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: safe|pg||
nt|athene: north is wondering how he can get to play it? dunno|pg||
nt|athene: i wld say north has a pretty good hand for 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: are we waiting for East to bid? 4@D?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H are a good contract for EW - down 1-2|pg||
nt|mariner1: S bid to me shows what he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: "whoa" she thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bob bid with his 3 of hearts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think they are friends:)|pg||
nt|rayhaa: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Canbecome an intresting board.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: in my opinion|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how they handle this|pg||
nt|poohbear: are they playing a Polish style system Adrian?|pg||
nt|poohbear: that would make 3@c the correct bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: since opener is limited by failure to open 1C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: sporting X by W :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East is not being backward in coming forward here|pg||
nt|ritong: ya sure|pg||
nt|ritong: he really wants to take the cues away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, Mike "the cryptical" Graham :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with all those goodies, West may bid 4@S |pg||
nt|frusco: after 3@s ovest must to bid 4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe Sikora thought it was "go ahead with a 5-4"|pg||
nt|frusco: west sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can West be 3-2 in the majors?|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|capercliff: N needs to do something here|pg||
nt|mamos: yes I was looking back at hand   you have plenty of tricks on cross ruff|pg||
nt|Gerben42: red vs white North has a tricky bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra2: not my cup of tea |pg||
nt|charles_l: the @hK is a big card|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: sorry, the play had |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: gone on but i missed it. 3@h went down 1|pg||
nt|charles_l: np, ty|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Osipov said: 'nice fit' :)|pg||
nt|ritong: even 2/1 for that matter|pg||
nt|ritong: and the whoa is confirmed with a second cue|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well into the fire as they say|pg||
nt|mariner1: to me N has a clear pass,,,,,,,, learning experience|pg||
nt|pelu: yes her bid was correct and N has some funny ideas - and will pay|pg||
mb|3S|nt|davidb: probably W knows his partners agressive jumps -if not 4sp is ok nv|pg||
nt|davidb: A h & h looks safe vs 3-2 in trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump length suggests 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D seems to understate his hand a bit, i think|pg||
mb|d!|nt|poohbear: and that would also make 3NT an easy bid by South|pg||
nt|ritong: this hand seems to be a matter of undertrick(s)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d a bit enthusiastic|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: holding 3 good spades and 2 bad hearts this system allows you to bid 1@S and partner rightside NT contract - but he can also find out later about your 3 cards if he has a strong ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told NS play 2@c as balanced 18-19|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s is cold obviously|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think both N and S shod do somerhing more here|pg||
nt|mamos: so that was the first board of the second half  will there be a Dutch revival ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Robert wants to ask for a stopper really, but how...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C would seem reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Have to go nowm folks and leave u to this exciting encounter between these promising young bloods|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Mike|pg||
nt|ritong: three down looks normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bessis bid a quiet 2@d in the OR and played there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý 1@c açýp bir sürü þlem buluruz diye hazýrlanmýþ ama rahat býrakmýyor rakipler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@c sizce nasýl kontrat?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, I see we lost 2 board :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT was mini|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D looks like a 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which is a gameforcing relay|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT denies 4c majors, and probably also denies 5-card minors|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@S shows 5|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT shows 2 @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C forced 2@D to show a sign off in @D or some stronger hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C forces 2@D, but maybe there is a case for bidding 2@H here, since so many @D fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A great result for Sweden |pg||
nt|yuval10: reasonable bidding, yes still a big swing in favour of Sweden|pg||
nt|yuval10: *yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a nice recovery after 0-48 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|charles_l: rehi. i see i missed some excitement|pg||
nt|elbec: indeed NS are fighting|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now there are 10 tricks|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: Grosset needs to unblock|pg||
nt|kaapo: This shows a draw back in 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Since West hasn't got 4@H nor 5 cards in a minor...|pg||
nt|kaapo: And he has 2@S...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Wow, I wish I could pen X at the 1-level lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: anyway, gotta go|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks all|pg||
nt|andy_h: See you later Gerben|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, thx Gerben!|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bye Gerben, take care|pg||
nt|h bertens: 4@S has a chance on a @H lead, will see|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: routinely|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: is he really thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|ritong: can t hurt|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: again|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bet Lorenzini is hurting|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3@H has some entry problems: you need 2 entries to dummy to take  finesses in @D|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@h must deny @c@d cues|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: find the @cQ for 3N|pg||
nt|raghavan: breather given by defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT shouldnt be too difficult . Declarer prob just unblocks spades and ducks a @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: and falls back on the @d finesse if @cs dont break|pg||
nt|henryb: I would only have bid 2@h; but I am old|pg||
nt|ritong: with north hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: no, with S|pg||
nt|ritong: was an option, yes|pg||
nt|henryb: and the auction might continue 6@h by north|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: that s the way ahan ahan i like it|pg||
nt|pelu: ok "only" down 1 - but 600 looks better :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, and 3@s show intrest|pg||
nt|mamos: The french have regained some imps against the Norwegians and regained the overall lead in nthe tournament|pg||
nt|h bertens: this I prefer|pg||
nt|mariner1: managed to stop on a dime,|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS miss rhe middle top honors and cards of generaly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and thx Rob cu all  soon|pg||
nt|ritong: why would he?:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: We (and the defence) know his full shape: 2-3-4-4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Worst he cold get by an 2/1 I belive|pg||
nt|mikael_w: S Dbl only showed @d I guess|pg||
pc|c9|nt|charles_l: a friendly lead|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: ok declarer sees things differently than me :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: I disagree with 4 @S. 3@S doesnt promise anything more then 2@D, his @C values arent impressive and they are not vulnerable.|pg||
nt|gulyas: the lead giving away a trick, but still not enough for declarer probably|pg||
nt|ritong: DID NOT EXPECT MORE|pg||
pc|cA|nt|davidb: he is still ok|pg||
pc|s7|nt|capercliff: wonder if they have a specific agreement of what X of a transfer is, suspect not|pg||
pc|c5|nt|poohbear: If the @d finesse had lost declarer might have had a spot of trouble|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 tricks now are likely|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 10 imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile the poles tried an intricated auction on the board michielsen bid a bold 3NT, and they lost 10|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not know what their auction means, but it was effective if lengthy|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kaapo: This appears to be going down now|pg||
nt|frusco: HI ALL|pg||
nt|ritong: always a pleasure to bid and make a slam after opponents opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: because when he stops to think he either had a stiff K@C or is thinking to switch|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: He should have ducked first D |pg||
nt|henryb: Hello|pg||
pc|c6|nt|raghavan: not good defense|pg||
nt|charles_l: looks like S dbl says 'don't lead'|pg||
nt|yuval10: it will be the same even if declarer make 10|pg||
nt|ritong: find the capslock, please:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C is 50% on the hook, which fails|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ritong: well, this is not really hurting|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, 3@s does not promise more than 2@d?|pg||
nt|ritong: are we deprived of green cards?|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he only needs both @H honors onside, but that will not happen|pg||
nt|lokaty: its just obvious bid from the MP1s:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: well done HQ, to hold it to -2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: after the XX  think it is for pen. |pg||
nt|frusco: sry:)|pg||
nt|othered1: ... which began when they were up > 40 imps early.  |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|mariner1: he has this made now|pg||
nt|hedyg: not when he finally plays back a @c|pg||
nt|ritong: no problemo, just kidding|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might not even have been sure to make 4 opposite nothing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra2: surprised he didnt split |pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: situation will be the same other room, assuming contract is the same, not the case here, so no worry|pg||
nt|hedyg: but while you wait for him to play a card..|pg||
nt|mamos: not very confident about 4@S Huub?  :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
nt|Gerben42: partner has @CQ and @HJT|pg||

nt|sybarra2: those specs looking think yes |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Oh, decl didn't realize N had a trump left|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they are playing 3 nt in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: They've settled for -2 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think we're almost back on schedule now - Ernst and Vincent, especially Vincent are infamously slow in play with the other Dutch schools|pg||
nt|poohbear: KOs are a much better test |pg||
nt|athene: of course that needed the defence to be sleeping|pg||
nt|athene: but north's actual line required them to be dead|pg||

nt|odysseus69: whats problem with 1D?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Players took a break btw|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: EW might get to 4@S fast if east makes a weak jump overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: 4@S made on 10 = 12 imps|pg||
nt|davidb: good slam for EW   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: being a fully-paid-up chicken, i think 3@S is an overbid as well |pg||
nt|capercliff: here he could have choose 2@h as TO of course|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h?|pg||
nt|ritong: i like 2NT|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling would just be looking for trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bob it's very nice player|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not think you are quite good enough; and you want to stop 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he make many jokes st the table:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: with Nawrocki:)|pg||
nt|frusco: i like dbl|pg||
nt|othered1: do you put south hand on @S or NT track now?|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat aggressive 2@H|pg||
nt|charles_l: double... and then?|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for S to decide|pg||
nt|h bertens: 8 more boards like this and its all even...:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: could imagine some problem in finding club fit |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mariner1: EW likelu need to stay low|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome William Frisby|pg||
nt|mikael_w: E/W :s week 1 NT has made alot of problems for N/S so far|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 @s is exaktly what n/s make here I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: South might have a hard rebid if there is no systemic agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Croatia need Davor Suker, Zvonimir Boban & Robert Prosinecki:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr, Sir Operator, I'll stop commanding :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a funny 3NT EW|pg||
nt|capercliff: but that would imply other hand types|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But now I wonder why S dosent open 1 NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: friendly table|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 5@D NS here|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should invite in now or just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: while E/W has a chanse in 3 @h|pg||
nt|mamos: lo 8 x5 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: X looks like single suited |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N not with @S lead though|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C now will show both minors but maybe stronger??|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: over 20 boards the better team should win. Not so over shorter matches |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but not guaranteed either|pg||
nt|capercliff: whatever X means, North had too much to pass twice|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oh, they play 15-17 I was told|pg||
nt|ritong: atta girl:)|pg||
nt|elbec: pass?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But not easy to come in after N opening|pg||
nt|rayhaa: disc a @d for 9 now|pg||
nt|charles_l: the @s8 is useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS may go down in a major suit slam with wrong (but reasonable)  guesses in both major suits|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS are close to making 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: But it should lose at least a spade, a diamond and 2 @Hs|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@C= 11-14 bal or 441@D4 or 17+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|sybarra2: in comparison e/w will say:  we took the early save" |pg||
nt|rodal f: But will might end at a partscore in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'm not sure I like 3@D, got the HCP and distr, but the suit is lousy|pg||
nt|yuval10: can W fins the excellent @s lead? not likely, i'd say|pg||
nt|yuval10: *finds|pg||
nt|frusco: 5@d is unlucky|pg||
nt|ritong: good try|pg||
nt|sybarra: or |pg||
nt|mariner1: really would need a @c lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double now should simply show extras|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive N have told minor at presicion now|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|poohbear: I guess the Russians are playing a Polish type system otherwise North really shouldnt pass 1H|pg||
nt|syl: good chance to declare 2@H in both rooms...|pg||
nt|syl: but here S reopened|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol|pg||
nt|elbec: double double :)|pg||
nt|othered1: LOoks like south will play 4@S, unless north insists on @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: my experience is that Dutch schools player are all very fast, so if you play average tempo you are "slow" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, I guess we do|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H conceals the hand but doesn't help if they bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: you might try 3@S or 4@C or something |pg||
nt|odysseus69: but having shown hearts South is worried that x may sound like penakties|pg||
nt|rodal f: If not there would have been a bid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C makes?|pg||
nt|mariner1: several routes to go, some make 4, some 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have a back and forth match going here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N a very reasonable spot|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C = Precision style, 2@S = hearts, 2NT natural i guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in Open Room are in a tough 3N here|pg||
nt|athene: i would think this is the sort of game you stumble into more often than not|pg||
nt|athene: east opens and west just decides to force to game|pg||
nt|athene: with the good heart suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and it would be tough to bring 9 in I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they play natural|pg||
nt|poohbear: works out very nicely for them here|pg||
nt|hedyg: is Lorenzini/Grosset a new partnership? i seem to rember Lorenzini used to play with another partner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu 2 kör cevabu kör ataðýný önlemek bakýmýndan iyi|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was likely strong (or Polish), and 1@D negative|pg||
nt|kaapo: South has some @S support and a hand that is pretty maximum for 1@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: So he might find another call|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Any time I play with my father, and I mess up, he says "Look at the clock, we've got another 8/30 minutes left! Take longer!"|pg||
nt|ritong: offshape preempts with unexpected strength often turn out good|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he needs to find the @S ruff to defeat this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: need to find the spade ruff now, and how can they realistically do that?|pg||
nt|frusco: nice stop|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and Bob It's suerly a very good player|pg||
nt|odysseus69: every bid has been a problem for N/S - tricky deal- |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ozgull: apaçi ye 5 li renk geldi:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3nt or pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: However, being rebellious and a schools player, I shrug it off :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Lhuissier figuring partner cant have everything when overcallling|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting that W pulls the 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ama deklaran 2 as çýkartmak zorunda|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iþi zor|pg||
nt|begse: kör oynanmazsa 3nt oluyor aslardan biri alýndýgýnda|pg||
nt|MolvaM: her 2 asýn da güneyde olmasý iyi|pg||
nt|syl: in OR S removed N 2@H to 3 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@c 4@s seems ok|pg||
nt|othered1: to me, south's auction implies another place to play.  Might north now try 4N to bring @D into the picture?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well. after 300 at ORit seems like some IMP:s back to franse|pg||
nt|mariner1: and W has no real outside fast tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now another wild bid from East|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well Lindqvist belive his pard. id EW steel the contract?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: this lead will not strike fear in declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i am told she is playing on the girls team|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: classic lead|pg||
nt|gh1: i think 3dia is the limit here 4 are down with good def|pg||
nt|usla: hard defence at 3 nt from E, belive they makeit|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT and min 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|lokaty: which is hard to believe after 3@H jump:(|pg||
nt|ritong: @d shift difficult|pg||
pc|d4|nt|MolvaM: güney zor bir karar vermek durumunda kalacak|pg||
nt|charles_l: 5@c a lucky make|pg||
nt|elbec: now he makes 4@s|pg||
pc|d3|nt|babydolldk: unlucky lead..|pg||
nt|kaapo: It appears, that West would have to lead hearts twice to keep this to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, he wasn't on lead, so he can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: well read by north and now west was trapped into the opening lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gh1: but i think he make 5 now:)|pg||

nt|mikael_w: not sure to make 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|elbec: not a nice lead by west|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S now makable as cards lie|pg||
nt|elbec: but he needs to guess how to play|pg||
nt|charles_l: not easy still|pg||
nt|othered1: right.  "as cards lie" equivalent to |pg||
nt|othered1: "double dummy"|pg||
nt|charles_l: W may try @sAx|pg||
nt|elbec: come on andrea! he needs that to calm down!|pg||
nt|othered1: That will end the defense|pg||
nt|elbec: not an easy play from west now|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or might not. Belive I'm wrong. Not shure|pg||
nt|mikael_w: even if they made 10 in OR|pg||

nt|rodal f: Flated it y, if 5 @D next rrom|pg||
nt|rodal f: room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that was unwise- with single spade South would have taken d ace and returned a spade|pg||
pc|c8|nt|MolvaM: zonda 3nt swingi|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. 10 or 11 tricks bought give 6IMP for Russia|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer was probably intending to overtake in diamonds and finesse clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|charles_l: lead saves an undertrick but stll -100 likely|pg||

nt|tokay1975: ama yinede bu 3nt komik  cok agresif bidding 3nt diyen elde abartcak bisey yok defansin kartlari daha normal olsa  hemen 2 3 iceri gidicek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: imp|pg||

nt|poohbear: Good technique by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|ritong: i am not completely aware about that  i just know that lorenzini lives in the east of france, where i have many friends, and they told me he is very promising|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is indeed, even if he misguessed the @ds here|pg||
nt|tomi2: E could have ducked the @CA but decl was favorite to get the clubs right anyway because of the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: France and Norway going strong at the top of the table. However, this is just round 12 of 22, so many things can happen|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@c call for a @s return|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eerbil: Güney ilk trefli almasa defans biraz daha kolay olabilirdi|pg||
nt|sybarra2: never to see dummy again |pg||
pc|dT|nt|davidb: good bidding by EW . play should not be a problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: no reason to overruff when there is a loser to pitch|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes if you play both suit "with the odds" then you lose, but I think N did not bid his 5 cards in the OR, so E lead a heart and I guess W shoed his count|pg||
nt|elbec: now he can't miss it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|poohbear: EW needed totake the @d ace before plying the @c|pg||
nt|syl: crossruffing may be superior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=12&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|yuval10: and S does very well to return @d, but declarer can simply finesse @c or @s now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Israel coming strongly from behind after a very poor start|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ lead in the other room solved a lot of problems for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: too late, bambi|pg||

pc|s5|nt|babydolldk: last chance|pg||
nt|raghavan: HK and a Heart may be a good defense|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: director calls for half time|pg||
nt|charles_l: but may decidwe to play N for @dQ10xx? instead of @c10?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ms Hoderova again pondering her next move|pg||
nt|charles_l: no- too much for 1@d response i think|pg||
nt|raghavan: Probably they are playing - In VuGraph delayed presentation|pg||

nt|gracelin: declarer is under no pressure in 4H.  But if he were in slam, the normal way is to go wrong in both major suits|pg||
nt|tomi2: with qxx in spades lindqwist is not likely to lead singleton Q in 6@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Meanwhile, Latvia has scored some IMPs on boards 9 and 10|pg||
nt|kaapo: So, is the East hand still a weak/mini 1NT, or 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E has left the table|pg||
nt|kaapo: So he can't decide|pg||
nt|kaapo: And is going to find a coin|pg||
nt|kaapo: To help resolve the dilemma|pg||
nt|kaapo: I have this info about the (possible) 1@D opening: marmic, 13-16bal, eller nat (kan vara canape med klöver)|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose it's simple enough to understand, even to those who cannot read Swedish|pg||
nt|kaapo: "klöver" = clubs|pg||
nt|kaapo: With help of the @H finesse, EW have 11 tricks at NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: With only 13 rounds to play, it's hard to recover from a <10 score|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: transmission problems |pg||
nt|capercliff: playing the A was 0%|pg||
nt|othered1: slam is quite good, preferably in NT|pg||
nt|athene: but if the lead really was a singleton, the club finesse still wouldn't bring them in|pg||
nt|mariner1: Germany and Israel are down in their matchs so Norway doing well moved up|pg||
nt|mikael_w: to bad Sandra diddent take rhe chanse after the lead to discard a @d, was worth 1 imp|pg||
nt|mamos: 3nT NS|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: small break here|pg||
nt|h bertens: is it?|pg||
nt|h bertens: on a heart lead it can be defeated|pg||
nt|mamos: Huub your lads will do well to get five imps out of this one :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: could be more on a non heat lead...|pg||
nt|h bertens: heart|pg||
nt|mamos: we shall see |pg||
nt|mamos: south is likely to show Hearts|pg||
nt|Gerben42: is this a roland slam?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 7 on finding two minor suit Q|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they will bid 6@D |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mariner1: 4 of either major works here|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wish I could say Croatian pickup as all the Croatians are good friends of mine|pg||
nt|ritong: uh?|pg||
nt|ritong: zia like?|pg||
nt|ritong: ah no|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Looks like it, judging by the IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 33 IMP lead is 22-8?|pg||
nt|hedyg: michaels?|pg||
nt|charles_l:  13 not recorded|pg||
nt|sten: well the club ace was the down trick ... if W has another spade it's home without taking the Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now @H+@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: So fare: France 219, Norway 216|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d from N....on the way to 4@h i believe|pg||
nt|mamos: after Stayman|pg||
mb|2S|nt|babydolldk: nice 6@H without at trump lead...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 10 3NT 1 down here. Open room 4S = 12 IMP |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S does play a trick better likely|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice to play unsual vs unusual and be able to bid a nf 3@s here|pg||
nt|ritong: wild shot id say|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d seems to be on|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: who's thinking?:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: always Grosset :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now is hard|pg||
nt|poohbear: that would be my choice|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c pass or correct|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW probably need to stay low here|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt eveyone in 3 nt on the n/s cards here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: every card is ok for NS  for 11 tricks in H . |pg||
nt|poohbear: and Ozturk's as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: with the lucky @cs he should be able to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about N bidding 5@C instead of 5@d, showing force in @c and fit in 1 of the reds?|pg||
nt|kaapo: In a diamond contract a major suit ruff would bring it to 12|pg||
nt|tomi2: in all junior competitions you have a bi difference between the best players and the "newcommers" Jassem and Tuczynski playing for Polish schools won that event already 2 years ago ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and are playing in first Polish league. They are very experienced and good players while there are lots of teams with players who only play Bridge for one or two years and don't ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: have as much training as others have, so we will see lots of 25-x scores this week|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Swedes did well to choose NT in the other room. 4@H is in jeopardy|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@h will manage, def. doesn't have communication|pg||
nt|h bertens: i have to hope, i am Dutch....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anybody for 1NT here, as many do|pg||
nt|odysseus69: defence did not shine- South should have won 1st diamond and returned diamond (not jack)- and of course North should not have played spade ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: dbl now|pg||
nt|poohbear: get the @hs in|pg||
nt|kaapo: But the 4-1 break is akward|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least if South leads the singleton @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: A practic bid:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But we have seen other players then W that has missed to play K/Q whith doubleton there, But still I think its a better chanse ro just play the 10 right|pg||
nt|capercliff: if East had Hx then small would suffice|pg||
pc|dA|nt|charles_l: E may sac in 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I like this kind of bidding:)|pg||
nt|gh1: i think 4s-1 with right def, and spade switch fore -1|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: You're right there, Thomas :)|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT 3@h 4@h|pg||
nt|ritong: boo|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Now S shod be warned whith this hand to bid any more|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poohbear: Especially if EW can bid 2NT scramble |pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d is a game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: South should reject|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer needs five @c tricks, he will find them whatever his choice so big hit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Montanari sees no defensive tricks vs 6@D.....|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might bid 6@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar öndeyken alýþveriþ ihtimali düþük eller gelmesi hoþ biþey|pg||
nt|capercliff: if KQ doubelton still has a chance later|pg||
nt|othered1: 32 HCP and good @S fit should be easily bid to slam here|pg||
nt|charles_l: E can shape out with 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: OR in 3N NS. lets see how the ladies handle it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: N sure has a lot to be passing 3@D|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, particularly when he holds @sAK, his pard very likely has an 8 bagger|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=733&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1 for running scores in the Schools series|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like an interesting spot they have reached now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: extra pass/|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7 NT also makes, hard to see that|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|raghavan: West will pass |pg||
nt|davidb: if N is short in Sp , S hand is not so good . ok to pass Nv'  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would have been -4|pg||
nt|hedyg: Grosset "the thinker" might take a while to play this|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no real alternative|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need @S returne for set the contract NOW|pg||
nt|henryb: suitable dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: W thinks E has to be entirely broke, not quite though|pg||
nt|athene: he could have doubled 1@H i think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: i am told they play Ghestem, so 2@s was @H+@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: trump switch best|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to play @c|pg||
nt|capercliff: and E would have to play a @s for ruff and discard anyway|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4N?|pg||
nt|charles_l: wow|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 NT is for sure a kontract I dont want to be in,|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 7N is not a great contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: undo please|pg||
nt|mariner1: no it just happens to make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|charles_l: if Z rebid 4@s it might go ppp...?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ms. Hoderova is playing the bartender now|pg||
nt|raghavan: N should try spade ruffs before drawing trumps |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: has left the table in order to procure drinks|pg||
nt|tomi2: west chose to pass 2@H - it's quite popular in Poland a) to upgrade lots of 14's to 1NT and b) to superaccept on maximum and 3 cards support - so he chose to pass 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is probably making.  Nice stop by Sikora |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will promote the 4th @s to discard a @c, and ruff @d in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, West could have led a diamond against 3NT I suppose, but he chose his own suit, clubs. Not such a good idea|pg||
nt|ronpa: well played|pg||
nt|pelu: pass or 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: now you might pass with east, on the basis that even if it makes, it's only 180 :) no disaster|pg||
nt|mariner1:  E needs to pass if he can find it|pg||
nt|athene: borderline pass of 2minor doubled is much more common than 2major|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@c warns misfit to S, so good stop|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I dont know is they play 1 NT as forcing here ( but I doubt it ) and then I think pass on 1 nt is a good bid|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 12 brought the expected five imps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might go down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C fit showing?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz: We'll save everyone's reputation and claim w shifted to a @d after winning the @ck...|pg||
nt|xenya: it does look a bit odd|pg||
nt|othered1: Worked out OK, even in 6N better|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphztm: S thinking.......|pg||
nt|syl: bold bid this 3nt|pg||
nt|gracelin: unless declarer misguessed D after north ruffs club and return a low D.|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has only 3 hearts, so after (taking @H finesse and) ruffing a @H, EW can draw trumps and then raise the @S trick|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bech explains to Lauks that his part's hand is a REALLY bad 13|pg||
nt|sybarra2: take no finesses.... |pg||
nt|tomi2: since W made no negative double E should have good spades for his offer to play 4@S. W with Hxx and @H shortnes can pass maybe|pg||
nt|mikael_w: As the layout is here this shod make|pg||
nt|rayhaa: loose 3@c 1@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we se a shiny play then?:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant really blame South for cashing club ace - although norths spade ace did suggest 4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|poohbear: 3@h is a counter Game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps North should accept that|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D was an artificial GF|pg||
nt|kaapo: And I suppose 3NT means what Florin told|pg||
nt|kaapo: This should go 1 down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: @H lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: that helps!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bang down aces and kings  |pg||
nt|xenya: but was brief and to the point|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 13 likely a push I think |pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you see @D 3-1 then you finesse @C wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 6@D as you said is a nice spot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: probably always makes 5 though|pg||
nt|athene: south has bid north's hand for him here|pg||
nt|athene: north passed 3@D and then bid only 3@S over the second double|pg||
nt|athene: saying "I don't have anything, partner!"|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=5|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I could claim but who knows..:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL better not|pg||
nt|hedyg: no operator claims :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Grosset is .... thinking:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ofc|pg||
nt|ritong: sometimes they get bored and have fun trying to anticipate the matters  not always a success:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: W looks troubled by the bidding |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elde önemi yok ama kuzeyin pik 8li dönmesi iyi bir oyun|pg||
nt|gh1: now last chance fore spade|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think 4@S is better than 5@D, esp. on this @D layout|pg||
nt|tomi2: Hoffmeister has already bid 4@D, if he wanted to run out of 4@S maybe he should have offered 5@C to let partner decide the final contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps his p could've halped him by doubling 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: @DA and @D( back (ask for @H)|pg||
nt|pelu: @D8|pg||
nt|sten: board 8 was misscored when it was played here in CR ... 4h +1 in both rooms|pg||
nt|sten: not 2h +3 by Berg|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (Refresh Often)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Nice said Mr. Osipov|pg||
nt|ritong: isn t that some sort of masterminding, passing 2@s with 16?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphztm: bd.13 was fault|pg||
nt|gracelin: did C9 call for spade ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but nopbody leads from Q into jx when xxx in spades is also available|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kaapo: I held a elementary bridge class a while back, and I kind of remember the book stating something about 33 HCPs for a slam|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kaapo: So perhaps Bech could've settled for 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: he normal are -1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra2: easy from here of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't, according to the movie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|ronpa: now another club|pg||
nt|poohbear: On a @c switch declarer wins and plays a @d. East can win but he has a dillema . If he cashes the spade that sets up a trick. If he doesnt  then it gets pitched|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I guess he had to cash it|pg||
nt|poohbear: and declarer can set up a long heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was a question of cash or cash it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I know 1 NT might be up to 11 somerimes, But marmic whith single @c is the worth posible distribution when your P bid 1 NT affter 1 @d|pg||
nt|mikael_w: sometimes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|poohbear: another trump now and declarer will attempt to cash 2@ds but the second gets ruffed. He can then ruff a @h and get the good Q of @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: played by S in OR on J@S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and they played fast untill now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: south raised to 4@S, saying "don't lie, i know you have lots really!"|pg||
nt|athene: and south was indeed correct|pg||
nt|ritong: then " undo" "undo" "undo", "sorry" "sorry" "sorry" etc|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and apparently easy at the table:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no point in popping A@H here|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes agree, usually 1@d - 1N(=4+@c)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: everyone's having a laugh|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|gracelin: yes, there is no discard available for declarer, so north will just sit back with DQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: had East NOT cashed the spade and played a trump . Declarer would win in hand and cash a @d pitching a @s then play Ace of @h ruff a @h |pg||
pc|hK|nt|kaapo: Or pehaps he could bid somthing to suggest a minor suit contract, say 4NT or 5NT?|pg||
nt|tomi2: Rusch could also have 5 clubs and 4 spades for his bidding|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: direct auction in the other room! |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphztr: the cups are tiny|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: when a @c comes from W he can claim|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows if he rises A@H and loses a @S another @H is coming|pg||
nt|athene: one ruff didn't massively inconvenience declarer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mikael_w: brb|pg||
nt|santyclz: Painful to see declarer suffering so when all lines work.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: it got rid of that annoying 4th trump in south's hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphztr: !!!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: one down ...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: OR 2 boards faster|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: now the @c loser is gone|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tomi2: while North maybe could have doubled holding some 1.5 trump tricks and an ace and seeing they had problems in their auction, I think he will win more often then lose those 4 imps ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: for =|pg||
nt|ritong: well, maybe they have agreements about simple raises|pg||
nt|athene: and also set up dummy's diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|poohbear: not clear what declarer should do but he is going for the @d break|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: got pushed into a very lucky slam!|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|rodal f: The capitan are online as h.....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ronpa: so small pickup for turkey here|pg||
mc|7|nt|kaapo: Ah, Bech had only 3@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: then try to cash the second @d. When it doesnt he just concedes 2 @Hs and scores the 5th one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: passing looks ok with 5332 shape|pg||

nt|mamos: 2020 hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: practical bidding|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1NT by West looks the spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@C Polish @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: it was indeed 7 to Russia on the 1@h hand. NS played 3@c in the other room. That was 2 high|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, some players play cards very fast - some don't place their card clearly enough on the table (or the screen hides it)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2@H seems to be the (in)famous Muiderberg, as we call it, 5@H, 4+m|pg||
nt|charles_l: ty|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ritong: amusing|pg||
nt|henryb: X = one suit or 4Major, longer minor?|pg||
nt|ritong: east almost has the best hand at the table after this start|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate that with a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|henryb: and you would be wrong as declarer takes 6 tricks while you have a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Catalin|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 1Nt opening 14-16 won the prevoious board|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D perhaps an underbid in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: five trumps and an ace...maybe worth 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: wld be nicer with two spades and the stiff in hearts, admittedly|pg||
nt|athene: (or that's what north probably thought) :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking for 6@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: The South hand here seems to me at least as good as the one North opened 1@C on  13|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even though it has 1 HCP less.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, in a limited opening system...|pg||
nt|kaapo: South might have a was to show a maximum opening with 6@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Like 2NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: *way (instead of was)|pg||
nt|kaapo: This might be yet another case for 3NT with a good 6-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: which probably he cant remember now as he is staring at the (very high) ceiling|pg||
nt|sybarra2: muiderberg or funky tartan?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2NT asking which m|pg||
nt|ronpa: open room here bid quickly to 3NT defenced blocked clubs so only 2 off|pg||
nt|ronpa: *defence|pg||
nt|ritong: not a sure shot, but could turn out in a bloodbath|pg||
nt|henryb: South may run.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ritong: anyway, grosset is " cricri" on BBO and i can say that he is a super nice guy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: will padon bid 4@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: or he will lead the ace of clubs?|pg||
nt|ronpa: he's not on lead so... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he won't lead anything|pg||
nt|ritong: probably systemic|pg||
nt|Gerben42: lhuissier don't balance, you will be -620 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS any lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now is the time to bid it|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a lucky grand slam bid by Norway in open room|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see if it gets in the way of a constructive auction|pg||
nt|sybarra2: E pleased to hear it is @C |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 50 minutes left|pg||
nt|lokaty: 2@C natural GF, 2@D relay for majors|pg||
nt|ritong: @hs into the picture soon, then|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H showing @S here|pg||
nt|pelu: play for 6@C - but diff to find @HJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is a nice reverse to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: mnissed that 2C opener|pg||
mb|1N|nt|charles_l: i think 4@h is a practical bid - not dbl|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ruso should lie by dbling if she feels obligated to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess we bid the raggy sp suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i would have opened a 20-21 2NT with the 2 10s and 9@d|pg||
nt|usla: matchpoints dbl in OR, saka style:)|pg||
nt|ronpa: he knows opp are bidding on long @D's|pg||
nt|santyclz: So our 2nd push of the match.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like a standard 3 NT here, whith maybe 1 IMP to sweden|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorunsuz|pg||
nt|tomi2: just getting some bets that polish players wont bid the grand, but my experience against sikora and nawrocki is that they will :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes this is a good time to grab a coffee|pg||
nt|mikael_w: my guess here is that 1 NT = @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S being 3 3 here will help|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2N shows the bid hand with little @c help as he has|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!|pg||
nt|poohbear: She rebid 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: would think she would be thrilled to raise NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and now Mr. Osipov.... pass:)|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that he takes his time playing this important event is rather a good thing, i add|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it is|pg||
nt|ozgull: düz bir el daha|pg||
nt|tokay1975: bu elide cozduler pastan gelen ortaga  dbl muthis|pg||
nt|tokay1975: kesinlikle pas derdim ben alakam olmazdi|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 3@H now could either show exactly 3@S - or deny 3@S. South just doesn't know which :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit passive by E? 2@C as bid for anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shaka style= 5 clubs:)|pg||
nt|ritong: easy going|pg||
nt|elbec: they can play 3@c in NS|pg||
nt|pelu: 3½ loser - |pg||
nt|charles_l: whats wrong with 2@c by S instead of 1N?|pg||
nt|charles_l: oh.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard has 4 great spades|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|charles_l: unless 4m=m+@h|pg||
nt|babydolldk: if you play leaping michaels maybe 4@C...|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt showed the strong version of 1@C? what wld south do with the weak NT? pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora may still regret on  11 when they stopped in 6C but trump K was onside for seven.|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand, with the diamonds breaking.|pg||
nt|andy_h: And of course N is going to lead his shortest major to hit partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: good decision by N 4SX goes 2 down VUL -500 where as now only 450|pg||
nt|charles_l: between dbl & 4@h, guys?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q10 @D comes down so this will not take long|pg||
nt|kastan88: disaster in Open Roome here, after quite similar bidding as here, IMO North can't bid 3NT with only 1 stopper, double much solid decision,|pg||
nt|lokaty: from this hand 13 tricks propably.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Cliff, I do that then|pg||
nt|elbec: somebody for a double after 1@h with N hand?|pg||
nt|athene: east has one of the best doubleton queens you can have|pg||
nt|athene: and two side aces are always nice|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl = Pd I hope you'll figure out what I have|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: Sikora is a gabmler and Nawrocki not so when West has the final decision to make...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
nt|elbec: di franco is having a senior approach today :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 7D makes on 2-2 diamonds or singleton Q, altgether about 52.5% chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although, of course they may not have that kind of agreement at alk|pg||
nt|ritong: no comment|pg||
nt|mikael_w: THIS is a great kontracr now :) if Sandra just get the @h right|pg||
nt|mikael_w: sry Sjöberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: This will not do well|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D always makes when Sikor is playing and Qxx(x) is not offside ;)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure he won't go wrong here.  That's a safety bet.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 4 @h = cue at this point |pg||
nt|sybarra2: (just a guess) |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Johansen just explained it as such|pg||
nt|othered1: Now has to find the @CQ.  Never got their good @S fit in, however.|pg||
nt|xenya: not me, but i would jave probably balanced as N|pg||
nt|xenya: *have|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N makes on other days - just not today @cs4-1|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But when the bad break in @c distroys it|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is getting interesting|pg||
nt|odysseus69: apart from the missed heart game the young Norwegians have not been shy|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: demek sen de yaþlýsýn tokay|pg||
nt|othered1: There goes the @C guess|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok now found? |pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C actually has a play, though its not easy in 4 suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tokay1975: ole gozukuyo:))|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: e n-am fost atent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nawrocki adopted the scientfic approach by asking trump Q|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mariner1: yes he would have to as 2@C was not forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: now claim 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: now you can shorten matters cricri|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 7 looser|pg||
nt|ritong: east is the probable declarer, dude  you can wait til the board is over to say " heyy i ve got some @s values"|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@S being Qx is key now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tokay1975: 100  sayi yazar giderdik biz|pg||
nt|gracelin: thedenial|pg||
nt|andy_h: W will duck a heart, in the (off?) chance that S has preempted with 7 of them and diamonds don't break - then he can take finesses into the non-danger hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: in @H suit|pg||
nt|pelu: but even if u find @HJ u have problem with @H6|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 is safe........|pg||
nt|athene: well, when you lead to KQ10, it's normal for a defender over you to duck with Ax(x)|pg||
nt|athene: to induce the misguess next time|pg||
nt|athene: so|pg||
nt|athene: there's a case for saying|pg||
nt|mariner1: you can play 2 high @H and then hook for the 9@H...... not that easy to set up|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead to the king and the ace is played|pg||
nt|pelu: u can - if u are very unlucky - lose 3 @H-tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: and not intuitive at all|pg||
nt|athene: you should play the defender for AJ rtight|pg||
nt|athene: *tight|pg||
nt|athene: because with Ax(x) he wld have ducked|pg||
nt|athene: but it's certainly a very tenuous argument|pg||
nt|athene: anyway there is more to it here because you are worried about the fourth round of hearts as well as the third round|pg||
nt|athene: east has said his all here|pg||
nt|athene: with doubleton heart and @CQxx, then he might have a 6@C bid|pg||
nt|pelu: but id u play @Hs from top then u have a finess for @H9!|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a @C - |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|MolvaM: son 5 borda giriyoruz|pg||
nt|kastan88: Now South had to decide to leave 3@S doubled or look for minor contract (that he mentioned with good-bad 2NT)...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think is not a classical good / bad NT|pg||
nt|lokaty: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kastan88: yes, but similar their|pg||
nt|kastan88: *there|pg||
nt|elbec: manno is pitching too often today|pg||
nt|pelu: when no "safe"-play in @H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: just claim the reds :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 7 tricks now,  does he mess around or just take his 7?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two very modern doubles|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 4 now I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (Refresh Often)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: ty !|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he claim too|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: i must say i am very impressed in general with the quality played by all these juniors|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior bridge nowadays is good!|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm lost my bet :(|pg||
nt|tomi2: but sikora will find the @DQ anyway so i was kind of right|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora can't be sure that partner has four trumps, otherwise he knows the only problem was trump Q and he would find it.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Spade loser goes on a @D so this is as good as 3NT as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra2: who leads from qxx?  or x of @C on this auction |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they are thinking and I'm sleeping (a little bit) :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: maybe he wants a sacrifice, the vuln is just right for that:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: after he told himself what to lead, he doesn't|pg||
nt|ritong: pity|pg||
nt|gulyas: so its a push|pg||
pc|d5|nt|charles_l: if i D then 4@h i expect W to move with @sA and @hQ10x|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kastan88: good play from West here, he must put declarer under pressure at once, another way dias will be thrown on good hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit more aktivity at the other room so X came natural|pg||
nt|ronpa: same block here and now declarer has to decide -1 or -4|pg||
nt|elbec: ducking|pg||
pc|hK|nt|usla: after 3 @C pre W hand count what tricks?|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can ask:) Was a hard one|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: so % clubs better over 1spade?:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: '5 clubs'|pg||
nt|ronpa: *-2 or -4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|poohbear: 3 NT would have depended on North's choice of leads|pg||
nt|mariner1: and maybe 5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can he get the hearts right now that they have not forced dummy - first declarer has to play spades and if South ducks first or plays 3rd club declarer doomed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: when his partner doesn't raise spades, and opps go for 3nt, west knows there's no future in spades|pg||
nt|athene: hence the heart lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The @C10 surely showed the @C9, so East could have overtaken  |pg||
pc|c9|nt|ronpa: I think that after J@C West would do much better by playing 8@C|pg||
nt|pelu: now it is safe to take @DQ - can ruff the 4. @h with @cQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: actually declarer cant even make on a diamond return|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra2: making waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay  too many |pg||
pc|dA|nt|rayhaa: 3dwn|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tomi2: North was squeezed in this trick|pg||
nt|mamos: oh lets mess|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead "to see dummy" might give away a crucial tempo in some layouts, allowing declarer to get his @SJ10xx or so set up|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: yes the @H was in fact a good try|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 2 imps, w managed to end up controlling both minors.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: Prob gets it right but his partner might not on a low @c lead. Might play the 10 . SHOULDNT since declarer is marked for the jack when he doesnt play Q|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: entry gone now and N has 3@C so no 6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|athene: wasted a dummy entry if he was going to cash the @HQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: declarer escaped with -1, it seem|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
mc|8|nt|charles_l: making?|pg||

mb|4C|nt|jtr: Our appreciation to the USBF for their co-operation in allowing us to broadcast this event.  And particularly to Jan Martel who has been instrumental in the organisation.  |pg||

nt|raghavan: should be in 4H or 3NT|pg||
nt|davidb: E can find a way to 10 tricks if not playing all spades |pg||
nt|kaapo: The Latvians made 3NT on  13 so the gap got smaller there|pg||
nt|kaapo: And they found 6@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: So now we're where we began: 0-0|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might end up at 3@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5 more boards|pg||
nt|santyclz: E, I mean.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Denmark in 3N on 15 Closed Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: we are Closed Room :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Maybe it was to tough to play another @c there, now she is 3 down, but remember that S do not know she has 4 @h tricks|pg||
nt|rayhaa: with @ds and @s wideopen shd cash out for a push|pg||
nt|charles_l: a close match|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 1N I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: are you undersaying that it used not to be ?:)|pg||
nt|othered1: trump leads at 5-level, like at small slam, better be right, since you seldom have lots of time to change your plans|pg||
nt|andy_h: Netherlands trying to pile up the small plusses|pg||
nt|andy_h: They need whatever they can get|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Too late for that now :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe higher if they use 2@C as 18-19|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: well 3N did make in Open Room, its not a lay down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D shows a major suit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe it better nowadays than it used be say 20 or 30 years ago|pg||
nt|ritong: mm..|pg||
nt|hedyg: remembering your junior days Henri?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: at this table they play a very good and NATURAL bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhat|pg||
nt|yuval10: N passed here, might be significent if EW will bid to 4@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Yes. That says unblock please. 10 says dont unblock|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4 @h seems ro depend on right guess in @s|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: it's all very well to double these artificial bids to show "cards"|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: he will find a nice dummy.....|pg||
nt|h bertens: is this a world record dummy puting?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@D might show the fit?|pg||
nt|h bertens: must be close|pg||
nt|h bertens: he cannot stop below 5@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w likely to take out insurance |pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: but the critical thing is what your subsequent actions mean|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2nt?|pg||
nt|kaapo: If East had opened 1@S, that is|pg||
nt|charles_l: i hate arguments at the table|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean?|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 1@s in the OR helped the Italians to bid to the easy 3NT|pg||
nt|ronpa: when north fails to cover 8@C I think East will get the message|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like a slam you want to be in if the @H finesse is on, and you want to stay out of it if it fails|pg||
nt|gulyas: since its on, you want to bid it:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not a bad score for france to make 2 @s in OR|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sensational result where they played 4Hx here- in OR N/s voluntarily bid to 7D |pg||
nt|sten: and Israel is second|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4. Italy  - 5. Dutch    -    Germany are now fighting for the the 4. place|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: is a new suit forcing or non-forcing?|pg||
nt|athene: if you haven't discussed these things, you are often worse-off after the first double|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: but internet is a gigantic booster, nowadays|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX showing Hx in @s?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: gencler uyanik akarken dolduralim diyorlar|pg||
nt|gracelin: poland might score another game swing here.  Tough for NS t reach 4H after the 1NT response|pg||
nt|gracelin: North plans to bid H then spade to show his 3-suiter|pg||
nt|tomi2: I like Zatorskis 1@H bid, he is the player who bids 3 card suits and underleads aces more often than me :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: and let south decide the final contract|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'm not a fan of 1NT openings on 5M-4m hands|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!|pg||
nt|capercliff: nice 4@h here but not a claimer|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S must be @c's|pg||
nt|athene: EW have all the ingredients for 6@D here, except for @DA@HA :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: whenever i dbl with W my pd rebids 4@h|pg||
nt|mamos: wrong vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops had the vul wrong |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Norths big hand has been devalued a little by the 1S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south can raise to 3H when already denied a 4-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!|pg||
nt|lokaty: 2@S:)?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might as well bid 7, then|pg||
nt|santyclz: N needed to cash the @hs first with a @s entry to s to make the 2nd overtrick.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphztr: very good players here|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would take 2@S here as showing values|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2S might show a minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I wonder what 1@S is|pg||
nt|yuval10: already starts very interesting, 1@s perhaps one long suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think it is suction perhaps: @c or @h and @d|pg||
nt|henryb: a good small slam. a bad but making grand|pg||
nt|mamos: i prefer 4@D if it is available to show Diamonds if you bid 4@H p will almost certainlyb bid 4@S  even 3@d might work better|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can South bid 3D now- |pg||
nt|rodal f: Need an obvious X|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can north bid 3D now- I exoect it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: S  is very guite today  NV 2H is ok|pg||
nt|davidb: 5 D is makable still (club 3-3 ) |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it certainly is. Juniors are much more exposed to international bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: being able to watch almost all of the best play on the planet everyday or so is unvaluable for these youngsters|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: pass at 1 sp rdbl?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Many Swedes play what they call "Häxan", which is a close relative to Gazilli|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@S-1NT-2@C would not be natural|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2NT!= transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and N decided to leave it which must indicate that he has many @s's|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, I have to go, have a good one, and check out Hungary leading the Schools event:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this looks lika 5 IMP to france and rhen we have 27-27|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good hand for Polish Club (or nay strong club, really) - being able to stop in 1NT on hands like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's alerted.|pg||
nt|othered1: Things are extremely friendly for a @H game here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a funny board|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=11&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best contract.|pg||
nt|lokaty: bye|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bye Daniel, see you later|pg||
nt|ritong: start was automatic, the tough part is coming nox|pg||
nt|ritong: now*|pg||
nt|ritong: @dAQ look bright, i d try 4NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I have adopted a new method: 1@d-1@h-2@s is either a strong jump shift or a good heart raise to free up 1@d-1@h-3@h for hands like|pg||
nt|ritong: "no batteries included" as our friend john stewart uses to say|pg||
nt|mariner1: those are some fairly important ingredients :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: this is bidding without thinking ahead, you better bid 5@H directly and play slam oppositte 2 keycards|pg||
nt|mariner1:  W will have to think about his return|pg||
nt|mariner1: or might he duck here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or 3@D?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now- south has enough for 5D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but 4D is expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: sistemlerinde 5 li h dengesiz davet|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2pik tek mi gösterdi?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: sanmam  2sp davet edicem birazdan gibi biseydi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dengesiz olduðunu gördüm de daveti geremedim daha.  bakýyorum|pg||
nt|eerbil: bence 2nt kýsalýk sordu, 3@h de pik kýsa demek|pg||
nt|ozgull: 8 puan olunca zaten zon diyorlar:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not necessarily at these colours. North could pass with anything NV vs Vul|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could get 500|pg||
nt|ronpa: good dbl by south, this will be painfull|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: -1?|pg||
nt|charles_l: its never productive and gives oppo confidence|pg||
nt|athene: east's 2@S-then-3@H shows both minors and short hearts i assume|pg||
nt|mariner1: makes lots of NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: best lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: then 3D sign-off, unless north has extra.|pg||
nt|gracelin: looking at thse NS hands, I am not sure I want to be in 4H|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then you should not think that long|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: amazing:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The other room are in 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: no overcall in OR by N|pg||
nt|mamos: anyway 5@S is safe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and if so North shouldpass|pg||
pc|s7|nt|raghavan: gets a OT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Parhaps that fact made East think it's better to open 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C, @H, 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: you are a little bit worried on a heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: could be nasty if the @HA is wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: need both Aces wrong|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: I don't really know their system, all speculating.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this time partner has a prime hand, but every time he bids a game with a worse one and it makes, opps call TD and claim that thinking long for bidding 2@S suggest more then really ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: minimum|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mariner1: J@C coming down is key here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hayýrlýsý|pg||
nt|tokay1975: koz cýkýsna  3h olmaz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: delikanlý adam koz çýkmaz|pg||
nt|eerbil: gördüðümüz kadarý ile @d rua normal atak :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet @DK þablon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as long as they are undoubled|pg||
nt|henryb: @sAxx, @hAQxx @d Kxxxx @c x|pg||
nt|rodal f: Must be wrong after the trancfere by 1@H for @S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Norths hand was not as good as it looked from the moment that East bid 1spade and 5D looks a poor contract on the e-w bidding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|poohbear: nice spot for NS|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt  iyi aslýnda  bati dusunebilir 3nt demeyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: herhalde benim tahminim gibi deðil anlaþmalarý, çünkü öyle olsa erdem 3nt derdi|pg||
nt|begse: 3nt düþünmeli mutlaka|pg||
nt|tokay1975: herhangi bi davete o el 3nt dusunebilir|pg||
nt|tokay1975: cokda onemli diil ne daveti 6li h davette olsa|pg||
nt|gracelin: Indeed, and screen doesn't help here. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not a double to be proud of|pg||
nt|ronpa: -2 from top but if north tries a sneaky low @H it will turn to -1|pg||
nt|poohbear: No guess for the @c as West  known to have 2 aces and is a past hand|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a killer|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: why give the show away?|pg||
nt|henryb: somehow one ought to be able to come closer to slam on these cards|pg||
pc|s4|nt|charles_l: luckily only OTs at stake|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: the normal CQ lead will beat this|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off|pg||
nt|elbec: manno is a very serious player but sometimes is a little bit nervous... i'm sure he feels the pressure...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|begse: ne olsa 3nt demek ya kendi lövem var ya kör tutuyorum demek|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: & 4 the girls: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=734&qroundno=12&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best spot from Simonsen I belive, but need to find the 10th|pg||
nt|yuval10: not at all...but appearently was hopping that P can deliver at least 1 trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will know south has trump tricks - bet he just cashes @HA|pg||
nt|mikael_w: down to 4 IMP now :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h9|nt|tomi2: i think a cross ruff and later exit might help|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see 11 tricks, but declarer is looking for the safest 10|pg||
nt|ronpa: we will soon find out|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ozturk should have played his most discouraging @H|pg||
nt|ronpa: well he can see AKQ@S in dummy like us but lets see if he resists the temptation of low @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: should have denied a @h trick here|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Barry, i am too slow :(|pg||
nt|ronpa: anything but low @H will lead to -2 even a spade|pg||
nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think he should try another club promoting partner's mid @D cards having A@H as entry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Insteed of 2@H I feltit better by a new opening. Or Victor and Sten?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tokay1975: evet|pg||
nt|tokay1975: cevapci hala 4h der isterse|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might still make this with a cross ruff line and some intereesting ending|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Emma can and probably should make it after she has been told that spades break 5-0|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphztr: Bob claim: "tutti frutti" :)|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe even bid 4@d over 3?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: he can do that now|pg||
nt|charles_l: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|poohbear: now declare will play @ds|pg||
nt|tokay1975: karo bi onor icerde splerde ar  iyi yerde olunca  defansda 3sp 1cl 1dia alamiyor  birazda sansli|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ama ille  zon oynicaksak bari iyisini oynayalým|pg||
pc|d6|nt|poohbear: ruff a @s cross to a @c  claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: highest @H for @d|pg||
nt|mamos: might have been messy if Spades 3-1 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|begse: ama zaten 7 puanlýk el pas diyecek bi el|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not enough minerals :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: I ve heard the explanation from the Italian kibitz, that 2 sp was either 6+@H 11-15 or 5@H4@S.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not a hand to play trumps |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|MolvaM: bu her elde zona gitme sistemi seyir açýsýndan fena olmuyor|pg||
nt|kaapo: "häxa" is a witch, by the way :)|pg||
nt|mamos: nonsense talking to myself|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: would @c back have promoted the J@s?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þimdi 2 kör oynuyor olsalardý herkes uyuklayacaktý|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|nt|raghavan: well played young man|pg||
nt|kastan88: still 2 tricks away for declarer and push|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|tokay1975: abi ben bu elle davet etsem sizi bana 3 ay bric oynamama  cezasi gelirdi:=))))|pg||
nt|begse: kolay gelsin genclerimize  tebrikler |pg||
nt|elbec: at the moment there are 4 teams from second to fifth place in only 3VPs!|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't really see why E had to open on his meagre collection oppisite a passed partner, vulnerable |pg||
nt|elbec: NS encourage with the odd and play reverse count (high low odd)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphztr: oh my god shes going so fast|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: her collection, sorry|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: that's weird...|pg||
nt|poohbear: Really unlucky for East.  When he first looked at his hand after his partner opened one spade he would have been thrilled to know he was getting dbled in 3@ds|pg||
nt|ronpa: sure|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Now Cilla will make rhe right guess for sure|pg||
nt|charles_l: hm|pg||
nt|elbec: tilted|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: oops, manno again nervous|pg||
nt|charles_l: NS need to snap out of it|pg||
nt|elbec: how much catalin?|pg||
nt|charles_l: strip  squeeze|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu elden kaybedeceðiz ama bir sonraki el çok güzel bi skor geliyor bizim için|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hayal gucumuzu zorlasak  nasil davet edelim diye hadi dicem   ar109x  h olsun bari eldede hic bi ozellik yok|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: what is going on|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ronpa: he made 6 tricks alone in his hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer trying to get as much info as possible|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
