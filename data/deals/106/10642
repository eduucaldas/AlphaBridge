nt|idblu: playing for @D's to split|pg||
nt|sharynr: seem to have reached par|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe a michaels type bid by Robert|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: We lost all the kibitzers here at the break. |pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c 11-15 points 6+ @cs|pg||
nt|idblu: I guess the paint dried///|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3nt or pass, Karen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to this semi-final match of spingold, 32 boards to play|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|poohbear: 3@c both majors|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@ds natural not forcing. I imagine they use 3@ds to force in !@ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think the best bid is for North if/when it comes back to him?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you better hope it does|pg||
nt|kareno: The other match is much closer - only 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sharynr: interesting DBL|pg||
nt|kareno: I bid 3nt in hopes my diamonds are going to be useful.  You can't really thread the needle with four decent hcp.|pg||
nt|sharynr: i agre|pg||
nt|kareno: Cohen says, 'find my suit.'|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree*|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|poohbear: 4@d by mittelman created a force|pg||
nt|idblu: and this is 50+1|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s is a fit-showing bid.|pg||
nt|kareno: And that would be a spade is my guess.  Shortest of south's suits.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|daman: on this auction   declarer might go wrong in the @S suit|pg||
nt|kareno: North is warned!|pg||
nt|idblu: won't stop him tho|pg||
nt|kareno: He hasn't got a trump to lead!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I mean that the in-person kibitzers have left, by the way.|pg||
nt|stewball: a 2@d opener may have gotten NS too high |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not sure why Mittelman chose to force . This will go down 1 or 2 depending on @ss|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lack of entries |pg||
nt|sharynr: Passell does well to takeout|pg||
nt|stewball: but i expect they dont have that club in their bag|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: looks like 200|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...|pg||
nt|kareno: They may wander back.|pg||
nt|sharynr: and buys well, too|pg||
nt|kareno: So Cohen scares them out of 3nt into a making partscore. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is way too high obviously|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphu6: The pairs have agreed to play it undoubled|pg||
nt|kareno: So he was allowed to simply pass, much more sensible on the auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The director has allowed the agreement|pg||
nt|kareno: And a sportsmanlike solution by the players.|pg||
nt|idblu: very honourable|pg||
nt|idblu: active ethics|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes|pg||
nt|idblu: once again showing their class :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: b|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kareno: Here we can see that the margin is 50 or so and the boards are clicking by.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz:  "I can't wait to see this."|pg||
nt|idblu: this may make 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Director call coming up|pg||
nt|idblu: the hole is getting deeper|pg||
nt|kareno: I just commented to my housemate that it is close to making six.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen wrote "S+D" to explain 2@S, but Shermer thought it was "5+D"|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, that could change Schermer's mind about the double.  |pg||
nt|idblu: Larry needs penmanship lessons|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe he should have been a doctor.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: It also might change his mind about the 3@S bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi all|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|sharynr: duplicated distribution, else might even make 5D!|pg||
nt|stewball: well the 1@d overcall worked even better|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@D would make if the defense doesnt find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the most obvious double, but well judged|pg||
nt|stewball: far from obvious|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's true!!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphu6: great guess |pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharynr: wonder if Berk would find the @S10 lead|pg||
nt|kareno: A point for the specs.  3@s was only competitive.  North could have bid 3@h as a game try.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: Cohen trying for an uppercut but south's trumps too weak.|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|c35|st||md|1SAQJ9632HTDKQ6C63,STHAKJ973DT94CJ95,SK754HDAJ2CQT8742,S8HQ86542D8753CAK|sv|e|nt|kareno: Well a ten is a pretty big card but I suspect that's what he would lead.|pg||
nt|sharynr: how unusual, back to back 130's|pg||
nt|sharynr: oh i thought 1st was 130.....wrong |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks to me that Sontag bid 4@S immediately (and confidently) because he felt hw would have to bid it anyway over 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Good evening, everybody!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Bill, Martin!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Ed and Bill|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: So the match slips further into Meltzer's hands.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: 4@h will make here because clubs split, hearts split too :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also EW profiles have not been updated|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: Helness is surprised at that splinter ... even more surprised when he discovers it's a void!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|poohbear: 1C 16+ 1D neg|pg||
nt|poohbear: 0-7|pg||
nt|kareno: But it only makes if you can bid it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Dubinin is surprised at that splinter ... :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I guess 4@S is not necessarily a splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4@S is not exactly a splinter, and at this point they are getting over their surprise|pg||
nt|othered1: At that level it should be pretty specific, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps mainly a "good raise to 5@H"|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Vugraphu6: The director thanked the table for their sportsmanship.|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: we should see 2@s pass or correct from North|pg||
nt|sharynr: but prob nnever mentioned|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the main issue will be should helness show his side feature|pg||
mb|5H|nt|poohbear: can stand to compete no matter what partner has|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: dbl shows values|pg||
nt|poohbear: within the 0-7 context|pg||
nt|kareno: And nobody has a double :)  |pg||
nt|stewball: i expect neither N or S would have gotten to that game with thier regular partners|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: you can also blackwood to find out whose hand it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 100 honors this trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, Freddie, honours :)|pg||
nt|idblu: ty....please use spellcheck...and the Queen's English|pg||
nt|stewball: close decision here for N n/v|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm ... what will Alan do?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|bjacobs: I think he might try 6@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: now he needs to find the @c Q|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time they got it right, auction could have died at several points|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: asuuming  the def plays @hs that is|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's right in that his void covers one of the missing aces ... but the patient will die|pg||
nt|othered1: will west risk a @H lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no clue which minor to lead, so he might|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He knows North is void in hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does he?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nothing else could explain 6@S, after South signed off after Blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: Doiuble, I'm told, says "don't lead @H."  Not sure I agree, as it might be EW hand and double just to stop partner from bidding one more|pg||
pc|cJ|mc|11|nt|ahollan1: Zmudzinski did NOT open Berk hand|pg||
pg||
qx|c36|st||md|2SA73HQ8DQ982CAQJ7,S95HKJ54DKJ4CK965,SKQT42H93D763C432,SJ86HAT762DAT5CT8|sv|b|nt|stewball: well i guess he got it right..:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: z's approach lets him declare 3@D|pg||
nt|sharynr: bd 2, 3NT was doubled and played in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: "...and pitch a club on the diamond."|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Double certainly suggests to lead something other than hearts (Lightner).  West showed his individuality with @CJ|pg||
mb|1H|nt|poohbear: strong|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt likely by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so bd 3 will be another Lynch pickup|pg||
nt|sharynr: nice @C fit|pg||
mb|d|mb|2N|nt|kareno: So a nice pickup for Lynch.  Great decision by Mike Passell to get out of that contract.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: helness will balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs in this room are playing Precision - but with their own unique twists|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd try a negative double as east.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: hey Guiseppe|pg||
nt|stewball: undo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this needs to be fixed|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: was 2@S by south i think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idblu: dbl here works well|pg||
nt|idblu: missed opportunity|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I was thinking, 'just one more double.'|pg||
nt|kareno: Close but won't make 5@d.|pg||
nt|kareno: ..... probably :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually with clubs 3-3 and Kx of diamonds in west ... yes, makes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Wasn't there a support double in there?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|me argent: ah well:(|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt is the better contract|pg||
nt|me argent: better bonus plan|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...shouldn't be a problem....getting there the tuff part|pg||
nt|idblu: but looks like they are on their way|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|sharynr: i agree Karen|pg||
nt|stewball: a bit off W didnt try a forcing defence|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|idblu: oh well|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|Vugraphu6: these hands have been so exciting that a kibitzer fell asleep and was snoring|pg||
nt|daman: that was Joey|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz had another kibitzer wake him up|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|idblu: the fat lady is getting ready|pg||
nt|kareno: 12 boards and over 60 IMPs ... yes indeed, it's all but over.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The kibitzers are back in force|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c6|nt|stewball: odd|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Operator, there's a problem here with the BBO setup.  The tables aren't linked|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: These minor suit hands are very awkward to bid after openinga strong @c|pg||
nt|me argent: good switch|pg||
nt|daman: will Robert cover the @S Queen?|pg||
nt|me argent: in time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing defense would actually have helped, he is doing it himself|pg||
nt|stewball: seems so|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surest way to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|sharynr: that was tough to do, who should?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|sharynr: sorry that was meant for Kib|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: best to shutdown after this board to fix the linking :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|idblu: @S9|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer is unlucky that the short hand is ruffing here|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: hey Freddie|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idblu: Hi Geo..all :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think so - not that I'm an expert in these matters.  But it's what Roland would say|pg||
mc|7|nt|fabsayc: also i believe scores are reversed|pg||
pg||
qx|c37|st||md|3SAKT873H5DK97C976,S2HKJ864DAQ2CKQ85,SJ96HAQ3D43CJT432,SQ54HT972DJT865CA|sv|n|nt|daman: loos like 2@S for NT on a NT auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz:  "I'd appreciate more trump next time, in case anyone is asking."|pg||
nt|daman: looks*|pg||
nt|idblu: there seems to be a big Canadian rooting section in the gallery :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at both tables|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: okay after this hnad though im in the middle of it okay|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: hand|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|poohbear: strong NT and transfer seq got NS to 2@s in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: just a few|pg||
nt|me argent: mostly comentating|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|daman: only proper|pg||
nt|poohbear: thought this was Bridge and not Lacrosse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st of what will probably be many catchall 1@D openers showing 2+ and  11-15|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
mb|3H|nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@d is just a burp in their system, showing some sort of (usually ragged) opening bid.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's a burp because it says nothing about diamonds for the most part.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: no worries|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kareno: Good night all from Silver Spring MD near the DC National site.|pg||
nt|idblu: 3/4 scores available at   http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2009/02/spingold/|pg||
nt|idblu: gn Karen :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a faint chance of making now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Mittelman unlucky to find more than half partner's hand in the red suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will need to guess spades to make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: can he just lose 3@S tricks?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|daman: picking up the @Cs?|pg||
nt|idblu: thats the key, and pick up the @C's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but after dubinin shows up with all the red cards, that should be easy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|poohbear: and he still has a shot|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz got up to kibitz another match.  I hope they're not playing the same boards.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very unpleasant for West, but he must play this like a beginner ... finessing|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|stewball: ths will simply things|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: So this will depend on south's view of the spade suit.  Probably won't make if they continue with diamonds now.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: west trying to protect his spade holding.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|poohbear: I am sure there will be a comment about opening leads by EW who are not noted for their brilliant ones :) LC mkaes fun of themselves  often in this department|pg||
nt|idblu: doubleton K onside, or dub 10 offside , or K10x onside|pg||
nt|idblu: pick your poison|pg||
nt|idblu: win 10 or lose 6....|pg||
nt|kareno: And now he has two natural spade tricks no matter how they are played.|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure how the K gains over low there|pg||
nt|stewball: unless pard has 5 little|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems like another case where udca gains|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|stewball: hey joe|pg||
nt|stewball: its taking Gromov a long time to play the @c Q|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: srry-- obviously my mistake-- |pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: was going to say:  Passell "down 1" -- Berk:  "are you sure?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: hit claim button by mistake|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: Hi Martin, John (and Bobby).|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|idblu: he needs all the help he canget :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: Robert will get this right I predict|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: for what reason?|pg||
nt|daman: just a feeling|pg||
nt|daman: necessity|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bias reporting|pg||
nt|daman: you sure you're from Canada?|pg||
nt|idblu: maybe Berk will lead a @C....  NOT!|pg||
nt|stewball: bizzarre sequence of plays here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: unh unh|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|daman: come on Robert|pg||

pc|s9|nt|daman: yessssssssssssssssssss|pg||
nt|daman: step 1|pg||
nt|idblu: showing your favourtism Geo :)|pg||
nt|daman: who are you rooting for Freddie?|pg||
nt|idblu: @C5 may influence him |pg||
nt|idblu: O Canada !!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen fondled the @c3 for a bit before he returned the @s7.  By now I'm sure he's glad that he put the @c3 back.|pg||
nt|daman: hhhrrrmmm    wonder what the holdup is|pg||
nt|daman: thanks for that insight Jan|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Lebi is pondering the double hook, probably?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I am an anonymous vugraph operator today; Jan is in the other room.|pg||
nt|daman: once he led the @C 7   he might have convinced himself to double hook|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any inference from non club lead?|pg||
nt|me argent: he needs 32 @Cs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: no|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: darn|pg||
