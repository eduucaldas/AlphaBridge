nt|idblu: playing for @D's to split|pg||

mb|2N|nt|daman: maybe a michaels type bid by Robert|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: We lost all the kibitzers here at the break. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c 11-15 points 6+ @cs|pg||
nt|idblu: I guess the paint dried///|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3nt or pass, Karen?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3@c both majors|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@ds natural not forcing. I imagine they use 3@ds to force in !@ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think the best bid is for North if/when it comes back to him?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you better hope it does|pg||
nt|kareno: The other match is much closer - only 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sharynr: interesting DBL|pg||
nt|kareno: I bid 3nt in hopes my diamonds are going to be useful.  You can't really thread the needle with four decent hcp.|pg||
nt|sharynr: i agre|pg||
nt|kareno: Cohen says, 'find my suit.'|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree*|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|poohbear: 4@d by mittelman created a force|pg||
nt|idblu: and this is 50+1|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s is a fit-showing bid.|pg||
nt|kareno: And that would be a spade is my guess.  Shortest of south's suits.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: on this auction   declarer might go wrong in the @S suit|pg||
nt|kareno: North is warned!|pg||
nt|idblu: won't stop him tho|pg||
nt|kareno: He hasn't got a trump to lead!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I mean that the in-person kibitzers have left, by the way.|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not sure why Mittelman chose to force . This will go down 1 or 2 depending on @ss|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lack of entries |pg||
nt|sharynr: Passell does well to takeout|pg||
pc|sA|nt|reisig: looks like 200|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...|pg||
nt|kareno: They may wander back.|pg||
nt|sharynr: and buys well, too|pg||
nt|kareno: So Cohen scares them out of 3nt into a making partscore. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphu6: The pairs have agreed to play it undoubled|pg||
nt|kareno: So he was allowed to simply pass, much more sensible on the auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The director has allowed the agreement|pg||
nt|kareno: And a sportsmanlike solution by the players.|pg||
nt|idblu: very honourable|pg||
nt|idblu: active ethics|pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz:  "I can't wait to see this."|pg||
nt|idblu: this may make 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Director call coming up|pg||
nt|idblu: the hole is getting deeper|pg||
nt|kareno: I just commented to my housemate that it is close to making six.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen wrote "S+D" to explain 2@S, but Shermer thought it was "5+D"|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, that could change Schermer's mind about the double.  |pg||
nt|idblu: Larry needs penmanship lessons|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe he should have been a doctor.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: It also might change his mind about the 3@S bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharynr: duplicated distribution, else might even make 5D!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: 5@D would make if the defense doesnt find the @c ruff|pg||

pc|s9|pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sharynr: wonder if Berk would find the @S10 lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@d is just a burp in their system, showing some sort of (usually ragged) opening bid.|pg||

nt|kareno: Last hand how many down?  1?  2?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharynr: looks like made 2 to me|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: this could be more IMPs for Meltzer -- slam missed in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: the claim there was very fast and involved a question from Berkowitz about if anyone was squeezed|pg||
nt|kit: The fact that E-W playing limited opening bids may slow West down a lot, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This hand, yes.  Being corrected.|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt best this hand.  I assume they have methods to find it.  Lebensohl of some sort perhaps.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: Perhaps East should open a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: well might speed up East :)|pg||
nt|idblu: count the voids and length...for sure 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: notice the difference in styles    in the OR   South bis 2@S over 1@S and gummed up the auction slightly|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: key now is if East can show that his shortness is really a void -- that will make quite a difference|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|poohbear: berk bid 3@h I think?|pg||
nt|poohbear: asking|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I think I got the result on board 45 right, but I'm not completely sure.|pg||
nt|kit: West won't like his hand much opposite a singleton diamond -- hard to find a 15-pointer which gins a slam if East has a stiff diamond|pg||
nt|sharynr: lebensohl start?|pg||
nt|kareno: Starting lebensohl auction.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: guess not|pg||
nt|idblu: can make 6@S here....|pg||
nt|kareno: Now 3spades to show a stopper and bid stayman.|pg||
nt|kareno: And south should bid 3nt.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: the 3@H call may have screwed E-W up -- I wonder if they will be on same page now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: bidding is accurate|pg||
nt|kit: for me, 3@S would show unspecified void, but not clear West thinks that considering his 4@S call|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: 3@h slowed down the auction considerably, and E/W both stopped alerting|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The in-person kibitzers are gone again.|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, Lebansohl is a nice, useful, convention to get you to the right contract most of the time after a preempt.|pg||
nt|sharynr: surprised that @H not mentioned at all?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: it can't cost W to bid 4@C on the way to 4@S   that will get 4@D from partner and change the complexion of the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: there is Larry saving the day|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen decided his hand was so good that if his partner had any interest he was worth a move|pg||
nt|daman: and he was right|pg||
nt|idblu: Trying to make last call at the bar...closes at 1am|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps 3@S showed 4 @H|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c might make with a trump coup.  |pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s after 2nt showed four hearts and a spade stopper.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: tough to show everything|pg||
nt|kareno: That's why people preempt :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: but will West know it is a void?|pg||
nt|idblu: think everybody needs a stiff drink at this point|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: West hedges with 5@H, a last train call|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|daman: 11 more to Meltzer   starting to run away and hide|pg||
nt|idblu: Berk and Cohen showing their class once again|pg||
nt|daman: are they ever|pg||
nt|idblu: I thought Larry quit the game a few months ago :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: There's some discussion between Berkowitz and Levi about E/W agreements over 3@d|pg||

mc|11|nt|kit: normal reopening by East -- it just doesn't pay to let opponents play at 2-level when you have some high cards and are short in their suit|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|kit: difficult for North to double, though it might be correct action -- a lot easier at matchpoints|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Just to settle things about board 14, Cohen says he could have made 6 but he made 5 :)|pg||
