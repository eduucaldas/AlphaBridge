nt|roswolf: the mini steals the contract|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|chick: 1@S is most likely a weak NT|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: There will only be recording of bidding, lead and result at this table to have comparisons available for the open room.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|udo: nice 1 NT, but EW should still reach 4 @H|pg||
nt|udo: south thinking?    cannot imagine|pg||
nt|udo: must be west|pg||
nt|udo: 2@S or 3NT with west looks ok,  East will always bid 4 @H|pg||
nt|udo: partner came in vulnerable, so...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: np, thanks for trying :)|pg||
nt|chick: I would have guessed @Ds and major preemptive|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H had good chances, but this contract might make with some skillful play|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  can make up tp 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: and need to stay out of game |pg||

nt|udo: yes|pg||
nt|udo: i prefer4@H with East, after the 2@S,,|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|nt|udo: this is more difficult as 4 @H|pg||
nt|udo: 5@h by east now ?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd have re-cued as west, agreeing @D, but that could be risky, too.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|chick: pretty interesting lead|pg||
nt|udo: what is speaking against 4@H from East after the 2@S bid ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: mp doubler     that was the danger with e/w vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: sharp double by north - an mp double|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hello - I'm back in time for another doubled contract :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztx: hi yuval|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Yuval :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: we have started with three boards ahead in the open room|pg||
nt|chick: Westman is apparently quite a slow player :(|pg||
nt|yuval10: we'll probably finish way after them though :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: i think so|pg||
nt|yuval10: Ramquist has a reputation of a slow player, some kibs suggested|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: west now calls because of use of time already|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: it's actually Westman being very slow|pg||
nt|udo: me too|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|othered1: but once east chose to bid 3@D, I think 5@D is iffy.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Good shot, West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can play it in certain club games in Denmark, but no-one does any more|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: another highly distributional hand|pg||

mb|3D|nt|lestergold: indeed that would be the only way i can see of tyhje hand going neghative for n/s|pg||

mb|3S|mb|4D|nt|yuval10: probably 4@s from W|pg||

nt|vugraphztx: Save = sac, which is not a typo :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: double = spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: very feisty 5@C is in the picture as well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am not a fan of the competitive double with 6-5 - I think one should simply bids one's suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It is not competitive, it shows spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S would show clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But if double is equivalent to bidding spades, that is very clever|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a double by west of 4s to alert partner that he can ruff something?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: never getting @H into the auction may work both ways for NS. Probably won't find lead, but they are in the wrong strain|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: so he has shown spades and clubs and a good hand. Fine description|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you the force before the hearts established will be a little awkward to handle|pg||
nt|othered1: if the double says that it might be worthwhile, but where are you finding more tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but two rounds of trumps andthen play on hearts should leave declarer in control|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure I'm prepared to see the blue card put down|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: very risky could attract a redouble and be unbeatable however pard did raise vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: this unfortuantely is now a weak defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably playing his opard for something like qx in hearts and a misguess|pg||
nt|lestergold: not knowing about declarer's 5 hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: so an imaginative shot but no joy today|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   an excellent contract to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have got there|pg||

nt|lestergold: no more problems declarer in comfortable control|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|ady: n/s  sacrifice in hearts  better |pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: The advantage of the transfer double. Say you bid a natural 2@S and partner rebids his diamonds. Then you have to bid the other suit at the 4-level. This is more economical|pg||
nt|hedyg: might have if S had bid 3@h instead of 2|pg||

nt|vugraphztx: network error over here, sorry for that|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're starting to play the boards that were already played in the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h + 3 was the score for Masd.|pg||
nt|yuval10: +200|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: something wrong with the score now, it has been reduced|pg||
nt|sybarra: so  @D for e/w and some @H for n/s |pg||
nt|lestergold: So Yellow will be in serious troub le if they fail to flatten this board|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|lestergold: need to identify the double fit in spades and diamodns to bid this slam with confidence|pg||
nt|othered1: it is an excellent slam.  Let's see if their methods get them there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may not be pretty|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|othered1: On a good day, you make 5@H with the NS cards.  Today's not good, however|pg||
nt|sybarra: and eveything off for n/s |pg||
nt|othered1: They seem to get into a relay structure pretty quickly|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|lestergold: yes it is great slam and looks highly biddable but not so easy when you are only looking at one hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|*|nt|lestergold: needs good bidding to reach it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: indeed and any slam attempted by n/s will be difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Need to get 800 to compensate for their game, though|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|othered1: I think west showed @S with his opening and then has responded to relays|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|othered1: Why did east pass 2@D?  does west show a 2-suiter including a major?|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely a push dont you think>? |pg||
nt|sybarra: not usre n/s can stay of 4 |pg||
nt|othered1: In the last set west opened 1@H on something like KQJx, xxx, xxxx, xx and they got to excellent 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: After a strong NTopening, very unlikely to stay out.|pg||
nt|othered1: Vulnerable the game is good enough, especially if you'll rarely get doubled when you're going down a couple|pg||
mb|3D|an|*|nt|vugraphztx: I was told they play strong 1@C opening and the rest of their 1-levels are 4 card transfers|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|Walddk2: Last board for Hedy, Liz, Geoffrey and David. Thanks all, much appreciated!|pg||

nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: ths all |pg||
nt|roswolf: looks at least -4 perhaps -5|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to switch to @H when pd plays his smallest cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a big swing for "Ywllow"|pg||
nt|yuval10: Yellow rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: 10 imps, perhaps on their way to the finals|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: current score 108-116 for Yellow|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|an|*|nt|othered1: wonder if east is still looking for 7?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Doubt it after such a long relay auction|pg||
nt|othered1: any idea what information either E or W has at this point?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: E knows W has 4(+) @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: And presumably W knows E has fit lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|sybarra: they powered right to 4,  not sure X is that easy |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: I do recall that, when west opened the 6-count 1@H, he rebid 2@D over 1@S.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Ok, the methods here haven't been very effective.   Without detailed notes, impossible to see who (E, W or the system) went wrong here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@H   for n/s  could make |pg||
nt|hedyg: not at all obvious that 6@h makes |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|yuval10: if he makes 11, then it's 10 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: he played @H to the 10 first time so made 11 tricks (missed that because of network error)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and it's 126:108|pg||
nt|othered1: It isn't.  That's why the odds for the vul game are relatively pure.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: cash @D   discardf club|pg||

nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|othered1: on the other hand, in open room they didn't do much exploration|pg||

nt|nicksan: Lead partners suit anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: I'll repeat what I said before for those who have just arrived: due to an error in the OR with the boards, we have to play 17 boards this session.  However, board 17 has not been ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: loaded into BBO, therefore we will not be able to broadcast it. We apologize for the inconvenience.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: that's some relief, but it won't be enough|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: OK, lead and three players left the table....|pg||
nt|yuval10: they aren't aware of the fact they're exceeding the time limit?|pg||
nt|nicksan: I suppose Berik might have doubled 2 D to make it clear. Anyway, they have time to get it right.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Or have they?|pg||
nt|nicksan: South will get in first, and he can't play Diamonds...|pg||
nt|lestergold: was east obliged to bid with his collection of quacks especially doubleton qx of diamonds not looking too great on south'sopening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: They're back|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like to stay at one level with these hands|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jwit: West should get this right, but perhaps East should have played the A of clubs and a small club to make it easier|pg||

nt|lestergold: ah yellow had aresult here in open|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt  and his assistants |pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Haha, I'll relay that to them :) Thank you!|pg||
nt|lestergold: about time|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|sybarra: Our appreciation to the sponsor, Mats Qviberg, and the Swedish Bridge Federation for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Carl Ragnarsson, Tomas Brenning and Carina Westlin who have ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|sybarra: here go again |pg||
nt|lestergold: lets hope that e/w here do not find a way of lattening the excellent result obtained by team mates|pg||
nt|lestergold: flattening i meant to type|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: After all from West's point of view, they are not beating the contract unless partner has KJx of clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: we need system notes |pg||
mb|2D|an|*|nt|jwit: From East's p;oint of view I should say|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D is a good spot only in danger on @C lead or horrid breaks|pg||
nt|othered1: Which board went bad in the other room, requiring the extra to be played?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Wasn't easy for East to cash @CA. What if declarer had KJ and was on a guess?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: As some/most of you may know, the other match was rather one-sided, so now the losing team, Lichtenstein, has forfeited|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: Instead of 12 they played 17|pg||
nt|nicksan: No, this won't be lat. It will bring the score to within 20 with one set to go. |pg||
nt|lestergold: west can only pass here and hope to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: It was W thinking, but there are screens in play|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie i can see no defence|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: It's not just a question of beating the contract. This is matchpoint scoring|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jwit: If declarer has the KJ, you are not beating the contract Roland|pg||
nt|jcwla: WD not to give away a trick with the lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Jon, but you don't necessarily have to beat the contract with this format|pg||
nt|Walddk2: MP is a cruel game|pg||
nt|sybarra: with lead and looking at dummy,  N is optimstic |pg||
nt|othered1: Do Ew play forcing pass here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 dims a club and a heart looks the limit for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: And after the TD made them play 12 too|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: So they played both 12 and 17|pg||
nt|nicksan: That's what the open room found out after they doubled it|pg||
nt|othered1: so the next set will have only 15 boards?|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the closed room east waited unmtil the 3 level before finding some kind of double what could west do he was pretty fixed|pg||
nt|nicksan: Or will they slip 17 back into play and hope that nobody recognizes it|pg||
nt|othered1: Next set will be boards 18-32, 17 having been played during this third set.|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: I'll enter 17 manually|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: And so will the OR operator|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|jcwla: Opening and rebidding @C's with the E hand may be "normal" but still feels blech.|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice bid by EW here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: East's hand comes up as well more than "23 points" to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he makes another move |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: but how does he know to what suit?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: surely this is a relay auction and east has an idea of west's shape and general  if not specific strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be |pg||
nt|othered1: But again, knowing exactly what west has shown would make this much more interesting to  us.|pg||
nt|sybarra: finding it most amusing the W opened that 5 count |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: Two hands in a row these methods have gotten them to great spots, better than in other room by a bunch.  So, well-done! |pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: Bas, has east described what west is thought to hold?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Probably, but I don't speak Swedish, and I can barely hear dummy commands lol|pg||
nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: *barely even|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jwit: I agree Jordan.  There are some people, myself included, who might open 1D and rebid 2C with those cards|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: has declarer really burnt a trump trick here - operator\?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|jcwla: Or perhaps rebid 1NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Sharyn Reus|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Sharyn.|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Sharyn |pg||
nt|jwit: I don't like rebidding 1NT with a stiff unless it's an honor|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|jwit: When you rebid 1NT, there is always the chance partner may rebid 2 of their major with a weak hand and 5 of the major|pg||
nt|sybarra: betting the house on @D on sire |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|c2|nt|nicksan: Even if he has, it'll come back in the end|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: so well done  on the system |pg||
nt|othered1: @S9 may have influenced west's change of mind|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We have already seen 3 members of the Danish Junior World Champions from Hamilton, Canada, in 1998. Jacob Røn is a fourth|pg||

nt|vugraphztx: God, hope not lol|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Roland!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcwla: Might be much tougher to get there if W were not dealer.|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul should tempt S to bid 5@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bruun has a tough choice here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hi there|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Heya Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting side to play 4 @S from |pg||
nt|othered1: wonder why the method seems to put the better hand in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a name for this system?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: *10 AM EST, not 12 PM, sorry. Thanks Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: guess they feel the loss of concealment is worth what they pick up in accuracy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 2@S seems  like the choice|pg||
nt|jwit: I would bid 2S, just in case partner has the hand they have.  Now 3H would get you 4H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S to the rescue?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: Don't you think the cards are very much concealed using these methods?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h will be defeated with west on lead if thats where they play|pg||
nt|nicksan: That's a heavy 1 NT bid!|pg||
nt|othered1: Even with @S lead, marked @H finesse will make this easy for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n makes on any lead even spade as we can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry snap Ed|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|jwit: Wow!!!!|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if NS have discussed auctions like this|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Blakset walking the dog on his first turn, oping that NT would be the final destination for E-W. He liked the colours|pg||
nt|jcwla: "It c-it c-it can't be."|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though we have no official score, it looks likely that the Yellow team has won|pg||
nt|yuval10: and will play Berrik in the finals of this prestigous event|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: 3 min overtime already|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks and push likely|pg||
nt|nicksan: So, all to play for in the last set, which should be starting in about ten minutes or so. |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  this is probably better than 5@c:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: will penalties be issued this time?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Not sure, ask the TD|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Who is now chatting to you, I think|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS did well to stay low|pg||
nt|yuval10: but @d lead will beat it nontheless|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S the limit, losing 1 spade, 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||
nt|othered1: That lead just simplified the hand.  Guess it was right to maneuver west into being dummy after all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so 6 IMPs to Yellow most likely|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|yuval10: @h lead would've probably save a trick here|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Heya Yuval :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer needs to duck it|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably they will be given an extension for a reasonable break|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: So, assign the blame, please|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: he didn't do well here|pg||
nt|yuval10: played too fast|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: o.O LIES! lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: hey Bas :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now he has an extra hand for a spade finesse, so perhaps an overtrick|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|yuval10: next session in 15 minutes?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: In that case 7 IMPs|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx to our operator Marc |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|vugraphztx: Something like that, yes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: now an overtrick|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yuval10: well, i'm not sure what W was trying to do here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcwla: Does it have to add up to 200% or 300%?|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer took some extra safety line|pg||
nt|yuval10: so only 12 tricks now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yuval10: we'll be right back with the 2nd session!|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: We'll be back in 15 minutes, thanks!|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphztx: Bye all, thanks for watching, they're going to play  17 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: We'll be back in 15-20 minutes, or so we hope :) Never know with EW here|pg||
