nt|jaapfr: IF one lives in Bandung one is always happy imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|super nova: Lawrence recommends x|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|super nova: and 4nt as two suited.|pg||
nt|super nova: x  = take out and your partner passes with the right hand.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|beauch: Sa pair in other room - have  reached good 6@H , but perhaps a tad lucky |pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: every reason fot that|pg||
nt|josj: for|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|beauch: me either- they must play double of 4S as penalties|pg||

nt|super nova: in these situations.|pg||
nt|super nova: 5c x  = take out.|pg||

nt|super nova: I wish the players at the other table played board 20 next. Since we know that the scores are a little bit wild. with that slam being bid going down.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|beauch: not a method i would advocate- but maybe thats why im not playing!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I play 4n as take out only because there 'tend' to be too much trouble with x = t.o as we can see it happened here.|pg||

nt|murat e: without the intervention 1nt from south was the normal contract|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mrace: Molva why cant we see the auction when click on other room result ? (specs asking ) |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|4+!H  11+|nt|drorp:  I think it's because scores were lost when both tables went down for the re-linking, we should be able to see bidding and play for the next boards.|pg||
nt|MolvaM2: because the link between tables was lost for a while and operator had to relink the 2 tables and then enter scores |pg||

nt|mrace: yes i remember that, now second one is coming :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 3 @c here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM2: the bidding was 1h-3c-6h in the other room|pg||
mb|3H|an|min|nt|murat e: nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM2: so east took the shortcut and was rewarded when south led the @sA|pg||
nt|mrace: 3 cl probably showing balanced hands 11+ |pg||
nt|mrace: and 3h after 3 dia shows minimum, if i am not wrong|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mrace: thats voidwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM2: this table goes more scientific to find a grand|pg||
nt|drorp:  yep, exclusion, still thinking on a grand slam...|pg||
nt|MolvaM2: now atalay wont lead a spade|pg||
nt|tweety1: 6 @d is a better contract in team match|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mrace: if i was him, i wld first seek for slam!|pg||
nt|MolvaM2: and declarer has to guess spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|drorp:  I'm not sure, 6@D depends on 3-2, and there is a serious entry problem (you need to ruff 2 clubs)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrace: true|pg||
nt|mrace: ooops|pg||
nt|tweety1: if @d is not 3-2  how can u make 6 @h?|pg||
nt|MolvaM2: a big swing for hendek |pg||

nt|mrace: 1 dia goes on cl A |pg||
pc|h9|nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|MolvaM2: this means he would not bid the grand even if west had shown the @sA??|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|murat e: who knows maybe this is better then bidding slam and guessing wrongly|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|drorp:  yes, this slam is surely not a must bid one|pg||
nt|mrace: maybe , but if he was not comitted to slam, exclusion is  wrong ! period !|pg||
nt|drorp:  but i don't like the way they bid here, Koca didn't know anything besides a minimum hand, there could still be 7, there could still be only 5|pg||
