mb|p|nt|april7: N should pass,S has 6-10 HP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An accurate looking contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: A normal spot but might a bit hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: NS will probably play in@C and not in @D|pg||
nt|gracelin: ater the reverse, NS will bid at least a game|pg||
nt|april7: why not slam?|pg||
nt|haans: south say NO MORE North looking for slam|pg||

pc|hK|nt|april7: S actually could bid 6@D, because without @D no slam posible,just to bad!!|pg||

nt|dburn: this is bridge, not poker|pg||

nt|vugraphu1: lol gerben, MANY players no longer in this event wishing for just one more IMP|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no I mean the last trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I would have had some use for 1 IMP here and there too|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i like david's terminology better|pg||
nt|dburn: but that @s8 was a good play, nonetheless|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it certainly forced Dubinin to burn synapses|pg||
nt|dburn: and credit to Dubinin for working it out|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this an agression test for S white red|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: playing strong @C it is easier to cope|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|imp_jan: curious how North will go from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Milgrim asks about 2@h - Gromov "both Majors"|pg||
nt|Gerben42: XX may be artificial I guess (transfer?)|pg||
nt|skollie: i think XX would've shown hearts by north|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2n now?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: jansma preditcs dbl|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|ahollan1: earlier today we saw Bertheau-Nystrom overcall 2@C showing  "at least 4/3 in majors, IF 4/3 then 5@D"|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: ok 1n |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: must be stronger than direct 1N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that was a new one for me|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, well - I guess I will never make it as a bridge player|pg||
nt|chip: N has seen his partner's favorable 1D openings before.|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: wow  Meltzer pitching 32-0 shutout  now leads by 72|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: overcalling with the South hand strikes me as risky, but if my partner bid *three* hearts, I would give him four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Jan said -- too bad we won't see the drama in Diamond vs de Knijff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|skollie: still i'm a little surprised by N bidding only 1NT|pg||
nt|chip: EW can defeat this if W is inspired enough to play diamonds before he uses his partner's spade entry.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: me too, must show this, with 9 HCP directly 1NT?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: would you prefer a dbl like Jan Jansma suggested or a plain 2n?|pg||
nt|skollie: u would want partner to bid NT, so i can understand dbl...|pg||
nt|skollie: maybe 2@S would be best - showing a inv NT hand:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: with their 4 imp spread at start of final set|pg||
nt|ritong: peacefully sailing|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chip: perhaps they play P then DBL is stronger defense (better spades)?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there has been drama everywhere|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really don't think we should complain about lack of drama here.|pg||

pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: E-W in this room rather|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|pg||

nt|harmon: well If I dont know what the contract is how shd I know whose lead lol|pg||
pc|hT|nt|imp_jan: still 5 imps to Jansa :)|pg||

nt|vugraphu1: not suprising, greco passed a long time ago...east is pondering|pg||
nt|imp_jan: simple and effective bidding in the or by moss-gitelman on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But note that Gitelman already upgraded when he opened 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: transfer response|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but these hands sure have pure fits|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|skollie: van Prooijen likes to bid Stayman with 5card major in a balanced hand - but this sequence looks better|pg||
nt|Gerben42: decision time|pg||
nt|imp_jan: depends on the range; if it is 15-17..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Verhees should perhaps upgrade again because he knows that his club suit must be worth something opposite a balanced hand|pg||
nt|skollie: do we know the range for 1NT?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: good point Ro|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: yes, it is 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: and 2@D was either TRF to @Hs or the minors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would be different if East could have a singleton club|pg||
nt|skollie: i thought so, 4Nt aggressive opp 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid from Aker would be  18-19  so 1@H carries some extra mileage|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: carries mileage???   make that baggage|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: how many more times will EW bid @S :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|me argent: now east must avoid slam|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ritong: and even the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: uh-oh  the give-em-more-room-to-maneuver DBL|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, not fair to make Aker's statement bad grammar (mine are okay) - he said "when I bid strongly"|pg||
nt|skollie: well done|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphu1: verhees: "it's just incredible" and almost showing his hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: impressive in both rooms|pg||
nt|ritong: would not get punished here, tho|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Jan - any description of Milgrim's DBL?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: No, sorry |pg||
nt|dburn: well, if 4@d denies a spade control, East won't move beyond the four level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: system description says transfer responses to 1@C can be very weak -- if not, then maybe [keyword] West would have tried reverse|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Gromov now asking about Aker's hand and Aker tells him that the 2@s bid showed 3 hearts and good values - they both seem to agree that Aker is likely to be 13(45)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-10 HCP, (5)6 @H or @S  -- no strong variants|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: There's been a little discussion about NS needing to give EW the multi defense, and Dubinin just alerted 2@d even though it was still on the other side of the screen :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: some know to call that Wagar 2@D - but most in north america call it "multi"|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: strong @C|pg||

nt|dburn: well, let's hope he doesn't lose by 1 IMP - been done before|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: South has double dummy @D holding for that EW auction|pg||
nt|me argent: 6@Cs is on a @H finess|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d is a forcing @c raise|pg||
nt|dburn: it is? crikey|pg||

mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@d prob KC|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|santyclz: And now about 200 specs are telling me why leading the @ca is "right"!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael Rosenberg pointing out that single dummy, Aker may decide to attack @S though|pg||
mb|p!|nt|imp_jan: inv sequence with 5@S?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: then north probably has another bid|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: as Greco is thinking, must be INV|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if its 17 19, maybe not|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: range is 16+ to 18 (flat)|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks like potential for more bad luck, though I suppose Verhees might lead a heart|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: in the other room, a 3-card superaccept got Ekeblad one higher than was comfi|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: greco has been very helpful in answering your questions by writing to me|pg||
mb|5S|nt|imp_jan: in the end Greco realised he was non vul|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: 18 or a VERY bad 19|pg||

mb|p|nt|scotty: This will work!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hey Michael!!|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ill bet big money that he doesnt !!|pg||
nt|dburn: although if Jansma's pass to 4@s says "lead a spade", while double would say "don't lead a spade"...|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: due to the inv sequence the contract is wrong sided|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: ...then he won't lead a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT asked for the @C Q and 5@s showed it with the @s K|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: gulp|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is the sort of deal that Larry Cohen thinks ought to be abolished|pg||
nt|dburn: 20-some IMPs on the toss of a coin|pg||
nt|poohbear: This lead will alleviate Moss's need to get rid of the 4th @h|pg||
nt|ritong: larry sometimes exposes bizarre ideas|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I can see his point|pg||
nt|poohbear: maybe they will abolish coinflips in poker as well ?|pg||
nt|ritong: but i have to say that i love it when he s dispo to commentate on BBO|pg||
nt|poohbear: then I will never be able to win|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't say I agree with his point - I just say I can see it|pg||
nt|dburn: but I do agree that he is one of the best commentators around|pg||
nt|poohbear: LOL   . I can see it now. this slam is purely on a finesse . Board is thrown out|pg||
nt|poohbear: bring in the sub|pg||
nt|poohbear: that will be declarer's new claim|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what Moss is thinking about here - not much to do but get on with it|pg||
nt|ritong: he s trying to see if he can try to steal the @s J|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4-0 trumps is the only liability|pg||

nt|vugraphu1: again, apologize for Jansa rather than Jansma, but cannot change it now :( Jan will have to forgive us|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: but, this is not the most obvious position for Jansma|pg||
nt|poohbear: Jansma might return a @d ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: then declare has a late guess|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if Jansma does play a diamond, Moss is a heavy favourite|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5-2 odds|pg||
nt|dburn: but I can't see why Jan would do that|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: just someone wake me when jan plays a card please|pg||

nt|dburn: you have the feeling that he really needs to make this, or the match is over|pg||
nt|ritong: now , two trumps routinely pitching a @h|pg||
nt|poohbear: Perhaps Verhees pitchs the 10 of @d  from Q10x?|pg||
nt|ritong: and decide later on|pg||
mc|11|nt|ritong: sigh|pg||
nt|poohbear: But moss will ask himself. Why no @h play?|pg||

nt|super nova: 68% grand approx|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see the same good bidding here? But by 2-2@C needed|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at least to The Australian Federation - BBO by all there nice people. ( Wald are at sleep) We was Bjørn and Frank from norway trying to help|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||

nt|Walddk2: if you guess it|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would play it that way based on restricted choice if an honour was played from N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you don't, you consign yourself to 40%|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: Their auction was a little mysterious, but I suppose once West 4th-suited, East was bidding a slam|pg||

nt|rodal f: And afterthe ques. 5@H = do u like ure quality at @H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to stop at 4|pg||
nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Perhaps as commented elsewhere, it is often unwise to use 4NT with weak trumps.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Thank you all. Bye now.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Are you calling for the "cone of silence"?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coincidentally Joe -- i just saw the Get Smart movie [time i'll never get back :( ]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did you know Don Adams was avid Bridge Player|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Actually, at this level most of the players are pretty good about writing things instead of saying them, and a wonderful person in ACBL services made sure the vugraph tables had ...|pg||
