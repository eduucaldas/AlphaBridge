nt|super nova: yes.. I dont understand the Auction myself.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|beauch: me either- they must play double of 4S as penalties|pg||
nt|super nova: 4s X may have been penalty.. but don tknow.. I know that Ron (who played for many years with lilley) plays basically ALL x = t/o|pg||
nt|super nova: in these situations.|pg||
nt|super nova: 5c x  = take out.|pg||

pc|s8|nt|beauch: not a method i would advocate- but maybe thats why im not playing!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I play 4n as take out only because there 'tend' to be too much trouble with x = t.o as we can see it happened here.|pg||
