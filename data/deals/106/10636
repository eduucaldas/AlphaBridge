nt|beauch: sa now in front, but still have a poor board no comparison yet|pg||
nt|super nova: then 5c 5d 6h.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|super nova: Lawrence recommends x|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|super nova: and 4nt as two suited.|pg||
nt|super nova: x  = take out and your partner passes with the right hand.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|beauch: Sa pair in other room - have  reached good 6@H , but perhaps a tad lucky |pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I dont understand the Auction myself.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|beauch: me either- they must play double of 4S as penalties|pg||
nt|super nova: 4s X may have been penalty.. but don tknow.. I know that Ron (who played for many years with lilley) plays basically ALL x = t/o|pg||
nt|super nova: in these situations.|pg||
nt|super nova: 5c x  = take out.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|beauch: lusk- deluca in other room - i suspect play 4nt as takeout |pg||
nt|super nova: I wish the players at the other table played board 20 next. Since we know that the scores are a little bit wild. with that slam being bid going down.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|beauch: not a method i would advocate- but maybe thats why im not playing!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I play 4n as take out only because there 'tend' to be too much trouble with x = t.o as we can see it happened here.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|nicksan: East in CR did just that, but I bet he didn't enjoy it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Looked silly from up here, but there is an explanation|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Still, the @D King was an...unusual play|pg||

nt|super nova: could blow the hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|super nova: Also your parnter may have a singelton.. and declarer may go 'wrong' later in the play and get a diamond ruff in defence.|pg||
nt|beauch: one of the kibbitzers was unimpressed with @h lead|pg||
nt|super nova: ok if you factor in the 13 for the last board|pg||
nt|super nova: then the scores are TIED|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|super nova: 6H -1 and 4h making 5 = 13.|pg||
nt|super nova: This could be a 2002 ANC in the making.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|super nova: If 4h is played for only 10 tricks then 1 imp loss.|pg||

nt|murat e: but really dont you think north has done enough to bid a forcing two diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||

mb|2H|nt|super nova: and he said oops. and took it back.|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: they said you cant do that put it back on the table and called the directory.|pg||
nt|super nova: When Sean came over he said 'come on leigh stop mucking around'|pg||
nt|super nova: but notice if dummy leads out of turn there can be a penalty because declarer has seen some of the dummy b4 it comes down|pg||
