mb|p|nt|kareno: They are given in other ways - limiting play with your partner for instance.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: NS play a pretty straight game     multi is their only sin |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 way stayman?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|imp_jan: dbl = major/minor|pg||
mb|r|nt|kareno: 2@h by north would be pass or correct, I suppose.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|daman: 2 wau stayman isn't weird|pg||
nt|daman: way*|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no and quite suitable on this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: usually 2@d is bid your major|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to segment 2|pg||
mb|p|an|forcing|nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@C even 3n|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: The spade jack is a good card but is it good enough?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: 6 appears to make on a double dummy line in diamond suit|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a strip endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually is not double dummy, just normal technique|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree with Rose Meltzer's assessment that it is not.|pg||
nt|kareno: The thirteenth club will be his ninth trick.  3nt might make depending on the lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This won't be easy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice easy partscore to start the day's action.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Sharyn :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi Karen|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Spades block so this will come in as it did in the OR.|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, sontag (rightfully) upgraded his card|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, south can have diamonds, no?  How do you get there then?|pg||
nt|kareno: Caitlin :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahh.. I'm told 2@c is pass or correct for a minor.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: George will make this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Helness is playing with Sontag, Helgemo unable to attend this tournament|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|reisig: I'll bet ...down 1|pg||
nt|daman: I'll bet making|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stewball: lots of talent little experience with each other|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so expect to see a lot of generic bidding|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: strip and play a @S|pg||
nt|caitlin: no entry to North hand for @DA and four spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Not much interest here.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: can finesse everything for 4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might just do that|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess Chambers thinks he needs diamonds 3-3 and a good spade guess.|pg||
nt|kareno: Helness bid 7@h operator :)|pg||
nt|stewball: a nice generic grand:)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|idblu: re all :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Freddie :)|pg||
nt|idblu: hi Karen :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: simple effective auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Instead he is taking his extra chance on the 3-3 heart break (in case the spade finesse is failing)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: btw, interesting pdship: helness-sontag|pg||
nt|imp_jan: helness usually play with helgemo for meltzer|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but i think that helgemo is banned playing |pg||
nt|kareno: And Sonty has just started a partnership with David Berkowitz|pg||
mc|9|nt|kareno: He is banned for one tournament.|pg||

nt|idblu: playing for @D's to split|pg||
nt|sharynr: seem to have reached par|pg||
nt|imp_jan: the ban will be lifted this september, at the start of the transnationals in sao paulo|pg||
mb|1S|nt|daman: maybe a michaels type bid by Robert|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: We lost all the kibitzers here at the break. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Okay making 3 and an IMP to Meltzer, first blood :)|pg||
nt|kareno: It had something to do with an event at home.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c 11-15 points 6+ @cs|pg||
nt|idblu: I guess the paint dried///|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3nt or pass, Karen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to this semi-final match of spingold, 32 boards to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: lots of private chats on this ban|pg||
nt|caitlin: nothing to do with cheating...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|poohbear: 3@c both majors|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@ds natural not forcing. I imagine they use 3@ds to force in !@ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think the best bid is for North if/when it comes back to him?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you better hope it does|pg||
nt|kareno: The other match is much closer - only 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sharynr: interesting DBL|pg||
nt|kareno: I bid 3nt in hopes my diamonds are going to be useful.  You can't really thread the needle with four decent hcp.|pg||
nt|sharynr: i agre|pg||
nt|kareno: Cohen says, 'find my suit.'|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree*|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Depends how you define that word|pg||
nt|caitlin: at cards|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Bulletin 4, page 5 it is said|pg||
mb|3S|nt|poohbear: 4@d by mittelman created a force|pg||
nt|idblu: and this is 50+1|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s is a fit-showing bid.|pg||
nt|kareno: And that would be a spade is my guess.  Shortest of south's suits.|pg||
nt|kareno: Support double.  This should play in 4@h and makes easily.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: thats true|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: on this auction   declarer might go wrong in the @S suit|pg||
nt|kareno: North is warned!|pg||
nt|idblu: won't stop him tho|pg||
nt|kareno: He hasn't got a trump to lead!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I mean that the in-person kibitzers have left, by the way.|pg||
nt|stewball: a 2@d opener may have gotten NS too high |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not sure why Mittelman chose to force . This will go down 1 or 2 depending on @ss|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lack of entries |pg||
nt|sharynr: Passell does well to takeout|pg||
nt|stewball: but i expect they dont have that club in their bag|pg||
nt|caitlin: nothing to do with cheating at cards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|reisig: looks like 200|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...|pg||
nt|kareno: They may wander back.|pg||
nt|sharynr: and buys well, too|pg||
nt|kareno: So Cohen scares them out of 3nt into a making partscore. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is way too high obviously|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphu6: The pairs have agreed to play it undoubled|pg||
nt|kareno: So he was allowed to simply pass, much more sensible on the auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The director has allowed the agreement|pg||
nt|kareno: And a sportsmanlike solution by the players.|pg||
nt|idblu: very honourable|pg||
nt|idblu: active ethics|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes|pg||
nt|idblu: once again showing their class :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: b|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can get to 6, don't see a seventh|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Sergey Kustarov|pg||
nt|dinos1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@s is not crazy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kareno: Here we can see that the margin is 50 or so and the boards are clicking by.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz:  "I can't wait to see this."|pg||
nt|idblu: this may make 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Director call coming up|pg||
nt|idblu: the hole is getting deeper|pg||
nt|kareno: I just commented to my housemate that it is close to making six.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen wrote "S+D" to explain 2@S, but Shermer thought it was "5+D"|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, that could change Schermer's mind about the double.  |pg||
nt|idblu: Larry needs penmanship lessons|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe he should have been a doctor.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: It also might change his mind about the 3@S bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mark Thiele from the Netherlands|pg||
nt|mrxxx: hi all !!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: Mark :)  Roland :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sharynr: duplicated distribution, else might even make 5D!|pg||
nt|stewball: well the 1@d overcall worked even better|pg||
nt|kareno: Not crazy and will make.  |pg||
nt|imp_jan: had something to do with matches in norway which were fixed|pg||
nt|kareno: West certainly had her invitation!|pg||
nt|po-s: no fixed  match, but a match reported though unplayed|pg||
pc|s8|nt|poohbear: 5@D would make if the defense doesnt find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the most obvious double, but well judged|pg||
nt|stewball: far from obvious|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: whatever u call it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: Yes, that's true!!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrxxx: karen :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|Vugraphu6: great guess |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharynr: wonder if Berk would find the @S10 lead|pg||
nt|kareno: A point for the specs.  3@s was only competitive.  North could have bid 3@h as a game try.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Cohen trying for an uppercut but south's trumps too weak.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, helness 4 bid was a little strange actually|pg||
nt|imp_jan: costs him a lot of money (helgemo)|pg||

nt|sharynr: how unusual, back to back 130's|pg||
nt|sharynr: oh i thought 1st was 130.....wrong |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks to me that Sontag bid 4@S immediately (and confidently) because he felt hw would have to bid it anyway over 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Good evening, everybody!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Bill, Martin!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Ed and Bill|pg||
nt|daman: maybe we shouldn't be talking about it on this chat|pg||
nt|Walddk4: good idea|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, yes, it costs him here a NABC and elsewhere I suppose.  It's all unfortunate.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|kareno: So the match slips further into Meltzer's hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 4@h will make here because clubs split, hearts split too :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also EW profiles have not been updated|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d is possible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Difficult auction after 1@S-X|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: Helness is surprised at that splinter ... even more surprised when he discovers it's a void!|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 1C 16+ 1D neg|pg||
nt|poohbear: 0-7|pg||
nt|kareno: But it only makes if you can bid it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Dubinin is surprised at that splinter ... :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I guess 4@S is not necessarily a splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4@S is not exactly a splinter, and at this point they are getting over their surprise|pg||
nt|othered1: At that level it should be pretty specific, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps mainly a "good raise to 5@H"|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphu6: The director thanked the table for their sportsmanship.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What should South do?  And then what should North do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: we should see 2@s pass or correct from North|pg||
nt|sharynr: but prob nnever mentioned|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the main issue will be should helness show his side feature|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, harder for N :) 2@h mb?|pg||
nt|mrxxx: this will probably end in a 3@h partscore, as EW most probably will compete with 2@s|pg||
nt|kareno: I really won't discuss it privately, specs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: can stand to compete no matter what partner has|pg||
nt|caitlin: nor will I|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: dbl shows values|pg||
nt|poohbear: within the 0-7 context|pg||
nt|kareno: And nobody has a double :)  |pg||
nt|stewball: i expect neither N or S would have gotten to that game with thier regular partners|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: you can also blackwood to find out whose hand it is|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S helps North in a way|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well it is good to note that a lot of people seem to have an opinion on this|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: 100 honors this trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, Freddie, honours :)|pg||
nt|idblu: ty....please use spellcheck...and the Queen's English|pg||
nt|stewball: close decision here for N n/v|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm ... what will Alan do?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: I think he might try 6@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt getting diamonds into picture, in any case at least two places to play|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|stewball: now he needs to find the @c Q|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time they got it right, auction could have died at several points|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stewball: asuuming  the def plays @hs that is|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's right in that his void covers one of the missing aces ... but the patient will die|pg||
nt|othered1: will west risk a @H lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no clue which minor to lead, so he might|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He knows North is void in hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does he?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nothing else could explain 6@S, after South signed off after Blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: Doiuble, I'm told, says "don't lead @H."  Not sure I agree, as it might be EW hand and double just to stop partner from bidding one more|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@D is a fair contract, but this is an impressive auction|pg||
nt|dinos1: interesting what wd make more problems for NS - pass or 3s by Bal?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kareno: This auction shows good clubs in east.  The club jack lead is best for the defense.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jan van Cleeff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hi folks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Zmudzinski did NOT open Berk hand|pg||
nt|mrxxx: heej Jan :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: this lead costs a trick, i think, compared to spade lead|pg||

nt|bjacobs: North was happy to defend 2@S if partner is broke|pg||
nt|bjacobs: undoubled|pg||
nt|kareno: 6nt makes and likely will be bid.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ew cold for (small) slam|pg||
nt|daman: un morceau de gateau|pg||
nt|imp_jan: brd 18 ekeblad bid and made 3n|pg||
nt|imp_jan: looks like a simple 4@s on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: z's approach lets him declare 3@D|pg||
nt|sharynr: bd 2, 3NT was doubled and played in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: "...and pitch a club on the diamond."|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Double certainly suggests to lead something other than hearts (Lightner).  West showed his individuality with @CJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: strong|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt likely by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so bd 3 will be another Lynch pickup|pg||
nt|sharynr: nice @C fit|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|kareno: So a nice pickup for Lynch.  Great decision by Mike Passell to get out of that contract.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: one Ultimate Club|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|fabsayc: helness will balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs in this room are playing Precision - but with their own unique twists|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd try a negative double as east.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South might have doubled 1@H there?|pg||
mb|2N!|an|21-23|nt|kareno: Is 3nt enough with that east hand?|pg||
nt|kareno: I wouldn't bid anything west could pass at this point.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: hey Guiseppe|pg||
nt|stewball: undo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this needs to be fixed|pg||
mb|3C|an|stayman|nt|fabsayc: was 2@S by south i think|pg||
nt|dinos1: bad @dK|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: dbl here works well|pg||
nt|idblu: missed opportunity|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I was thinking, 'just one more double.'|pg||
nt|kareno: Close but won't make 5@d.|pg||
nt|kareno: ..... probably :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually with clubs 3-3 and Kx of diamonds in west ... yes, makes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Wasn't there a support double in there?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: True|pg||
mb|3H|nt|me argent: ah well:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: 3nt is the better contract|pg||
nt|me argent: better bonus plan|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...shouldn't be a problem....getting there the tuff part|pg||
nt|idblu: but looks like they are on their way|pg||

mb|p|nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@d is just a burp in their system, showing some sort of (usually ragged) opening bid.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's a burp because it says nothing about diamonds for the most part.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: no worries|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but the last time i said that, Balicki went into a huge tank :)|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|dinos1: was 4@d KC or 4N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a faint chance of making now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Mittelman unlucky to find more than half partner's hand in the red suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will need to guess spades to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: can he just lose 3@S tricks?|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D looks pretty easy to make -- 5 diamond, 4 clubs, 1 spade, 2 hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Probably won't make six.  |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kareno: Well, clubs are good and diamonds break.  NOW it'll easily make six.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: the lead is helpful|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but the result in the or not (for team jansma)|pg||
nt|kit: add 1 club trick to my count -- now can take them all|pg||
nt|daman: sticks and circles in the other room on this hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: picking up the @Cs?|pg||
nt|idblu: thats the key, and pick up the @C's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but after dubinin shows up with all the red cards, that should be easy|pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz got up to kibitz another match.  I hope they're not playing the same boards.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very unpleasant for West, but he must play this like a beginner ... finessing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|stewball: ths will simply things|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: So this will depend on south's view of the spade suit.  Probably won't make if they continue with diamonds now.|pg||

nt|caitlin: -1100 E-W in 4@S down 5 on this board|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay a phone number :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: what a diff between the helness style and the rubin style (hellnes nevcer supported spades, rubin jumped to the 4level rightaway)|pg||

nt|kit: 4@S could result in a missed slam, but the gains when opponents do the wrong thing probably outweigh the losses|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: has to put that behind him and move on|pg||
nt|daman: maybe he was thinking of the rule of symmetry   lots of singletons on that hand|pg||

nt|idblu: Nothing going right for Schermer ....|pg||
nt|kareno: (the last hand)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|kareno: Heart lead to beat 1NT.  That would the the "Australian' lead - shorter of 5/4 suits.|pg||

mb|4H|nt|me argent: thats some pass by george|pg||
nt|daman: huge|pg||
nt|idblu: he's seen Roberts o/calls :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kareno: South saying by his bid that he would not accept any game try, hearts or notrumps.|pg||
nt|stewball: do EW play stronger NT here?|pg||
nt|dinos1: ))))|pg||
nt|kit: and to make 5@S, will have to guess queen of clubs since ace of diamonds is off|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: not to mention LCs pass|pg||
nt|idblu: they can feel it...a very tough situation to play under|pg||
nt|kareno: East checking for a 5-card spade suit in west's hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: May be moot.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|stewball: i'm told they up it in 3rd and 4th seat|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: i think i would have started with a heart with dubinin's hand, cant blow a trick :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he may need every side entry to establish the suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Since you don't expect much from pd, playing for qxxx(xx) of @c is a shot.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In theory, this should be bid to 7NT.  And it might end up that high if N/S keep bidding their suits|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@s is down with @s lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk, with any lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: verhees didn't want to bid his hand twice, ew were not put to the test|pg||
pc|d3|nt|caitlin: maybe it was up to North but with two Aces, he might have been reluctant to do so|pg||
nt|kit: South apparently judged that 5@H would go down too many|pg||
nt|kareno: So perhaps he should have bid 5@h directly :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrxxx: opening weak majors was quite popular in holland, and would have definately worked on this deal|pg||
nt|kareno: An Australian asks if I made that remark disparagingly.  In fact there is some theory that the lead of the shorter suit works and it was advanced by an Australian, hence the name.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|me argent: berk probably does not trap heavy in this situation|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's funny - N/S were mindful of the big misfit - well done!  But 4@S is not really where you want to be, looking at their hands|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, when they see the 5-0 clubs, they will be incredibly relieved|pg||
nt|kareno: To make e/w make the final decision.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|sQ|nt|kareno: two is a bad number of spades to hold when you are thinking of a save.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: The contract that I think is probably cold is 6@C|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can try that later Joe|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i agree with you karen, to bid 5@h directly|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|kareno: If west misguesses the clubs she may still be defeated by a heart shift!|pg||
nt|mrxxx: the lead is 5th giving less spaces for 2 clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: The specs all know, "eight ever, nine never"|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that 52-48 percent for the split is off when you know anything much about a hand.|pg||
nt|mrxxx: well the lead showed 5 diamonds, and missing 9 hearts makes it probable that clubs maybe were not 2-2|pg||
nt|kareno: Shift is tough for north - spade queen is alluring, so is length in hearts.|pg||
nt|mrxxx: hearts shift now is still not easy|pg||

nt|kareno: Ah, well done!!|pg||
nt|mrxxx: yes !|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Interesting comparison on board 51, where N/S missed a game ...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c-5?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, makes the 3@D contract seem superb|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still down 5 looks excessive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Take a look at their auction.  This is why Sonty's pass of 2@S (on 51) was so nicely judged|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk S shd bid 3@d over 2nd X|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On this hand, he certainly should have|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: This is safe - most he can lose now is six tricks.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but double on only 2 clubs was to say the least dangerous|pg||
nt|kareno: In the midgame, Berkowitz shifted to the spade Queen so the game was made in the OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Jansma put 4NT bid on table, his partner was happy to know that he has a maximum|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Vugraphu6: saying, if you go down on this hand with a @c lead, then you mis-bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H!|nt|fabsayc: ok we started with a backwards score here, is actually meltzer 73 lynch 55|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: yes coz he cdnt bid 1N)|pg||
nt|kareno: This is an easy 3nt so I propose a cup of tea ... (_)? ... and some cookies ... OOOO while we watch.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|sharynr: not happy with 1 KC i guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suspect West rebid 2@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the initial difference was 19, keep that in mind|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the second double|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: pushing now|pg||
nt|idblu: but needs something good to happen|pg||
nt|othered1: might 2@H have been transfer rebid?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, I shouldn't back-seat drive|pg||
nt|imp_jan: what i just said about canape was probably non sense since 1@C is strong|pg||
nt|kit: Now it may be difficult for N-S to get to 3NT -- neither partner has full diamond stopper|pg||
nt|kit: and after the now marked diamond lead, 5@C won't make|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|othered1: ditto 3@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: still I dont like pass with 17|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: relay auctions also may look like this|pg||
nt|imp_jan: there u are|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: can make 6 only on a @H lead tho|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen jokingly fingered the double card (behind the screens).|pg||
nt|idblu: will not get it|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: 1 imp for Schermer|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Schermer:  "May the gods be with you partner."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: "This is very, very pushy."|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missed the boat here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: No time for cookies - I am working on a book on the Multi|pg||
nt|kit: West will lead a diamond.  South will hopefully ruff the third round of diamonds with the jack of clubs ....|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.  So they play 5@c which is not too good with the marked diamond lead.  Even Qx of clubs in west would defeat it.|pg||
nt|kit: And West can then give declarer hope by discarding!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: north relayed and south answered|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: an imp is an imp|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think Larry could ever have played @S's here :)|pg||
nt|daman: they won by one IMP yesterday|pg||
nt|idblu: and that's the truth|pg||
nt|kit: declarer was always making with the clubs 2-2, but the shift makes his life even easier|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think Larry will go wrong on this one|pg||
nt|kit: from declarer'spoint of view, he can ruff one diamond and pitch two diamonds on the spades -- but then he has to worry about getting back to his hand if north has Jxx of clubs|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|Vugraphu6: Schermer:  "I knew this wasn't going to be very good."|pg||
nt|fabsayc: presumably those bids places west with short clubs, so Gromov gave up on slam|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West can see he is no lock for even 4@H, but that heart layout is declarer-proof|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: kit, he cant handle 3-1|pg||
nt|kit: So I think he will win 10 of clubs and play club to ace, so he can follow by ruffing high on third round of spades (if North has 3 clubs)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but he knows spades are 5-1|pg||
nt|kit: oops, sorry -- miscounted the spades|pg||
nt|idblu: on a @H hook, 3-3 @D break and 3-3 @C break|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Berk:: "Sorry"|pg||
nt|kareno: Too bad - could be very costly.|pg||
nt|dinos1: pd has in average 2@s so fit is highly probable (even 3@h on 4-3 fit)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but is partner supposed to bid 3 card suits over it?|pg||
nt|dinos1: no)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|Vugraphu6: Chambers:  "3 NT is very good..."|pg||
pc|dT|nt|idblu: a big sigh of relief|pg||
nt|daman: that doesn't work    does it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so chance of landing safely was not high|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: south showed 4@s 6@c and short @h|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: Doubly unlucky for N-S that the diamond blockate makes 3NT cold even with the bad club split|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Perhaps West should bid 4@C over 3NT|pg||

nt|fabsayc: helness has compressed a trick here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What should he have done?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: draw trumps and claim down 1|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so that brd is a potential equalizer|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think Meltzer will land up in 3N with heart overcall by East and natural 1@C initially by Meltzer|pg||
mb|3H|nt|idblu: BAM - 3-2 for Schermer|pg||
nt|sharynr: its a good partner who says "sorry" |pg||
nt|stewball: 4@c cant cost its true,,is a good partnership bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh yes - allows declarer to pitch 3 spades, and set up the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Another very difficult bidding hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But doesn't he need a club ruff?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Sontag is a big reason they are so far ahead|pg||
nt|kareno: Could be duplicated in the other room but it's potentially a slam swing to Lynch.|pg||
nt|kareno: Here I bravely predict a six spade contract for n/s ;)|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Gromov made it look easy though|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: Lebi will have to take a  view here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh trumps 4-0. my mistake|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: unusual auction in open room, sontag responding 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S from North side almost cold -- on club lead, have 12 winner.  On other lead, can pitch both clubs and ruff fourth diamond in dummy if needed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another perfect fitter|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h alert!  Xfer to 4@s by the opps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Assuming 2@S showed spades and another, 3NT possibly denied a spade stopper - Gromov trusting that hearts would look after themselves|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not look like there was a winning defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: indeed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kareno: Heart lead not the best for defense!|pg||
nt|imp_jan: what happende to brd 23?|pg||
nt|caitlin: no they stopped in 3@C|pg||
nt|imp_jan: oops, 5@C -1|pg||
nt|kareno: Won't make but it's as good as anything I guess.  Nothing makes.  Kit would you pass with north's hand?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: this should be a mild slam try|pg||
nt|kit: probably this sequence is a mild slam try -- would just bid Texas if only wanted to play 4@S|pg||
nt|idblu: if he wanted to play 4@S he would have bid 4@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: i found a pair that doesn't play 14-30!:)|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't either!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: Nor do I|pg||
nt|sharynr: as suggested may they play 14-30 over minors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: assuming they superaccept by bidding a doubleton, Berk knows Cohen is 4-3-3-3; therfore no 7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Trump lead in a flash.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And from Qxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you have to have faith|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: this won't take long|pg||
nt|fabsayc: george has minimum count, but excellent controls, not clear to pass|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with this type of hand we use to psyche 2nt or 2@S with east hand in college days|pg||
nt|stewball: back in the early days of bridge Martin?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pre sputnik|pg||
nt|stewball: are we here?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1168 of us|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i smell russian cigarettes :)|pg||
nt|kit: close, but I like 3NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|kit: Still, he is 4-3-3-3.  I think it was South who underbid some|pg||
nt|sharynr: good point|pg||
nt|kareno: I think he knows Cohen can't cover all his losers with only 22 hcp.|pg||
nt|sharynr: and why push when the HCP are not there|pg||
nt|kareno: No source of tricks.  They do play forcing club so they don't have to open 2nt on some 5/4 hands we might |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: it usually comes back by stopping a dummy ruff|pg||

nt|idblu: what would 4@H over 3@S be?|pg||
nt|kit: make another move perhaps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: something to show he has more than a "mild" slam try|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting that sontag returned a diamond iso another heart|pg||
nt|kit: East can barely afford to pitch aspade and a club on the diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: if Sontag had returned anothe heart, he might really have been squeezed|pg||

nt|stewball: i would not have done anything other than 2@s with that N hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kit: Maybe not -- ace of spades, spade ruff, heart over, spade ruff, ace of hearts, diamond to ace, draw last trump -- that's 6 hearts, 3 diamonds, 1 spade for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this double is a bit pointless|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: if South finds a trump shift, that may disrupt the entries for that plan|pg||
nt|imp_jan: when north leads a spade vs 3n by west the entree to @hq will be removed on time|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: and he has|pg||
nt|kit: no, same thing -- just win ace of hearts now|pg||

nt|daman: right Kit|pg||
nt|kit: he still has those 10 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: A polite way of putting it.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: As often happens breaking a transfer gets you to an uncomfortable level|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or a club swith will do the job|pg||

nt|imp_jan: 4@s can be made, i think|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: and 3@S i suspect was a splinter|pg||
nt|kareno: This should end quickly once Kyle Larsen plays to this trick.|pg||
nt|mrxxx: this is a very tricky play|pg||
nt|kit: but in fact he chose very well this lead really scrambles declarer's entries even with the diamonds behaving perfectly|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Declarer could plan to ruff both losing clubs.  He will need to keep out West's @D8 if he does so|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Is 6@S makeable?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a 3@C preempt by dubinin would have livened up this auction|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|fabsayc: not makeable on diamond lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: otherwise there is a red suit squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That looks correct.  On a non-diamond lead, declarer can lose a heart, and squeeze East|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Made 1@s yes?|pg||
nt|kareno: not 2?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades will win this battle, but at what level|pg||
nt|stewball: 4|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems there was misunderstanding (on 5@d bid)|pg||
nt|caitlin: by cuebidding|pg||
nt|mrace: :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sharynr: 4@h played on the 6@S hand in other room, @S never mentioned using a strong @C auction|pg||
nt|kareno: I saw the auction and wondered why north never ever bid his spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs I've asked about the number of tricks :)|pg||
nt|othered1: they won't try seriously for it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: some would be willing to rebid 3@C on South hand, giving more meaning to a 2@S rebid -- depends on partnership agreements|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you never know|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they have been too high before|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, E/W might leverage them into it ... but I think East will find the killing diamond lead, even after all that club bidding|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|idblu: should be "schneider"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Schermer and Cohen started laughing when the tray came back to them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a diamond lead and continuation after heart ducked there is no dummy entry |pg||
nt|othered1: This is a forcing pass situation, I'm sure.  South chose to do something more direct.  But does that say anything about @D?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No more room for Sontag ... he has to decide now.  |pg||
nt|kit: might not be so obvious for East to lead a club|pg||
nt|caitlin: true if no cuebidding|pg||
nt|kit: Note that vs. 6@S, if East does lead a club he must lead a low club -- if he leads the king, his partner should play him for stiff king and overtake|pg||
nt|poohbear: Not clear who is on lead :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: try a fake cuebid and bid seven (palyed by north)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: no 13 tricks tough|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|kit: Very difficult lead problem for West here IMO|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i am not sure is a forcing pass situation actually|pg||
nt|bjacobs: drum roll ...|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|bjacobs: Gah!|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: best lead and a @D switch|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen might not go up king of clbus|pg||
nt|idblu: even if guesses the @H, can't get to dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok now you will see it folks|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kit: diamond shift pretty easy, assuming they play 4th best leads|pg||
nt|kareno: That's all she wrote.|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|daman: tilt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: preparing a way to hand|pg||

nt|imp_jan: ah, helness did not dbl 5@c|pg||
nt|kareno: hm..|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: some days are diamonds...some days are stone :(|pg||
nt|kareno: We're looking for the site to watch two rooms at once - anyone know it?|pg||
nt|kit: good point Jan -- probably he didn't understand that his partner might be on lead vs. 6@s|pg||
mb|6S|nt|kit: but if they play attitude leads, his partner might have started with AQxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: 1 imp to Schermer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: note that vs. 4@H, three rounds of clubs and diamond shift would defeat it.|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting|pg||
nt|kit: this shows how important it is to be familiar with enemy methods|pg||
nt|kareno: All this auction I believe was north asking questions and south answering.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: 4@d was a slam try in @s and 4@h was negative|pg||

nt|idblu: 5@D begets 6@D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: Bidding now by east would show a minimum hand.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: so, what will a raise tell him?|pg||
nt|daman: they have a fit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: direct 4nt would be KC for clubs possibly, delayed KC for diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps -- don't know their agreements|pg||
nt|daman: now what?|pg||
nt|idblu: Robert hates to be pushed around|pg||
nt|kit: Now 4NT sounds like takeout to me|pg||
nt|idblu: get up on his hind legs and bid it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|imp_jan: 5@d always down (black lead)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: well, let's see what North thinks it is|pg||
nt|kit: And if they bid 5@D or 6@D, will (should?) West be saving?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wouldn't, but it's not really important|pg||
nt|kareno: Might make two on this lead.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@s diff to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: go Robert!!|pg||
nt|kit: well, looks like they are on the same page|pg||
nt|kit: It will be difficult for West to save, since there might be some doubt in his mind as to whether or not his opponents have had an accident|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What IS important is that I think Gromov's lead stank|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idblu: these last few should go fast...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S by north|pg||
nt|mrace: and if ew do not play hearts on time , they may have to duck clubs twice|pg||
nt|mrace: vs 4@SP|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: can't push him around|pg||
nt|kit: note that even though it is a "good" save, he will still lose 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|sharynr: stopping low is good, especially since it does not rate to make as much as  8 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: unless hearts are picked up, that is|pg||
nt|kareno: It can be made but only by playing heart to ace, then finessing on the way back.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He had a known 10+ card club fit ... so the only trick to take there was partner's ace|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|idblu: very nice |pg||
nt|kareno: And maybe still only seven tricks.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|imp_jan: @S8 = sp?|pg||

nt|imp_jan: i believe ns play reversed count|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so probably sp indeed|pg||
nt|caitlin: not sure why he would want spade|pg||
nt|kareno: sp = suit preference|pg||
nt|mrace: i do not think they are interested in count in this deal after spade A|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he does not wnat spades but clubs|pg||
nt|mrace: thats why he played his smallest spade|pg||
nt|caitlin: lowest spade asking for club|pg||
nt|mrace: no ? |pg||
nt|caitlin: assuming West has King reading @S8 shouldn't be that hard|pg||
nt|caitlin: or South would continue with King|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idblu: better than 13|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sergey Kustarov says the trump coup was still available, I've learned not to argue with him.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: This illustrates why sacrificing is so overrated -- huge cost if it is a phantom, and often a loss anyway even if right|pg||

pc|sT|pc|c6|nt|santyclz: For some reason the players often seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course you could argue that the diamond lead doesn't achieve much either ... it's not fair to expect him to be breaking up a squeeze with the lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: that was really a careless play -- he knows his partner has a stiff spade|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes:))|pg||
pc|d4|nt|santyclz: Sorry, reply to private msg.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that would make east 1426, barely possible|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: but maybe he was afraid his partner had a doubleton club and if he ducked, a pitch would be coming|pg||

nt|kareno: Last hand how many down?  1?  2?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to set 4@H they needed to start a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could produce some imps|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharynr: looks like made 2 to me|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: some play 4@d to show this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why not the cold 6@H by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this could be more IMPs for Meltzer -- slam missed in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: the claim there was very fast and involved a question from Berkowitz about if anyone was squeezed|pg||
nt|kit: The fact that E-W playing limited opening bids may slow West down a lot, though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: This hand, yes.  Being corrected.|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt best this hand.  I assume they have methods to find it.  Lebensohl of some sort perhaps.|pg||
nt|dinos1: lol - leader has no @s )))|pg||
nt|kareno: So this should be a push board, give or take an IMP.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Perhaps East should open a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: well might speed up East :)|pg||
nt|idblu: count the voids and length...for sure 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: notice the difference in styles    in the OR   South bis 2@S over 1@S and gummed up the auction slightly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at least it seems cold|pg||
nt|dinos1: but -1 if W had singl @s)) |pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: key now is if East can show that his shortness is really a void -- that will make quite a difference|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was not a good 4, but may be bid and made at one table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no -2 or 3 then|pg||
nt|poohbear: no. West has long Heart|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: Many people will respond with an ace.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be west bid 2@S|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe south passed?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@S is playable as well|pg||
mb|r|nt|poohbear: berk bid 3@h I think?|pg||
nt|poohbear: asking|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I think I got the result on board 45 right, but I'm not completely sure.|pg||
nt|kit: West won't like his hand much opposite a singleton diamond -- hard to find a 15-pointer which gins a slam if East has a stiff diamond|pg||
nt|sharynr: lebensohl start?|pg||
nt|kareno: Starting lebensohl auction.|pg||
nt|kareno: That would be a diamond trap.|pg||
nt|kareno: Poor North :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 26 E-W in 4@S not 3N|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: kibitzers are saying 4@S makes, and it probably does, but not easy to see a route to it|pg||
nt|othered1: west won't lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: guess not|pg||
nt|idblu: can make 6@S here....|pg||
nt|kareno: Now 3spades to show a stopper and bid stayman.|pg||
nt|kareno: And south should bid 3nt.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Excellent 3NT contract actually - unlucky to fail|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo operator|pg||
nt|dinos1: y, sleepy))|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|kit: the 3@H call may have screwed E-W up -- I wonder if they will be on same page now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: bidding is accurate|pg||
nt|kit: for me, 3@S would show unspecified void, but not clear West thinks that considering his 4@S call|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: 3@h slowed down the auction considerably, and E/W both stopped alerting|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The in-person kibitzers are gone again.|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, Lebansohl is a nice, useful, convention to get you to the right contract most of the time after a preempt.|pg||
nt|sharynr: surprised that @H not mentioned at all?|pg||
mb|r|an|SOS|nt|daman: it can't cost W to bid 4@C on the way to 4@S   that will get 4@D from partner and change the complexion of the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: there is Larry saving the day|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen decided his hand was so good that if his partner had any interest he was worth a move|pg||
nt|daman: and he was right|pg||
nt|idblu: Trying to make last call at the bar...closes at 1am|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps 3@S showed 4 @H|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c might make with a trump coup.  |pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s after 2nt showed four hearts and a spade stopper.|pg||
nt|othered1: do they play SNAP (strong NT  after pass)?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bravo|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharynr: tough to show everything|pg||
nt|kareno: That's why people preempt :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a really conservative auction|pg||
nt|kareno: They can make that with the same inspired spade play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: but will West know it is a void?|pg||
nt|idblu: think everybody needs a stiff drink at this point|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: yes Karen|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: West hedges with 5@H, a last train call|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: George :)|pg||
nt|daman: better late than never|pg||
nt|kareno: You bet!|pg||

nt|daman: here is the vugraph schedule showing when the next round begins: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||

nt|daman: 11 more to Meltzer   starting to run away and hide|pg||
nt|idblu: Berk and Cohen showing their class once again|pg||
nt|daman: are they ever|pg||
nt|idblu: I thought Larry quit the game a few months ago :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: There's some discussion between Berkowitz and Levi about E/W agreements over 3@d|pg||
nt|daman: will soon be 52-4 with 2 to come|pg||
nt|mrxxx: hi !|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: He is Bridge's answer to Brett Favre|pg||
nt|kareno: Great bid by Helness in the OR|pg||

nt|idblu: ruff 1 @H DT&C|pg||
nt|imp_jan: a spade now|pg||

nt|kareno: Do we have any scores from other events yet?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yep|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: You'd be really annoyed if you went down in 3NT here (with hearts 5-2 and led), and 4@S made at the other table on the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mark|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: hi Karen|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wants to make 4 or 5 trumps in his hands|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|kit: I think he got drafted when Helgamo was unable to play|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|idblu: may have timed this wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Now he needs to cash the @dK and pitch a club to avoid an overruff|pg||
nt|idblu: @SJ, @HK @S to hand...|pg||
nt|poohbear: well played by Helness|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|idblu: won 1st @S in wrong hand|pg||
nt|mrxxx: it has been a pretty dull set so far, hope the real interresting boards will come shortly :)|pg||
nt|daman: Ace and a @S will hold him to 4|pg||
nt|kareno: Two rounds of spades useful here for the defense.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: Hi all from Silver Spring, near D.C.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|idblu: needs 3-3 @H's and that's not happening|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: N/S is considering conceding, he knows he screwed it up and hasn't found the answer yet|pg||
nt|caitlin: this wins IMPs vs 3N by E-W|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|caitlin: with declarer not playing diamonds|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|kareno: Or did he first cash the club?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Incredible tempo for such a major event.|pg||
nt|poohbear: seemed tempting to cash the second @c but no need|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so easy to play for another fast discard|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not bad by the houdini's of the low lands|pg||
nt|imp_jan: minus 300|pg||

nt|dinos1: coz W had no @s|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|Vugraphu6: He did not cash the club.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H is for the adventerous|pg||
nt|poohbear: yup. Would have to give dummy a cl|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
nt|daman: hhrrrrmmmmm|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yep, 4@s was made on brd 26|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kareno: Then he should have made six by giving the diamond to west |pg||
nt|othered1: and double?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fabsayc: we will see what sontag and helness have discussed|pg||
nt|othered1: is double a double negative?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fast 3NT ?|pg||
nt|mrxxx: that will not be everyone's choice 3@d :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: the players just learned from the director that they are playing slower than the other table....:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Sometimes that's played as showing zilch|pg||
nt|othered1: normally a pass by the 2@C bidder confirms a strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or opponents just bid his main suit|pg||
nt|kareno: We play 4@d shows diamonds and spades and a great hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: the law in action :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: guessed right, club ace offside :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Unless west unblocked diamonds.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: It made 5.  You are right, he did give West a @d|pg||
nt|kareno: Then west was endplayed in clubs.|pg||
nt|kareno: For 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have seen some excellent declarer play by both sontag and helness|pg||
nt|poohbear: Zmudski can count 9 on a non @d lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N - good bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: might easily be the winner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: great swing bid |pg||
nt|daman: 3@C took east out of the auction completely|pg||
nt|kareno: It is mine.. sigh.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: normal reopening by East -- it just doesn't pay to let opponents play at 2-level when you have some high cards and are short in their suit|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|kit: difficult for North to double, though it might be correct action -- a lot easier at matchpoints|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Just to settle things about board 14, Cohen says he could have made 6 but he made 5 :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: 4@H showed a singleton, and a raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Last hand of the quarter coming up.|pg||
nt|kareno: Almost makes too.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: There's nothing to the play after trick one.  Just eight tricks and not nine.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: yes, at this point they will be out about the same time as the regional knock outs :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously Helness not on the same page with Sontag.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: rubin handled the spades correctly|pg||
nt|caitlin: much better treatment|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: Nobody's going to double.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well it worked|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is cold|pg||
nt|daman: he'll still give it some thought|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idblu: same auction in the OR|pg||
nt|idblu: hi Karen...congrats on your win :)|pg||
nt|kit: not same auction -- South didn't redouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|kit: and that makes a big difference|pg||
nt|dinos1: and pd cd have more @d's|pg||
nt|daman: where there's hope???|pg||
nt|kareno: South will explain that 3@d was a good save against 2@s :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idblu: carried Garozzo I saw|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it seems an exciting moment to drop in Verhees might have regretted that double as there is aslighhtly better 5 level contract available|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: there's Crosby|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: is it on @C lead?|pg||
nt|poohbear: but on that lead 4@s is the winner|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh, you mean the intervention worked?  3NT certainly has excellent chances|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A restricted choice play in diamonds will bring it home, for example|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: did Sontag not have a method to show his two suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: He employed it.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: Great lead by George Mittelman.|pg||
nt|kareno: And a push board developing.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: with lucky entry to dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: admitted not very lucky after east got @H into the auction|pg||
nt|imp_jan: misunderstandig i suppose|pg||
nt|imp_jan: leaping michaels|pg||
nt|kareno: But his partner must have forgotten the bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in which case can some one explain why this is being played in dims not spades|pg||
nt|daman: Leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|kareno: It's called Leaping Michaels.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: showing @s and @d's|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|idblu: Join us to,morrow for the semifinals....results will be posted on the ACBL website...thx to all for a good show and to Joe our Vugraph operator :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: whatever :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: of course at same time 4H could be cold, so not sure i would want to try unless badly needing a swing|pg||
nt|daman: yes    perhaps the next 16 will be more exciting|pg||
nt|mrxxx: lets hope so :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|idblu: promotion now|pg||
nt|kit: seems like normal lead -- needs only ace or queen in partner's hand, and nothing else is attractive anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|idblu: one to go.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: ach so|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the old guy uses the right convebntion and the youngster forgets it|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: had to cash ace of spades first for the promo to work|pg||
nt|kareno: Had to cash the spade for a promotion.|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|kareno: So the defense is duplicated and so is the result|pg||
nt|stewball: Meltzer finally scores on 27..Passell made 4@s w/o ! lead|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|mc|9|nt|fabsayc: he could have discarded on the club return|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.  And we are left to wonder if they discussed it day 1 and not afterwards.|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be expensivo|pg||
pg||

nt|kit: I totally disagree Karen -- I think after the redouble North should double 3@H.  It just plain doesn't figure to make.|pg||
nt|idblu: true...but 800 would have looked nice|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen:  "I'll never do that again."|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks much!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the player names at table are correct, the profiles are wrong|pg||

nt|lestergold: ok i understand leapfrog or something|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: It's true, pass meaning "I have no bid" seems to have gone out of fashion for a reason.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: what happened to 47's score?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: please stay on a while so we can get the final score of this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: thanks there|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|kit: This could be tricky -- when 10 of hearts led from dummy, if West covers I think it can make|pg||
nt|kareno: And to Sharyn for her fine analytical commentary :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: thx karen, and you as well|pg||
nt|imp_jan: more dynamite on this ome|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kareno: Lot of minimum hands this set :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Pleasure is all mine!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well could be more to come if they tie|pg||
nt|lestergold: Jansma are really on a roll here|pg||
nt|kareno: Would anyone else consider removing that double with the west hand?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|imp_jan: not me|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: declarer now warned about bad diamond split from lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharynr: this should make 9 tricks....so good stop|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: some people are asking if we could have a result also at 3/4 mark in the 0-5000 spingold|pg||
nt|othered1: south does not go quietly here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are actually three levels of spingold events that run simultaneously|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: Last hand now. Game time tomorrow 2 hours earlier than it has been . 11 AM local  16:00 London  17:00 CET  8 AM Pacific|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: no where very good to run to|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: And always thanks to the specs for keeping us awake and on our toes!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but on this hand 3@D is much more comfortable than any heart contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|caitlin: I hate keeping in doubles at one level but..........|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: great non-cover by Berkowitz!|pg||
nt|kareno: He was listening to you, Kit|pg||
nt|kit: if he had covered, a hook for the 8 of hearts would set up a heart trick for club discard, then club ruff in short hand, and making|pg||
nt|kareno: Where are results posted?  Thanks.|pg||
nt|poohbear: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/index.php?a=2009&b=Summer&c=daily_bulletins for 3rd quarter results|pg||
nt|kareno: I would assume, on the ACBL site, www.acbl.org|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told, http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2009/02/spingold/|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d - the 1@d is artificial, no?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n some might try but best defence not many tricks left when smoke clears|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: 1@d=0+ @d|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: 8 am, yikes|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|othered1: Eventually, it should be posted on http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2009/02/minispin5000/|pg||
nt|dinos1: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dinos1: thx all :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: off to the open room|pg||
nt|dinos1: will watch the finish of this interesting match|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|caitlin: so far no agreed time when players will re-start for final 32|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe there was something to asay for old fashiopned conservatism when butting in at unfavourable vul with zip playing strength|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: eventually is not soon enough in the internet era, we want instant news :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks bill, ed and spectators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to the acbl, which has shown us matches from the start this week|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also to Jan Martel, who has to continuously scramble to find operators for these shows|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and lastly to BBO staff, for making it possible for me to sit at home and watch all these great events|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are six boards ahead of the other table, so you are welcome to move there for more action|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|fabsayc: final set will start in about 15 minutes after open room is done|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: break tiem|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: time|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The other tables are on break and some folks in the room are being loud.  This table is very annoyed.|pg||
nt|kareno: And if the table is annoyed, surely the players are also :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: damn tables with attitude!|pg||
nt|kareno: Club is needed because of the throw-in risk against east.|pg||
nt|idblu: had they played a little quicker.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz:  "Sorry [for the delay], George."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Mittelman:  "That's OK, I understand your problem.  I'm going to take advantage of it, though."|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: @D artificial|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: Diamond finesse and that's all, folks.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|kareno: Now George Mittelman can make the contract.|pg||
nt|kareno: It was not a dreadful overcall at the one-level.  Lead director.  Ran into the wheelhouse.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|po-s: ae you  suggesting East shouldn´t bid 1H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer probably will save a trick in the end game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharynr: bye for now |pg||
nt|kareno: Bye|pg||
pc|s5|nt|caitlin: :) I think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes north end played on this trick|pg||
nt|kareno: I wouldn't think of NOT overcalling with the hand.|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno: But he's not making it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Larry Cohen can get out with his spade.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have here a partnership between two sometime world champions|pg||
nt|caitlin: low spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sontag got that wrong!|pg||
nt|imp_jan: it is obvious south has @SQ (otherwise hwld have discarded a spade earlier)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not expecting to see a ping pong of errors at this exalted level |pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps its quite comforting for us ordinary mortals to see just how much egg can get plastered on such faces|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|stewball: he played that like he lost interest|pg||
nt|kareno: For the specs he could have made it by ruffing that last heart and tucking east in with the second round of spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: How he can make it doesn't mean it is the best line of play, folks.|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay, he cannot make it except for Kit's proposal that he ducks the ten of hearts!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The result on board 45 is correct:  2NT making 2.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
mc|4|nt|imp_jan: Mike, i think it has everuthing to do with the fact that sontag-helness are not a fixed pdship|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the trafficinmg in imps on last two boards to rival the columbian drugs trafficking trade|pg||
nt|imp_jan: a lot of imps coming in for jansma|pg||
nt|kareno: Certainly looks that way.|pg||
nt|po-s: I can´t understand what partnership has to do with this board|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay, some time later today we will see the final half of the Spingold Finals.  |pg||
nt|imp_jan: i was not referring to this brd only po|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but i noticed some a typical actions|pg||
nt|imp_jan: has everything to do with uncertatinty|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously someone forgot their methods over weak two bids.|pg||
nt|lestergold: How regular a partnerswhip is this?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I assume not very|pg||
nt|lestergold: all new partnerships have these teething problems even if the two players are world class its to be expected|pg||
nt|imp_jan: vprooijen en verhees? they play 2 days per week for 2 yrs now|pg||
nt|lestergold: well then should have sorted out actions over weak 2s by now|pg||
nt|lestergold: no Sontag and Helness I mean|pg||
nt|mrace: he was refering to sontag -  helness|pg||
nt|mrace: i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think not a familiar partnership|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well as far as i know sontag and helness play on the same team (melzer), but with diff partners|pg||
pg||
