pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pass for penalty, 2N scramble, 3@C as described -- all look reasonable|pg||
nt|mrace: so 2 nt would be scramble, not necesarilly weaker than 3 cl |pg||
nt|ritong: pass for penalty is not envisageable being + a ton, i think|pg||
nt|harmon: especially not with a big lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter didn't correct Ekeblad's description of 3@c, but it wasn't clear to me that he heard it so may not have intended 3@c as strongly 1-suited|pg||
