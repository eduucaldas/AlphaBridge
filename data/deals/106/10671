pc|c6|nt|lestergold: also possible|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: but defence should play normally here for a long spade and three bullets and hope a red q makes a trick|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, n has to lead something after cashing the last @s.|pg||

nt|super nova: 6nt by south?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|super nova: doesnt make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|beauch: playing with one of my regular pds ted chadwick- i always refuse all slam invitations!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: not that you would want to be in it.. better than the last one though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: Is that beacuse he has already bid your hand for you ;-)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|beauch: in my opinion david lilley should have bid 3D immediately over 2@S|pg||

nt|tweety1: To me, his line of play is not too bad. He placed @h to N and @d q to S.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: but he could have made another discovery play without any risk play the third club|pg||
nt|santyclz: No need for him to make any placements at that point.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|tweety1: still cant understand why not played the 3rd @c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: and also fin d out probably that spades 4/4 now placing north with three diamonds becomes pretty certain|pg||

nt|westjava: in Indonesian : basa-basi|pg||
nt|jaapfr: IF one lives in Bandung one is always happy imo|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|super nova: Lawrence recommends x|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|super nova: and 4nt as two suited.|pg||
nt|super nova: x  = take out and your partner passes with the right hand.|pg||
mb|d!|an|support|mb|2S|nt|beauch: Sa pair in other room - have  reached good 6@H , but perhaps a tad lucky |pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I dont understand the Auction myself.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|josj: every reason fot that|pg||
nt|josj: for|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|beauch: me either- they must play double of 4S as penalties|pg||
nt|super nova: 4s X may have been penalty.. but don tknow.. I know that Ron (who played for many years with lilley) plays basically ALL x = t/o|pg||
nt|super nova: in these situations.|pg||
nt|super nova: 5c x  = take out.|pg||
nt|westjava: sure,always and always|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|westjava: dont want move to any where:)|pg||
nt|josj: maybe Lembang?|pg||

mb|4C|nt|westjava: Lembang much better:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|beauch: lusk- deluca in other room - i suspect play 4nt as takeout |pg||
nt|super nova: I wish the players at the other table played board 20 next. Since we know that the scores are a little bit wild. with that slam being bid going down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch: not a method i would advocate- but maybe thats why im not playing!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I play 4n as take out only because there 'tend' to be too much trouble with x = t.o as we can see it happened here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|josj: yes, we had some good rain here too this morning|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|santyclz: That was my take, and why I asked if 3 were conventional.|pg||
