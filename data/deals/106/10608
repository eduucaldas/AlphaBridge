nt|ahollan1: Rod 2@S opening nothing special    they play Precision 2@D opener so don't do the bad vs constructive treatment some using these days|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, this - at first sight it appears that if South plays @hK, he allows an entry to the clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: but def would hav 5 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: but in fact, he would have done better to cover|pg||
nt|dburn: since not to do so gives declarer four heart tricks (if he reads the position)|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has 8 with 4@H 2@D and 2@C|pg||
nt|dburn: he does, and eventually he can endplay North in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: and north looks endplayable|pg||
nt|dburn: but he will have to read it very well|pg||
