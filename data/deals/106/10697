nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: I don't want to make the same mistake again...Which one's are females?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: none|pg||
nt|nicksan: See what you mean!|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|vugraphzun: Welcome back all|pg||
nt|nicksan: They may make up for it on this one though...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a razorblade sharp 4@S EW to start with:)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: well, this looks like a routine 3NT|pg||
nt|nicksan: Excellent, I'll be fine then!|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Hi, and welcome back|pg||
nt|nicksan: Are they going to get close to the slam?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi and welcome back |pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: with combined 18 hcp very unlikely but..................|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nicksan: North is doing his bit....|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nicksan: Ok Welcome back to the Hague everbody, another 7 board match|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: E/W havo no good fit. Hope they'll discover that in time...|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hok is a club from Amsterdam and Buitenhof from Scheveningen, but Tammens is from Amsterdam so he is kind of in the wrong team... |pg||
nt|ady: e/w  can make 4@S   on guessing Q@C      needs spade finesse as wsell|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Some chances in 5 @C i suppose...|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Wow!!|pg||
nt|neobas: Can imagine E having some trouble with bidding 2@S, since @HK are 3/9 HCP for him, but the spot is good (behind the weak 2 in @H), so I agree with 2@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nicksan: Very well done N/S indeed!|pg||
nt|nicksan: This is a nice and safe spot for E/W|pg||
nt|jaapfr: solid bidding by all|pg||
nt|neobas: It's a Roland game :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hello Jaap|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty Roland en hoi Gerbrand|pg||
nt|nicksan: Assuming declarer will test the dimonds and take a double finesse in spades for his ninth...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr: unlikely to make this 5@H mb 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS were being optimistic, but they got away with it|pg||
nt|mamos: hi nick|pg||
nt|nicksan: This won't make, but at least it's not doubled...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he only deals in slams:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Mike Amos|pg||
nt|nicksan: With South's hand on view, I'd expect West to get this one right. |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|nicksan: I'm told North was doing HER bit, sorry.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi Jaap|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|nicksan: Is this a club championship then?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S at least 1 off|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nicksan: nope|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nicksan: A beautiful quantitative auction, What a start!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Nick|pg||
nt|nicksan: Shows what i know...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|jaapfr: is it hot there Gerbrand:)? or AC?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: we have airco :), and outside it's nice, but 20ish degrees I think, nto sunny :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Kees Tammens for Buitenhof Gerbrand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: yes|pg||
nt|nicksan: 460 would have looked better at pairs...but he'll take it.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzun: No it's open event,|pg||
nt|nicksan: Ok, thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: They just called their teams to a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: the 3 other players of Buitenhof play there for many years already...|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he will find out N 1624 so likely @CQ with N so 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: if east knows of long diamonds with south and then finds north has singleton heaert  may well get club right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nicksan: Still, the @S King will come to the resque|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: all lines now too -1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nicksan: or 490 even|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: 490 indeed|pg||

mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: I know that Morath-Efraimsson were in 3NT here, but I can't see the result|pg||
nt|nicksan: a combined 25 count, but not many tricks. Can they stop low?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT -1 in the CR I am told|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: @SQ lead|pg||
nt|diablo666: -1 is a pretty good result.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|nicksan: The only way to eight tricks seems to be the eight of clubs |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/m6m6o5  for running scores. Our scoreboard will be in accurate for the remainder of the match I'm afraid|pg||

nt|vugraphzun: NS are not regular, and North didnt like the overcall fo South|pg||
nt|nicksan: Thin 3 NT has some chances...|pg||
nt|nicksan: North must like diamonds...that's 20 in three hands...|pg||
nt|nicksan: He presumably thought the @C K might often hold the trick wherever the Ace is...|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C    excellent for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: where this board ends?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gulyas: I didn't either:)|pg||
nt|mamos: bravely done for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: might be a pass out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y or mb 1nt EW?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: a lot of voids so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: it really had no point|pg||
nt|nicksan: Wow, what a monster hand...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@DD reaceble and playable?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and unbeatable|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: seems more likely East opened|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if by W|pg||
nt|nicksan: 3 NT, not 4 @S here for the money...|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Yes, Director!|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: NS lead attitude|pg||
nt|mamos: hello again|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi Mike!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C cue here?|pg||
nt|nicksan: N/S may go to 6 @S !   Bad lay out...|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: S-->E: N has 5-5|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi Ed.You arrive just in time...|pg||
nt|nicksan: are a girl's best friend...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gulyas: the hand was weak, balanced, the suit very poor, and pd a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: needs @C 3-2 and some 4-1 are ok for slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and no very odd distributions EW|pg||
nt|ady: what is 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: not alerted, so my guess is 18-19|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|gulyas: what did he want to achieve?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3rd hand so now 1NT with extras is best|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: I believe 3NT was alerted|pg||
nt|nicksan: One of them had the right idea...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: all he could get into is trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: sorry :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hello Mike|pg||
mb|3D|an|*|nt|nicksan: np|pg||
nt|jaapfr: previos session he came in with a -1100|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i suppose a sayc 2/1 acol one|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he got away with murder, he could sigh that nothing bad happened|pg||
nt|nicksan: She'll be trying clubs soon, I hope|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It surprises me that Jamilla doesn't introduce her clubs|pg||
nt|nicksan: Should be long clubs. Should also have been the final contract in my view..|pg||
mb|3H|an|!H+SI|nt|gulyas: EW again in a routine-like game, but this time there are some bad breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Nick Sandqvist|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Nick|pg||
nt|nicksan: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hello Nick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: optimist|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: NS lead 135|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H5 best for fense|pg||
nt|jaapfr: de|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: South was thinkign about @D5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok any red 5 will do|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: now about a small @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: N can return a @H to get another @D ruff, but then he should not try to cash the @CA|pg||
nt|othered1: Is this a forcing auction?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too strong to open 1NT|pg||
nt|neobas: 3@C CBS and 3@D minimum without 3@H/4@S?|pg||
mb|4C|an|cue|mb|p|nt|vugraphzun: She did at 5level|pg||
mb|4H|an|sign off|nt|jaapfr: still 1nt was high enough but i think we all understand the 2nt bid by E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb he can bid 6@D with expected void of his pd\|pg||
nt|Walddk3: well, she did eventually, sort of|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Merijn is happily surprised|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: yy found 6@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least if no pass|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|nicksan: Should West start with a clubhonour? He want's to finesse twice...|pg||
nt|mamos: well this 2NT might make|pg||
nt|nicksan: A brave attempt by West to let it through, but it's not enough...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: in @S|pg||
nt|nicksan: Ok, we have some action. Will need to be very careful here...|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: at least ic no more than 7 tricks EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: now declarer can just ruff his 2 @H losers and claim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 300 most normal or 100|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: which bid established @C as trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: none|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: might make 6@H without trumps lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nicksan: It'll be closer than I first thought...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|nicksan: Yes, North better off not to ruff the third diamond "in thin air"|pg||
nt|othered1: this is redoubled, so 600 or 200|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: y @S @S @H @C@S|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gulyas: playing a @H was not wise from N, that gave an extra entry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha forgot the rebl|pg||
nt|jaapfr: was a power or frustation one:)|pg||
nt|ady: still might have a problem with trumps 4-1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: does this make if he ducks?|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nicksan: power! His partner bid to the 5 level and he had that!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: even now cant get back and forth|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nicksan: Welcome to Mike Amos. One of Englands most repected TD's, as well as a great commentator. |pg||
nt|nicksan: (That should get the next ruling in my favour)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nicksan: Still a trick short...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ic no chance|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: even then makes 6@H imo|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|nicksan: A club from South would have been better|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C for -1 else -2|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|nicksan: @S Ace no good...must ruff another club..|pg||
nt|othered1: So redouble didn't cost a whole lot here.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: Gerbrand tell him it makes no difference lol|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no mistake by defense so -1|pg||
nt|nicksan: Except if E/W had believed him and gone to 6 @D...|pg||

nt|vugraphzun: they are discussing the board now, and thinking what would happen when North didn't ruff the @DJ|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 2@S by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: right, if N discards, it is much harder for him to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: today is 7x 7 RR, to qualify for groups tomorrow|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: anyone knows why E bids 2nt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: 2nd hand red vs white preempt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East explains that 3@D is support, and says that 2N would be natural, and hopes he has 4@S, but far from sure|pg||
nt|nicksan: Someone better bid clubs...i don't think they'll beat 4 @s|pg||
mb|2N|an|21-22|nt|jaapfr: marco 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzun: yes Marco 3@S...|pg||
mb|3C|an|Puppet stayman|nt|gulyas: a very nice 1NT hand, he will likely make it, too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: brave to oblige the 4 level|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N played with 12 cards:)??|pg||
nt|othered1: 1NT welcomed NS into the auction.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzun: before he started bidding|pg||
nt|nicksan: Need a diamond ruff to beat this... |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|4!H and or !S|nt|nicksan: Nice, controlled auction avoiding the dreaded 5 level. East showing @C shortage and West getting out. |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzun: 2@C was natural, as you can see|pg||
nt|nicksan: North should really have doubled this.  His partner ovecalled!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so now ic why E did bid 2NT:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: it's Marco ter Laare, did you expect something else?|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|gulyas: the best would have been to play a low @S to hold this to 8 tricks, but that is the most likely outcome anyway|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@Ds, 2@Hs, 1-1@Cand@S is the minimum, 9 tricks|pg||

nt|nicksan: 12 IMP's to spangenberg for the 4 @S that could have been beaten here a couple of board ago|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Jamilla doubled for the lead against 6@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: that was not a good contract|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're gonna discuss disasters while still in play, it's tougher to clear your head for the next hand.  "Keller" approach to at the table partnership behavior has a lot to say ...|pg||
nt|othered1: for itself.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: @D9 ruffed, heart to the queen and another diamond ruff|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: bidding and lead and 10 tricks all too normal this board:)|pg||

nt|nicksan: On our first board, N/S bid a great 6 @C. That has brought them 11 IMP's. |pg||

nt|Walddk2: So I now make it 119-111|pg||
nt|gulyas: Szalay tells me that cuebidding is outdated, I guess he is right:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: It even looked like Magnusson led a low club in tempo|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugraphztw: He did, it was veeery quick|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|gulyas: it was obvious to him:)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Berik still with the edge I would say. 30 is a good board for them|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H obv Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A ridiculous slam bid in this room (30)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Closed room MOVIE reads  E  2@H  -2   but I am not sure if that is correct|pg||

nt|jaapfr: pretty standard 3nt -1 here so break time|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: last board of this match already, they are playing fast, it's EW style I would say|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Last board of this round|pg||
nt|jaapfr: blijft onzin zeggen:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry private|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Aggressive prepemt in OR, and E/W lost their way. Another swing coming up?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks on this bd is not that easy:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: with 6-5, 3@H is not too aggressive, even all vul|pg||
nt|nicksan: My guess is North led the @H Ace...|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: last board for today|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gulyas: thats is likely:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: NS discussing Norths lead and SOuth didnt lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: pushy 3N here, but it's one that "everyuone" bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Again 3 NT has a somewhat better chance than 4 @S...but on best defence goes a few off|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|gulyas: but still, that was only the 9th trick|pg||
nt|nicksan: This will wrongside it though!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4@S should be down automatically when East is declarer|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nicksan: Chance for more IMP.s for N/S here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr:   |pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: south has judged to pass will North?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: can't you make 5@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks awkaward on a clu lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: yep, going down|pg||
nt|nicksan: 6 @H good spot in the OR|pg||
nt|ady: club|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzun: this is the last board of this match, we resume soon (10-15 min) with match 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: actually, if the defense starts early on @Cs, even 3 can be beaten|pg||
nt|mamos: I like 1@s here   can show ten of our cards hopefully ig 1@H may be harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Yes, you can...with a bit of good guessing..|pg||
nt|nicksan: Should try 3 NT in my opinion...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzun: North thinking about 6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt-1 seems unavoidable here for all pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: aah, they changed the agreement sorry|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hard to find even a possibility of a ninth...|pg||
nt|ritong: i m surprised they still play puppet|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: on @S lead, pin the 8|pg||
nt|nicksan: But i don't think West safety played the trumps...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nicksan: I see that North likes solid opening bids...|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a 19 count to me|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the interest is to find 5/3 major fits, basically|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then 3nt can be made|pg||
nt|ady: should certainly make now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: hmmm tense |pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk3: cute switch|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gulyas: now that is a lot of down:)|pg||
nt|nicksan: He, he...tricky!|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup, can't treat the @Ds wrong|pg||
nt|jaapfr: fine feeling as commentator|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gulyas: @C back, @H to A, @C ruff, and a @D thru...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nicksan: West avoiding the diastrous diamond lead...flat board?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: can see an obvious line on a club lead?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|nicksan: Even that's counting low, but it got the job done and that's what matters...|pg||
nt|ady: cant|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|nicksan: @H Ace is bad play. If North has all three....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes @D @D and x@H |pg||
pc|dK|nt|nicksan: All together now...ACE|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: they guessed the @S's in the other room but didnt guess the @H's|pg||
nt|ritong: when nowadays everybody is happy to be in 3 NT with two balanced hands|pg||
nt|nicksan: That's one. Well spotted Ed!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|gulyas: no @S for S to ruff with:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: did south have ruffs/|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: That cover should let this make|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|nicksan: Better!|pg||
nt|ady: club threw  and  then spade   and another club?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzun: thx for watching all, cu soon, don't know how soon :). |pg||
nt|jaapfr: then 3@H and 5@D and 1@C or 1 @S 2@H 5@D a @C all to 9 tricks if @C lead|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dJ|nt|nicksan: @C ruff ?|pg||
nt|othered1: But this is the normal play, that likely won't work here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzun: East thought @HJ was played|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: easy game|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: thx all, they played extremly fast here|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: so will ahve a longer break now, but you can join the OR to watch the results, thx for now, cu soon|pg||
nt|nicksan: That's it for now...tx all see you later|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: still -1 @S8 found or not|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|gulyas: still, 2 down|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: I guess  you can't stop this|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: small error creates 12 imps out of the blue-grey sky|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|neobas: Claiming time!|pg||
mc|10|nt|gulyas: just imagining things:)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Thx all, back soon with match 2|pg||
nt|nicksan: Neat defence!|pg||
nt|nicksan: tx all  see you soon!|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye, see you soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: thx all cu soon|pg||

nt|vugraphzun: thx for watching, cu very shortly|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks all, we'll be back shortly :)|pg||
