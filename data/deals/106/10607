mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: sorry catchin up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How much do you think the K&R thinks it's worth?|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: on card it says "FSJ limit+"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: 4-card majors, weak NT for N-S I presume|pg||
nt|benjent: 2NT must be artificial - I suggest weak with C or some strong hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT are one but will miss the handle of @C I belive, so a partscore might? Or  NT still|pg||
nt|benjent: 3@c would have been forced, and Koke's passed it out with the uninviting hand with @c's|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|april7: now @S and diescard of 1 @D and so on mAKING EVEN §|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can Bachi find extra values?|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: nt wrong now|pg||
nt|haans: how is that possible|pg||
nt|april7: W shouldplay NT and not E, but he wants to play in a minor, to bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 8 tricks only|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Smart can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2NT is textbook stuff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bagchi "see red" (the vulnerability) and bids 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't that show 11-12 with a C stopper?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: if you double 2@H please hide  = no more bidding|pg||
nt|april7: now they are overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... tougher if you take a point or two away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's see|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use 11-14 NT openings so this show 15 - 17(18)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: precion at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: precision|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: the 2NT bid was not the best idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he will let this ride to his queen and advance @H10 to the queen|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Was a spot for 6@S here. Still tough @S are 1-4|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|april7: the X was also wrong, because E makes it now and W WAS FORCED  TO CONTINUE BIDDING ANYWAY|pg||
nt|haans: you can not sell precision withn that bidding|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: On either black suit switch, it seems N/S has 5 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: negative = spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: For set the contract down it was needed a @S lead I belive|pg||

nt|super nova: 68% grand approx|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see the same good bidding here? But by 2-2@C needed|pg||
nt|benjent: This contract drifted 3 off in the Open room - let's see if Khokan can do better....|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will be minimum2 down|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at least to The Australian Federation - BBO by all there nice people. ( Wald are at sleep) We was Bjørn and Frank from norway trying to help|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||

nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||

nt|rodal f: Hard to stop at 4|pg||
nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Perhaps as commented elsewhere, it is often unwise to use 4NT with weak trumps.|pg||
