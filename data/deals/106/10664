nt|Walddk2: Erik Sælensminde reigning World Champion and member of the Norwegian Bermuda Bowl team in a few weeks|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h making therefore scoring more (if it indeed makes) but 3N looking the sounder contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h an early spade switch probably beating 4h|pg||

nt|Walddk2: To be honest, it's a horrible hand to lead from when partner has no help in spades|pg||

nt|nicksan: A fairly normal result, but still, N/S will feel happier about it than E/W.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=NMMixPar09  for participants and standings after 78 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may get away with 3@S undoubled for -100|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 140 is a fine score|pg||
nt|nicksan: And some N/S will take the push to 4 @H, and so on...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What did you wear at the Palace when you were knighted?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shorts?|pg||
nt|reisig: What would S do ...if 1@s  P  3@s ?|pg||
nt|nicksan: If E/W try 3 @S, I'm sure South (at this table at least) would double. North would then probably bid 4 @H. But we'll never know...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More likely to bid 4@D, isn't he?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The winner is to leave it in of course|pg||
nt|nicksan: If 1 @S - 3 @S, surely you have to try 4 @H. Thoresen has never been backwards in coming forwards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: about to restart|pg||
nt|nicksan: Yes Roland. I meant if E/W bid 3 @s after South has mentioned her hearts...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And 1@s - 3@s - 4@h, will W save in 4@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, then she should double|pg||
nt|reisig: Immed pressure always seems best|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hard to any reason for West to take another bid|pg||
