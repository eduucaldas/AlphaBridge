nt|vugraphztx: Hi all, it's Bas again :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey you again!|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|jwit: 3 of a major is the limit here, but defense better cash their tricks if NS get to 4S|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|vugraphztn: 3@d is a good @h raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|othered1: on the other hand, in open room they didn't do much exploration|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: a little unlucky that the west hand has no entry|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: I think 4@S is an OK spot as cards lie|pg||
nt|othered1: can anyone translate this?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully someone can tell us |pg||
nt|vugraphztx: EW play a very artificial system, nothing like I've ever seen|pg||

mb|3S|nt|sybarra: looks like extreme canape  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or "lets bid what we dont have" |pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: better shift to a club at trick two, or it's all over for defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: Overtake for @C through.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: 10th against 4th|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: another hopeless contract it is|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: In watching it, it's nice to know what information is available to them.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|jwit: Very well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I wonder if 1N showed clubs|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like the Yellow team are well on their way to the final|pg||
nt|yuval10: for those who join us now - the correct score is 126:108  in favour of "Yellow"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: West should get this right, but perhaps East should have played the A of clubs and a small club to make it easier|pg||
nt|jwit: I guess West didn't get it right|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: W played a heart and declarer claimed|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@D or even 6 as cards lie will be OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a fun hand to lead from in N |pg||
nt|othered1: and, on this hand, not relevant, unless it's a low @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: solution suggested by one spec,  is never lead |pg||
nt|othered1: Whatever the information available to EW, they found a very good spot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: now makes 7 on major suit squeeze|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|sybarra: doesnt W only make 6?   |pg||
pc|c7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|yuval10: S needs to ruff the 4th @c and play A@H and @h|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|yuval10: still not makes|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
mc|12|nt|othered1: in real life, yes, or maybe only 5.  But now has 12 off top and @S finesse with length in north could have given west all the tricks (if you assume south wouldn't duck @SK)|pg||

nt|vugraphztx: Haha, I'll relay that to them :) Thank you!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|sybarra: Our appreciation to the sponsor, Mats Qviberg, and the Swedish Bridge Federation for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Carl Ragnarsson, Tomas Brenning and Carina Westlin who have ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|sybarra: here go again |pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: After all from West's point of view, they are not beating the contract unless partner has KJx of clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: we need system notes |pg||
mb|2D|nt|jwit: From East's p;oint of view I should say|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D is a good spot only in danger on @C lead or horrid breaks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|*|nt|Walddk2: Wasn't easy for East to cash @CA. What if declarer had KJ and was on a guess?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: As some/most of you may know, the other match was rather one-sided, so now the losing team, Lichtenstein, has forfeited|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|vugraphztx: It was W thinking, but there are screens in play|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's not just a question of beating the contract. This is matchpoint scoring|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|jwit: If declarer has the KJ, you are not beating the contract Roland|pg||
nt|jcwla: WD not to give away a trick with the lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Jon, but you don't necessarily have to beat the contract with this format|pg||
nt|Walddk2: MP is a cruel game|pg||
nt|sybarra: with lead and looking at dummy,  N is optimstic |pg||
nt|othered1: Do Ew play forcing pass here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Opening and rebidding @C's with the E hand may be "normal" but still feels blech.|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice bid by EW here|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|othered1: East's hand comes up as well more than "23 points" to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he makes another move |pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|sybarra: but how does he know to what suit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|othered1: surely this is a relay auction and east has an idea of west's shape and general  if not specific strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be |pg||
nt|othered1: But again, knowing exactly what west has shown would make this much more interesting to  us.|pg||
nt|sybarra: finding it most amusing the W opened that 5 count |pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Two hands in a row these methods have gotten them to great spots, better than in other room by a bunch.  So, well-done! |pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: Bas, has east described what west is thought to hold?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Probably, but I don't speak Swedish, and I can barely hear dummy commands lol|pg||
nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: *barely even|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jwit: I agree Jordan.  There are some people, myself included, who might open 1D and rebid 2C with those cards|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|jcwla: Or perhaps rebid 1NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Sharyn Reus|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Sharyn.|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Sharyn |pg||
nt|jwit: I don't like rebidding 1NT with a stiff unless it's an honor|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|jwit: When you rebid 1NT, there is always the chance partner may rebid 2 of their major with a weak hand and 5 of the major|pg||

nt|sybarra: interesting side to play 4 @S from |pg||

nt|sybarra: is there a name for this system?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: *10 AM EST, not 12 PM, sorry. Thanks Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: guess they feel the loss of concealment is worth what they pick up in accuracy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 2@S seems  like the choice|pg||
nt|jwit: I would bid 2S, just in case partner has the hand they have.  Now 3H would get you 4H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S to the rescue?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: Don't you think the cards are very much concealed using these methods?|pg||

nt|othered1: wonder if NS have discussed auctions like this|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Blakset walking the dog on his first turn, oping that NT would be the final destination for E-W. He liked the colours|pg||
nt|jcwla: "It c-it c-it can't be."|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though we have no official score, it looks likely that the Yellow team has won|pg||
nt|yuval10: and will play Berrik in the finals of this prestigous event|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphztx: 3 min overtime already|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  this is probably better than 5@c:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: will penalties be issued this time?|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Not sure, ask the TD|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: Who is now chatting to you, I think|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: NS did well to stay low|pg||
nt|yuval10: but @d lead will beat it nontheless|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S the limit, losing 1 spade, 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||
nt|othered1: That lead just simplified the hand.  Guess it was right to maneuver west into being dummy after all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so 6 IMPs to Yellow most likely|pg||
