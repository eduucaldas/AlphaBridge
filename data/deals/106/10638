nt|tomi2: In Schools Israel and Poland are fighting for the gold medal in 2 different matches and some other teams play for places 3 and 4|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mtvesuvius: not a friendly hand here either|pg||
nt|hedyg: possible 6@d|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mug: North hand best suited for 2@C then high level double of hearts|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: although as the cards lie, 6@c is on for NS|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h or 1@s follows by 4@h from W ?|pg||

nt|eerbil: selam Levent|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a bad day, yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|korszurku: seems similarly to the 1-st board 3@h for N-S and 4@D for E-W|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 4@h is close if the defense don't attack spades early|pg||
nt|korszurku: just like bd1 :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: else NO|pg||
pc|cK|nt|asig: The first dbl probably shows a one suiter|pg||
nt|mug: 1@H please|pg||
nt|mug: double looks wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: a very aggressive 2@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: no shape, bad suit|pg||
nt|cicus: opp cards lying quite friendly , 2 spades and a @D to  lose it seems|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|cicus: seems NS has take n a phantom save|pg||
pc|h8|nt|asig: It looks as if NS can make 3@H|pg||
nt|kastan88: CC showing they use MultiLandy over 1NT, probably double with minor-suiter, but, who knows, not so much on CC|pg||
nt|asig: Sorensen considering a raise to 3@H|pg||
nt|vasanti: hello everybody|pg||
nt|asig: Good controls and trumps, but the distribution is pointing in the other direction|pg||
nt|ACBL:  Welcome Vasanti ..thanks :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: Heya Jacki and Vasanti :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: too flat hand, i would pass, as partner passed on 1st round too, would be disciplined|pg||
nt|vasanti: they do have noce sp fit|pg||
nt|hobakan: Rxx den mi yoksa V9x den mi?|pg||
nt|wwalter: will be 4@h :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this may be -1 at the end of the dy |pg||
nt|xenya: the 3-level sacrifice is futile though|pg||
nt|sybarra: *day|pg||
nt|elbec: here they are|pg||
nt|cicus: S accepting the try with good controls despite of his ugy spades|pg||
nt|cicus: *ugly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hobakan: derken..|pg||
nt|mug: so no need to double with zero defence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|blade: seems difficult to find that @h fit...|pg||
nt|korszurku: W was lazy not to play the @CK|pg||
nt|sundiszno: would you rise with the @cK?|pg||
nt|korszurku: oh, sry - the other one is dummy|pg||
nt|sundiszno: not an easy hand to defend|pg||
nt|korszurku: not that easy|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see EW setting this|pg||
nt|elbec: no way... he should play spade to the king in order to make only 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vasanti: nice|pg||
nt|kastan88: Hi Vasanti and Jacki!|pg||
nt|asig: Yes, EW can make some spades|pg||
nt|vasanti: hi anders hi jaak|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu durumlarda genellikle bir 8. löve de bulunur bir yerlerden|pg||
nt|sybarra: now looking like -2 but maybe no double no trouble |pg||
nt|blade: and in this case its better not to find...|pg||
nt|sundiszno: rise with @cK, play @sT|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: thom, do u open with east hand? |pg||
nt|tomi2: i think not in imps, i save the time for the nex board|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: aha|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: same here|pg||
nt|asig: Enterprising lead|pg||
nt|kastan88: that is problem how to bid with 6minor+4major over opps 1NT not easy to find right part-score|pg||
nt|asig: 11 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|kastan88: and perhaps points on other side too, so no need to fight all the time :)|pg||
nt|asig: Draw trumps and set up clubs for to discards|pg||
nt|vasanti: some play x as minor +M|pg||
nt|z_lasu: hello all|pg||
nt|z_lasu: i suppose this vugraph is making from bridgerama not from the table so it is a little bit slow|pg||
nt|liviu123: hi all|pg||
nt|z_lasu: hi Liviu|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: yes, is from rama|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|cicus: S will ruff his losing heart and draw trumps|pg||
nt|elbec: before ruffing a @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same auction in other match when Berkowitz held South hand -- but Lunch did NOT double|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|namial1: Club lead i think|pg||
nt|korszurku: I imagined S playing - I have to modify my previous statement: it is DIFFICULT if you see all 4 hands :)|pg||
nt|cicus: although EW may have found their hearts - not easy even after a mild 4@D by N|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: EW can't make much, 3@S should be down by a few|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 3@d was 5+ after all? and 3@H was meant as cuebid by W and as natural by E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d like gf checkback|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||

nt|sundiszno: hi mikael - you must support poland :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: W pulled the brakes by refusing to cuebid @d|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|tomi2: I think N should bid 4@C|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: possible|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: do we have operator problems?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: operator?|pg||
nt|mug: pass should not be forcing or in any way encouraging on this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: rather, EW can't make much on best defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphztt: no, this is the playing speed :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: umm|pg||
nt|bily: i'm the new commentator|pg||

nt|ovncylmz: hi bily|pg||
nt|bily: hi|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this should be claimed very fast|pg||
nt|mikael_w: :) why ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zmudzinski did not open South - and was able to buy hand at 3@D later|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: the thing that i ve seen in this table, they bid in 7-8mins, then leading takes 3-4mins, and auto-claim:)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i like this bridge:) declarer play and defence is hard|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 3@h ll make = or +1|pg||
nt|bily: +1 I mean|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wwalter: a small @d would be interesting , I ment that as a doubledummy joke|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mikael_w: 6 would probebly been made if they bid it, but now dec may play as safe as possible to make 5|pg||
nt|hedyg: making 12 tricks not obvious at all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wwalter: now should come the 10|pg||
nt|namial1: A :d lead  good gess by the mother of Lea|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||

nt|sten: possible slam?|pg||
nt|charles_l: 5 or 7 on a @d lead|pg||
nt|sten: as the cards lay is 12 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|charles_l: 12?|pg||
nt|sten: 13 I'm sorry|pg||
nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: close |pg||
nt|charles_l: 12=13|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 6 is in danger on a @d lead! lucky slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: after @d lead if the K@C is not on...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but @s lead likely|pg||
nt|charles_l: on a @d lead you either make 5 or 7, so might as well be in 7@h :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: let's see the overcall by E..|pg||
nt|cicus: he probably played @SK before claiming |pg||
nt|elbec: anyway it wasn't played at best...|pg||
nt|wwalter: 3 nt would be the best contract|pg||
nt|tomi2: will be most likely|pg||
nt|wwalter: we shall see if the young blood stays so low :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: if Bell will open....|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5+!s 4+!c or 6+!c|nt|yuval10: 5@h looks like down 1 or 2 at most, so N did well by not XX'ing|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok :)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 4@h can be made here|pg||
nt|poohbear: And any bad feelings North had about the first board are forgotten|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, another phantom in OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|blade: a thin 4@h here...but prob. noit reached...and with good def. 1 down...|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 3 Volcker overbid to 5@H in OR after a 3@c opening by S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Open Room of our match, Greco-Hamson playing Big Club for Diamond -  i'm not sure about Jansma-van Prooijen :(|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 10-16, 6+@C OR  4+@C & 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ekeblad calls his system "Ultimate Canape"|pg||
mb|d|nt|korszurku: but N-S can save in 5@C|pg||
nt|sundiszno: for 500|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont blame him, he has a great hand after 3@c-X-5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: Granovetter-Rubin used to play a big club relay system called Ultimate Club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 1 & 2 level suit opening will be alerted EXCEPT  2@S in seats 1/2/3|pg||
nt|cicus: they seem to be satisfied with the canapé principle|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: Likely diamond part score for EW here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm... 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: @d's|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok|pg||
nt|blade: ich grüße mal alle deutschen specs zwischendurch...HEYYYYYYYY..:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: No game can be made here|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 2NT is too high here with best defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead or @d he can make this|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he just bashed 6@H|pg||
nt|cicus: EW in 3NT here|pg||
nt|elbec: 9 tricks in NT for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: they play transfers here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I was about to mention that :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, the defense must hurry up taking their tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S, A@D, @s to dummy and J@d|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3@H is not good|pg||
nt|korszurku: but maybe he will get another chance :)|pg||
nt|korszurku: Zsolt (Wagner) did not appreciate his 6-4 enough|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sundiszno: 6-4's are very good|pg||
nt|korszurku: I beleive with these cards it is normal to jump to game, but if you are pessimistic at least invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they owned the Bridge World Challenge the Champs competition for almost a year -- averaging close to 90 with Ulitmate|pg||
pc|h4|nt|elbec: 1@c is 15+ with 4+@c or 15-17 balanced or 24+any|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|asig: or NT|pg||
nt|kastan88: and lot of tricksin @D perhaps 10-11|pg||
nt|kastan88: in 1nT probably 9 tricks, I think South not attacking spades|pg||
nt|vasanti: 1nt is not too bad either  |pg||
nt|namial1: difficult to reach 5 @c and win it|pg||
nt|kastan88: what was 1@S? transfer to clubs?|pg||
nt|namial1: 2 down with @s ruff|pg||
nt|kastan88: then probably East could bid 5@C|pg||
nt|blade: very agressiv this 4@h bid...|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 2NT= asking about spades fit|pg||
nt|wwalter: minim with 3 cards, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 3 clubs= 3 card of spades and weak|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eerbil: kör ataðýna batan bir 4pik seyredeceðiz þimdi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 11'e 11 lik bir 4 pik. hadi bakalým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: genelde koz ataðý gelir ama bu deklareye|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is minimum for his X, he can not go any higher|pg||
nt|hedyg: can N?|pg||
nt|charles_l: N can mke another try?|pg||
nt|sten: has N to another try?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this team - all combinations of Ekeblad-Rubin-Granovetter play Ultimate Canape -- just carding changes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eerbil: 13 var güneyde|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3@h is not invitational|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nice decision by S here to pass 3@h, Not sure I would do that, but W would for sure bid 4 @h over 4@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think so, his pd showed 8+ hcps with 4+@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: big start for Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he had anything other than the A@s...|pg||
nt|cicus: some work to do but the layout is ahgain favourable|pg||
nt|elbec: heart lead probably gives some pressure|pg||
nt|cicus: E can come o 3@S+2@H+1@D+3@C tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: club lead will solve the problem in that suit|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: bizce koz ataðý iyi|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that N didn't overcall|pg||
nt|wwalter: good bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ovncylmz: 4@h made?|pg||
nt|tomi2: @D lead|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all|pg||
nt|namial1: small @s now|pg||
nt|mug: so what's the best line here?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: as I would have in a second :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bily: one down|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: yeah|pg||
nt|MolvaM: genç dünya þampiyonumuz murat anter de bize katýldý|pg||
nt|murat: herkese selam :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: DB 2/4 atak ediyor, bu atak ile Batý oynayandaki trefl sayýsýný çözemeyecek |pg||
nt|eerbil: ve saldýrgan kör defansýný bulamayabilir|pg||
nt|ozgull: irfan ve muhammet oldukça yavaþ oynayan bir çift ancak sanþlýyýz ki latvia lýlarýn yavaþ oynayan ayaðý diðer masada|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu dummy'e bakarak küçük kör dönmek oldukça zor defans|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bence koz dönecek|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good afternoon from Manchester|pg||
nt|sten: that came from the board I wrote "not that exciting"|pg||
nt|cicus: not much competitive bidding there, of course|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: here yes|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: germany was 2nd before this round|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems I missed some exciting boards |pg||

pc|dA|nt|ovncylmz: what do you thk about hands?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i thk good hands for bridge|pg||
nt|mug: remember that declarer doesn't know which way round the heart honours lie|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kastan88: Website for official results and running scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|mug: I would have thought you cross to @DA and play a club to the jack|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now he does|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think K@D and @d to the ace, then @c to the jack|pg||
nt|yuval10: everything works here for declarer|pg||
nt|mug: will probably guess wrong as North passed over 1@C|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|eerbil: eðer ortaðýnda 2 trefl varsa, beklemeli ve 3 trefl, bir kör (veya karo) almak için|pg||
nt|ozgull: ortaðýnda 4 adet trefliyi anladýysa mecbur gibi|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 2@c double checkback|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 2@s invitational 5+ spades|pg||
nt|liviu123: very good bid |pg||
nt|z_lasu: contract is down one but only after club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tomi2: very good|pg||
nt|cicus: of course E does not know @H's are so fiendly but he may try one anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much more interference in current CTC than back in the 80s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ovncylmz: yesterday there were many flats|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer needs to start @ds by playing low|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|yvonnebrid: a|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well they missed the grand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East thought they were an ace off it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Robert didnt show his void|pg||
nt|hedyg: will he play security again and just cash out?|pg||
nt|hedyg: another @H and 8@c|pg||
mc|10|nt|vasanti: 3nt in closed room overbid|pg||
nt|eerbil: evet bilse 4 trefli, kör tek þansý|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how to avoid a @H and @C loser here |pg||
nt|mikael_w: so this will be 8 fast now|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: right|pg||

nt|hedyg: wow he bid 6@H all alone!|pg||
nt|hedyg: what a start for Norway!|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N here looks ok until @c4-1 off|pg||

nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|charles_l: no|pg||

nt|tomi2: Netherlands are already awake it seems, they are leading vs. Italy... Italy 381, Netherlands 380 and Germany 379, thats the latest score|pg||
nt|cicus: this was cheap as 4@H was on|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, 4@S might go down here|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|namial1: they opened in both rooms|pg||
nt|wwalter: this will not end @@ 2@h :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: young blood :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: routine @h game here for NS|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here its importent dor N/S NOT to bid to hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: I still feel Robert should have shown more though|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is nice and easy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mtvesuvius: Wrong colors for a minor save|pg||
nt|vasanti: sld be 2 imps gain|pg||
nt|kastan88: 4@S for NS|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 2@h?|pg||
nt|korszurku: very interesting - on board 1 and 3 E doubled diamonds (seemingly natural) and in both cases W lead a spade in the OR|pg||
nt|sundiszno: or 3?|pg||
nt|charles_l: not 2nd seat with 4@s|pg||
nt|sten: and not Skjetne either|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: "closed room"|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: So yes, 4 (or maybe 5) hearts making 5 is pretty much a claim|pg||
nt|peachy: nice aggressive game, imps for sweden|pg||
nt|korszurku: in both cases it was quite essential to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 @s might even be to hi for N/S here|pg||
nt|korszurku: good opening leader Jassem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: catchall 1@D  2+|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-13-|nt|laurentiu: hi everybody from Romania|pg||
nt|wwalter: the pass users, R all over 40 :)|pg||
nt|blade: its important now to forget this boad!..hope North will shut up and play further..he is unfortunatly known NOT to do this.-..|pg||
nt|korszurku: 1NT might be Polish style|pg||
nt|korszurku: 4@S and 5+ in a minor|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 4@c in the open from the last one|pg||
nt|elbec: I didn'l like the small heart from the dummy... maybe he hoped south to play the king with Kx|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: Hi there! A commentator was badly needed, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: hi kibitzers|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a posible 4 @h here, and will be fun ro see if it makes|pg||
nt|cicus: in OR the hand was played by N|pg||
nt|cicus: he may have received a @D lead or successfuly picked up trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: system forces 1@D opening which shuts out Ekeblad|pg||
mb|2C!|an|forces 2!d|nt|laurentiu: and also from our distinguished guests from Europe, and spectators from Terra :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: W shd investigate, he needs only @H AK|pg||
nt|hedyg: S really loves his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bily: unknown suite|pg||
nt|vasanti: there would be competetion with those @H|pg||
nt|vasanti: everyone bidding|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bily: i think|pg||
nt|asig: 2@c is artificial, showing any invitational hand and asking opener to bid 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: double now is wrong without trump tricks and minimum, IMO, if this is not some artificial|pg||
nt|asig: Dbl is very ill advised as 2@h is unbeatable|pg||
nt|eerbil: 3nt neden açýlmadý merak ediyorum|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhammet özgür rakiplere olasý bir 4 majör kontratý olduðundan þüpheleniyordu ama ortaðý gereðinden çok majör kart bulunduruyor elinde|pg||
nt|z_lasu: no double, no trouble here|pg||
nt|z_lasu: but still -300 not looks great|pg||
nt|z_lasu: Romanian pair stop in 2@s at board 4|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H is a bit bow-and-arrow|pg||
nt|mug: many pairs these days play transfers or some kind of 2@C tool |pg||
nt|peachy: i am not familiar with the players' systems, if a kibitzer knows, feel free to msg me|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Both natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT showing long @ds + 4 @s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: strage 1 NT here ? maybe it shows 4@s and longer @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: it does|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like it after N 2 @s|pg||
nt|sundiszno: looks like at least 5 tricks for the defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: too hard to rearrange the names?|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry u got there:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C opening let Hampson overcall 1@D|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, a @D lead helped there I hear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D makes it look like 2@C was 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that's pretty strong south hand to just start invite sequence|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: so 10 more imps to Poland|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, ATLEAST|pg||
nt|sundiszno: not now...|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3@S bid consistent with my comment about 1NT|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but they menage ro get the kontract on the right hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: he has not seen W's @cs|pg||
nt|sten: this contract is doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: And 5@S making your own way|pg||
nt|vasanti: looks like they not reaching game|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lay, Michielsen will make this, mebbe even four|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Cecilia (Cilla) Rimstedt is West, the younger of the two sisters|pg||
nt|peachy: she played with Emma yesterday, is that right?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I think she is 20, Sandra 22|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No, that is Sandra|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H competitive, non-invite|pg||
nt|elbec: lucky 6@h here|pg||
nt|cicus: NS have everything here, only problem is the trump suit|pg||
nt|cicus: but that is distributed wonderfully|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm maybe Diamond shows 6@S and offers Choice of Game|pg||
nt|cicus: better remove this a s3NT has no play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: That cannot be a winning bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT would show about 18 with me,  so Robert is expecting miracles I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Perhaps a little confusing, but  Sjöberg - Sandra Rimstedt  and  Grönkvist - Cecilia Rimstedt  are regular partnerships|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1  Israel found the slam  so off to a good start for them |pg||
nt|xenya: well a @D now looks very natural|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt, S is considering other possibilities|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: what to think with South hand, if partner saying, I have lot of heart tricks? So probably double was something, or South knowing partner doubling sometimes without tricks :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: young blood wants to draw blood:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: even 3@H is good sacrifice, as 4@S stay and 3@H only 1 down|pg||
nt|vasanti: loke jaak says ill advised|pg||
nt|vasanti: like|pg||
nt|asig: Even 5@h is a good save :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: kx and 2 aces also guaranteed shortage in @H in ps hand 3sp was better now?|pg||
nt|kastan88: North putting partne under pressure: why she is doubling without trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vasanti: 3@D from s might still save their game|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: EW are already in 3@H :)|pg||
nt|asig: 3NT now to collect the vul game bonus?|pg||
nt|vasanti: u true:)|pg||
nt|asig: And a matchpoint top|pg||
nt|MolvaM: belki 3nt açýþýnda "yanda birþey yok" oynuyorlardýr?|pg||
nt|eerbil: 4.pozisyondan öyle oynamýyorlardýr herhalde|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elikontrsuz oynuyor olmamýz gayet iyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: bi önceki boardda, koz ataðýndan sonra 4@s kolayca yapýlmýþ|pg||
nt|murat: Letonyalý gençleri biraz biliyorum.. Son 5 senedir oldukça iyi çalýþtýrýldýlar. özellikle þu an oynayan 4lüsünden gelecek için çok ümitliler.. |pg||
nt|yo_yo: and one happened :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bad luck Houlberg, it sounded as if EW were well stopped in @S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 @s might also make|pg||
nt|mikael_w: @dQ now ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: then he makes 3 @s|pg||
nt|sundiszno: the @d and the @s finnesses are somehow linked|pg||
nt|sundiszno: W wont have @cAK, he'd lead it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|blade: lets see if they reach a grand..and then...which one....|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but will not be easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead best?|pg||
nt|cicus: this is the only layout in whicjh declarer loses only 1 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect platnick doesn't know about 6th spade|pg||
nt|cicus: most likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if availabe, 2@D game force checkback would have helped Diamond|pg||
nt|cicus: although they alerted 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well Diamond alerted his own 3N -- we don't know if Platnick was on same page :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: 3NT I believe showed 5@s choice of games, not sure though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vasanti: oh no|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3Nt is possible only if spades are running, but North bidding showing something else|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Kath :)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: he has @hK|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahalim: this I don't understand, so easy to check for keycards and stop in 5@H |pg||
nt|blade: 7@c down for sure...7@h also has big problems, cuase no communication....and of course with @c ruff down from the top...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: or @c turn after @h A|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is more difficult|pg||
nt|hedyg: can Quentin find it?|pg||
nt|cicus: slow start by the NS pair here|pg||
nt|cicus: thx Owen|pg||

nt|mikael_w: what ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H now to show @c interest|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: wrong three|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is more then one way to play this|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d to hand and @H ruff, @d and @H..K@D|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that is ONE way|pg||
nt|sundiszno: so if he has one, the other may not|pg||
pc|s2|nt|blade: oh...|pg||
nt|blade: if norway is lucky...this will brings lots of imps if germans bid to 7....|pg||
nt|cicus: interesting @D discard|pg||
nt|cicus: seems he could have let a @H go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all KO matches in Spingold [including this semi-final and tomorrow final] are 64 boards - barring playoff|pg||
nt|cicus: but after @SQ this is also OK, N has not enough tricks without spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: this will be a likely 800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Eke better hold his remaining @D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cicus: now please not another @D|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|elbec: i think the score is not right|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: of @s after last @H ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: the good news is he isnt doubled|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: nt now, however|pg||
nt|elbec: according to official scores Israel is leading 7-0|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: but if other table bids game, loss not very great|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 4@h has been bid in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: in the meantime ms Michielsen is still thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: if lucky, Grönkvist might excape with -500|pg||
nt|peachy: escape|pg||
nt|peachy: I am slightly speechless at the daring 4C|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: the screen has been closed and the players are talking on each side|pg||
nt|peachy: Florin, our operator told 4H was bid in other room. Shouldn't make so Sweden will lose 12|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, 140 now all the ways|pg||
pc|sT|nt|elbec: now it's right|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: in college, we called the @D discards "compression plays"|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should make this|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yuval10: no swing in board 2 as well|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s -1...the play was different though|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead @c and declarer did very well to play A|pg||
nt|yuval10: but lost it somewhere along the way|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|yuval10: running scores for both schools and juniors|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|ovncylmz: some tables playing 4@s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|neobas: Had N or S had the @HT, W would've been endplayed here|pg||
nt|neobas: So he might think he is :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Now he can safely exit with @H or @C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ovncylmz: too much enthusiasm|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 140, yes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kastan88: Now i can see surprise in South eyes....|pg||
nt|blade: ok..in Board 4 the norwegian also failed to beat 4@h....|pg||
nt|sundiszno: stop supporting the poles, pls :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: may see an end play coming?|pg||

nt|kastan88: "partner with such hearts you are doubling?"|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: 2@s|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: compressing 5 winners at start, to 4 winners after lead, now 2 winners IF they untangle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lost opportunity for Eke|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: on the 2nd @s, Ekeblad started to throw a @h but then picked the @d|pg||
nt|cicus: first idea is always best|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Ekeblad is taking a break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction convinced him Platnick only held 2@S - so assumed 1@D included length|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that means -- going for smoke|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: he alledgedly quit smoking|pg||
nt|cicus: these broadcast of the Ekeblad matches take rather long even without the frequent smoke breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: it's what they were talking about before play started|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in other Match  Meltzer 10  Lynch 0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- LYNCH 10  Meltzer 0|pg||
nt|santyclz: Almost the same.|pg||

nt|wwalter: I will call the TD :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: he dose not answer :)|pg||
nt|namial1: i think declarer did not loose A @d|pg||
nt|wwalter: on @s@s lead it should be 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some may be carried away with the East cards, sooner or later|pg||
nt|blade: looks like a 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: should have ruffed with 2@s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: trying not to support any team m8 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: OR playing 3@HX, last board|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But that was a false claim right ?|pg||
nt|cicus: NS may try another 3NT here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N openers are  1/2/3 not vul  13+ to 16   3 vul/4th  14+ to 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: i think i'd want to be in 4@S on that hand after this bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: and because i don't know how to finesse I would win ;)|pg||
nt|kastan88: 5@S is possible sac for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: pity we didn't see the play|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ovncylmz: neth. guys feeling they ve a good lead?|pg||
nt|blade: you just need to bid it...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: wow|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: other table 2@h, then 4@h|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s: "Is|pg||
nt|asig: "It's juniors"|pg||
nt|kastan88: but now 4@S-5@C and what to do with W hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: but never mind|pg||
nt|hedyg: it served no other purpose|pg||
nt|hedyg: multi 2@d|pg||
nt|cicus: that settles it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mtvesuvius: Partscore here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: playing the 10@s at the end is terrible play, The K@s is right. IF rhe @sQ is alone|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: minimulti|pg||
nt|charles_l: N tempted to psas|pg||
nt|hedyg: N thinks his pd has @hs|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@H (-1) will be the most likely contract here. Youre missing 3 aces and need some helb in both majors with the queen but most pairs will bid this game and then try to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: here 3nt:= they like playing|pg||
nt|kastan88: this time North not so aggressive :)|pg||
nt|asig: Germany indeed bid 4S on 5|pg||
nt|vasanti: E hand is more like 4/5@C opening and iff ines chest|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if north passes, pass is no an option for csaba here|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: 2D = it is only weak with one major|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Adrian|pg||
nt|elbec: here NS has a nice save in 5@d, but very difficult to bid it|pg||
nt|cicus: NS may find a 5@D save here|pg||
nt|cicus: I would have bid 3@D with the N hand|pg||
nt|elbec: 2nt shows inviting support (3 or 4 cards)|pg||
nt|cicus: to direct the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: disciplined pass by Gronkvist  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 3@d isn't too bad actually, and certainly a good "save"|pg||
nt|vasanti: off ones forgive bad typing|pg||
nt|yuval10: E had 3 options - 3@h/ 2@h and pass|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2NT game-forcing with 4+ hearts       4@D   5-5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That will make Rimstedt stay away from the D lead one would assume|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Molenaar did not have that info in the other room and led @DK, but the contract went down regardless|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Bas, Last board shod be just made right ? It was a false claim for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sundiszno: well, we told them beforte the event that tere are bonuses for games...|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Yes, my apologies|pg||
nt|wwalter: no reso to bid 4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kastan88: now i think East can't stop  West to bid slam, or...|pg||
nt|vasanti: S s 2sp rather aggressive|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps some writing taking place|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 2nd chance|pg||
nt|mikael_w: is it posible to change it ? so we gets the IMP:s right ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: I corrected it|pg||
nt|sundiszno: anyway, it'll be a lot of imps to poland|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ty, Looks like the Hungarians miss another game here|pg||
nt|wwalter: reason|pg||
nt|santyclz: No extras, no fit, not vul.  Obvious 3nt...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: aren't you glad i announced the ranges :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I am|pg||
nt|cicus: lead helps that's sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th from STRONGEST would have worked better|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2: dont know their agreements but one of both misbid his hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu gerçek mi?|pg||
nt|murat: frenlerimiz tutsa iyi olur|pg||
nt|ozgull: deðildir|pg||
nt|eerbil: açanýn splinteri bu kadar düþtü herhalde|pg||
nt|MolvaM: özgür artýk 5@h dese iyi olur sanýrým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1@h açþý gayet makul idi. sonra agresiv bir 4@d ve artýk þimdi fren rica edelim|pg||
nt|eerbil: 5@h dese de irfanýn pas demesi çok zor artýk|pg||
nt|blade: sometimes I wonder..they bid games with combined 21-22 -23 points with no fit..but this one is missed...|pg||
nt|cicus: no need to direct it :)|pg||
nt|elbec: he's maybe thinking to play the queen for pitching a spade... but it's a losing play...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mtvesuvius: hmm. Treating that as invitational just doesn't look right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well the missed Grand was flat|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that means a "push" to you shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy grand to bid do you think?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not easy, void in partner's suit  never easy|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they have a chance still|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|eerbil: çünkü AK treflin dýþarda olmasý neredeyse imkansýz irfan'ýn elinden|pg||
nt|ozgull: pass geçmeyecek olsa 4sp dermiydi|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was actually in other room with some of that discussion |pg||
nt|sybarra: need our wits about us on this 3 nt |pg||
nt|yuval10: he went for the only non-juniorish option :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have friend who HATES leads from unsupported Jack -- he'll give you grief even when it works|pg||
nt|santyclz: As my dear, departed mother used to say, "The only lead worse than jxxx is j9xx."|pg||
nt|cicus: I admit i would also have led a club|pg||
pc|c8|nt|asig: But also very effective, taking up valuable bidding space|pg||
nt|vasanti: sure finds p with good fit|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally not right red K in West hand|pg||
nt|eerbil: zaten 4sp demesi de normal deðil ki|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 2@h looks interesting here|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure this is our best spot |pg||
nt|xenya: tough hand for NS -- it appears all game contracts fail here|pg||
nt|sundiszno: :(|pg||
nt|elbec: nice|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|namial1: a lot of down here|pg||
nt|wwalter: I will not say a word till the end LOL|pg||
nt|korszurku: 2@S is a bit timid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: verry|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes, he may suspect partner's short in @h|pg||
nt|korszurku: but if you do bid 2@S, 3@H is better at the next turn|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@h is almost making EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have said:  no really partner -- you make the lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|murat: karo ataðýna, tref dama doðru oynasa  6 olmuyor mu ? iki tur çekip durmasý yeterli|pg||
nt|sybarra: always smile and say "thanks p"  (esp. for the @H suit) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes it looks hopeless if you are of a pessimistic natuer|pg||
nt|namial1: i prefer 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d was gf|pg||
nt|mikael_w: as he played now it dosent matter if rhe A@s is bare|pg||
nt|sundiszno: may be natural too :)|pg||
nt|sten: good start for the Norway, maybe a little lucky|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ozgull: 2sp konturu atak amaclý heralde|pg||
nt|murat: gerçi 2pik kontr geldi|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer has a lot of work to do here....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Dutch a little lucky here because even 4@H rates to go down|pg||
nt|peachy: what would you lead from W?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe a low heart although I can see that a spade is fine|pg||
nt|cicus: no need he has safety in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice duck|pg||
nt|cicus: ducking into safe hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: neyse. frenler tuttu |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: now for the @H switch|pg||
nt|z_lasu: about 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c, 2@s and 2@d losers are visible|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: he needs to play trump from his hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt fails with the bad @C break (among other things) |pg||
pc|s6|nt|laurentiu: not the good bid ... as at least 6 are on the table|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Adam and Arifin, you have a third commentator now|pg||
nt|peachy: The Dutch will be happy |pg||
nt|peachy: oops, they are in 5!|pg||
nt|peachy: takes a little planning|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not if N/S play 5+ major openings|pg||
nt|sundiszno: i'm joking |pg||
nt|mikael_w: :)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: ..or at least, trying to|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mtvesuvius: great, Hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|cicus: another hurdle taken|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: now he feels OK|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h by E should show some @d preference|pg||
nt|yuval10: so W did very well to play @d rather than @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 9@H in dummy|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Not sure I like rhe @sA lead here. I guess he hoped for single @s whith his parner, but not verry likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: very unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: he might be looking for a way to make with a 4-1 @h split|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Peter all the way from Australia|pg||
nt|murat: diðer masa 4de durdu|pg||
nt|MolvaM: acaba batýnýn yan rengi trefl olabilir mi?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: o zaman trefl çakasý tehlikesi var|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dolayýsý ile trefl dönüþüne as girmek zorunda kalacak|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C looks nice -- until you discover the 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|xenya: or 3N, yes, Shirley|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: I think East liked his @DAJ 9 positioned over the 2@D bid, so East pushed towards a possible vulnerable game with the aggressive 3@H call.|pg||
nt|asig: Still one off|pg||
nt|vasanti: almost there but sadly dk wrong|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this was a REALY tough kontrakt from start|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: with 109 @c dropping should make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tomi2: the reason is that you get 420 points for a game and only 170 for 3@H+1 :)  right in this moment both, Bell and the dummy hope that Partner has some usefull trump cards|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and if he makes it, it will be a realy good score|pg||
nt|cicus: now the right finesse and it's made|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mtvesuvius: True, although I don't think it's strong enough anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 tricks look possible if West continues to play it well|pg||
nt|petergill: @C10 looks best now|pg||
nt|ahalim: and if @H's were 3-2 even 10|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true|pg||
nt|murat: güney karo rua çýktý.. muhtemelen 1 imp vereceðiz|pg||
nt|aupillon: test|pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h ruff and @c|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|elbec: j of spades?|pg||
nt|tomi2: @H9 is the keycard now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will have to open @s for declarer|pg||
nt|yuval10: or give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|yuval10: so -1 it will be|pg||
pc|cA|nt|laurentiu: Diana and Lucian ... is a new pair ... starting to play togheter since the end of previous year|pg||
nt|petergill: then he should play the strong bidder North for the ace, not the queen, of clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: looks like it is 1 down. |pg||
nt|blade: germans in 7@h next door...we will see if they can make that...|pg||
nt|elbec: it is not always a good thing to give count to your p... now it costs an extratrick for EW|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ovncylmz: -4?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, then it has overtricks when @hs split|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes|pg||
nt|blade: in the previous board|pg||
nt|sten: still I think it's good judgement by both the Norwegian pairs |pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: he could draw trumps, play all @ss and give up 2 @ds|pg||
nt|mikael_w: strange to play @h2 to ruff, Why not @hJ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello all. I am arriving on a Grand slam :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|nt|elbec: ace?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: These young Israeli players are very strong - I think all of them are World Champions from 2006 in Bangkok.|pg||
nt|petergill: Dror Padon has done well to discard his @Ds to remove declarer's entry to dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: now cannot make 10 tricks anymore, had to play @c, not Q@s|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|peachy: kibs say should have eliminated clubs and spades first.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or i was thinking combine chances via top @H and if Queen doesn't fall then @D finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but shouldn't argue with success|pg||
pc|c7|nt|aupillon: good and straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|aupillon: for a push|pg||
nt|pelepele: hi|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello Charles. Nice boards here...:)|pg||
nt|z_lasu: now down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: well not quite..|pg||

nt|sundiszno: reverse flannery here|pg||
nt|korszurku: bd 6 was not good either, but the fault is in this room|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 4+ hearts, 5 spades, inv-|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs tend to go to where there are lots of specs.|pg||
nt|cicus: less aggressive 2@H in OR allowed them to find their spades|pg||
mb|5H|nt|peachy: reasonably:)|pg||
nt|neobas: E alerted 3NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Padon might have tried 3@s|pg||

nt|hobakan: 3 Trefl|pg||
nt|pelepele: 3nt maybe ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy bid for S,  |pg||
nt|gulyas: The x probably shows @H, as a xfer sequence|pg||
nt|gulyas: my guess:)|pg||
nt|othered1: might double have specifically shown @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe so |pg||
nt|Walddk3: and the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|blade: another thhin game....|pg||
nt|blade: looks like there is no defence against....maybe on a @d lead you get problems|pg||
nt|hedyg: better to play kokish here and be able to stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: now he should definitely bid 4|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the opps find their @c ruff 4@s goes down 2. Assuming the defense doesnt crash high @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and Barry|pg||
nt|sybarra: a "calm" hand compared to the others we have seen so far|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hi Vlad|pg||
nt|lokaty: yes, but only @D lead defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.pattayabridge.com/conventions/KokishRelay_main.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 7@D in S hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: now slam time|pg||
nt|aupillon: looking at @d position, Nt is MUCH better|pg||
nt|aupillon: look upon the club problem for 3NT now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but he decided he had extras|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt I would find the 2 @S call |pg||
nt|sundiszno: now he shouldn't ruff the @c lead|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if csaba wuill ead a @c|pg||
nt|cicus: he has to pass 2@C not try 2@S|pg||
nt|cicus: now no way back|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ovncylmz: hmm|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yet another slam for NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nor me  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see if his play justifies his bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: E finding it interesting that his pard has the A |pg||
nt|gulyas: anyway, they stayed away from the @H contract, a good start:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT is a slam try in @hs|pg||
nt|cicus: with a misfit the rule is: quit as soon as possible|pg||
nt|elbec: would have you passed with East cards? i would|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, E has no sensible bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H can be beaten now  and 6@S cold|pg||
nt|cicus: and this even goes down on the ruff|pg||
nt|cicus: if E believes S has 4 of them|pg||
nt|cicus: and zakes @H A immediately|pg||
nt|cicus: *takes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ovncylmz: junior bridge rulez|pg||

nt|eerdvegas: strange, just a normal game here|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 24hcp?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: well I think all national squads would bid here the game|pg||
nt|poohbear: In the Polish @c system how would West force to game if he wanted to?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: S must like his @d honours here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lokaty: 1C 1@D 2@D is any GF|pg||
nt|blade: 11 imps to norway for staying in 5@h, where 7@h is nearly 95%...bad luck...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if E turn to @h now I rhink you shod try the @h finess at ones|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT might dampen North's slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ahalim: and an easy one to play|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@c = cue - 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|ahalim: you simply cannot misquess @D's :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry misguess|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = non-serious about slam, hence 4@S cue later, since 3NT had already said that his hand was poor, so 4@C was a most serious slam try indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S = 1st or 2nd round spade control, denies 1st or 2nd round @D control due to bypassing 4@D, hence North needs to think now, knowing no @Da opposite|pg||
nt|hobakan: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but 4@s will be interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: and here it comes|pg||
nt|poohbear: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he would cuebid them N will take off now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mtvesuvius: The leaders at the moment are 1. Norway with 101 VPs 2. Germany with 95 VPs 3. France with 91 VPs|pg||
nt|petergill: North decides slam is a finesse and trump break at best, i.e. less than the required 50% |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Tarnovski now wants to sign off|pg||
nt|aupillon: 3NT would have been best as 3rd South bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: Wonder why east didn't lead partner's suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: even it was not a transfer sequence, (just a plain neg. X)   not sure what I would bid with S |pg||
nt|gulyas: good Q, he knew that pd had a singleton|pg||
nt|sundiszno: that starts to be a lot of imps to the poles...|pg||
nt|poohbear: At least thats what Nekrasova intended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- good pickup for Jansma|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikael_w: A1H and then AKJ in @s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cicus: true, E does not have much choice|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4 as dýþarýda iken zor|pg||

nt|eerbil: doðu'nun bu trefli boþlamasý gerekirdi|pg||
nt|aupillon: but O/W have to take tricks QUICK|pg||
nt|aupillon: E/W*|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather bid my AKx than my xxx:)|pg||
nt|mug: North appreciated his golden cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @h now... and declarer will play A@h and another one|pg||
nt|sundiszno: It is to be correct to try to shorten the long trump holding|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2: in OR both players downgraded their hands|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I can't believe thety are still playing the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Did everyone fall asleep, Florin?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: seems it was a revoke on clubs, director at table|pg||
nt|peachy: either that or everyone went for a Coke|pg||
nt|blade: hopefully board 6 brings us 12 back...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: then he has 8 tricks atleast|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bily: thx all go to work bye|pg||
nt|tomi2: west opened 1@S that could be light in a strong club system and E only invited|pg||
nt|ahalim: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow, well done|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Padon liked his club control and spots I bet|pg||
nt|petergill: Superficially, South might have passed 5@H, as the partnership might be off @DAK from South's point of view, but he takes the view that his hand could not be better and with no @DA ...|pg||
nt|petergill: nor @DK North would have bid 4@H not 4@C|pg||
nt|ahalim: albeit a little bit undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: U26 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: good duck, limiting the loss|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I see|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tomi2: bye|pg||
nt|petergill: In my opinion, slam is not that great a contract, a bit less than 50%, so reaching it is more good luck than good management, perhaps.|pg||

nt|pelepele: was 3@s best bid ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Very VERY dangerous board for France|pg||
nt|mug: so you think he will try to set up a cross-ruff, not try to develop diamonds?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then he knows West has 7-4 and it might help him|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: then @d to the ace will do it for him probably|pg||
nt|yuval10: he knows E has 1 or 2 @h's for not supporting|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel has won 10 imps on board 3|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW there found the unusual vulnerable sacrifice of 5@h|pg||
nt|mug: East was very bold there to raise partner's second suit at the five-level on Q-x-x|pg||
nt|yuval10: W there opened, as i suggested, 1@s|pg||
nt|mug: much prefer to open the longest suit myself|pg||
nt|blade: operator?|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems so|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: 3 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: he does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that room opening was 2@H which I suspect showed BOTH @H & @S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|ahalim: but you were young once too Peter ?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's not one I would be thrilled to be in, but it's pretty good|pg||
nt|mug: strong five-card suits look very nice until you have to ruff once or twice with them|pg||
nt|lokaty: 2@H was 6+@H almost GF or extremaly well 5card suit.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this was even better when W take the @dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: mistake by W, with A109x in @d he would have taken the J|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poohbear: as advertised:)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kastan88: West founs here good @S lead, as @D would give at once 3nT, usually not good to lead from 4TH Jxxx|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þimdi yapara geldi|pg||
nt|eerbil: artýk oldu|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the @C 10 coming down will help his cause|pg||

nt|sten: well bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: excellent bidding!!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky no @D ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: thats why I love this game:)|pg||
nt|cicus: still a big loss, already sealed by the bidding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: he will have to risk playing @D while there is still a trump out|pg||
nt|cicus: I think to double you'd have to have some sure tricks outside trumps|pg||
nt|cicus: else you could get easily endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly - i have nothing good to say about the 3@H opening  --  not because of @S length, but the combination of good @S and terrible @H|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree completely|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mikael_w: now he can even make this kontract depending on def|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E must have 9 @d, he cannot have the 10 or would have played it instead of the J|pg||
nt|mikael_w: good point Hedy|pg||
nt|sundiszno: * -to be :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 4 imps difference.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|laurentiu: not the best lead ... now it will be quiet easy for french pair to fulfill their contract|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|petergill: A long time ago I was as young as Adam, though when I was his age my bridge was terrible, compared to him.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore|pg||
nt|mikael_w: This was a rime when you shod not finess, Q would not lead @s from the Q in his life|pg||
nt|poohbear: Padon on side of the screen with volozhenin. so he didnt get the benefit of an alert. So he might have tried the sneak @c attack|pg||

nt|petergill: A superb effort by the young Israelis to double up 3@H at the other table with 3-2 holding in trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: An ambitious 4@S seems to have four losers|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I am told that EW are disputing the 6@H bid, saying there was a long delay before bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed and with a known fit in @S's too|pg||
nt|petergill: There did seem to be some (a short?) delay here on BBO before 5@H - I cannot remember how long. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I believe about 15 seconds, idk though|pg||
nt|eerbil: diðer odada da ayný hata olmuþ, trefl ataðý as ile alýnmýþ ve pik dönülmüþ ve batý pike devam etmiþ|pg||
nt|sybarra: they do need some imps |pg||
nt|namial1: 4 @h good contract but ...................|pg||
nt|z_lasu: not sure if this was the best line of playing this contract but successful|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 4@h here for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=733&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: live scores|pg||
nt|othered1: quite a nice result for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: all things considered a good + score for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk3: One of the defenders revoked when a club was played to the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and a 1 trick penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant quite hand 4 @H here |pg||
nt|xenya: no, it's a partscore hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=733&qroundno=7&qshowflag=1  Schools|pg||
nt|elbec: still playing board 4 in open room...|pg||
nt|tomi2: those flat hands are good for france now - Norway is behind in their match|pg||
nt|wwalter: this was a bid & play by England|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- interesting part of the imp scale there -- 5@H +650  5@H -100 only 4 imp diff|pg||
nt|cicus: only good to say that it was so weak it could preempt opps from 3NT or 5m|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: would not be saying only after the margin of victory that diamond had yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: muidberg?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: yes|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 5M 4+m?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Contract made|pg||
nt|peachy: at least it is a non-controversial ruling, mechanical 1 trick awarded|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so this is that kind of session when all cards are bad for dec ?|pg||
nt|wwalter: nice I ment|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+ any|nt|cascade: it is hard to imagine not getting to game|pg||
nt|othered1: do you act initially with west's hand?  |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, with so many @Ds available for EW|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like 3 @h is max for N/S and 3 @s is max for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: 6 cl on EW|pg||
nt|asig: 3@s asking for a spade stopper|pg||
nt|aupillon: here 4@s seem clearcut to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Here's a strong 2  but nobody plays them any more|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But S will never give up under 4 @h now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H=@S+@C|pg||
nt|neobas: 3@H was alerted|pg||
nt|wwalter:      Norway      Czech Republic   7   7   22       12   18|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|1S!|an|8+ HCP 5+!s|nt|hedyg: the dealer is generous today|pg||
mb|p|nt|eerdvegas: 4@S good save here , nobody will enter the bidding now I think|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: one italian and one norwegian pairs made 4@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Are screen in use?|pg||
nt|asig: Perfect hand for that gadget|pg||
nt|asig: Apparently W not playing this convention|pg||
nt|kastan88: West cant pass, only if South doubled|pg||
nt|aupillon: x|pg||
nt|aupillon: 2 @s only. Only 15 and 3 @h losers|pg||
nt|cascade: I prefer to bid my suits on this sort of hand but 2@c would be a common action|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, it is best to preempt, despite the 4c @H suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: took the pot with that preempt |pg||
nt|othered1: That's the modern approach, but I can't bring myself to do it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Ed,  had been drummed into me too long I am afraid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: are you sure its not @s+ any minor Hedy ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I like the bid Dbl on N:s hand here instead of 1 @d|pg||
nt|sundiszno: whoever will be the declarer here, will go down :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: OR N going down in 4@S last board|pg||
nt|sundiszno: that sounds bad|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT forcing?|pg||
nt|cicus: now they aren't going to miss this one|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mtvesuvius: I think so|pg||
nt|kastan88: oh, no|pg||
nt|asig: NS can make 4@S and can only get 300 against 3@s undoubled - so a possible gain for Germany|pg||
nt|hedyg: the French tend to play modified Ghestem, not Michaels|pg||
nt|korszurku: oh no - that is kind of like a blitz now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Hungery need a short break here, and rake some air and then start all over I think|pg||
nt|mikael_w: This is a good rime ro go to the bathroom |pg||
nt|sten: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|sten: 6-11 hp|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: sometimes it can be bad|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what now shirley?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok|pg||
nt|elbec: 4 top tricks for the defence in this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  I thought NS played artificial responses to 1@C -- similar to their teammates Greco-Hampson|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: 1@c responses: 1@d=0-7 any, 1@h=any 8-11 <5@s, 1@s=8+ HCP 5+@s|pg||
nt|cicus: haven't Greco-Hampson reverted to natural responses?|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, 1@S does not promise 12+ any more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right maybe just the 1@H response :(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kastan88: but 5@C on EW stay|pg||
nt|MolvaM: briç hatalar oyunudur. az hata yapan kazanýr demiþ ünlü 1 amerikalý dünya þampiyonu|pg||
nt|gulyas: my drummer told me to preempt when I can:)|pg||
nt|othered1: side @C suit instead of @H and I'd preempt.|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they ruffed the @cQ-lead, and we still went down...|pg||
nt|korszurku: this is when they should call for the trainer|pg||
nt|korszurku: I like this new rule in tennis|pg||
nt|korszurku: when you can call for the trainer during the match|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is 3@s?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not 3NT?|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: ...|pg||
nt|sten: doubleton preference without 5c minor or 4-5c hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: because he wana play more....|pg||
nt|hedyg: great to have you here Sten :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eerbil: eller uyutmaya yönelik geliyor, nerede bi önceki maçta gelen 8'li, 10'lu renkler :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1NT is a transfer to 2@C I believe|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Grönkvist could not be bothered and rebid is 7-card suit|pg||
nt|korszurku: like a time-out in a team sport|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they cannot see the result|pg||
nt|sten: I think|pg||
nt|cicus: very good idea|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: The reason for it is 1@c-1@h// 2m auctions are now more efficient|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right, Owen.  I should have said: "only" 4 imps difference.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking more like meckwell responses|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vipe1: hello everyone :).|pg||
nt|vipe1: interesting bidding so far.|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW missed 4@s here, but obviously it's not easy to get there|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c overcall would've made it a lot easier|pg||
nt|yuval10: if EW doesn't decide to sit for it with X , that is|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Rimstedt could give it a try, but it's not attractive at all from her hand|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps West underbid|pg||
nt|mug: suppose she had visions of @SAQ10 on her left|pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks iseems to be the limit here|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe just 8 on this lead?|pg||
nt|poohbear: best lead. Defense has time to prevent a @d ruff. Declarer can counter by trying to set up a @c but that doesnt work|pg||
nt|sybarra: take a look at bd 3  !   3nt made 6!|pg||
nt|xenya: on a @S lead, yes|pg||
nt|sundiszno: in tennis, you immediately see it |pg||
nt|korszurku: not allowed at the majors I am told|pg||
nt|poohbear: all slams on the @s finesse though @ds you might cope with 4-1 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: If so, 15 seconds is not considered to be a hesitation - also, with screens, the hesitation exists only if it is pointed out by the opponent on the side of the screen that did not ...|pg||
nt|petergill: hesitate, by EBL (Euro) and WBF regulation. |pg||
nt|petergill: So my guess is that the 6@H score will stand  - just guessing, as a commentator is entitled to do.|pg||
nt|petergill: I can confirm that screens are in use|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Steve Eginton|pg||
nt|eggy: Hi everypne|pg||
nt|cicus: they play Meckwell light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right but i thought RM Lite used more artificial responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|cicus: it does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure wish i could convince somebody to share a copy of the notes :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT shows 12+ with @Hs|pg||
nt|cicus: 2m is nat, 12+|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: 2@h=14+ Balanced, 2@s=12+ any 4441, 2NT=12-13 Balanced|pg||
nt|cicus: so they have inverted 2@H and 2NT as well|pg||
nt|cicus: tat's called evolution|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, intelligent design...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree that you have to work on your system continuously, to find the most effective ways|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great info -- thanks Owen!!!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelepele: nice lead for north|pg||
nt|sten: thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: talkin bot last hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that an 'anti-double', no help in diamonds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c would show @S+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hi eggy!|pg||
nt|lokaty: yes, because of "juniors" multi opening with 5 card suit:(|pg||
nt|blade: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To be fair, she has no help anywhere :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: oysa türkiyede her maçý sýfýr hata ile oynadýðýný iddia eden briççiler vardýr çok sayýda.|pg||
nt|murat: yok mudur ? :) :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: an overtrick i suppose|pg||
nt|sundiszno: @h now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: funny thing. Hungerys only 2 IMP. They got on the board I thought was going to be rhe most expensive board for them :)|pg||
nt|cicus: N was right with his 3NT...|pg||
nt|tomi2: does somebody know their agreements about the 2NT bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a great ad for the system.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: System foul-up here, diamond thought 3NT asked for side 4-card suit, and platnick meant 3NT as balanced slam try|pg||
nt|santyclz: The technical term for this is:  The wheels fell off.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Director is being summoned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier to use grandma's term     oy|pg||
nt|cicus: will they be forced to bid the slam?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who called??|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ed Shapiro:  Part of an intelligently designed system is that it can be remembered by players who choose to use it.  This flunked.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other match   Meltzer 12  Lynch 10  only 55 boards left to play|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: then it is the Q of 3@D or 4@D in this vuln:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the total of 2 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 2N is many types|pg||
nt|elbec: club lead or switch after a diamond lead sets the contract|pg||
nt|elbec: 3nt, i mean|pg||
nt|cicus: but it also goes down, and  on a club lead not even 1|pg||
nt|elbec: 19-0 for Isreal after 4 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Lead has been made, no director, and no ekeblad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they did push board 8 in 6@S|pg||
nt|cicus: well only declarer is needed here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and pushed  8  ---  in 4@H making 5|pg||
nt|cicus: TD and Ekebald having a smoke break|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Ekeblad and Director just returned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: aha   director called to escort|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eerbil: umut dünyasý, ya oynayan alýrsa :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: france was in lead since round 13|pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess Bell took the pass on 4@S als forcing and expected some stronger hand as Dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: I think 2NT must be to invite|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Director called for time penalty purposes if it comes to that so he knows that diamond took so much time on this hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead was going to be more of a challenge |pg||
nt|sten: yes it is|pg||
nt|hedyg: well it was alerted|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: certainly seems to be forcing|pg||
nt|sten: GF with either a one-suiter or a two-suiter with 5+-4|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|elbec: it hasn't been a wonderful start for my friends|pg||
mc|12|nt|petergill: If the hesitation was over 20 (or is it 25 or 30, I cannot remember) seconds, as it may have been, it is considered to be a valid hesitation with screens in use.|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess he will lose 1@H and 2@S more, for just making|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes bt "invite+" or only "inv"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eke will take a little time to figure out no way to beat 4@S :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-10 HCP, (5)6 @H or @S  -- no strong variants|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: There's been a little discussion about NS needing to give EW the multi defense, and Dubinin just alerted 2@d even though it was still on the other side of the screen :)|pg||

nt|cascade: lets see how optimistic the Polish are|pg||
nt|namial1: 3 NT or 5 @d ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@D|pg||
nt|wwalter: @d, but how many? :)|pg||
nt|cascade: it looks too good for you Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It all depends on the response to 1@H. 2@D and you are there, 1@S and it will be difficult|pg||
nt|cascade: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I prefer 2@D (your longer suit) when you are strong enough to force to game, and South is|pg||
nt|cascade: I like almost always to bid my six-card suit with this much strength|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For new viewers: Poland need to win by at least 13 IMPs to overtake France and win the gold medal|pg||
nt|wwalter: & needs 8 VP 4 the second place|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13-16 imps is a split tie but Poland wins gold|pg||
nt|liviu123: yes after this i agree with you|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: another routine game, although it could be down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: if declarer is not a rabbi :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: 5 imps for Sweden board 5|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|sundiszno: but beleive me, this is a good team, just this is a bad day for them|pg||

nt|tomi2: this is a nice hand - facing a passed partner Lorenzini decided to open 4@C having a 4 card majors side suit but it loos like he missed a makeable 4@S now|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: at the table is Nyrolph may he knows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D  longer @D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|laurentiu: if they play the queen of trump|pg||
nt|aupillon: 2NT is the redid now|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like capp |pg||
nt|cicus: they may still find 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 5+@H and 4+@D  EW open 2@D|pg||
mb|5D|nt|asig: ok|pg||
nt|kastan88: NS playing 5@S doubled so -1 and 5 IMPs more for Denmark|pg||
nt|aupillon: b*|pg||
nt|vipe1: polish club from east, natural 1@s, can have longer diamonds, 1NT 11-14 |pg||
nt|korszurku: two pairs out of three have had no imternational experience untill now and not even much experience playing tournaments in Hungary|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: I'm not actually at the table Micke :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice interference from NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades I presume|pg||
nt|mikael_w: why not Dbl on S hand over 3 @c ?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: it wasn't unexpected, I expected good results from them, they worked hard before the EYC, and they are good players|pg||
nt|mikael_w: aha ok Bas :) worth a try|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes, @s suit lost|pg||
nt|korszurku: looks like all of us are for Hungary now - Mikael too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: aymeric ... u have to correct me, as long as french is not my mother tongue|pg||
nt|aupillon: 10@h anyone ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: the standard lead|pg||
nt|pelepele: hope a@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know, eggy means The Channel Trophy|pg||
nt|z_lasu: this match is a good start for Polish juniors who defend European title|pg||
nt|mug: for me 2@H would be a strong bid, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I don't think even I would do that :)|pg||
nt|ozgull: bizim gençlere vugraph iyi geliyor sanki  sizler ne dersiniz?|pg||

nt|aupillon: Do I play 1NT ? ( asked The Rabbi, in David Bird's book)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4@S a bit of a stretch opposite a single raise |pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d natural and gf|pg||
nt|korszurku: it is natural to sympathize with the team 44 behind...|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only gains 2 imps [assuming they cash @S]|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 much needed IMPs for @D|pg||

pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: 1 imp'yi nelere vermiyoruz|pg||

nt|ahalim: and this is a contract Idid not expect|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyoone understand this auction?|pg||
nt|othered1: west sort of looks like he's making relays.|pg||
nt|sybarra: its the 2 @C bid I do not understand |pg||
nt|othered1: artificial game force?|pg||
nt|gulyas: my thoughts exactly|pg||
nt|peachy: agree, not even a singleton anywhere|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Best defence will yield 500|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm letting South hold trick may mean ok to switch to @C|pg||
nt|cicus: does N want a shift?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Gabor --- we both agree Platnick should overtake and cash 2nd @S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: that's  a shame , the Danes didnt even score on Neilsen's good board, 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he played it so well |pg||
nt|sybarra: no rewards sometimes|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all,  I have a lunch commitment,   must leave |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Any idea why Zimmermann opened 1@C rather than 2@H?|pg||
nt|blade: they play strong @c..no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with transfer responses? Unusual|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@D and @H?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eerdvegas: dutch squad haves 50 VP out of 3 matches with a bye(18VP)|pg||

nt|blade: yes..they do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they do|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then shift to the @c.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eggy: This could be good for them too as EW can make plenty|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bye |pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of the @H k to be on side |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They will bid it now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hi George and Krzysztof|pg||
nt|snetram: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: I warn you    I am 100% Irish|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm i would have played @H before @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: oooooops partial then!|pg||
nt|korszurku: and about to be even more with bd 8 yet to be scored|pg||
nt|sundiszno: I'd rather see everyone sympathize with poland than...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or -- knows @C trick(s) won't go away|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eggy: Bye Shirl|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Takes a club switch while hearts are still stopped|pg||
pc|dT|nt|laurentiu: if we translate my fellow's aymeric nickname this will be - night flight :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: easy claim for 6 now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I doubt anyone could have predicted this contract|pg||
nt|petergill: (1) they are not afraid to penalise you (2) they will take their tricks on defence and (3) your interference might help them figure out the layout if they become declarer|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yeah, although I probably should change that :)|pg||
nt|blade: all their system is unusual...but they love it....and opps not.--..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D asking for @SQ|pg||
nt|elbec: or @h|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: good start |pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
nt|othered1: and this should now make|pg||
nt|othered1: a non-@C return should tell east what he needs to know.|pg||
nt|cicus: because he was a passed hand and  anyway, where are opener's points?|pg||
mc|11|nt|eggy: difficult for EW to get in though unless west makes a minimum off shape x ...|pg||
nt|eggy: or East comes in at red with S unlimites|pg||

nt|eggy: So -50 has a great chance of scoring well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so that this point Poland has enough to win the event|pg||
nt|Walddk4: However, 11 boards to go, a lot can happen|pg||
nt|z_lasu: maybe first imps to Romania at board 9|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 1NT EW looks like normal contract here|pg||
nt|vipe1: looks like a 4@s board|pg||
nt|sybarra: stiff A of @H in the other hand this time |pg||
nt|blade: nex time @h are 3-3 and with "your" crossruff West overruffs the @c....|pg||
nt|blade: then would have siad how to play the hand....|pg||
nt|sundiszno: than it must be 2 imps for us!!!!!!|pg||
nt|neobas: Yes. but that would mean he had 1@D left|pg||
nt|neobas: In any event, a @D from dummy wins, not the @CJ :)|pg||
nt|neobas: 2@D was alerted by N|pg||
nt|hedyg: then, if after A@s opps play 3@Hs he could make it|pg||

nt|aupillon: Can i go reach for a light to search ? Yes, driver said. Meanwhile he went away ( the driver). There was no 50£ bill. So the taxi was for free :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 1@S cannot hold 5@S & 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|liviu123: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=4&qshowflag=1    for running scores|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|laurentiu: easy 3 nt or 4 spade|pg||
nt|po-s: now 3D and North will get excited|pg||
nt|eggy: some might shade East as 1NT, but not the French usually, who are very disciplined as a rule|pg||
nt|peachy: 2level the max either side can make, looks like|pg||
nt|daman: I see 6 tricks     7 should be there by default|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer may assume 4@ss in S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: sry Adam|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 straight plus scores by NS with 1100 just then - I think EW might feel a bit down at the moment. :(|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'll bet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's looks like a support X from east|pg||
nt|eggy: and 2NT a values raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and slam aspirations from robert?|pg||
nt|eggy: probably facing a weak NT, so will need perfect cards|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: misunderstanding seems previous brd again, 5@D without double, seems E made forcing pass, but West didn't play again that convention|pg||
nt|MolvaM: saðolsunlar :)|pg||
nt|murat: bu arada içerdeki masada rakipler çok agresif deklere veriyorlar.. bizimkiler bi yakalasa...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and bd 4,  other room settled for 3 nt  instead of stretching to 6 @C |pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h asking for a stopper but why cant it be natural?|pg||
nt|poohbear: just because South has 4 doesnt mean that west cant have 7 solid|pg||
nt|neobas: W alerted 4@C now, E didn't|pg||
nt|santyclz: Giving pd a chance to go wrong is as great an error as going wrong yourself.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR 5@S and 4@C [that opens 2@C]|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: but 4sp is quiet difficult on heart lead|pg||
nt|laurentiu: and imp for Romania !!! :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: I keep my hope alive! :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes but NS biidng his void|pg||
nt|eggy: I am told that by S 2 spades is 3 card support and 10+|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was NOT forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but opener only passes with minimum 5@S(332)|pg||
nt|cicus: this can be set via taking trumps separately on a little cross-ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Mark Horton|pg||
nt|vipe1: about half of the tables made 4@s, half of them went down. 4@s-1 in open room is a good result for russia so far.|pg||
nt|daman: but he has to something   will probably play for the drop|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: S playing 6@S last board|pg||
nt|mikael_w: brb|pg||
nt|sundiszno: well, not 2 imps for us|pg||
nt|mikael_w: omg|pg||
nt|charles_l: trf responses?|pg||
nt|sten: you're quite right Hedy|pg||
nt|charles_l: ty|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, even may go down losing 3@Ds with a ruff|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact i can't see E can do anything to prevent that|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is a bad lead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5+@D|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: When you feel down, it is hard to avoid giving back more imps. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H is a sound contract, should make it and go plus, we hope|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@H is a nice spot, maybe an overtrick with the @h position|pg||
nt|petergill: I approve of both Wests deciding not to make a bold vulnerable 2@H overcall of 1@S. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Craciun tells me that the Director has adjusted board 7|pg||
nt|aupillon: Have a nice day all, see you soon. Tks Charles and be right back tomorrow. Thanks all specs. Merci|pg||
nt|eggy: so this is a 4 card raise with 10+|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Robert has to pass, no interest by East|pg||
nt|eggy: Not sure that after 5@H this i even a think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Glorious sunshine in Bath|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 3NT could be made here|pg||

nt|daman: do*|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mtvesuvius: to 5@h +1|pg||
nt|po-s: wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: only 8 tricks in NT, and 10 in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wait a minute, @DQ drops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 3NT is there|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|eggy: after all East is limited to 3 cards in hearts, so setting up the diamond suit may not even be that straightforward|pg||
nt|cascade: hmmm cold and frosty here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@s shows 3?|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder you can't make Wuermseer co-operate|pg||
nt|santyclz: Just like the dread "semi-forcing nt" in Aces Scientific and similar systems.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: In the other match on BBO, Owen for England and Ozturk both overcalled 2@H over 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well Neilsen might lead A@S|pg||
nt|vipe1: i guess 2@c is gazzili, either weak hand with 5@h4@c or a strong hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 HCP, no major fit = 3N.  May make, too.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, and this should make exactly|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile the Israeli team have built up a commanding lead, having outdone their oponents on almost every board|pg||
nt|daman: low @D gives the opps timing|pg||

nt|sundiszno: could have been|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eggy: As Julien Clement says - 4S was possibly exclusion ..|pg||
nt|eggy: so a spade lead would not be sensible|pg||
nt|eggy: and S has told N to lead something alse anyway|pg||
nt|vipe1: this now shows strong hand with 3@s, nekrasova simply raises to 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D, 3 @C, (maybe) 1 in each major |pg||
nt|gulyas: if he tries to play it safe by finessing @Ds into the S hand to avoid the @S thru, he may go down|pg||
nt|cicus: good defence, @H entry retained|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: entries to dummy for @H finesses and to run diamonds are scarce, if @DA is ducked on the first round of @Ds|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|eggy: Although his hand is very tempting, I think that West took control too early really|pg||

nt|petergill: A desperate attempt to remove the entry to the @Ds|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: tough to know that though|pg||
nt|sundiszno: i am a little bit hopeless|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
pc|d8|nt|mtvesuvius: K@C to kill the @d entry looked right|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||

nt|sundiszno: sorry for that|pg||
nt|elbec: now he can't :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kastan88: 6@C quite problematic witn @H lead: if you collect trumps, then you have only 4@H+4@C+1@S+1@D+1 ruff= 11 tricks, if play at once for @D A finesse, then def will get @H ruff|pg||
nt|daman: I think he was always going to get his 7 tricks before the got theirs|pg||
nt|daman: they*|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@S is needed here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sundiszno: but still this is a good team, and they will recover from here, for the next match|pg||

nt|chessmaste: The big difference on this deal was that East did not bid in the Open Room|pg||
nt|wwalter: this was strange|pg||
nt|cascade: hmmm what happened there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did she really go down?|pg||
nt|wwalter: ADI?|pg||
nt|cascade: didnt seem possible|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: looked like declarer made a mistake and went down|pg||
nt|namial1: what happened ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perhaps the play was different from what we saw|pg||
nt|namial1: clubs ruff ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sometimes it's very difficult for the operator to follow the play|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: im in rama room entering exactly what i see, so i dont know more than you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So we must give him the benefit of the doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: but final scores are right|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, excellent|pg||
nt|snetram: they need 3 tempo, no way|pg||
nt|daman: no   but that didn't happen|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ireland got on the bd on bd 8|pg||
nt|mikael_w: it was not to late after the @s lead|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT or 4@H on this one?|pg||
nt|sten: well played again|pg||
nt|hedyg: Norway making 3NT on bd 9, @d lead taken in hand, K@S taken with ace and @H switch, opps played 3@hs..|pg||
nt|hedyg: the exact scenario described earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice defense.|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT?|pg||
mb|1N|an|13+-16|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: We had a few of those yesterday in Cardiff|pg||
nt|charles_l: open 4@h?|pg||
nt|hedyg: correct declarer play and the slip by opps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another upgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: 2 spades shows 5Mc and at least 4mc|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT|pg||
nt|snetram: standard 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Should Drijver have known to switch to a diamond rather than a club? Not sure. Michielsen just encouraged, which was not helpful|pg||
nt|cicus: little systemic  disaster|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: see you later folks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bye for now|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS can make 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C  or 6 nt?|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is hard to bid the @SJ:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggests 7 @S |pg||
nt|gulyas: nice idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I will be there |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Looks like he took the 5 as a suit preference signal for clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a few weeks ago   a commentator said   "+" & "good" means they open ALL hands with that count :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|laurentiu: a good defence against 5 hearts|pg||
nt|eggy: Values are a bit thin, but 4C looks tempting for West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Due to the lucky position of @DQ, 5@C also makes. The Swedes bid and made it against Bulgaria|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Back, the players took a small break and so did I, but they were back faster :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ovncylmz: 5@d and 3nt making|pg||
nt|eggy: He's done well|pg||
nt|eggy: so far |pg||
nt|eggy: He may have guessed that the hand is duplicated as my friend Sejr suggests|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H making|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ovncylmz: hmm|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: no X?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think Wayne supports England, but he must be happy to see that Australia did not win|pg||
nt|cascade: lol|pg||
nt|cascade: they should have declared earlier|pg||
nt|mug: quite natural methods the Israeli NS play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s looks weird|pg||
nt|mug: for many juniors 2@D would be part of Drury|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they should make 3@c here|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3NT is on as the cards lie|pg||
nt|sundiszno: very light openeing 3rd seat|pg||
nt|neobas: I wonder why W bid 3@H instead of 3@S...|pg||
nt|elbec: 22-0 the results now and more imps coming to Israel|pg||
nt|elbec: again 4 top tricks for the defence...|pg||
nt|elbec: but they should be fast catching them|pg||
nt|cicus: I think N could have just invited with 3@Cs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: amaaaaaaa|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu masada yapýlan 2 büyük defans hatasýnýn diðer odada kapatýlmasý maçý hala az da olsa önde götürmemizi saðlýyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: az önce polyanna nýn da belirttiði gibi 4@h yaptý bizimkliler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dolayýsý ile 3nt felaketini de hasarsýz atlattýk|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet þu ana kadar Þehmus ercan ve mehmet güney gündoðdu çok baþarýlý gidiyorlar aferin|pg||
nt|ozgull: bakalým 6 cl diyecekler mi|pg||

nt|hobakan: geçtilerse tamamdýr|pg||
nt|murat: as soruldu|pg||
nt|mug: agreed, North should pass|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, it may have been a misunderstanding even|pg||
nt|hedyg: W would need a stronger hand to bid 3@c, thus 2@H=5+|pg||
nt|elbec: 3rd card now ;)|pg||
nt|cicus: now correct size of opening card|pg||
nt|elbec: exact|pg||
nt|cicus: :)|pg||
nt|elbec: a diamond switch shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|eggy: the problem with bidding 3H 1st time though , is that he's got a problem biding now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The youngsters like to bid. One can argue with that is a 2@H overcall after a strong NT|pg||
nt|Walddk3: *if|pg||
nt|daman: @S lead is not useful|pg||
nt|daman: any lead is ugly|pg||
nt|hedyg: i wonder though, with his primes isnt the E hand more suitable for 4@H?|pg||
nt|daman: except a @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: @D lead is excluded from the bidding|pg||
nt|snetram: 12 tricks without play|pg||
nt|daman: no kidding|pg||
nt|cicus: @D switch should not be difficult|pg||
nt|tomi2: that 6@H hand was flat because French bid 5@H and went down there, similar bidding problem for them|pg||
nt|cicus: I have never seen anyone not finding an excuse to upgrade|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate that, to tell the truth|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: @hs could easily be a better trump suit  . Has to have a @s fit|pg||
nt|charles_l: E may X|pg||
nt|hedyg: he thinks he has the down trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: this isnt good for Norway  imo |pg||
nt|gulyas: you need to relay somebody's hand out to be able to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt looked quantitative |pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: bu arada önceki elde büyü yaparak, dua ederek, reiki yaparak veya diðer bilimsel yollarla 4@hün yapýlmasýný saðlayan seyircilerimize de teþekkür|pg||
nt|vipe1: seems like a normal 4@s. interesting how some pairs ended in 3NT, sadly we don't have auction from other room|pg||
nt|vipe1: some=two :)|pg||
nt|neobas: E overcalled 2@S, seems like there is at least a 5-3 fit...|pg||

nt|eggy: N is wishing he'd kept his outh shut now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is, in theory, 15-17, but ....|pg||
pc|cT|nt|asig: good stop by EW here|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unusual for quantitative bidding to come a cropper here.  If north had gotten the long suit into the auction, south would have been very interested|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Rimstedt had her bid and will be disappointed that this is not making|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway did not bid slam on 9|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gulyas: but if S has a minimum, N should have bid slam already|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree, he should have brought @Cs to the picture|pg||
nt|gulyas: into I mean|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know what range south showed here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not how to bring the clubs in do you guys have suggestions?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd consider south's hand 22+, and I'm not a habitual upgrader|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand is good enough for four NT, so transfer to @C, if available, then 4N.|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would say it is a very pretty 22|pg||
nt|gulyas: if his bidding shows 22+, N should have bid slam with his good 10|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N openings (directly or via 2@C) require very precise methods/agreements to unwind hands like this.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 3 @C over 2 @C?|pg||
nt|othered1: They do hog quite a bit of room and today's style doesn't require perfect shape, so . . . |pg||
nt|sten: he is getting disappointed when declarer ruffs the club|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cicus: here the 5-card suit may be a plus but Qxx in @Ds ids a minus|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|eggy: and so ends up taking a losing action|pg||
nt|Walddk3: unless ....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Michielsen has to guess who has @SJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was easy to make 12 tricks after West tried a second club honour. But remember that he was trying to beat 5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney dünkü maçýda çok baþarýlý oynadýlar|pg||
nt|eggy: One principle of pushing is that you are making the opponents guess|pg||
nt|yuval10: many players here play 2@d as 9-11 with 3 cards support|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i never though NS are one of them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is one -- in Eke system  1N=14+ to 17   and Pamela Granovetter said during Senior Trials that Matthew almost NEVER upgrades|pg||
pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: bu elde sorun yok. 7 trefl bekliyoruz :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And he did not know about the singleton in the South hand as South was declarer|pg||
nt|blade: needs exact defence now...tough...|pg||
nt|blade: @hAK...@sA and @s...dont think he can find that?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|yuval10: appearently neither did S :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: well done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eggy: so that when they do, you shouldn;t usually end up taking a guess yourself|pg||
nt|hedyg: test the @hs and play A@C and 10@c|pg||

nt|mikael_w: and 3 @s is far away from easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: btw, in my view, they must alert their 1NT saying: we always upgrade|pg||
mb|2H!|an|5+!h 4+!c|nt|eggy: I doubt the auction will be similar in the open room - for a start, I'd be very surprised should S open 3@C|pg||

nt|vipe1: nice result in open room for poland, most pairs play 3@c|pg||
nt|snetram: 6331 with short in clubs - very bad|pg||
nt|mikael_w: big risk that N/S will come ro 4 @h here and its ded|pg||
nt|hedyg: E could have "invented" 2@s or 3@c as forcing over 2@H, i think that was his only choice|pg||
nt|korszurku: 1NT is either a miscklick or they have lowered their NT level :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: something was missed in the play|pg||

mb|d|nt|eerbil: sistemleri sonucu karo kaybolmuþ durumda ama|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and opening hand less than 1@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly qualifies on that count.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for history/system geeks -- which system first introduced that 2@H opening??|pg||
nt|cicus: roman club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WINNER|pg||
mb|3H|nt|blade: another slam....but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not particularly interesting when all of a sudden we just have a claim. They can't have played it that fast|pg||
nt|blade: 2@d from S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not blaming the operator. He is just copying what he sees on a big screen|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 16-1|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and what to bid over 2@d?|pg||
nt|poohbear: if 3@s is a splinter then West should be hating his hand|pg||

nt|poohbear: or else 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he did, unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 6@c isn't a bad spot|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mtvesuvius: but the @hs are troublesome|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 11: The Israeli interference at the other table helped guide the Belgians to the good 3NT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Woops|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I agree whith W here that his hand is even worth a 15-17 NT. But this rime he stoped N/S to reach imposible 4 @h|pg||
nt|neobas: 7@H off because @CK is offside, 6@H is on though|pg||
nt|sten: yes, but probably right declarer play|pg||
nt|sten: unless you see all four hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: now @hAx lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you lead A@H when you want to ruff @D?|pg||
nt|charles_l: protect pd's @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass over 3@d is positive in @D i believe, they seem to play undouble|pg||
nt|sten: but will the bidding end in 4h?|pg||
nt|charles_l: on bidding E has red suits|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eerbil: karo ataðý bekliyoruz|pg||
nt|hobakan: karo ataðýna da trefl gitse|pg||
nt|peachy: Hope you all enjoy the match in the gallery.  It is 1:35AM here and I must get some sleep... Thank you kibitzers for your helpful comments|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I guess you can make slam if you know the layout, but it's not laydown by any means|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Thanks and good night, Raija|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you for having me over:)|pg||
nt|xenya: too fast :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|MolvaM: kör rua ataðý daha iyi|pg||
nt|murat: bu olur mu :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu da olur np|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu da olur|pg||
nt|MolvaM: aslýnda antre sorunu var|pg||
nt|eerbil: iki sürkup ve trefl asý verecek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama gene de normal oyuna 4 pik batmaz|pg||
nt|vipe1: seems it ends in 3NT here too|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@h - 3@h is a strong hand with club|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|laurentiu: it seems that will be 3 down |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: ly 3 diam!|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: only!!!|pg||
nt|z_lasu: Romanian pair playing 3nt at board 9|pg||
nt|z_lasu: only one pair have won it already, but unfortunately they partners played 3d X -7 :)|pg||
nt|mug: you'd think over the double East would have sufficient opportunity to express pessimism that West wouldn't have to reraise|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: depends if pass or 2@s is stronger over the double though|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, E has XX, 2@h , P available|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but I agree with a 4333 minimum that east has a pass|pg||
nt|mug: so perhaps 2@H should be natural, pass should be so-so, and 2@S should be garbage|pg||
nt|mug: I've never discussed the meaning of redouble|pg||
nt|blade: oh....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@c - 3@c i meant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can that Open Room auction be right???|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some serious overbidding in the open room.|pg||
nt|poohbear: what you see is what you get|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson psychs 3rd seat 14-16 NT  ---  go figure|pg||
nt|cicus: Hampson may have tried a little psyche|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eggy: N will need to duck the club smothly to have  chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes the strong clubber's will get there |pg||
nt|Walddk2: juniors|pg||
nt|blade: no its interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this time *|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about possible 5@C? needs a @c lead to beat it?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: everybody psykes at the same board now :)|pg||
nt|neobas: That board with the TD, apparently 3NT was a @S cue there|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer needs to negotiate @cs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Barry, welcome.|pg||
nt|cicus: he's getting away with it - for only 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|cicus: or maybe 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this rate -- getting away with losing only 4 just translates to just losing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: yani sorun yoktur|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vipe1: seems it makes on this lay of cards, quite lucky i'd say :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: ty WW:)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|namial1: Difficult lead|pg||
nt|chris3108: goooooooooo france :) |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, declarer is still a trick short|pg||
nt|cascade: but the defense need to get their spade tricks|pg||
nt|chris3108: euh sorry :) |pg||
nt|cascade: and they need to do that now|pg||
nt|wwalter: now needs to play 1s|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But I think North must now play spades |pg||
nt|cascade: she may think a diamond is safe|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She has a count in the diamond suit|pg||
nt|korszurku: I am suprised to see N pass over the weak NT however|pg||
nt|sundiszno: a kib said 2@h, and maybe play in 4-2...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am MORE suprised ro see N turn a LOW @d after rhe A|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ovncylmz: back*|pg||
nt|eggy: well done|pg||
nt|blade: X from W?...in the moment I cannot follow...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why on earth does Johansen think he can best 4@H??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: beat|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think 5 @c will be ealy hard to make whith any lead ?|pg||
nt|neobas: 5@S asking for kings, 5NT showing 1|pg||
nt|cicus: he won't do it in every board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eggy: that won;t help the defence though|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: All one or two spec who may have read Precision Power Bidding (not about Precision @C  system, which was developed much later) have heard about the Theory of Bounded Values, which ...|pg||
nt|othered1: applies here.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: exept maybe @d|pg||
nt|neobas: 1 King, because @HK is a keycard and thus one of five aces|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 3NT could be "serious". I don't know the E-W methods|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe PO Sundelin does|pg||
nt|blade: for a @d lead?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: 4@D was blackwood for @D and 5@C was 2 keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: what about israel performance?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: denmark and israel are not good if you think their original level|pg||
nt|eggy: although he may try a ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|cascade: now attitude in spades|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well done indeed!|pg||
nt|sybarra: here a make |pg||
nt|poohbear: On a @h lead best for West to play the Q and declarer has to guess what to do|pg||
nt|lokaty: would have to guess after @H lead and putting the queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok the question is: do you all pass 2@c as S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd bid 2@c nat vulnerable|pg||
nt|snetram: no, i bid 2H|pg||
nt|poohbear: there are various ways to play @cs. Can play a @c to the J and if that wins a @c to the 9|pg||
nt|hedyg: check the spotcards in @s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cascade: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They are very ambitious at the other table I am told. Verbeek-Molenaard are in 7@H!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Molenaar|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense can counter with a @c shif tthough|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are claiming |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s was the spot|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a @H lead beats 3N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Natural bidding up to and including 4@C, 3@D suggesting 1435 shape, I think|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This should be a push|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: With no way to set @s up, and @h overruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@d and 4@S look like cue-bids, with clubs agreed. |pg||
nt|po-s: don´t think they play serious. 2spades showed heart acceptance I think (if they play my NT methods)|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I believe would have denied shortness|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt N just have to hold up the @H to make 3 nt? |pg||
nt|sundiszno: if partner has @ds 2@c will turn out to be bad|pg||
nt|korszurku: this could be a pickup if N-S get to 3NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: or a @c to the Q and if that wins  duck a @c |pg||
nt|poohbear: if either loses then best to play for 3-3|pg||
nt|poohbear: or Dbltn 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to be honest in he did know that partnership held AT MOST 20 HCP|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petergill: South's final choice of 6@C is a bit exuberant, but would be fine if dummy had @CJ or @DQ. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or Q@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 tricks if only he could get to dummy to enjoy the spade tricks - somehow. But he cannot|pg||
nt|ahalim: still too optimistic|pg||
nt|wwalter: nice|pg||
nt|namial1: good switch|pg||
nt|cascade: so more IMPs to Poland|pg||
nt|vipe1: didn't let her gues how to play it, A@s AK@h A@d and five clubs.|pg||
nt|vipe1: *guess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2: they have played 3 of 23 matches...|pg||
nt|eggy: great result for teh Danes in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, but even then he only has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@d was a mistake|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blade: he/she gets what he/she derserves for that X..I am sorry...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I say 2 @h may work in E/W in rhier 4-4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hobakan: üste çakýldýðýný biliyordu büyük ihtimal|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: provided that declarer follows twice|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: he|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I bid 2@h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vipe1: she hid the longest suit :)|pg||
nt|blade: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars Arthur Johansen|pg||
nt|mikael_w: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Had Padon ducked smoothly..................................|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Ah, the optimism of youth :)|pg||
nt|blade: so..then it was necessary to bid the slam...|pg||
nt|blade: not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, that would also have been doubled, and redoubled :)|pg||
nt|blade: and costs then?|pg||
nt|blade: dont know this score---|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2070|pg||
nt|blade: ok|pg||
nt|sundiszno: partner played the Q, if that is singleton, declarer has stoppers anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|po-s: I think West should have bid slam with 3 and not 0 aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer-Lynch, playing same boards  12-15|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hobakan: valla +1 bize uyar|pg||
nt|z_lasu: +2 looks too much|pg||
nt|z_lasu: something must go wrong in defence|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You can make 7 with open cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: me too|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hobakan: undo|pg||
nt|ozgull: mu acaba?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: herhalde|pg||
nt|eerbil: niye? +1 yapsak fena mý olur|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, I think 5@H was meant as "pass with 0, bid on with 3 keycards"|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hobakan: ama butür durumlarda siyah rualar karýþýr|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm off to bed - it's been fun commentating. Goodnight Adam and Arifin.|pg||
nt|othered1: No bid can be permitted q littitude of count or distribution so great that there no longer remains a sufficient number of bidding levels to complete the definition of the hand.|pg||
nt|cicus: and a trump still to lose|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mikael_w: yes, but this time partner played J|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vipe1: interesting that she didn't try to take more tricks by ducking the diamond and seeing what develops|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wwalter: deserved 7 IMPS|pg||
nt|cascade: 220 for 6 i think|pg||
nt|wwalter: only , 6, was in green|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Also some applause for E/W in the bidding|pg||
nt|korszurku: have to go now, bye all|pg||
nt|sundiszno: no, Q first|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: a lattitude|pg||

nt|elbec: nicely done|pg||

nt|eggy: did he really win the K?|pg||

nt|hedyg: now @H and @c ruff|pg||
pc|h8|nt|laurentiu: sry 2 down ... I misscounted|pg||
nt|yuval10: in Thailand 2006, the same teams played against each other with almost an identical lineup|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow, we are way ahead|pg||
nt|yuval10: only change was E here that didn't play there|pg||
nt|yuval10: and the match ended 25:5 for Israel, on their way to the U-21 title|pg||
nt|yuval10: a massive swing for Israel|pg||
nt|yuval10: 16 imps on board 7|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s was made here, and on the OR declarer went down 3, doubled|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're playing 4@s on  board 8|pg||
nt|yuval10: so likely 6 more to Israel|pg||
nt|yuval10: N overcalled 1NT there, too|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it didn't make W fold, though|pg||
nt|mug: why the long delay now?|pg||

nt|eggy: PP1@S is my prediction|pg||
nt|vipe1: a push, but good board for both NS pairs|pg||
nt|vipe1: 3NT down four seems like another good result for russia|pg||

mb|1N|nt|po-s: of course he can´t have 0, once he accepted hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Anyway, a nice recovery for the Swedes after the revoke on board 7|pg||
nt|Walddk3: that cost 14 IMPs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|snetram: too strong for 2NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: gentle raise of the 3rd seat opening|pg||
nt|cicus: I'm taking notes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mug: diamond game is on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 3 is too high if E-W find the diamond ruff|pg||

nt|hedyg: 20-22 balanced|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: but what would Diamond have opened|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk3: 6@S likely to make if you are in it|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Is 2NT some sort of spade raise, PO?|pg||

nt|ovncylmz: problems for declarer|pg||
nt|cascade: not so easy to find when you have four cards in an unbid suit|pg||

nt|sundiszno: yep, 3NT made, 10 IMPs for us!|pg||
nt|mikael_w: tjoho :) 10 BIG IMPS to hungery|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if you play @hA and a @h, and east plays low, you must guess whether to finnesse or g oup with the Q|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eggy: as long as they switch to a club the defence should prevail|pg||
nt|eggy: er - or lead one :)|pg||
nt|blade: how you want to deat it else?...ok..tough again without seeing the cards|pg||
nt|wwalter: would it be a @h lead?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|po-s: 2NT could be either or - support or a long heart with stiff spade|pg||

nt|hedyg: now|pg||

mb|2C|nt|wwalter: sry, a problem came up, I must leave, wish U all fun|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N to calm the nerves here|pg||

nt|wwalter: bye|pg||
nt|vipe1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|othered1: People who Michaels on south 's hand (I don't) will find @C here.  More often, however, they can lose the unspecified minor.|pg||
nt|sybarra: too good for michaels for you?|pg||
nt|othered1: At matchpoints there's a case for bidding 2@C on the south hand, with a hep (and tolerant) partner|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather Michaels with it, considering the suit quality in @Hs|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels bidder |pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, too good for me, as I play it preemptive |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I play michaels as very good or bad|pg||
nt|othered1: this seems neither very good or very bad, unless  you downgrade because of crumby @H suit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @H is almost like a 4 @C suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: *like a 4 card suit |pg||
nt|othered1: Playing with my preferred partners, 2@S is an ASTRO cue, showing 4@H and 6@C.  I might try that here due to relative suit qualilty|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow, I always admired ppl who tried those conventions:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Been playing that over 40 years|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=13&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|sundiszno: EW has approximatively 8 tricks in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Was S really thinking do you think?|pg||
nt|eggy: Seems unlikely|pg||
nt|cascade: not sure I like 1NT with three cards in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 4 @D is  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Platnick make mild slam try?|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@c looks pretty good, single dummy.  Roland would certainly be there.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kastan88: 3@H= 10...12 3-card support|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D and @S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c cuebid|pg||
nt|snetram: i dont like this convention (2NT), you lost 1 level to say, i am strong with support|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Brave bidding by West|pg||
nt|cascade: i am told it is conventional showing three hearts|pg||
nt|cascade: i like 2@s with a fit|pg||
nt|vipe1: interesting thing in russian team is that volozhenin plays almost all the boards but swaps the partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: S wishing he had used Michaels |pg||
nt|lokaty: yes, its common bid after preemptives on level of 2.|pg||
nt|elbec: winning in hand he shouldn't pay trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too good for Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 6@C can be made even against this 5-0 break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Roland slams supposed to be less than 20%|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: 6NT can be made double dummy I think|pg||
mb|3D|nt|laurentiu: 2 big gains for Romania|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kimisi ise þöhret yolu bu yoldur diye düþünerek þapkasýndaki bütün tavþanlarý ayný anda çýkarmaya çalýþabiliyor|pg||
nt|eggy: this looks pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|vipe1: he played 120 boards with nekrasova and 80 with veselov|pg||
nt|sybarra: like a ghestem type bid |pg||
nt|mikael_w: will easy be 9 to|pg||
nt|sundiszno: where is the 9th?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: finnessing 's10?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: @s10?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 @s, 2 @h, 1@c and 3 @d|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if they lead one, yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would have passed the south hand, don't like 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Last 6 boards (after the accident on board 7): 45 IMPs to Sweden|pg||
nt|Walddk3: For new viewers. There was a revoke on board 7, so a doomed 4@H vulnerable made after all when one trick was transferred to the non-offending side|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c lead?|pg||
nt|sten: what about 2 of hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: S said he has @hs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mikael_w: Old Blackwood will take away any chanse for Grand here and 6 @s will end the bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: i prefer 5@c to the 3|pg||
nt|charles_l: E attacks @hnot W|pg||
nt|elbec: strange duck....|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: In theory this should go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: how can W bid 4NT with Jxx in @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think he should bid 4@s and let his pd take over if he can|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: there goes our overtrick :)|pg||
nt|vipe1: would be interesting to know how they pick which partnerships play a match :).|pg||
nt|vipe1: russia missed a fit here, but spades split nicely|pg||
nt|vipe1: quite lucky that spades are split, but still goes down on non-spade lead|pg||
nt|sundiszno: you were right|pg||
nt|cicus: ruffing 1 @H high and ruffing in hand with the small trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe one of David Burn's Laws:   ruffing doesn't work in NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: 4@s over 4@d would show a problem in @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@cs, 3@ss and 3@ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: and maybe a @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably even|pg||
nt|elbec: 27-14 now|pg||
nt|elbec: i hope he will not miss all the queens!|pg||
nt|santyclz: The standard for a Roland slam is 26.89%.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: he might have said   cross-ruff doesn't work in NT    which is funnier|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lokaty: this slam is extremaly luck. That would be to much for Poland.|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But Krysztof, you must remember that there is alot of hands your P know you DON´T have when you bid slower if you play rhis 2 NT conv.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@D asks for Q@S, 6@D= Q@S+K@D|pg||
nt|snetram: what West know about East hand - nothink|pg||
nt|hedyg: now W still knows nothing about @H stopper|pg||
nt|cicus: will E take a @H trick here?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I am surprised to see that this was passed out in the other room|pg||

nt|namial1: spades + points < 15|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Corrected to 3@S -2  now|pg||

nt|mikael_w: I know, But my guess is that they know rhey are trailing alot|pg||

nt|sundiszno: but if you try to recover, you possibly will be down more|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: The youngest player in the event is Katharina Kaeppel from Germany; she is 13. Anna Christa Ege (Denmark) and Ida Grönkvist (Sweden) are both 14|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ovncylmz: i predict a 3-4level competition ll be coming|pg||
nt|vipe1: well bid by nekrasova|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: 11th brd Open room West bid 6@D. Who can blame North cashing her @CA against slam? ... 11 IMPs more too Denmark|pg||

nt|sundiszno: and 6@c couldbe made on an impossible @h guess|pg||
nt|sundiszno: finding @hAJ behind|pg||

nt|xenya: this should be an easy one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there actually is a physiologic explanation for my typo fo operator's names |pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: seyircilerimiz 1 nt neden dedi diye soruyorlar|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þu an uyuklamakta olan yorumcularýmýzdan birinden cevap rica edelim|pg||
nt|vipe1: open room made 9 tricks, we'll see how it goes here|pg||
nt|hedyg: can make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a good view in @c|pg||
nt|elbec: here it is|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ovncylmz: 3@h now?|pg||
nt|mug: might have helped|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: slam time here|pg||
nt|snetram: 2NT - because i have good 5 cards suit, partner has only 11PC, and you can win 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not for "fo" instead of "of" :(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|murat: :) ööö meraba !|pg||

nt|yuval10: and now a missed slam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or not|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Time is running out for the French girls. To be fair, Poland has been the better team in this match|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|laurentiu: I suppose 2nt shows both majors ... and 4diamonds is transfer for spades|pg||
nt|laurentiu: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: why duck the @H lead?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|murat: 1NT'nin 5+ pik ve 8+ puan olduðunu düþünüyoruz :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 7 karo kör veya nt olabiliyor. bakalým becerebilecekler mi|pg||
nt|yuval10: things are really getting downhill for Sweden|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mtvesuvius: if 2NT is what I think it is, I cannot believe east didn't go looking|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No way to beat this when diamonds come in. Just 1 overtrick though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mug: East must have missorted his cards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: aslýnda kozu karo olarak bulabilselerdi koz dam olmadýðý için 7ye gitmekten çekinebilirlerdi|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu gidiþle 7 demeleri çok zor görünüyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama sanýrým þimdi karanlýkta el yordamý ile 7@he gidebilirler|pg||
nt|namial1: 10 Tricks i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: or was the ghestem?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wasnt ghestem as I know it |pg||
nt|xenya: just set up the long @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: and all ok after that |pg||
nt|tomi2: Israel took the 2nd place in provisional ranking now - Norway 3rd and Netherlands 4th, but everything is still close|pg||
mc|11|nt|MolvaM: aynen dünki ingiltere maçýndaki durum bence|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D, 1 @H, 2 @S and 2 @C |pg||
nt|xenya: you can even make an overtrick that way |pg||
nt|xenya: by endplaying E|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Vlad,  uptrick available but may not go for ir |pg||
nt|sybarra: *it|pg||
nt|xenya: what's happening?|pg||
nt|snetram: rutine play|pg||
nt|sundiszno: the @c slam depending on @hs, @hA (or J) must be with south, and @hs must be 3-3|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he plays A@C now E needs to unblock K|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: we have 5 more boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's quite funny to notice that West thought he had a double of FOUR in this room; the other West did not double SIX! Judge for yourself|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=18&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|sten: good declarerplay he had only 6 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: the match has become close|pg||
nt|elbec: part score here|pg||
nt|cicus: well here N bid game all by himself and found a miracle dummy|pg||
nt|wwalter: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set -- short break then 16 more before longer dinner break|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: so it kills yet another good defensive bid, the 2@D over 1@C opening|pg||
nt|mug: Israel on top, getting into blitz territory|pg||
nt|cicus: let's say Israely aggressivity pays in this match|pg||
nt|elbec: yes indeed. but maybe 3@h shown some values (lebensohl style)?|pg||
nt|cicus: can be|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I do not suggest that kind of treatment:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: specs suggest that 3NT was slam inv. with support|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|mtvesuvius: hmm, it's possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Great Job Owen!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S could include any canape|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Thanks :) I won't be doing this any more today, but will be back for tomorrow's final|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: club partial EW, and unlikely to get past 3 level|pg||
nt|eggy: Thanks to other results, France have stretched a 5 VP lead at the top now|pg||
nt|sundiszno: inverted raise|pg||
nt|sten: and was revarded with 9|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kastan88: 4@S EW line, probably South fighting here|pg||
nt|kastan88: that may be stop EW in partscore?|pg||
nt|cascade: yes it is one IMP|pg||
nt|namial1: why 170 instead of 200 ?|pg||
nt|cascade: the endplay was unavoidable if the last three cards were accurate|pg||
nt|namial1: Poor dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: but well bid by south|pg||
nt|Walddk4: According to the K&R Hand Evaluator the North hand is a little too strong for a 15-17 NT. It is worth 17.2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Kxxx+AK+KJ109+Kxx|pg||
nt|cascade: unfortunately the next range starts at 18|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yeah|pg||
nt|cascade: K&R will upgrade with all of those controls|pg||
nt|cascade: and the intermediates in the diamond suit|pg||
nt|cascade: what do you lead around to a strong NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: a jr.  not opening the W hand?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: grand actually making in @hs here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: of course no way to come close though|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps W had some other view about it...|pg||
nt|xenya: we are well ahead of the other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Romania - Israel: 2 - 104: 1 - 25|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: running scores on http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/VGRama/minirama.html|pg||
mb|3S|nt|laurentiu: not to overtake with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't see why didn't she bid 4@d then|pg||
nt|mug: might have worked better for South to start with 2@C over 1@S|pg||
nt|blade: hmm...with what kind of hand they try to X opps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: this is a sadistik board :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: obviously was some kind of mechanical error or misunderstanding last hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This may roll in. Declarer is a hot favourites to get both black suits right after the pre-empt|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This solved one problem|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4@D opening nexxt door kept everyone out|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Perhaps 4@D would have had a different meaning for this N-S pair|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play it as Namyats, a strong 4@S opening|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D|pg||
nt|sundiszno: this will be easy, I think|pg||
nt|sundiszno: just the kind of boards poland needs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: verry easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: The problem with this hand is finding the strain to play in|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 3swing for Romania on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: board 13'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically, Eke could have opened 1@D with that shape, but in 3rd seat went for tactical 1@S opener|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eerbil: yine gereksiz bi agresiflikle zona geldik|pg||
nt|MolvaM: cevapçýda 7 puan var. davete pas geçmek için kaç olmasý gerek?  6?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: "ortak 1 nt cevabýn yalan deðilse 3 de" konvansiyonu bu herhalde|pg||
nt|fahir: tekrar merhabalar, net bir süreliðine gitti baðlanamadýk|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hoþgeldiniz fahir bey :)|pg||
nt|ozgull: bir de üstüne diðer minör kýsa oynuyorlar bence|pg||
nt|relrikas: @C donusu olmamasýný ümit etmekten baþka yapacak bi sey yok bakalim...|pg||
nt|xenya: they seem to be playing real fast here|pg||
nt|poohbear: they started late in the other room too|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we said at beginning  the "need for speed" table |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: israelian pair is known to be fastest in this contest|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S is not in danger as the cards lie|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mtvesuvius: I think this may be able to be -2 on good defense|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 7 karo bordu konusunda apel komitesine lokum götürmeniz gerekiyormuþ galiba diye duyduk?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, he can be happy now he didn't:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed |pg||
nt|blade: partner has 16+, opps red...you have11 with 5 trumps...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eggy: but slam wouldn;t be on anyone's mind (except Roland perhaps)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: opps bidding and raising his AKQTx suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Much of the problem with 2-suited bids is deciding on range,  which should be rather narrow.   Philosophy that you just bid your shape in response doesn't work well with wide ...|pg||
nt|othered1: range'  |pg||
nt|othered1: Even juniors can decide to pass flat, 8-loser hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they grow up fast :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: std lead @dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: no @c lead since E did not open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS have had a rocky start missing those 2 slams, but still 48 boards to go in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice in other room Greco's conventional 2N raise of @S let North show @C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: but 2N is already too high|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2Sa seems down |pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me, 1nt as passed hand not forcing, so 2@C promiss 4|pg||
nt|eggy: Sajr tells me that 2@D is checkback (presumably GF)|pg||
nt|eggy: apperntly N has shown 2-5-3-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: (what movie is that line from?) |pg||
nt|sybarra: line actually was "I feel the need for speed" |pg||
nt|poohbear: Had West led a@d honor there would be no guess for the spade but declarer can find out for himself|pg||
nt|poohbear: West a passed hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphztt: Jaak, these are junior players! lol|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me N hand is pure pass, with flat hand why to put head under possible guillotine or push opps to game. But you know: Junior blood!|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: No interference can stop us/them from bidding game ;)|pg||
nt|charles_l: poor west looks at @hvoid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wwalter: well managed by France|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|voldenuit: they play high as encouraging on the queen lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2@C is 3+, seems to me east should pass 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what that says in the long run - but my turn to type|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: specs suggested further than 2NT was 20-21|pg||
nt|poohbear: why didnt he cash @c ace?|pg||
nt|poohbear: strange|pg||
nt|xenya: he can do it now?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes. I like tidiness though. This is sloppy :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean by crossing to hand in @Hs|pg||
nt|snetram: std. clever|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kastan88: yeah, I have forgotten my junior years, they are so far (88oldish as you can see in my name:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Lies! You're still a junior lol|pg||
nt|poohbear: Needs to use 2 trumps to het back and forth|pg||
nt|poohbear: first real Glitch in the Israeli armor|pg||
nt|frusco: hi all|pg||
nt|elbec: 6@c in open room was a little bit aggressive!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|z_lasu: boards 14 and 15 also good for Romanians|pg||
nt|yuval10: *that|pg||
nt|mug: not a compulsory slam this hand anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: can explain why W didn't want slam, but not why she didn't correct to 4@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: Over a drury response, n would have a choice of a x or 3@c.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@c isn't gazilli or sth like that?|pg||
nt|xenya: evidently they are playing some form of gazzili|pg||
nt|mikael_w: almost never wrong to lead a trumph vs partscore|pg||
nt|elbec: west in order to set the contract should have played in the same moment @s and @h :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well both South's overcalled 2@H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eggy: could easily get home this |pg||
nt|eggy: they are a credit to Wald imo|pg||
nt|mikael_w: How about a claim now ?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|Walddk3: If declarer suspects a singleton a club with North, he may well go wrong in spades, but he can afford it|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, but can't they make some score in @D?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sorry, was a response to a private question.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: Houlberg isnt sure who has K@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: ruff high|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphztt: is anybody who want to comment?|pg||
nt|elbec: now France and Norway are both winning 21-9|pg||
nt|wwalter: not too may :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|cicus: good try|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: doðu, @d apeli  vermek için paralanýyor|pg||
nt|elbec: yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|voldenuit: nice defense |pg||
nt|cicus: to no avail|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: so both 2@C and 2@D were artificial|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok in that case east should rebid 2@S :)|pg||
nt|cascade: Canonne needs to be on lead so we need these undos|pg||
nt|cicus: true anyway|pg||
