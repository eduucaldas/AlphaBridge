nt|vugraphzrq: Warm up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: looks like partscore here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|chick: would you double or bid hearts?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|lestergold: hearts first|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: Bid|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: good spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: But I'd bid 1@s over 1@h with the south hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: agree Harald|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 5 losers 100 away|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can of course make 2n|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: N S 3@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: MP scoring, it matters|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3ccan go off|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: and as u point out 3s may be made|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: over 3c north could have doubled which would have shown the spades as well as very good hearts|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: depending on their methods that is|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|d4|nt|chick: might make now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: double should not be penalties as no suit has been agreed nor no no trumps bid that is my method |pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: well in that case a good score fo N/S for sure|pg||
nt|chick: a good method, Mike|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|lestergold: especially at mps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: where u often need to double for business|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|chick: about as high as either side should go|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|chick: 2@D limit raise of spades, and N declined, S should not have bid 3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well best defence one off|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|c2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: i think qc lead may well have been best|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can now avoid one of the club losers draw tru8mps ace and another heart duck|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chick: if he figures that out|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he will|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now it costs nothing to play for the heart ruff out|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: either way the big cards are marked with west|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no point in playing east for club ace unless last resort|pg||
nt|lestergold: well poorly played the winning option was free a shot to nothing|pg||
nt|chick: yep |pg||
nt|lestergold: and actually quite likely to work Kx of hearts a very likely holding for west on the bidding|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: Can't throw 3 clubs on one heart....|pg||
mc|8|nt|chick: I tried that once, but the opponents noticed :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: Last board this round|pg||
nt|chick: the real problem was that S bid once too many times|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: Played fast here, 5 minutes before next round starts.|pg||
nt|chick: coffeeeee time|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: EW staying here for the next round too|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6s infran not manmy will bid it|pg||

nt|lestergold: a row of $S+2 i suspect|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4S+2 i meant|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: can't fault them, N is very weak and he bid the right thing.  S can hardly bid stronger than he did.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the point for declarer is not to drop any tricks other than of course... er the ace of trumps|pg||
nt|chick: double and jump to his suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzrq: Hi Hedy!:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|chick: er, I could be wrong, E's bid shows most of the remaining pts|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east ducks there is a good reason for n ot playing east for the aqx of spades- witrh a stiff there is more chance that pard would have found a bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point|pg||

nt|lestergold: mps is about taking a deep breath and taking risks for overtricks in these situations as long as risks are in ur favour|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: the safety there was not an affordable option|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: 11 tricks will be a poor score|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: 2@d denying 3 cards in @H i guess|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|c2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: allowing vul opps to play 2 of a minor at match points is not a winning policy|pg||

nt|hedyg: disc a loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: No idea, Hedy. Prefer the 2.|pg||
nt|chick: suggesting something in @Ds?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4 clubs to warn west that east has nothing in hearts not knowing that west can afford to exit in hearts in any case|pg||
