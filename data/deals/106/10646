nt|Vugraphu1: If the Meltzer match had been a little faster, we would have been able to cover the 4th quarter of de Knijff-Diamond, which is now quite close, but they had already started to play ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: before Meltzer finished :(|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so first blood to Jansma here, both bid the grand|pg||

nt|ritong: fred:"uh?"|pg||
nt|poohbear: The Splinter might slow Fred down|pg||
nt|ritong: barry told me yesterday about doubling splinters|pg||
nt|ritong: calling for lower or higher unbid suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS from Rubin actually tends to show weak preference for @C - but sometimes you just guess partner's hand type|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: greco asking for all the nitty details of rubin's pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL would have been TRF @D, 2@D would have been RELAY without promising any values|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: greco asking more questions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i've answered all the questions i can think of :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 3n easier but is it biddable?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes I would dbl with the East hand to say lead a @c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|santyclz: If you don't show a 2-suiter with the n hand, you should take that convention off your card.|pg||

nt|imp_jan: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they scrable to 3@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scraMble|pg||
nt|othered1: can west avoid leading an ace?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: when did XX show 6?|pg||
nt|me argent: as i said the challenge avoiding slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer is unlucky that dummy doesnt have 4@ds . then he would have a shot|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: nice save against 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: moss: "wow, i bid a lot"|pg||

pc|s3|nt|skollie: with three he would've bid 2@C i guess, after RDB it's a reasonable bid|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: greco says he doesn't think he can have 3 spades here|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: greco says he ought to have 6|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, they reached the imposs and the imbiddable :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess west couldn't avoid it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|imp_jan: undbiddable..|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if East had made any noise other than competitive 3@H South would have bid earlier|pg||
nt|skollie: 1@S is limited...still very well done by NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not saying it should be scramble -- but thought that 3@D might be their best spot |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: most pairs play Unusual vs Unusual  where 3@C and 3@D are available to show good hand|pg||

nt|poohbear: but declarer will suspect that Fred leads a singleton @d so no reason not to finesse|pg||
nt|me argent: needed a @D lead|pg||
nt|ritong: in this position, fred has to play a @d no matter what|pg||
nt|me argent: to beat contract|pg||
nt|ritong: but first, he tries to see if it could give the contract with no counterparty|pg||
nt|harmon: on 35 or played 5c in the 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|me argent: of course on @D lead declarer can play @S himself|pg||
nt|poohbear: Yesterday moss specced a dbl after partner's weak 2 and got a big gain for his effort|pg||

pc|dA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: that's more style than judgment|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: protect against West holding 4 trump then claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many time champ asks something we didn't consider -- what if East NEVER bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer must guess which 41 split to guard against|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obligatory @S8   it would have been the 9 except dummy has that card :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or perhaps play 3nt and see if w finds the @c lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah - everybody gets to 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with short @H would East play @CK or @CQ at trick 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike Lawrence argues small @S now -- when west follows - was NOT doing echo to tell partner anything|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the "mandatory 9 (or 8 in this case)" should declarer lead a low @s and finesse if w follows?|pg||
nt|dburn: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm confident of these pychological situations -- i KNOW i'll get them wrong at the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: D put the screen down to ask Aker something - but I can't hear - I think it's to do with what the difference is between this auction and if Milgrim had opened 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm scrambling now for Mike's book "Falsecards" to see if his online statement matches what he said in the book :)|pg||
nt|dburn: the guy has to play thw "mandatory nine" from J9xx, so you should just play him for J9xx when he does|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I couldn't hear their whispers I'm afraid - wonder if he's thinking that a side 4 card major might deter Milgrim from opening 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: J8xx is different, but even so...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco 1@H easy choice in context of Big @C system|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and game forcing|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|imp_jan: curious how North will go from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Milgrim asks about 2@h - Gromov "both Majors"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i know nothing about the rest of the sequence so let's hope Patty gets the skinny|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: earlier today we saw Bertheau-Nystrom overcall 2@C showing  "at least 4/3 in majors, IF 4/3 then 5@D"|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: wishing ... and hoping ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @C isn't a good spot.  NT is on NS cards alone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco-Hampson play RM Lite    [RM = Rodwell Meckstroth]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a reasonable guess is that 2@D SHOWS @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the full RM system played by meckwell does artificial followups like that - but who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: ok 1n |pg||
mb|3D|nt|Gerben42: must be stronger than direct 1N?|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: overcalling with the South hand strikes me as risky, but if my partner bid *three* hearts, I would give him four|pg||

nt|othered1: here 6@C by south does have its chances|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|skollie: still i'm a little surprised by N bidding only 1NT|pg||

nt|Gerben42: me too, must show this, with 9 HCP directly 1NT?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: would you prefer a dbl like Jan Jansma suggested or a plain 2n?|pg||
nt|skollie: u would want partner to bid NT, so i can understand dbl...|pg||

mb|7C|nt|ahollan1: with their 4 imp spread at start of final set|pg||
nt|ritong: peacefully sailing|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: perhaps they play P then DBL is stronger defense (better spades)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred Gitelman led @S against 6@S looks like that will save/win the board|pg||

nt|vugraphu1: not suprising, greco passed a long time ago...east is pondering|pg||
nt|imp_jan: simple and effective bidding in the or by moss-gitelman on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But note that Gitelman already upgraded when he opened 1NT|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: transfer response|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but these hands sure have pure fits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|skollie: van Prooijen likes to bid Stayman with 5card major in a balanced hand - but this sequence looks better|pg||
nt|Gerben42: decision time|pg||
nt|imp_jan: depends on the range; if it is 15-17..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Verhees should perhaps upgrade again because he knows that his club suit must be worth something opposite a balanced hand|pg||
nt|skollie: do we know the range for 1NT?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: good point Ro|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: yes, it is 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: and 2@D was either TRF to @Hs or the minors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would be different if East could have a singleton club|pg||
nt|skollie: i thought so, 4Nt aggressive opp 14-16|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid from Aker would be  18-19  so 1@H carries some extra mileage|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: No, sorry |pg||
nt|dburn: well, if 4@d denies a spade control, East won't move beyond the four level|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: system description says transfer responses to 1@C can be very weak -- if not, then maybe [keyword] West would have tried reverse|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Gromov now asking about Aker's hand and Aker tells him that the 2@s bid showed 3 hearts and good values - they both seem to agree that Aker is likely to be 13(45)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Clubs a non-issue on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: I wonder if Smolanko had a little try for game, and gave it up after a 2@d minimum response|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS to gain 1 IMP more?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think so - looks like 9 tricks are available|pg||

nt|murat: Kepekçi sanýrým bu eli ortaðýna oynatmak istedi, bu yüzden 2@D ile sordu|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: belki olur þimdi|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: ama yetmiyor galiba, yerden 4@s yaparsa olur|pg||
nt|f_aydogdu: cakaya oynar bir batar|pg||

mb|4N!|nt|gracelin: not necessary game forcing, just showed some range and West thought his 3 is enough for game.|pg||
nt|haans: sort of agree with you but Mackwell boys never passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: duck first @H|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: right and endplay is with 4th defensive trick :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-10 HCP, (5)6 @H or @S  -- no strong variants|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: There's been a little discussion about NS needing to give EW the multi defense, and Dubinin just alerted 2@d even though it was still on the other side of the screen :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: some know to call that Wagar 2@D - but most in north america call it "multi"|pg||
nt|santyclz: When they call it printable things...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a hand worth examining when there is lots of time|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: strong @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is Game Force but can be as few as 2|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think I said it in a nutshell AL|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphu1: Gromov asks Milgrim what 3@d and 3NT mean - Milgrim says 3@d is natural and he thinks 3NT is to play|pg||
nt|dburn: well, let's hope he doesn't lose by 1 IMP - been done before|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: South has double dummy @D holding for that EW auction|pg||
nt|me argent: 6@Cs is on a @H finess|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d is a forcing @c raise|pg||
nt|dburn: it is? crikey|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c would be non forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so it includes balanced game force and let's 1M-2@D always show 5|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@s promises 6+|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@d prob KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry if i missed that Barry - i was getting caught up in loops just examining all 52 cards :(|pg||
nt|poohbear: I predict a low @c lead against slam|pg||
mb|4N|nt|santyclz: And now about 200 specs are telling me why leading the @ca is "right"!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael Rosenberg pointing out that single dummy, Aker may decide to attack @S though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of a big @C system -- nice to be able to open that hand 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: inv sequence with 5@S?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: then north probably has another bid|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: as Greco is thinking, must be INV|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if its 17 19, maybe not|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: range is 16+ to 18 (flat)|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks like potential for more bad luck, though I suppose Verhees might lead a heart|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: in the other room, a 3-card superaccept got Ekeblad one higher than was comfi|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: greco has been very helpful in answering your questions by writing to me|pg||
nt|poohbear: actually might play 6NT|pg||
mb|6N|nt|imp_jan: in the end Greco realised he was non vul|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: 18 or a VERY bad 19|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@S might be to high as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: This will work!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hey Michael!!|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ill bet big money that he doesnt !!|pg||
nt|dburn: although if Jansma's pass to 4@s says "lead a spade", while double would say "don't lead a spade"...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: good prediction|pg||
nt|poohbear: now predicting @d lead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gromov-Dubinin got to 7@C on 55   down 2, lose 11 against Sontag 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: if lead gives up nothing, declarer needs to pick up @S then work out right rounded suit play.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
nt|poohbear: wellllll would be if the contract was good :P|pg||
nt|othered1: only @D doesn't give something up directly|pg||
nt|poohbear: spade too|pg||
nt|poohbear: low spade :P|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well, there is THAT|pg||
nt|othered1: decent auction down a bunch of imps late in the match|pg||
nt|poohbear: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very unlucky @D duplication|pg||
pc|s5|nt|imp_jan: due to the inv sequence the contract is wrong sided|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and purists will say -- if Greco had real opening bid then ....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: ...then he won't lead a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT asked for the @C Q and 5@s showed it with the @s K|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: gulp|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is the sort of deal that Larry Cohen thinks ought to be abolished|pg||
nt|dburn: 20-some IMPs on the toss of a coin|pg||
nt|poohbear: This lead will alleviate Moss's need to get rid of the 4th @h|pg||
nt|ritong: larry sometimes exposes bizarre ideas|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I can see his point|pg||
nt|poohbear: maybe they will abolish coinflips in poker as well ?|pg||
nt|ritong: but i have to say that i love it when he s dispo to commentate on BBO|pg||
nt|poohbear: then I will never be able to win|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't say I agree with his point - I just say I can see it|pg||
nt|dburn: but I do agree that he is one of the best commentators around|pg||
nt|poohbear: LOL   . I can see it now. this slam is purely on a finesse . Board is thrown out|pg||
nt|poohbear: bring in the sub|pg||
nt|poohbear: that will be declarer's new claim|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what Moss is thinking about here - not much to do but get on with it|pg||
nt|ritong: he s trying to see if he can try to steal the @s J|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4-0 trumps is the only liability|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he is waiting for Verheess to fall asleep before he plays a heart to the queen|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: the sominex coup|pg||
pc|h4|nt|harmon: low club now|pg||
nt|harmon: too late|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|poohbear: would Gran lead the 5 from J54?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|poohbear: he can be sneaky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still must still guess correctly but Rubin is going to have trouble discarding|pg||
nt|poohbear: why?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|poohbear: has alot of red losers|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: although this entry changes matters|pg||
nt|ritong: @d J|pg||
nt|dburn: it does indeed|pg||
nt|poohbear: not really. Just play a @h and if the finesse is on ruff one back as an entry|pg||
nt|ritong: no, he will get a @h back anyways|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: deadly defense, beating 2@S where they were inviting to 4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: 63-28 to Meltzer vs Lynch at this point|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: again, apologize for Jansa rather than Jansma, but cannot change it now :( Jan will have to forgive us|pg||
nt|imp_jan: similar to this match|pg||
nt|dburn: but West will play a heart when he wins @sA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c3|nt|ritong: ya|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, if he wins @sA...|pg||
nt|poohbear: If declarer has Jx of @s and AQx of @h flying gives the contract now|pg||
nt|dburn: ...and East won't get squeezed in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees in 6@S from North  lead will please Barry & Harmon    @C8|pg||
nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|nt|dburn: but, this is not the most obvious position for Jansma|pg||
nt|poohbear: Jansma might return a @d ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: then declare has a late guess|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if Jansma does play a diamond, Moss is a heavy favourite|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5-2 odds|pg||
nt|dburn: but I can't see why Jan would do that|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: just someone wake me when jan plays a card please|pg||
nt|poohbear: Not unreasonable for declarer to be Jx AKQx A3  AKxxx?|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob doesnt RKCB then|pg||
nt|dburn: could be, I guess|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: uh oh|pg||
nt|ritong: oh my|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: well...|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: brad smiling|pg||
nt|harmon: verhees couldve helped discarding on clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: you have the feeling that he really needs to make this, or the match is over|pg||
nt|ritong: now , two trumps routinely pitching a @h|pg||
nt|poohbear: Perhaps Verhees pitchs the 10 of @d  from Q10x?|pg||
nt|ritong: and decide later on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drum roll ........ QUEEN|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: sigh|pg||
nt|poohbear: But moss will ask himself. Why no @h play?|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: brad announced he was taking the finesse, not going for the squeeze and had to ask ME who had @H king after he said so|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, well...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||

nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||

nt|skollie: 420 in hearts|pg||
nt|imp_jan: looks like an excellent result for ew, impossibe 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need 8 trump tricks and 2 clubs. That's what declarer got in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  3@C reasonable, i'm just trying to justify lifelong membership in society of fatalists|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: heavy multi bid|pg||
nt|imp_jan: east opened 3@h in or|pg||
nt|poohbear: POTTLF  strikes again ( Paralysis of the trump leading finger :))|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The defence had 4 chances to lead a trimp|pg||
nt|Walddk4: trump  even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how many pairs play "leaping michaels" after 3-level openings|pg||
mb|4C|nt|santyclz: 5@c of course makes, but 3nt by n would be much more interesting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: without DBL 2N is  a) weak @C  b) inv 6+@D or  c) inv+  55 @H & @S   -- obviously the DBL changes things|pg||
nt|othered1: The double is scary to me.  But it may work out.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where (3@S)-4m = forcing 5+m & 5+ other major|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Gerben42: 3@H would be my choice at this vul. but you should bid whatever you agree with partner|pg||
nt|skollie: 2@S interesting|pg||
nt|h bertens: 2!g showed 4 @D and 5@H|pg||
nt|skollie: sorry 2@D shows @H@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: thats interesting|pg||

nt|ahollan1: uh oh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ron - you can bid and double @S -- but Matt is just NOT going to lead them|pg||
mb|6D|nt|imp_jan: unfortunate bidding for ew|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: nu nog maar 10|pg||

nt|vugraphu1: Hampson: "your leads?" "4th best"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think @D 33 means this MAKES|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|warrens: trump lead or shift after a spade lead, then jump up on the first club|pg||

nt|imp_jan: more logical indeed|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|h bertens: logical? opening a 10 count with no aces if 2@d shoes 4@D and longer@H?|pg||

nt|harmon: doesnt matter what lead|pg||
nt|vugraphu1: No one accepts and Greco says "well play it"|pg||
