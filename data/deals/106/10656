mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|daman: 2 wau stayman isn't weird|pg||
nt|daman: way*|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no and quite suitable on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to segment 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: The spade jack is a good card but is it good enough?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: 6 appears to make on a double dummy line in diamond suit|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a strip endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually is not double dummy, just normal technique|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree with Rose Meltzer's assessment that it is not.|pg||
nt|kareno: The thirteenth club will be his ninth trick.  3nt might make depending on the lead.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: This won't be easy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice easy partscore to start the day's action.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: Sharyn :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi Karen|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: George will make this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Helness is playing with Sontag, Helgemo unable to attend this tournament|pg||
pc|d4|nt|reisig: I'll bet ...down 1|pg||
nt|daman: I'll bet making|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stewball: lots of talent little experience with each other|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so expect to see a lot of generic bidding|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: strip and play a @S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Not much interest here.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: can finesse everything for 4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might just do that|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess Chambers thinks he needs diamonds 3-3 and a good spade guess.|pg||
nt|kareno: Helness bid 7@h operator :)|pg||
nt|stewball: a nice generic grand:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|idblu: re all :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Freddie :)|pg||
nt|idblu: hi Karen :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: simple effective auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Instead he is taking his extra chance on the 3-3 heart break (in case the spade finesse is failing)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|poohbear: Interestingly if North had a slightly worse distribution 4-3-3-3 slam would be better|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: cash the @C|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|reisig: easy strip|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|poohbear: as there would be a possible pitch if @hs were 3-3|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|idblu: playing for @D's to split|pg||
nt|sharynr: seem to have reached par|pg||
mb|1C|nt|daman: maybe a michaels type bid by Robert|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: We lost all the kibitzers here at the break. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Okay making 3 and an IMP to Meltzer, first blood :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c 11-15 points 6+ @cs|pg||
nt|idblu: I guess the paint dried///|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3nt or pass, Karen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back to this semi-final match of spingold, 32 boards to play|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d!|nt|poohbear: 3@c both majors|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@ds natural not forcing. I imagine they use 3@ds to force in !@ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think the best bid is for North if/when it comes back to him?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you better hope it does|pg||
nt|kareno: The other match is much closer - only 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sharynr: interesting DBL|pg||
nt|kareno: I bid 3nt in hopes my diamonds are going to be useful.  You can't really thread the needle with four decent hcp.|pg||
nt|sharynr: i agre|pg||
nt|kareno: Cohen says, 'find my suit.'|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree*|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|poohbear: 4@d by mittelman created a force|pg||
nt|idblu: and this is 50+1|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s is a fit-showing bid.|pg||
nt|kareno: And that would be a spade is my guess.  Shortest of south's suits.|pg||
nt|kareno: Support double.  This should play in 4@h and makes easily.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|daman: on this auction   declarer might go wrong in the @S suit|pg||
nt|kareno: North is warned!|pg||
nt|idblu: won't stop him tho|pg||
nt|kareno: He hasn't got a trump to lead!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I mean that the in-person kibitzers have left, by the way.|pg||
nt|stewball: a 2@d opener may have gotten NS too high |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not sure why Mittelman chose to force . This will go down 1 or 2 depending on @ss|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lack of entries |pg||
nt|sharynr: Passell does well to takeout|pg||
nt|stewball: but i expect they dont have that club in their bag|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: looks like 200|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...|pg||
nt|kareno: They may wander back.|pg||
nt|sharynr: and buys well, too|pg||
nt|kareno: So Cohen scares them out of 3nt into a making partscore. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is way too high obviously|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: The pairs have agreed to play it undoubled|pg||
nt|kareno: So he was allowed to simply pass, much more sensible on the auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The director has allowed the agreement|pg||
nt|kareno: And a sportsmanlike solution by the players.|pg||
nt|idblu: very honourable|pg||
nt|idblu: active ethics|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes|pg||
nt|idblu: once again showing their class :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: b|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can get to 6, don't see a seventh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Sergey Kustarov|pg||
nt|dinos1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|kareno: Here we can see that the margin is 50 or so and the boards are clicking by.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz:  "I can't wait to see this."|pg||
nt|idblu: this may make 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Director call coming up|pg||
nt|idblu: the hole is getting deeper|pg||
nt|kareno: I just commented to my housemate that it is close to making six.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen wrote "S+D" to explain 2@S, but Shermer thought it was "5+D"|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, that could change Schermer's mind about the double.  |pg||
nt|idblu: Larry needs penmanship lessons|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe he should have been a doctor.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: It also might change his mind about the 3@S bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi all|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mark Thiele from the Netherlands|pg||
nt|mrxxx: hi all !!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kareno: Mark :)  Roland :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharynr: duplicated distribution, else might even make 5D!|pg||
nt|stewball: well the 1@d overcall worked even better|pg||
pc|c2|nt|poohbear: 5@D would make if the defense doesnt find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the most obvious double, but well judged|pg||
nt|stewball: far from obvious|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|kareno: Yes, that's true!!|pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: great guess |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharynr: wonder if Berk would find the @S10 lead|pg||
nt|kareno: A point for the specs.  3@s was only competitive.  North could have bid 3@h as a game try.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hT|nt|kareno: Cohen trying for an uppercut but south's trumps too weak.|pg||

nt|sharynr: how unusual, back to back 130's|pg||
nt|sharynr: oh i thought 1st was 130.....wrong |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks to me that Sontag bid 4@S immediately (and confidently) because he felt hw would have to bid it anyway over 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Good evening, everybody!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Bill, Martin!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Ed and Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: So the match slips further into Meltzer's hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 4@h will make here because clubs split, hearts split too :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also EW profiles have not been updated|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d is possible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Difficult auction after 1@S-X|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+, could have longer !d|nt|bjacobs: Helness is surprised at that splinter ... even more surprised when he discovers it's a void!|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 1C 16+ 1D neg|pg||
nt|poohbear: 0-7|pg||
nt|kareno: But it only makes if you can bid it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Dubinin is surprised at that splinter ... :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I guess 4@S is not necessarily a splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4@S is not exactly a splinter, and at this point they are getting over their surprise|pg||
nt|othered1: At that level it should be pretty specific, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps mainly a "good raise to 5@H"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphu6: The director thanked the table for their sportsmanship.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What should South do?  And then what should North do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: we should see 2@s pass or correct from North|pg||
nt|sharynr: but prob nnever mentioned|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the main issue will be should helness show his side feature|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, harder for N :) 2@h mb?|pg||
nt|mrxxx: this will probably end in a 3@h partscore, as EW most probably will compete with 2@s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|poohbear: can stand to compete no matter what partner has|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: dbl shows values|pg||
nt|poohbear: within the 0-7 context|pg||
nt|kareno: And nobody has a double :)  |pg||
nt|stewball: i expect neither N or S would have gotten to that game with thier regular partners|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: you can also blackwood to find out whose hand it is|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S helps North in a way|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: 100 honors this trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, Freddie, honours :)|pg||
nt|idblu: ty....please use spellcheck...and the Queen's English|pg||
nt|stewball: close decision here for N n/v|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm ... what will Alan do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I think he might try 6@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt getting diamonds into picture, in any case at least two places to play|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|stewball: now he needs to find the @c Q|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time they got it right, auction could have died at several points|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: asuuming  the def plays @hs that is|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's right in that his void covers one of the missing aces ... but the patient will die|pg||
nt|othered1: will west risk a @H lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no clue which minor to lead, so he might|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He knows North is void in hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does he?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nothing else could explain 6@S, after South signed off after Blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: Doiuble, I'm told, says "don't lead @H."  Not sure I agree, as it might be EW hand and double just to stop partner from bidding one more|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@D is a fair contract, but this is an impressive auction|pg||
nt|dinos1: interesting what wd make more problems for NS - pass or 3s by Bal?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This auction shows good clubs in east.  The club jack lead is best for the defense.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jan van Cleeff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hi folks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: Zmudzinski did NOT open Berk hand|pg||
nt|mrxxx: heej Jan :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: this lead costs a trick, i think, compared to spade lead|pg||

nt|idblu: or not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is actually the best spot, but that one is near impossible to reach with confidence|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|Vugraphu6: Claimed on "I'm going to finesse South for the queen of spades..."|pg||
nt|sharynr: at this vul, I think 3@d is very reasonable|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: club and two spades to come.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@H can be made of course|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|stewball: not a lot to go on from what I can see|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: Three rounds of clubs and now east leads the fourth to remove the pitch for dummy's diamond.  West should ruff low.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sontag trying for a count of hands, which may lead him wrong|pg||
nt|stewball: the @h count must be pretty ambiguous for him|pg||
mc|9|nt|kareno: Then her diamond will make and perhaps also her heart king.|pg||

nt|sharynr: bd 2, 3NT was doubled and played in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: "...and pitch a club on the diamond."|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Double certainly suggests to lead something other than hearts (Lightner).  West showed his individuality with @CJ|pg||
mb|2C|nt|poohbear: strong|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt likely by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so bd 3 will be another Lynch pickup|pg||

nt|imp_jan: ciao for the moment, have to check my bbq|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: another 5@d|pg||

nt|fabsayc: they are racing thru these boards, we have four of the fastest top players here|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@d is just a burp in their system, showing some sort of (usually ragged) opening bid.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's a burp because it says nothing about diamonds for the most part.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: no worries|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but the last time i said that, Balicki went into a huge tank :)|pg||
nt|kareno: discreet pass by north (I would bid).|pg||

pc|s3|nt|dinos1: was 4@d KC or 4N?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: a faint chance of making now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Mittelman unlucky to find more than half partner's hand in the red suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will need to guess spades to make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: can he just lose 3@S tricks?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: picking up the @Cs?|pg||
nt|idblu: thats the key, and pick up the @C's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but after dubinin shows up with all the red cards, that should be easy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poohbear: and he still has a shot|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphu6: Berkowitz got up to kibitz another match.  I hope they're not playing the same boards.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very unpleasant for West, but he must play this like a beginner ... finessing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It did seem like an obvious Blackwood for South, once he heard some diamond support|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|stewball: ths will simply things|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: So this will depend on south's view of the spade suit.  Probably won't make if they continue with diamonds now.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kareno: west trying to protect his spade holding.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: I am sure there will be a comment about opening leads by EW who are not noted for their brilliant ones :) LC mkaes fun of themselves  often in this department|pg||

nt|idblu: win 10 or lose 6....|pg||
nt|kareno: And now he has two natural spade tricks no matter how they are played.|pg||

nt|stewball: unless pard has 5 little|pg||

nt|idblu: O Canada !!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen fondled the @c3 for a bit before he returned the @s7.  By now I'm sure he's glad that he put the @c3 back.|pg||
nt|daman: hhhrrrmmm    wonder what the holdup is|pg||
nt|daman: thanks for that insight Jan|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Lebi is pondering the double hook, probably?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I am an anonymous vugraph operator today; Jan is in the other room.|pg||
nt|daman: once he led the @C 7   he might have convinced himself to double hook|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any inference from non club lead?|pg||

nt|kareno: (the last hand)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|an|puppet stayman|nt|kareno: Heart lead to beat 1NT.  That would the the "Australian' lead - shorter of 5/4 suits.|pg||

nt|idblu: he's seen Roberts o/calls :)|pg||

nt|stewball: do EW play stronger NT here?|pg||
nt|dinos1: ))))|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|me argent: not to mention LCs pass|pg||
nt|idblu: they can feel it...a very tough situation to play under|pg||
nt|kareno: East checking for a 5-card spade suit in west's hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: i'm told they up it in 3rd and 4th seat|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: i think i would have started with a heart with dubinin's hand, cant blow a trick :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he may need every side entry to establish the suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Since you don't expect much from pd, playing for qxxx(xx) of @c is a shot.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In theory, this should be bid to 7NT.  And it might end up that high if N/S keep bidding their suits|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@s is down with @s lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dinos1: thk, with any lead|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mrxxx: opening weak majors was quite popular in holland, and would have definately worked on this deal|pg||
nt|kareno: An Australian asks if I made that remark disparagingly.  In fact there is some theory that the lead of the shorter suit works and it was advanced by an Australian, hence the name.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|me argent: berk probably does not trap heavy in this situation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: It's funny - N/S were mindful of the big misfit - well done!  But 4@S is not really where you want to be, looking at their hands|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, when they see the 5-0 clubs, they will be incredibly relieved|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: The contract that I think is probably cold is 6@C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: you can try that later Joe|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: If west misguesses the clubs she may still be defeated by a heart shift!|pg||
nt|mrxxx: the lead is 5th giving less spaces for 2 clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: The specs all know, "eight ever, nine never"|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that 52-48 percent for the split is off when you know anything much about a hand.|pg||
nt|mrxxx: well the lead showed 5 diamonds, and missing 9 hearts makes it probable that clubs maybe were not 2-2|pg||
nt|kareno: Shift is tough for north - spade queen is alluring, so is length in hearts.|pg||
nt|mrxxx: hearts shift now is still not easy|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|kareno: Ah, well done!!|pg||
nt|mrxxx: yes !|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: 6@C on a spade lead - people are asking - does it make?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: the bracket sheet for the Spingold so far:    http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2009/02/spingold/|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some interesting possibilites in club suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: none of which we saw|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@c makes on X-ruff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it is cold i|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The cross ruff indeed makes it quite easy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On the whole, I think N/S will be rather chuffed with +450|pg||

nt|bjacobs: my pleasure, old chap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: part of the 900,000 words in english i never have used|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Interesting comparison on board 51, where N/S missed a game ...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c-5?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, makes the 3@D contract seem superb|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still down 5 looks excessive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Take a look at their auction.  This is why Sonty's pass of 2@S (on 51) was so nicely judged|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk S shd bid 3@d over 2nd X|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On this hand, he certainly should have|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: This is safe - most he can lose now is six tricks.|pg||

nt|dinos1: he overvalued his @sK |pg||
mb|3D|nt|stewball: particularly since S jumpshifted|pg||

nt|kareno: But it may lose him a spade slam!!  Let's watch.|pg||
nt|dinos1: and didnt thk what pd shd do w/o @s stopper. Pd wd bid 2N (or 1N at once) with @s stopper|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kareno: Could be a trump ask.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I think he wrote Key Card|pg||

nt|bjacobs: (You mean OR on 36, I assume)|pg||

nt|kit: guess it is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but double on only 2 clubs was to say the least dangerous|pg||
nt|kareno: In the midgame, Berkowitz shifted to the spade Queen so the game was made in the OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Jansma put 4NT bid on table, his partner was happy to know that he has a maximum|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphu6: saying, if you go down on this hand with a @c lead, then you mis-bid|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes coz he cdnt bid 1N)|pg||

pc|dA|nt|sharynr: not happy with 1 KC i guess|pg||

nt|fabsayc: the second double|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idblu: pushing now|pg||

pc|d2|nt|othered1: ditto 3@C?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dinos1: still I dont like pass with 17|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: relay auctions also may look like this|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idblu: can make 6 only on a @H lead tho|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen jokingly fingered the double card (behind the screens).|pg||
nt|idblu: will not get it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idblu: 1 imp for Schermer|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Schermer:  "May the gods be with you partner."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: "This is very, very pushy."|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missed the boat here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: No time for cookies - I am working on a book on the Multi|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: an imp is an imp|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think Larry could ever have played @S's here :)|pg||
nt|daman: they won by one IMP yesterday|pg||
nt|idblu: and that's the truth|pg||
nt|kit: declarer was always making with the clubs 2-2, but the shift makes his life even easier|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think Larry will go wrong on this one|pg||
nt|kit: from declarer'spoint of view, he can ruff one diamond and pitch two diamonds on the spades -- but then he has to worry about getting back to his hand if north has Jxx of clubs|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|nt|Vugraphu6: Schermer:  "I knew this wasn't going to be very good."|pg||
nt|fabsayc: presumably those bids places west with short clubs, so Gromov gave up on slam|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West can see he is no lock for even 4@H, but that heart layout is declarer-proof|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: kit, he cant handle 3-1|pg||
nt|kit: So I think he will win 10 of clubs and play club to ace, so he can follow by ruffing high on third round of spades (if North has 3 clubs)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but he knows spades are 5-1|pg||
nt|kit: oops, sorry -- miscounted the spades|pg||
nt|idblu: on a @H hook, 3-3 @D break and 3-3 @C break|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Berk:: "Sorry"|pg||
nt|kareno: Too bad - could be very costly.|pg||
nt|dinos1: pd has in average 2@s so fit is highly probable (even 3@h on 4-3 fit)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but is partner supposed to bid 3 card suits over it?|pg||
nt|dinos1: no)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c7|nt|Vugraphu6: Chambers:  "3 NT is very good..."|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idblu: a big sigh of relief|pg||
nt|daman: that doesn't work    does it?|pg||

nt|santyclz: 4@h alert!  Xfer to 4@s by the opps.|pg||

nt|kit: oops, sorry -- clubs would be good|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no, down1|pg||
nt|santyclz: (tricks on defense)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needed the ruffing power to eliminate dubinin's guard in hearts|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphu6: I'm not sure why that wasn't 2 down, but Larry confirmed the resulk|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: @d leads ruined any trump coup even if Sontag was inclined|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and he needed to save a dummy entry in diamonds|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: chance for Schermer to get som IMPs back here, as laydown slam missed in other room|pg||
nt|daman: only 2@S overcall in OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: LC not making it easy|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S is much tougher to handle|pg||
nt|poohbear: or perhaps he is :)|pg||
nt|stewball: au contraire,,3@s may drive them to slam|pg||
nt|kit: I think South just bids Blackwood and then bids slam, since no way to go scientific now|pg||
nt|stewball: which i'm sure he wasnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Yes, it seems a "strange" 2@d reverse might have worked out better.|pg||
nt|othered1: not sure everybody would agree with you on terminology|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is not permitted|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: little break should be back shortly|pg||
nt|dinos1: they're ahead on 2-3 boards)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|idblu: no room for science...just shoot it|pg||
nt|kit: I just don't see what 4@D will accomplish|pg||
nt|daman: might get a raise|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@D begets 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Bidding now by east would show a minimum hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so, what will a raise tell him?|pg||
nt|daman: they have a fit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: direct 4nt would be KC for clubs possibly, delayed KC for diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps -- don't know their agreements|pg||
nt|daman: now what?|pg||
nt|idblu: Robert hates to be pushed around|pg||
nt|kit: Now 4NT sounds like takeout to me|pg||
nt|idblu: get up on his hind legs and bid it|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|kit: well, let's see what North thinks it is|pg||
nt|kit: And if they bid 5@D or 6@D, will (should?) West be saving?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wouldn't, but it's not really important|pg||
nt|kareno: Might make two on this lead.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: go Robert!!|pg||
nt|kit: well, looks like they are on the same page|pg||
nt|kit: It will be difficult for West to save, since there might be some doubt in his mind as to whether or not his opponents have had an accident|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What IS important is that I think Gromov's lead stank|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|idblu: these last few should go fast...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S by north|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: can't push him around|pg||
nt|kit: note that even though it is a "good" save, he will still lose 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|sharynr: stopping low is good, especially since it does not rate to make as much as  8 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: unless hearts are picked up, that is|pg||
nt|kareno: It can be made but only by playing heart to ace, then finessing on the way back.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He had a known 10+ card club fit ... so the only trick to take there was partner's ace|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|idblu: very nice |pg||
nt|kareno: And maybe still only seven tricks.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idblu: better than 13|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sergey Kustarov says the trump coup was still available, I've learned not to argue with him.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: This illustrates why sacrificing is so overrated -- huge cost if it is a phantom, and often a loss anyway even if right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see a danger|pg||
nt|daman: hopefully George doesn't lead the @S Ace|pg||
nt|daman: when he is in|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: And is it really possible that the loser could be discarded when he held such strong cards in the red suits?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|kit: oops|pg||
nt|daman: told you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now a club looks best|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: he could not be sure partner not ruffing hearts|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|santyclz: For some reason the players often seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course you could argue that the diamond lead doesn't achieve much either ... it's not fair to expect him to be breaking up a squeeze with the lead|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: that was really a careless play -- he knows his partner has a stiff spade|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Sorry, reply to private msg.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that would make east 1426, barely possible|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: but maybe he was afraid his partner had a doubleton club and if he ducked, a pitch would be coming|pg||
nt|idblu: for sure|pg||
nt|poohbear: Mittelman was worried that declarer could run @cs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: so he really did have a problem|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|s2|nt|barnets: seeing all 4 hands west had to win first D and play club|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: gosh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That truly is a terrible bid|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|daman: they lead the @C 3 in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: ditto here|pg||
nt|dinos1: not sure what's better - 2N or 3@c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lynch team needs something good to happen fast|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C is much better spot, but 2nt was a possible rebid|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@s, as specs are pointing out, is an interesting contract, reached by neither team, however.  So the double dummy experts can have a good time analyzing it :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|sharynr: spade guess to make 9 tricks (if they had bid 3NT)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dinos1: even @cxx makes 3N on fin|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: Gromov either: 1) likes to torture partner, or 2) thinks partner is the world's best declarer.  Not sure what Dubinin would be thinking here|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be he is still thinking of the defense to 6@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: Winning the first diamond would have made life easier for Meltzer.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharynr:  but NOT in 1nt, risky|pg||
nt|dinos1: or @cKx @sA and @hxx|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is not without its chances, with South having bid 1@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S usually signals a misfit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: But it would be so much easier just to take the 6+ top tricks against 2@H|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|kareno: No.  He'll just take his tricks.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: If South had studied the club spots on trick 1, he might have worked out not to lead a club back there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually it is hard to construct a shape where double is correct on this auction through 2@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: it shows just 5@s and is constructive|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: How many down last hand?  |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kareno: Made only one, operator.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: it made 2, must correct score|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe with @H length and south taking a false preference on 4=1=2=6?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strange play, but will help declarer|pg||

nt|dinos1: 3N :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: some play 4@d to show this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why not the cold 6@H by south|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: this could be more IMPs for Meltzer -- slam missed in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: the claim there was very fast and involved a question from Berkowitz about if anyone was squeezed|pg||
nt|kit: The fact that E-W playing limited opening bids may slow West down a lot, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This hand, yes.  Being corrected.|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt best this hand.  I assume they have methods to find it.  Lebensohl of some sort perhaps.|pg||
nt|dinos1: lol - leader has no @s )))|pg||
nt|kareno: So this should be a push board, give or take an IMP.  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|kit: Perhaps East should open a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: well might speed up East :)|pg||
nt|idblu: count the voids and length...for sure 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: notice the difference in styles    in the OR   South bis 2@S over 1@S and gummed up the auction slightly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at least it seems cold|pg||
nt|dinos1: but -1 if W had singl @s)) |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: key now is if East can show that his shortness is really a void -- that will make quite a difference|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was not a good 4, but may be bid and made at one table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no -2 or 3 then|pg||
nt|poohbear: no. West has long Heart|pg||
mb|2D|nt|santyclz: Many people will respond with an ace.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be west bid 2@S|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe south passed?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@S is playable as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: berk bid 3@h I think?|pg||
nt|poohbear: asking|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I think I got the result on board 45 right, but I'm not completely sure.|pg||
nt|kit: West won't like his hand much opposite a singleton diamond -- hard to find a 15-pointer which gins a slam if East has a stiff diamond|pg||
nt|sharynr: lebensohl start?|pg||
nt|kareno: Starting lebensohl auction.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: kibitzers are saying 4@S makes, and it probably does, but not easy to see a route to it|pg||
nt|othered1: west won't lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: guess not|pg||
nt|idblu: can make 6@S here....|pg||
nt|kareno: Now 3spades to show a stopper and bid stayman.|pg||
nt|kareno: And south should bid 3nt.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Excellent 3NT contract actually - unlucky to fail|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo operator|pg||
nt|dinos1: y, sleepy))|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: the 3@H call may have screwed E-W up -- I wonder if they will be on same page now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: bidding is accurate|pg||
nt|kit: for me, 3@S would show unspecified void, but not clear West thinks that considering his 4@S call|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: 3@h slowed down the auction considerably, and E/W both stopped alerting|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The in-person kibitzers are gone again.|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, Lebansohl is a nice, useful, convention to get you to the right contract most of the time after a preempt.|pg||
nt|sharynr: surprised that @H not mentioned at all?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|daman: it can't cost W to bid 4@C on the way to 4@S   that will get 4@D from partner and change the complexion of the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: there is Larry saving the day|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen decided his hand was so good that if his partner had any interest he was worth a move|pg||
nt|daman: and he was right|pg||
nt|idblu: Trying to make last call at the bar...closes at 1am|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps 3@S showed 4 @H|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c might make with a trump coup.  |pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s after 2nt showed four hearts and a spade stopper.|pg||
nt|othered1: do they play SNAP (strong NT  after pass)?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bravo|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharynr: tough to show everything|pg||
nt|kareno: That's why people preempt :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a really conservative auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: but will West know it is a void?|pg||
nt|idblu: think everybody needs a stiff drink at this point|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: West hedges with 5@H, a last train call|pg||

nt|othered1: is double a double negative?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fast 3NT ?|pg||
nt|mrxxx: that will not be everyone's choice 3@d :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: the players just learned from the director that they are playing slower than the other table....:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Sometimes that's played as showing zilch|pg||
nt|othered1: normally a pass by the 2@C bidder confirms a strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or opponents just bid his main suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the law in action :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: guessed right, club ace offside :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Unless west unblocked diamonds.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: It made 5.  You are right, he did give West a @d|pg||
nt|kareno: Then west was endplayed in clubs.|pg||
nt|kareno: For 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have seen some excellent declarer play by both sontag and helness|pg||
nt|poohbear: Zmudski can count 9 on a non @d lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N - good bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: might easily be the winner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: great swing bid |pg||
nt|daman: 3@C took east out of the auction completely|pg||
nt|kareno: It is mine.. sigh.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: normal reopening by East -- it just doesn't pay to let opponents play at 2-level when you have some high cards and are short in their suit|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|kit: difficult for North to double, though it might be correct action -- a lot easier at matchpoints|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Just to settle things about board 14, Cohen says he could have made 6 but he made 5 :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: 4@H showed a singleton, and a raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Last hand of the quarter coming up.|pg||
nt|kareno: Almost makes too.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: There's nothing to the play after trick one.  Just eight tricks and not nine.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphu6: yes, at this point they will be out about the same time as the regional knock outs :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kareno: Nobody's going to double.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well it worked|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is cold|pg||
nt|daman: he'll still give it some thought|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idblu: same auction in the OR|pg||
nt|idblu: hi Karen...congrats on your win :)|pg||
nt|kit: not same auction -- South didn't redouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|kit: and that makes a big difference|pg||
nt|dinos1: and pd cd have more @d's|pg||
nt|daman: where there's hope???|pg||
nt|kareno: South will explain that 3@d was a good save against 2@s :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idblu: carried Garozzo I saw|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: there's Crosby|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: is it on @C lead?|pg||
nt|poohbear: but on that lead 4@s is the winner|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: Oh, you mean the intervention worked?  3NT certainly has excellent chances|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A restricted choice play in diamonds will bring it home, for example|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead by George Mittelman.|pg||
nt|kareno: And a push board developing.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|othered1: with lucky entry to dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: admitted not very lucky after east got @H into the auction|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|idblu: Join us to,morrow for the semifinals....results will be posted on the ACBL website...thx to all for a good show and to Joe our Vugraph operator :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: whatever :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: of course at same time 4H could be cold, so not sure i would want to try unless badly needing a swing|pg||
nt|daman: yes    perhaps the next 16 will be more exciting|pg||
nt|mrxxx: lets hope so :)|pg||
mc|8|nt|idblu: promotion now|pg||
nt|kit: seems like normal lead -- needs only ace or queen in partner's hand, and nothing else is attractive anyway|pg||

nt|kit: I totally disagree Karen -- I think after the redouble North should double 3@H.  It just plain doesn't figure to make.|pg||
nt|idblu: true...but 800 would have looked nice|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohen:  "I'll never do that again."|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks much!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the player names at table are correct, the profiles are wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: that is true|pg||
nt|stewball: i meant Lynch|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board now, thanks to barry, sergey and bill for their insights|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and kibitzers for showing me the truth about board 54|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And I assume room will be kept open until all comparisons are in.|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, it's a tight match ... don't give up your seats!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: the best kind...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board now of this set, thanks to our operator Nikita, is a tough job|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and last but not least a big cheer for our operator :)|pg||
nt|daman: NS have a decent @H partscore here   potential for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: so   we'll be back shortly with the 2nd session  see you all then|pg||
nt|kareno: Bye for now.  Specs, don't give up your seats - lots of bridge coming up!|pg||
