nt|daman: what do you think the best bid is for North if/when it comes back to him?|pg||

nt|idblu: the hole is getting deeper|pg||
nt|kareno: I just commented to my housemate that it is close to making six.|pg||

nt|kareno: Well, that could change Schermer's mind about the double.  |pg||
nt|idblu: Larry needs penmanship lessons|pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: the claim there was very fast and involved a question from Berkowitz about if anyone was squeezed|pg||
nt|kit: The fact that E-W playing limited opening bids may slow West down a lot, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kit: Perhaps East should open a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: well might speed up East :)|pg||
nt|idblu: count the voids and length...for sure 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: notice the difference in styles    in the OR   South bis 2@S over 1@S and gummed up the auction slightly|pg||

nt|poohbear: asking|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I think I got the result on board 45 right, but I'm not completely sure.|pg||
nt|kit: West won't like his hand much opposite a singleton diamond -- hard to find a 15-pointer which gins a slam if East has a stiff diamond|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: guess not|pg||
nt|idblu: can make 6@S here....|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: the 3@H call may have screwed E-W up -- I wonder if they will be on same page now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: bidding is accurate|pg||
nt|kit: for me, 3@S would show unspecified void, but not clear West thinks that considering his 4@S call|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: 3@h slowed down the auction considerably, and E/W both stopped alerting|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: The in-person kibitzers are gone again.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: it can't cost W to bid 4@C on the way to 4@S   that will get 4@D from partner and change the complexion of the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: there is Larry saving the day|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit: but will West know it is a void?|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|nt|kit: West hedges with 5@H, a last train call|pg||
