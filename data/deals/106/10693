pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Is that a Scottish expression (away with the birds = distracted)?|pg||
nt|justin c: better, anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the result will be ok for ns|pg||

nt|jbgood: well, that is really debatable, but in a way ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 6 card @d suit headed by the AK brought the value back up to 20+|pg||
nt|lestergold: my stiff Ks tend to buy three small in dummy and go with the wind uinder oppos aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|justin c: 4@H failing with the @SA wrong here|pg||
nt|andyv:  playing with the wrong pds, Mike|pg||

nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: well stopped but if ace of spades was with south it would be badly stopped|pg||
nt|jbgood: if they have discussed that position..|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|april7: and then could they stop in 2 or 3@H?|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
nt|justin c: with 1NT hand over them|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb have to chck somthing on the cooker|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't have anything extra either in hcp or distribution, so 2@h would have been the final resting place unless pushed to 3 by N/S.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|andyv:  it's an easy hand to go overboard for those players with rose colored glasses|pg||
nt|lestergold: and always plnty in a pairs|pg||
nt|lestergold: plenty of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3n again?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|april7: 3NT by E going down on a @S lead|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3n by east going down on any leasd if north finds a spade switch|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose even in mps most will lead a spade but as is often the case more off on a pasive lea|pg||
nt|andyv:  switch the 4 and 5 of @d and N might not have been able to duck the first club!|pg||
nt|andyv:  but S powerful 76 of @d would have saved the day:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: There are 3 major Championship Tournaments in Norway: The Premier League, The KO Teams Championship, and this one. |pg||
nt|april7: S gets a @H attack|pg||
nt|justin c: south wont like that north is thinking here|pg||
nt|april7: a real one|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: another 3NT for EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|justin c: she, sry|pg||
nt|april7: EW might stop below game|pg||

nt|andyv:  not on this auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: EW is the only women pair in the field as far as i know|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if E/W play checkback|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jbgood: they surely do|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I guess not|pg||
nt|april7: a lot of guessing here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and suth sor of endlayed at trick 1|pg||
nt|jbgood: but 3 spades is natural showing 4-4 in majors, with 5-4 h/sp w would rebid 3 @h and expect prd to bid 3@s with a spade suit|pg||
nt|april7: W's bid might stop the @S lead|pg||
nt|justin c: @S lead wont be so successful this time|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead here will be crucial in determining the mp score i fear|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead has been highlighted but won't help N/S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: nor would spade or heart |pg||
nt|lestergold: a club would give declarer the tempo also|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards well placed for declarer|pg||
nt|jbgood: iow: no medicine|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: @D lead doesn't giv3e anything away at least|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|april7: first right guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s back|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: quite a few will get  a spade lead so declarer here has slight disadvantage|pg||
nt|andyv:  few options here|pg||
nt|april7: not bad either, but E has her 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: hts sortd now must play qc specifically or may cost|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  trick is not to lose 3@c|pg||

nt|lestergold: well not much to worryno disaster even if qc lost|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|s5|pc|c3|pg||
