nt|Walddk2: We just passed the half-way mark. 170 boards to be played|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but they open very light|pg||
nt|april7: N might open with a leddirecting 1@S|pg||
nt|april7: although they play 5card major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Austberg may open before him|pg||
nt|april7: then 1NT by S endcontract|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, swapping seats|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe NS will play 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: One definition of torture is to hold hands like the S hand all day and have to decide every time whether to open - it's very close.|pg||

nt|jbgood: E could have held it to nine a couple of times - but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a duck would have held it|pg||
nt|justin c: East switched to @C trying to remove the dummy entry before a @S trick established|pg||

nt|jbgood: guite a few will open 1 NT on the N hand, and reach game|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: still 5min left of the round|pg||

nt|hedyg: how about double over 2@D? anybody?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: it is the opening bid which set the ball rolling|pg||
mc|9|nt|henryb: If I could not open 2@d I would not object to 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but I believe they play 2@D as Multi|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think so too|pg||
nt|jbgood: FIFO - first in - first out - is a good plan|pg||
nt|henryb: having values as the opening bidder is also often a good plan|pg||
nt|henryb: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: more and more players are opening with 11 hcps|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would sooner open the W hand with some   of @D's than double the artificial 2@D.|pg||
nt|jbgood: what is an opening bid is just a matter of partnership understanding. No worldwide agreement applies|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course|pg||
nt|henryb: and more and more players are bidding no play games and slams because their responding structure still assumes a "real" opening bid|pg||

nt|april7: except W tries the @H finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: why should he do it that if he reads the lead as from a 4 card suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: "cant" is a dangerous word for commentators, Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem with opening 1NT is that the long suit gives a source of tricks that partner cannot know about, which can make it hard for him/her to evaluate  |pg||
nt|hedyg: but he should be able to read the lead as 4 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  need 4-4 clubs to make, so leading a @s should be pretty risk free|pg||
nt|lestergold: in which case a heart finesse risks the contract and indeed would lose the contract here|pg||
nt|jbgood: the carding clearly implies clubs to be evenly distributed - so getting the ninth in spades should be safe|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont need 4-4 @cs if the @H finesse is on|pg||

nt|haans: how to find 6@C|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C     will they get there?|pg||
nt|lml: I think South has already close to finding 6! without hearing from partner|pg||
nt|lml: 6@C|pg||
nt|ady: in this case they will play in clubs|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|haans: no @D bid harder to find 6@C|pg||
nt|lml: I have a great system for hands like this... I bid 4@C which sets the suit and then we show controls and have asking bids|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: how many years have you had that conv?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: I have played that for a long time|pg||

nt|lml: I hear some specs do so as well|pg||
nt|lml: and yes it does come up.  |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: often when you opened a strong 2 you have a once suiter or balanced hand|pg||

mc|12|nt|haans: opps may go to high in @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C-2@D-3@C-3@H-4@C - can this be passed?|pg||
nt|chick: partnership agreement|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, I've had two yesses and three noes so far |pg||
nt|haans: good question acol said yes but nowday most say no|pg||
nt|chick: for some, 2@C forces to game in NT or major.   others, forces to game unconditionally|pg||
nt|chick: just decide with your partner which way you want to play|pg||
nt|haans: game force is easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously, if it is a major suit you can pass at the four level as it is game.|pg||
nt|chick: I prefer unconditional game force|pg||
nt|lml: Mark Horton is behind me trying to see if he can find an auction to get to 6@C without asking bids|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful to have a double negative here - say 3@D - then perhaps 2@C-2@D-3@c-3@D-4@C and now North can bid 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: opps bidding lots of @D|pg||
