mb|4S|nt|caitlin: that makes sense Karen|pg||
nt|kareno: How high to bid at adverse vulnerability is Larry Cohen's question.  He decides to force to 5@h showing values.|pg||
nt|caitlin: high enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: jan has entered the scores reversed before the match...she had to go play but the scores will be accurate next quarter|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe sets e/w force|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The six level is too high for E/W. Looks like Larry will have to break the law.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|caitlin: can we give actual score with our comments?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am asked|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: simply reverse so Lynch 44 and Meltzer 63 right now|pg||
nt|barnets: south having most of the points|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Score is wrong by 38 in Lynch's favour|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: its impossible to change the scores after we enter them...amazing technology|pg||

nt|barnets: 500 is a great score I think|pg||
nt|caitlin: 73 for Meltzer and Lynch at 55|pg||

nt|caitlin: a maximal X|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ckv: that was sort of my question on board 34|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|caitlin: and the redouble?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|caitlin: nice 4@C|pg||
nt|warrens: that's what i mean, the redouble serves as an invite|pg||

pc|d9|nt|barnets: 4@C was a thoughtfull bid by east setting up a possible lead|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  On a diamond opening lead declarer needs to play a spade to break communication|pg||
nt|barnets: hes on lead|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe |pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: into the tank he goes|pg||
nt|caitlin: but also tells pd if he gets in to lead it back|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If North has AH and South short D, the diamond ruff cannot be prevented|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If South has AH he is too good for a weak two|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So I would finesse this |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Only wrong if South has QH singleton and singleton diamond as well|pg||
nt|barnets: I like that|pg||
nt|kareno: Berkowitz MUST finesse or lose his game!|pg||

nt|kareno: Now north can get the dread diamond ruff!!  Great defensive maneuver by Zmudzinski|pg||

nt|kareno: A great result in the CR for Meltzer.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I guess he lost a heart, ruffed a heart, then squeezed East in the red suits|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Two diamond leads should stop that|pg||
nt|warrens: there's a heart-diamond squeeze, but a diamond lead will beat it|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond lead doesn't break it up?  |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They have to continue diamonds when in with the heart|pg||
mb|2C|nt|barnets: @CJ was led|pg||

mb|4C|mb|5C|nt|kareno: It's the Edgar Kaplan theory.  When they deal you that diamond suit it screams out to be led.|pg||
