nt|Walddk2: Martin de Knijff - Fredric Wrang of Sweden|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to David Bird|pg||
nt|brolucius: The pressure mounts on the players as we enter the round-of-8.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No doubt they are hoping for an easy deal for starters. I always did.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs strong club'ers as far as I recall|pg||
nt|brolucius: N-S may go to 4@H here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I put the hand up a little too soon - they're still discussing things :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent, we have Jan Martel as VG operator. One of the best!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and she can play too!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North has to choose between 1@S and 2@H.|pg||
mb|1N!|an|4+ !ss|nt|brolucius: Ah yes.... just to prove me wrong.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not exactly a strong club. I'll try to find a CC for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: or . . . probably shows @S length|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is the equivalent of a natural 1@S response.|pg||
mb|2C!|an|17+ or !c 2/1|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North does not understand the meaning of 'holding back a bit'.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the other room Platnick - Diamond are N-S against Bertheau - Nyström  ..... Gitelman-Moss and Fredin-Fallenius sitting out in this set|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has plenty of losers to cater for, but he can discard some and ruff some.|pg||
nt|othered1: so a trump lead is attractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or North rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sry private|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's right, a trump lead would work well. Not that I ever lead trumps myself.|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jon Sveindal|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hampson asking Wrang about the auction - 2@c was 2-way and I think he said that now he's shown hearts as primary suit with side clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Hi, Jon!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi, Jon. You would have approved of the spade response by North (I gather from your remarks yesterday...)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has started strongly, with a trump.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: No doubt he did not fancy any of the side-suit leads.|pg||
nt|jbgood: just heard in the lobby that the swedes are 3 to 2 favourites|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bluffmagazine.com/players/martin-de-knijff/232/player-profile.asp  a professional poker player who has earned more than $3 million in that game|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|h5|pc|c3|pg||

nt|brolucius: He can make nine tricks if he guesses the @SQ.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h duly made in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: A few tables away, Balicki, Zmudzinski & Bob Blanchard have left the room (B&Z speaking loudly in Polish) and someone asked "Shane (Blanchard), what did you do to those guys?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hampson asksi if 1@d opening would promise an unbalanced hand? Wrang says usually, but could open 5332 with 1@d|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: And to answer an unasked (yet) question - each match is playing a different set of boards, so hearing something from another match isn't bad|pg||

pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Declarer had no convenient entry to his hand, to lead towards the @DQ. So, he starts trumps from the table.|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: and then he wont have transportation to take both the spade and the trump hook from dummy - making 8|pg||
nt|brolucius: He will be pleased enough to find the perfect trump situation, thereby making the contract.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Balicki, Zmudzinski & Blanchard have returned and now the director has been summoned to that table. I won't be able to learn any more I'm afraid|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Very sensible to discard a loser, rather than risk an overruff.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although it seems that declarer will survive in 2@D, he will probably decide to stop comfortably in 1@S next time.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c8|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Hampson asks how the spades split - his alternate line was to try to ruff spades and find them 4-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is always unfortunate when both halves of a partnership decide to push a bit on the same deal. 4@H was too high.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could not think of passing 3@H, however, because his partner was more or less unlimited and had accepted the limit-bid try.|pg||

nt|brolucius: This is a very long auction for two simple-looking hands. I wonder where it will all end.|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like north in closed room transferred to 5@C over a 2N opening.  Methods here, lower, may do better.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North punted 5@C at the other table (facing a 2NT opening). Should he be surprised that South had plenty in the one suit where North had nothing himself?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I'm glad North has more than the one point that was apparently possible, but even so he is getting full value for his money with three bids already|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: I think that I misunderstood the note about 3@d and what it really meant was that he was 1-6 in the minors either way, but I'm still not positive and once play starts I can't fix ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: it even if I learn more|pg||
nt|chessmaste: We lesser mortals would have raised 1NT to 3NT - but that's clearly old fashioned|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: I think he wrote that 1@s showed spades and another, but I'm not sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|jbgood: i know lots of guys who would have ventured 3 @ds against a strong clubber|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Some players would have opened the North hand with a weak 2@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: 2@d is either something or 3 @ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jbgood: he had them both|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nothing much wrong with opening 2@D. As I mentioned yesterday, if partner happens to have a big heart fit, the other side will have a spade fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and your point is just as valid today as it was yesterday, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it was very kind of the players to attempt to make a dull board interesting.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Note was that with some partners, he plays 1@s after the DBL as NF - but he thought it was forcing here. 2@d was either a cue bid or max with 3@ss|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|bjacobs: 2@S looks very strange to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 68%?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About 46% I think, to pick up that club suit|pg||
nt|super nova: 68% = You want to bid 68% grands approx.. and clearly this is not it. ;-)|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs 2-2 = 40%.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at least to The Australian Federation - BBO by all there nice people. ( Wald are at sleep) We was Bjørn and Frank from norway trying to help|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can get hard to find the slam I belive|pg||
nt|super nova: Just thinking about the extra 6% that bill mentioned|pg||

mb|p|nt|elivero: And thx to Frank that use so mucth of his time for uss here,,thx Frank|pg||

mb|4C!|nt|april7: now a crossruff is coming|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Losing to doubleton QJ - that's the extra 6%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if you guess it|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you note the bidding in our room was bing bang boom  |pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would play it that way based on restricted choice if an honour was played from N|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hard to stop at 4|pg||
nt|elivero: ur missing 3 topp in long suit,,it could be a warning sign,,but it easy when u see all cards|pg||
nt|roman505:  In the last auction, 2D was forcing to game and 3H a strong raise.|pg||
nt|roman505:  Perhaps as commented elsewhere, it is often unwise to use 4NT with weak trumps.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: No, Alan Sontag isn't at that table :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: With trumps 3-1, he needed to unblock the @SK and 'draw trumps, ending in the dummy'.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The Poles vs Blanchard just broke (that's Lynch vs Rigal)|pg||
nt|ritong: that s right, david, but declarer has to explain west s double|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Or maybe they went for a smoking break, since they seem to be coming back into the room :)|pg||
nt|ritong: and still has chances if @c Q drops|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, the @CJ would become an entry.|pg||
nt|ritong: the explanation of west s double is not the posqsession of the @h A|pg||

nt|brolucius: If declarer is sure that trumps are 0-4, then he needs tto pick up the trumps and hope that the @CQ drops, as you said.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|an|multi way|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Thanks too to my fellow commentators, Mark, Jon and Ed. It was a very enjoyable session, with several boards of note.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Thanks for joining us - we'll be back with the second quarter of this match reasonably promptly after both tables finish. |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|brolucius: Finally we are all grateful to BBO, who give us the chance to enjoy these great tournaments from the comfort of our own homes. Great!|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Greco asked about 4@h and deK wrote "shortness" |pg||
nt|othered1: south now knows of some duplication in @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I still think that North's bid of 6@D was a good (yet unrewarded) effort on the last deal. Perhaps here they can reap their due reward from a slam sequence.|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Vugraphu1: Hampson asked about 4@h and Wrang said "short @h" so they're in agreement on that |pg||

nt|brolucius: 5NT must have meant 'pick a slam... I have two places to play'.|pg||
