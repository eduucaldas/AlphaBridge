nt|Vugraphu1: Glasson asks about carding: "standard"|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if 2@S showed 6.  If so, maybe 3N was possible over 3@S (if 3N would be natural.)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: dim lead looks normal on auction|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead isn't easy at all to find on this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: an aggressive player as west may have doubled 3c for the lead but that his its risks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: no east cannot be blamed for leading the unbid suit|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, if you double it, it's nice to have some confidence you can beat it, or at least hold redoubled overtricks.|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why i said 'aggressive' as opposed to desirable |pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: would have made no difference on actual hand but could have on another day|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz checks that 1NT is strong and Sutherlin says it is|pg||
nt|othered1: how will south act?|pg||
nt|lestergold: excfellent roland slam for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: you mean 6@D by east?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz wrote a long note to Sutherlin - I can't see it, but probably spades and another or spades and a minor|pg||
nt|dburn: slam? what slam?|pg||
nt|othered1: really?  It doesn't make, does it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: only needs dims behaving hearts 3/3 and heart finesse and no damaging club lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts 3/2|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d by East is down on a club lead, 6@d by West is down on a heart lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: 12.85% plus maybe|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|amr: not even that high|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|fabsayc: but there is a 12% chance defense goes wrong, so it qualifies|pg||
nt|lestergold: its terribloe andhopeless david but its a roland slam|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5D|nt|lestergold: maybe not ok|pg||
nt|dburn: the defining feature of a Roland slam is that it should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but in practice all slams that can make on a lie of the cards and a misdefence qualify|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like best lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: however back at this particular ranch what are the chances now for 4h making?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Glasson asks Mancuso what the NT range is: "15-17"|pg||
nt|dburn: slim and none, and Slim just left town|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, very slim|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|amr: better than the -3 in the Closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: slimmer than u david and certainly slimmer than me!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: -1 looks to be par|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ouch|pg||
nt|othered1: 150 seems like a nice result for NS in closed room|pg||
nt|dburn: well, when declarer sees the trump split, she may not play diamonds to best advantage|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: a dim finesse would look to be with the a priori odds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Did south show a second suit with 2@S?  If so, @D misguess isn't automatic|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: not playing a strong club system, many would open south opposite  a passe pard with 4S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now the issue is avoiding getting too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|othered1: the right 8 count makes slam easily opposite south, so 4@S is a pro-am bid.|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes but there is a danger in opening spade of pass out with 4 cold too|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||

nt|lestergold: club switch and wont risk it for the novertrick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: I don't understand why no club lead, though.  South is known to have good spades.  Peggy is adament, however, about not 'leading for partner' in 3nt.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: and north is known not to have anything in clubs also|pg||

nt|lestergold: so the club does look marked|pg||

nt|kareno: I think at any I would :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kareno: NO not a WJO - you have a transferable value with the ace of spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: Just a simple 2@c overcall to get your suit in when you have an entry as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well when i do ajxx sitting over and opener making a reopening double and partner goes down with misfitting yarband i go for 1100|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c over call i have more sympathy with but pard may expect more|pg||
nt|kareno: Versus a more normal continuation where the auction continues and you have gotten your suit in?|pg||
