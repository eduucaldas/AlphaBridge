mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|beauch: me either- they must play double of 4S as penalties|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|beauch: not a method i would advocate- but maybe thats why im not playing!!!|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.. I play 4n as take out only because there 'tend' to be too much trouble with x = t.o as we can see it happened here.|pg||
