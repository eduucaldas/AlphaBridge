pc|dA|nt|beauch: not a method i would advocate- but maybe thats why im not playing!!!|pg||

nt|mdgraham: not sure there is all that in that|pg||
nt|murat e: no w would lead 8 or 9 spot then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The K&R Hand Evaluator indicates that you should upgrade the South hand to a strong NT. It's worth 15.2|pg||
