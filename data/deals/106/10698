nt|Walddk2: 2551  perhaps, Joe?|pg||
nt|petergill: On the likely club lead, 4@S looks cold|pg||
nt|nicksan: 4 @S not excactly showing the hand type. If E/W continue to 5 @C, South will have the wrong idea...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly the raise has advantages, it does miss a possible 5/4 @h fit since people frequently overcall rather than x with 5422 hands, though.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The good old rule: when you have a misfit (and this is definitely one), stop as low as possible|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|petergill: This Telemark team seems to include 2 or 3 recent regulars in Norway's youth team, who may have won a World junior teams Championship in Beijing last year|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hi folks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|petergill: South showed 5-6 in the majors, so North's two minor suit kings look like waste paper, so perhaps North might raise 3@S to only 4@S, having only 1 HCP in partner's suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Joe|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nicksan: Morning Joe!|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, when you have only 8 trumps, a singleton in partner's second suit is not much of an asset|pg||
nt|nicksan: If he runs this...It's getting closer!|pg||
nt|petergill: Looks like -1, my 2nd guess would be -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: this may take a while|pg||
nt|petergill: whatever, NS will gain imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't quite get to 12 tricks even if he lets it ride, but it's close|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S9 is an important card|pg||
nt|petergill: yes|pg||

nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Previous board: Even if North had have bid 3NT over the splinter, 3NT would have failed too|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|nicksan: N/S may find a plus score in, say, 1 NT. |pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Would you re-open with double or 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Depends on range agrements...|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT I think|pg||
nt|nicksan: This should make comfortably|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: 1NT, partly because I want to protect @DAQ in any contract we play, also to protect @CAKx if partner has the jack|pg||

nt|nicksan: Personally, I'm not a fan of leaving the field open to the opponents as West. Would have responded 1 @D...|pg||

nt|petergill: North did well to pass 2@D - an aggressive 2NT over 2@D would have led to a minus score in 3NT I think|pg||

mc|9|nt|petergill: Nick's point about responding light is good tactical advice, rather than giving the opponents a free run to their best contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am with Nick. I tend to respond with most anything when non-vul|pg||
nt|nicksan: Except when i do, partners next bid is always 2 NT...|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, in practice that approach seems to produce the best outcomes|pg||
