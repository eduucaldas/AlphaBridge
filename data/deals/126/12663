mb|1H|nt|peachy: NEC Bridge Festifal|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone and welcome back |pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play 1N=15-17,  Klinger-Mullamphy transfer over their 3+ 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to get there if W bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - He will sure risk 2 @S|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: however n/s do not play at speed of light (until the end of hand) |pg||
nt|peachy: Qualification Match number 7 on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - letÂ´s start with 1 NT undoubled?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but not the final quarter|pg||
nt|sybarra: I played agst. N/S in super swiss in USA Nationals |pg||
nt|sybarra: final Swiss standings and qtr-final brackets at   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Tuff start here - slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: The tournament website for those interested, scores from Match 5 are not yet there but will sonn I'm sure http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: from NEC Bridge Festival in Yokohama, Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 15th NEC Cup. 12 rounds of qualifying (Swiss), 14 boards per match. This is a match from round 7 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello V|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker-Gower are the "South" part of Team South Sweden -- they're from South Africa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heavy promotion of the N hand will likely allow 3N to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have a CC that says NS play Precision with variable NT [sometimes 10-12, other 14-16]|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ish is quite interesting |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and now?|pg||
nt|peachy: esciting hand, afteralll|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the current leaders versus  2|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Ralf|pg||
mb|3C|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: they found the @S lead in the other room |pg||
nt|marlowepi: case for Slead but H normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's a WBF card from 2008 - so maybe they played for Bulgaria in Beijing|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ish =Del Monte|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even playing walsh style, a passed hand can afford to bid 1D, surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oh well, cant spell|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Raija Davis, Hans Werge and Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the ecats site has a CC for the Italians from the 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I believe Bach's nickname is "ash"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 3rd @D might bring some problemes|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings -- not updated for Round 7 yet |pg||
nt|hawe45:  No losing option in slam, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well called peter|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H should make because of the @c discard on the @S Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and with this lead...|pg||
nt|shevek: here we are, hello everyone, the last round of the swiss|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|peachy: W got worried and pulled|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find the best lead: @C Ace|pg||
nt|po-s: anyone knows the standings?|pg||
nt|shevek: you're picking Hans :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: yeah i met him in Yokohama|pg||
nt|sybarra: shortly for Ashley   thx Nick |pg||
nt|larrymori: first|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
mb|4C|nt|flash: a bit harsh to attribute a result to a normal lead?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W helped a bit - now declarer should guess @s correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
nt|shevek: current results will be updated soon at: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S back is best|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat light and risky double by N on just 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - anf opener third in hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: -50 could win a few vs. 140|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N getting what he maybe deserved. even so, maybe S should pass 2D...he has probably already shown spade tolerance by passing 1S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - 920 in sight|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  @S 10 was an option|pg||
nt|flash: the trump split will slow declarer down a bit|pg||
nt|xenya: creates a small problem for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  udca|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no big risk to double 180 instead of 90|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: ruffing with the 9 seems to be correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s not the way everybody would play. Ruff with the Jack og King and play against the Queen. But no argument against success|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Polish Club, EW 5card major and 15-17NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|nt|flash: declarer will probably start on one of the pointed suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His problem is, that @S King might be by the 1 @D-bidder |pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is weighing his options|pg||
nt|flash: mentally going through each possible line - trying to find the safest/ most reasonable|pg||
nt|flash: all not lost if the @SK off-side|pg||
nt|peachy: against this opposition, it pays to be careful|pg||
nt|flash: that looks like the most probable choice from here|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has a rather strong clue to the location of the @DA...|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Awful @H-shift, partner wanted @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a sense "W helped", but if he hadnt bid N would be playing a level lower|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: soon is not soon enough...|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some interesting decisions at several stages of the auction here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: udca=Upside Down  Count  Attitude|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Raija.|pg||
nt|peachy: Jordan:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello raija, jordan, rehi Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru 8 matches posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Marshall.|pg||
nt|peachy: Al:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think this is match  10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Either N or E might have made a double at their turn.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can see 3C with the N hand, but double looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C in context of Precision probably shows longer @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: onthis defence, it's cold|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what about 6nt? if @c are Jxxx - x, @hq can be on side|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes sure|pg||
nt|po-s: hej Ralf, hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and actually -- a number of big clubbers use  1@D-2@H as Reverse Flannery - to show the 5@S 4@H weak responding hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally guess one board right per day - here it was|pg||
nt|xenya: the other room was quicker -- a push|pg||
nt|po-s: 6nt?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
nt|flash: declarer's problem, if the @SK is, indeed, offside is the lack of an entry to hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Both of these teams are prime candidates for winning the whole event|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  not sure why W covered the ten of clubs as trick one|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may accept the invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should we say it this way - @S-shift was not killing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with W in a sense of his bidding, actually, but this time his activity wasted |pg||
nt|po-s: just in case North holds Jxxx in clubs - and the HQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Yokohama. hi to all|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had few options, but that certainly clarified/simplified things for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argument for @S is that partner has all the points -- even if @H strikes strength -- may not be entry to East's length|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: now should go down, he doesnt have the ricks any more|pg||
pc|d4|nt|shevek: A few words about the format of the event:|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|sybarra: he lead 9, so....N had to count (3) |pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: oh you mean N  sorry |pg||
nt|xenya: 1N went down next door, so it will be not 3 imps, but 6|pg||
nt|shevek: 48 teams entered, random draw for the 1st match, then swiss draw|pg||
nt|po-s: but will lose against 4s-D|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello po :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi p-o|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Mike!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: always up so late :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi PO|pg||

nt|po-s: hello all, particularly Mr W|pg||
nt|pelu: yes @c6|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello David|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Must be a flat board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- played the 2@H bidder to hold ZERO @H honors|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of Roland choices here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here 3 NT better be played by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. the case for a spade is that if you are beating this with hearts your heart ten is redundant, whereas if spades is the right suit the heart ten may be of some use on defense|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like an easy 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: Lavazza brought this time Duboin-Sementa, Bocchi, Madala, and Guido Ferraro|pg||
nt|flash: all right, folks - we've got a relatively small group in this room (to watch two of the best pairs in the world), so pls move down to the front of the auditorium and feel free to ...|pg||
nt|flash: ask questions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Hello PEO|pg||
nt|po-s: is there a link to standings?|pg||
nt|xenya: hello PO|pg||
nt|larrymori: slam happens to be cold but...|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems here, that 4 @H depends on the @C-suit|pg||
nt|flash: Polish Club - several possible hands|pg||
nt|flash: in this case, the strong(est) option|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict 3S final contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: but this might not be flat -- particularly after the double by W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  EastÂ´s double is OK - for the minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ecats should still have convention cards for both pairs online from Beijing 2008 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly hand, endplayed into making 6N|pg||
nt|othered1: well odds-off|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 3-loser hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct play makes it|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: overcals in minor vuln sh normal be on 6 card suits - so S passed where mane clubplayers would bid 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
nt|hlortz: for sure vul too dangerous to overcall at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N take any action now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e., is it worth is?|pg||
nt|peachy: strongest is 19+ any shape|pg||
nt|flash: our operator threw up a small false card|pg||
nt|flash: didn't slow us down, however   :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @H RD is a make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
nt|xenya: Oz Players are currently 4th, 16 VPS ahead of Sara who are 6/7th |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = ART Game Force [2-way Checkback]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know why Sementa didn't bid 2@H :(|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here a pass from West would be a big win!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice West-hand - E/W can make 1 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless EW play 4-card majors, E would probably have bid 2S over 1S if his pd had opened in first seat|pg||
nt|po-s: how much is that?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very risky, but more than 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and without a @h lead 9 tricks in 2@hRD|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oays even better then|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Pays|pg||
nt|po-s: really?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East was right, without @H-lead 11 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  po-s even 2 @H D is more than 620 (670)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
nt|shevek: they probably will :)|pg||
nt|po-s: I heard you the first time - or rather saw you|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
nt|pelu: and prob @Ss bad for declayer - act 2@H down 1 - EW tahe the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i freely open 1N with a 5-card major, but here i would open 1S. i doubt we have a game if pd responds 1N, and if pd is 35 in majors we will play wrong suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either 2C was Puyppet or E is already steaming trying to get the swing back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: current standings available at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1100 against 2 @H D - and against any other contract I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: the teams' primary target is to get to the quarter-finals|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
nt|hlortz: dubion must be worth another try here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Henry.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may not try. he may just bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe 2NT has dual meaning|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin ..my typing is lacking|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 IMPs to Bulgaria on 1 - Lavazza got to 5@D and that was doubled and set 3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1 = 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that much point in trying when YOU have eight controls. partner is likely to drop you even when you want to be there|pg||
nt|peachy: even a player with no pulse would get that dbld, I think,|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@d looks like an overbid... whatever it means|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either EW play 4-card majors or E was allowing for possible 4-card suit by doubling. still, with short spades a 43 fit could be the best spot, with the ruff coming in the short ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump hand|pg||

nt|xenya: hard to see where E found the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East trusted South - a mistake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why 5@c now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough decision atr trick one, probably wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: so ifyou changed @H and @D in west's hand, you would open 1N, Marshall?|pg||

nt|sybarra: where do YOU want to be on this hand |pg||
nt|po-s: oh please, KJ doubleton in D on side would also do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: curious that when N led a heart and E won, E continued that suit. |pg||
mb|2S|nt|hlortz: we see here the strong part of 1@C |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good old Irving Gordon, originally from Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I bet David played against him a few times|pg||
nt|jtr: And in teams with him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awfully good hand for a weak 2, if that is what it is|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red suits lie well for NS - for 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway well done by both sides as 4@H was cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: usual 1@C is like a weakNT|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club, weak no trump in use for North-South|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18, 5c S|pg||
nt|flash: we had a famous baseball player in the old days "Shoeless" Joe Jackson...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their convention card from Sao Paolo just says "2-way checkback"|pg||
nt|sybarra: true po,  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was not as bad a slam as many we see, though odds-against|pg||
nt|larrymori: south would have to put up the 10 to cause a problem|pg||
nt|othered1: and 1N is?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has some chances in 4S|pg||
mb|3D!|an|better minor|nt|andyv:  vul 2N seems a bit rich with W hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, Sveta:)|pg||
nt|flash: supposedly because, as a country boy, wearing shoes hurt his feet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then:  xx   KTx   KQx   QJTxx|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will Westrun in 5 @D DOUBLED...|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks conventional but not sure what |pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: in Hans' case, not removing his shoes might indicate fewer tricks than available...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4-9 HCP, 5+@H & 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|peachy: I still have suspicion 2NT was not denying hearts, perhaps to show the 12-14 instead of more wideranging options included in 1C|pg||
nt|po-s: probably "Polish" |pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart king fatal|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  vul attempt - it always deserves trying|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N considering 4N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hi Raija, welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not cold, I think. You have a losing option in @C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like X or 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2N vul against not has limited appeal|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure Scotland wasnt joined to europe when he was there:)|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to overcall, perhaps on the basis that his hand is too good - immediate overcalls destructive in nature|pg||
nt|peachy: nt apparent;ly 16-18 or something|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You have 10 slo tricks in 4 @H, but before that, defense will have 4 or 5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  slow|pg||
nt|po-s: 4 of a major and a longer minor|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||
nt|larrymori: just what east wanted to see pard bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: will W float this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially since the suit is likely to be weak|pg||
nt|po-s: he should - 2NT should be this kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe W not on same wavelength, as he had other options over the D|pg||
nt|larrymori: something about trying to improve part scores is not a good philosophy|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. at this vul |pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump needed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and logical|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like these 2-openings|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  S to the rescue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice 5 @D - if they bid the slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now - why is West passing?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer wind and leads jack of hearts, covered. N must unblock, and duck 2nd heart to S's 8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  nice plan for expert's book )))|pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down a few|pg||
nt|po-s: The opponents do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and you PO?|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong hand for the gadget|pg||
nt|po-s: The Laws say the game should be played in a friendly way|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: EW off the hook |pg||
nt|pelu: NS could also go for penalty against EW - 2@CX = 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say that the W hand looks more like what I usually hold|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes e came in expecting the weak hand in south|pg||
nt|dburn: if classical strong club, yes - 17-19 or even 17-20 more common ranges nowadays|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I'm old school|pg||
nt|flash: this is the kind of deal which decides matches - much less short matches like this|pg||
nt|flash: to some extent, the @D call helps North - whatever values South has might well include some in @Cs|pg||
nt|peachy: good decision, 5D would only tumble one or so|pg||
nt|xenya: very unlikely at these colours and with W being silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction in OR '|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H denies a top honor  - but that doesn't surprise Klinger|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: dblfits all around, and now that was brought to daylight|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - the lead must be a @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Service-double - earns nothing, helps N/S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice contract - on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Do we all bid 1 @S - I do not|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: seems a small spade allows to make it -- a club lead would have been more challenging|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: strictly speaking, yes, but you can get a fairly good count on the E hand i think|pg||
nt|flash: East suggests defense vs 5@Ss and strongly suggests that West not bid more (especially vulnerable)|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree with Jim's explanation, for what its worth|pg||
nt|flash: Hans actually sneaked in a good point - suggesting/directing the @D lead was important here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   1N already said 12-14|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even w/o dbl - could be gain for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NorthÂ´s opening bid pushed E/W to game, equalling the match|pg||
nt|othered1: with no trump lead and very friendly breaks, this can play well on cross ruff.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you see they made 5 in the other room,   @h and ht continuation |pg||
nt|hlortz: oh im NOT defending their bidding LOL you have 19 pard opens and you dont move past 3n.|pg||
nt|peachy: X more flexible|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess the Canadians are well behind - although Raptor sounds old|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, can make 5 by going up ace, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 lead is ATTITUDE  [seems an exaggeration of the suit]|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe helps - http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2008/zagranica/friendly/cc_hol/van%20Prooijen-Verhees.pdf |pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  Nice @D-suit - brings 4 tricks to East-West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - cancel|pg||
nt|po-s: Hans, asusual you are right - North will cover the Dten and yes, four tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D could lead to 3D cold for 3N or 4S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why South volunteered a bid in front of partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
nt|peachy: this has chances to chke, and I think it will|pg||
nt|peachy: S sensibly signs off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer D from W on the first round of bidding. 15HP behind opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both sides play trump - only one can be right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s 9 - "partner, I have clubs" - seems so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here than in OR|pg||
nt|flash: XX shows 1st round control|pg||
nt|shevek: west is Johan Sylvan, a hugely successful poker player, but....pass was right|pg||
nt|sybarra: its 2 yrs old so at out own risk |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  life is more simple|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: K or Q from S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think best was to fly @CA, ruff @H  top @D pitching @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is much to be said AGAINST this 4 @S 1) Suit is too short - but good 2 ) Hand can play also in @H - and @C|pg||
nt|po-s: Johan is also a very good bridgeplayer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|flash: notice that the @D lead would hold this to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I am surprise the diamond lead didnt come, after West's valiant effort|pg||
nt|flash: to quote David Berkowitz:  if  i'd bid @Cs, would you have led a @D????|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: Yes true|pg||
nt|peachy: make*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- I'd try 2N|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2@c p/c was not so attractive so he figured maybe a 62 or 61 might be better|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Nice for once to see instant scoring outside Scandinavia and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can we hope for America to follow suit?|pg||
nt|hlortz: in 10 or 20 years|pg||
nt|peachy: she could even play low and make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should have bid 5 @C - to get a @D-leas...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: X for me|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure... 40 or 50 years from now|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello kibitzers:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: I see we have a strong match going here|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I have had|pg||
nt|po-s: trump queen and a club|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  Some play this DONT -. or others, where D = 1-suiter|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: it wasnt just 19, it was about the crispest 19 imagineable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shd be easy now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: top D before H ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- unblock Ace first|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the soup now,  with q of @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  But now the @C-guess will decide - and East will fix it|pg||
nt|xenya: faultless defence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: 3N is my second choice|pg||
nt|othered1: nicely defended|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: not on a club opening lead she couldnt|pg||
nt|peachy: not opening lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|jtr: What do we think of West's 2NT though?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S should have played trumps from the very beginning|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1D response showed four+hearts, 2C was puppet to 2D and 2S inviting with four|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK - not much the defenders can do to hurt him since he has one spade trick and two of each|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: 3@D is my LAST choice :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N could fail cold for 4S though, and on many hands where E would not trake you out|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|peachy: Might have been wise to cash HA, it could disappear on the club|pg||

pc|h3|nt|peachy: hes got 7|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: at red facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too aggressive at these colours|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|po-s: 1C was a weak NT or clubs - didn´t know "my" system had spread that far east|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jtr: Very polite Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much, at these colours, and pard a passed hand  |pg||
nt|hlortz: vul not to my taste to easy to go -200 - or more|pg||
nt|jbgood: served its purpose: getting a plus score|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Yes fair point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it did, but it possibly should not have done|pg||
nt|jtr: If you dont give decisions the opponents dont have the opportunity for mistakes|pg||

nt|dburn: he needed to, for some reason - not quite sure what that was all about|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - he went up with the jack on the first round of hearts|pg||
nt|flash: our skepticism of the board 2 result is the 1 IMP on the scoreboard so far|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem with 2N is that it is an underbid|pg||
nt|loganrun: 8311 perhaps|pg||
nt|shevek: results updated now at: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
nt|po-s: then it would be necessary to grab the CA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cheap adventure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: likely 3S by S|pg||
nt|dburn: but I don't have much idea why he did that, with K9x in his hand|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was a case of "monkey fell from tree"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: this alert?  is it "could be 2" |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe playing for West to have @h10x and no entry, but that seems a bit of a view|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree with W's pass -- the fact that you are behind the opener doesn't matter much with his holding -- no tenaces, just controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+@C, not 4@C & 4@D [1@D]|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|hawe45:  Still no game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not everybodyÂ´ s taste that 2 NT - facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes you need to make that call with an undistinguished balanced 16. here you are close to 8 trix in yr own hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL expects to hear more @H from LHO|pg||
nt|loganrun: but that means that he has ace of hearts and king of clubs outside of his trump suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the bare @C King, South would have taken the kead in his hand to play @C King|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was that making?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D attractive spot single dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: Wasn't the last -1?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lead directing pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this will be a very tight match, both teams have some of the world's best pairs playing,  and Fantunes, perhaps theeee best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW rate to go minus in game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to hear more hearts, it matters little what you do|pg||

nt|po-s: did Ish never cash his ace?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder |pg||
nt|larrymori: cant imagine not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe they just miscounted|pg||
nt|othered1: As usual, our running score isn't remotely official -- the players will get it right in comparisons.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fixed noww|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: JC doesn´t quite believe the explanation|pg||
nt|loganrun: that as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" are either explaining, deep in thought or crashing |pg||
nt|po-s: I thought they played some miniclub  thing, pretty natural, like he played) with Jansma|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: prob same as open rm|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N takes the push to 3...faster than I could type|pg||
nt|peachy: not a bad choice, d finesse near 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi: its over|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S was puppet to 1NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  why not a simple raise?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow aggressive double|pg||
nt|jtr: Just right at MPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in their lucky day EW win @s game|pg||
nt|peachy: good start, W raised|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main problem - to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: lose 2h and 3s|pg||
nt|flash: the stopperless 1NT does have its potential drawbacks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and against 2 NT also|pg||
nt|peachy: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: how about 3NT Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm starting to think that the long run winner for South is to PASS the DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this could be ugly for EW very soon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4C was a lot to bid with 11 adjusted losers and all 5 HCP in opps' suits|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: good decision by West here - that raise wasn't automatic|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm unfamiliar with ew system, for me raise would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|peachy: they did well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=transfer|pg||
nt|loganrun: this hand will play well as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 1C was clubs or wk or 18-19 NT, 1H showed spades|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if Gower doesn't lead a minor -- still only 9 tricks  [i think]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S bids 3S, as he should, they arein slam|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: sounds like penalties, with good hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: Aiming for the KOD Roland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S probably wanted to dbl the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going for the KOD is tempting at MP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KOD = Kiss of Death|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead - only a @S could give S some problems|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Let me count|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Edgar Kaplan is rolling over in his sepulchre Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|po-s: not so ugly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow !! ugly all right, but for NS|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  Here they only get 10, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments from now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Vlad -- i'm not really here, just adding some explanations of alerts if i can|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome!|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S was consistent with a wk NT with 2-3 spades...|pg||
nt|po-s: how is 6|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like def can make 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: excellent switch |pg||
pc|d5|nt|hlortz: aka 200|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -200 at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead was better, and logical on the auction and the W hand|pg||
nt|chick: kind of a waste of the 10|pg||
nt|peachy: its cold, dont think any lead woulda caused a prob|pg||
nt|flash: but an important lesson:  the defenders can't see your hand...|pg||
nt|peachy: silence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  20 tricks in difference or so|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks simple enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to guess the spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if N leads heart queen...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  second try is still available|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how will he get to dummy?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ruffing clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not before hearts are led by S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N leads a club, jack is the correct card. then ten of hearts|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  your are right, Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W does best to rise and lead a club, but NS can still prevail, though there is scope for error|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause -- in case Klinger has ducked @DA??|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but is N still thinking...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: wrong J by pd - and he has 3 of them :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bulgaria matched the 4@S contract on 19 - and two overtricks for 2 IMPs to 23-zip.|pg||
nt|hlortz: bulgarians are going full speed ahead|pg||
nt|peachy: N gambled, W could have had Ax spades and KQxx xlubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N could easily turn out to be an underbid, e.g. if N held:   KJxx   Axx   AKQxx  x   they would play 3N with 6D near cold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction from Vladi Isporski|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks an entry short to use all threats, but i may be wrong|pg||
nt|larrymori: the game bonus makes it compelling to raise with the south hand|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff diamond, 2xtrumps A of D to throw a spade,  ruff and SK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: and on board 18 West kept NS out of 4@s by opening 1@s on five low and a pile of dingo's kidneys|pg||
nt|othered1: South may feel has two free bids were enough and 4@D is likely defined as NF|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but now lost the chance to defeat|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  and should get it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not 500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 25 3@S-1 was above average for NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: total waste|pg||
nt|chick: although I guess a pitch on the J doesn't do much|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|po-s: trump I think,  knowing that South has a good number of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 11-13, 3/4@H   2@D=ART Game Force [effectively 4th suit]|pg||
nt|po-s: but won+t|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: not about pitch, about how many clubs nead to be ruffed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as it was proved next door |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: penalties ranged from 1400 (4Nx-5 EW) to 800 (4Hx-3 NS)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now you can make an overtrickm playing on @C|pg||
nt|po-s: and now a club finesse?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been weaker hand than 2N  --- not sure what 3@C asks :(|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: how do u play on a @s-lead?? - can u make 3NT? |pg||
nt|peachy: well, perhaps I am wrong, fforgot the 3S bid after hearts were set by 3H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Duboin to have opening bid, he MUST hold @DK|pg||
nt|peachy: wd|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: push on 3 -- same contract, same result in the OR|pg||
nt|jcwla: Highly impressive.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  Oh - no entry any longer|pg||
nt|pelu: prob on an endplay of West?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: it could be beaten double dummy -- @H lead, A, @H ruff, underlead @Cs, another @H ruff -- and there is another trick for the defence -- but now it makes|pg||
nt|po-s: fortunately no|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: you could from the beginning but why bother too much, IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: so that was 11 IMPs to The Latin, who usually make a good showing in this tournament|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  This might pÃ¥ 1.200 - 2 x 600|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like he won with @dA|pg||
nt|xenya: well perhaps that's how it was made in the other room -- i was wondering|pg||
nt|po-s: but will beat this or should|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I´m not awake. He won with @cK|pg||
mc|8|nt|xenya: pitch a loser now|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NS have an awful lot of tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 top tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: about 16|pg||
nt|jtr: A few tricks here|pg||
nt|hlortz: 7 @D @H or NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you would expect a flat 7N across the field |pg||
nt|jbgood: no|pg||
nt|jtr: Even my grandmother would manage 9 i think|pg||
nt|jbgood: there are always a mix-up somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in Central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far the standard fo card play has not matched the quaity of the bidding|pg||
nt|tez: nicely played|pg||
nt|po-s: misplaying diamonds like that...|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry, you didn´t even need that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have bid 5D there, as the 4C bid helped him...it looks like S is not loaded in clubs so is likely to have D ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: was 4 @D the right bid?  may 5?|pg||
nt|larrymori: he did bid it 3 times, south can raise|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that looks like gain for NS - they have no game for easy play |pg||
nt|xenya: that was very strange|pg||
nt|po-s: oops I thought he had three clubs...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  @S-guess is worth 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S made E-W on that one, so a potentially very big 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here N/S can take the first ?? tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they won't mind that 1 imp loss at all|pg||
nt|sybarra: he had of the things! |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: but somehow I doubt every pair will bid 7N|pg||
nt|po-s: the spot cards in D and H were crucial - should have made|pg||
nt|hawe45:  -Ready for another partscore|pg||
nt|po-s: Carruthers never get to bid his hearts...unless 2D was multi|pg||
nt|pelu: now on slam-level|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely n/s draws a dble here |pg||
nt|peachy: 12-15 bal, 19+ any, and two more options|pg||
nt|flash: again, the multi-meaning 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Bulgarian EW also playing big club   their auction begins  1@D-DBL-P-2@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: need to get to NT not @H here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=(21)22-23|pg||
nt|sybarra: that didnt get in my comment|pg||
nt|othered1: I put the last board into the "stuff happens" category, along with many other 8-card suit hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  NS got lot of points again.  @h game? NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And the Multi might help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how high does e/w bid?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 5@H now??|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c opening means..nat or 16+any hand..polish club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I agree with 5 @H |pg||
nt|dburn: I neither - they were 19th in the standings after four rounds, but not sure what they did in their last match|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 |pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts n/s in a spot quickly |pg||
nt|tez: bid or not to bid..pass is not forcing i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: for all N knows,  S may have no clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: 16+ nat or 12-18 4441|pg||
nt|xenya: weak 1N?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Â´Looks like a flat 3 NT here|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ed, you are so gracious @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5NT? = I can play slam in 2 suits?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if they are up against The Latin their results can't have been bad|pg||
nt|peachy: if the have puppet, easy|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|Walddk2: Some will not even be in a grand slam. Just wait and see|pg||
nt|po-s: which it probably ewas|pg||
nt|xenya: on 18, EW in the other room didn't find the 4@S save -- 8 imps to World Youth|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the X shows @S or just cards?|pg||
nt|tez: strong opening |pg||
nt|sybarra: will S bid 7?|pg||
nt|tez: i thk|pg||
nt|pelu: cards I exp - but spect can correct me :)|pg||
nt|tez: 6 enuf:)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly different auction in other room  since 1 @H=sp |pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least that's what the old convention card says :(|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh never mind 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easier without it|pg||
nt|peachy: but S decided not to even look, reasonable decision with 4333|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think 4 @D is "testing pard"  doesnt pard have to have at least a couple of @D's (with honor) to bid 3 nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: he will bid pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree  but S has to like his hand |pg||
nt|loganrun: strightforward 3NT after West shows 18-19 bal|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  3@d by S seems to make things easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @d suit most likely the one in question |pg||
nt|flash: 2@D natural and VERY positive|pg||
nt|flash: grand slam easy from here - far more difficult to reach at the table?|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D 5+ C or D, usually gf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A 2 C-overcall by East, might have brought some trouble for N/S |pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C|pg||
nt|flash: SPECS!!!   287 people in here and there's virtual silence!!!   c'mon - talk to us|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N did not want to lead a trump because he was worried about hearts affording discards. he preferred clubs to diamonds for an unusual reason--they were weaker, i.e. he hoped the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ten would best serve the defense if the suit was not attacked from his side|pg||
nt|othered1: Not really|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow. well, he has 3 hearts and the 3 of hearts. must be why he bid 3H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: at least 3@c gets some strength across i imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: to Zmud|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be at sprint speed of play |pg||
nt|pelu: 6@Hs will only cost 800 - but rish that opp bid 7 - and then he also has to bid 7@H|pg||
nt|tez: and also 7@s..then:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (when he decides play) |pg||
nt|dburn: looks like strong club for both pairs, given that 1@d opening|pg||
nt|flash: private msgs only to any commentator who has +++ in their profile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @C Voidwould - and South is taken by surprise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Voidwood|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D was 5+ DIAM and usually GF, I made a mistake, thanks friendly spec!!!|pg||
nt|flash: i've seen this b4...|pg||
nt|flash: 5@C (obviously???) intended as exclusion - but....|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H showed H stopper!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|peachy: he surely has it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 NT is the spot - nu risc for @D-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  no|pg||
nt|po-s: will Ish double finess clubs?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  I will let it drop |pg||
nt|larrymori: but the north hand had no aces too with strength behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there was a flat grand (13 tables) at the YC once - about 30 years ago |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is lesson for all......think at first trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Now 7NT is easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the few hands 2/1 players would have an easy time with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning, afternoon, evening, as you please|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Roland!|pg||
nt|po-s: it looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT is the limit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would have asked if opener held 3 or 4@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: Blackwood is a fine convention|pg||
nt|flash: standings at   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very heavy 1 NT - or?|pg||
nt|po-s: or just establish spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N was worried in particular aboutheart strength behind him, which E rated to have for his strong bidding|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  so, first push?|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm sure that is correct|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: KC is even better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one pair in 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: make, prob with overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: check the Daily Bulletins - they're among the best in the world...   a Rigal-Colker production paid advertisement...|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H?! That will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the second double was quite an overbid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once N cannot even make a responsive double over 3H, really S shd subside|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: two in six|pg||
nt|peachy: nice switch|pg||
nt|xenya: trappy hand -- they are bound to end up in 3N -- and they did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=long suit game try -- not sure why that is an alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S brought his rabbi  (play ace with K is singleton off side) |pg||
nt|xenya: i womder what system NS are playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both players strong NT with their regular partners|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: he has a cost free chance to try find the Q|pg||
nt|dburn: and of course, whenever you open some minimum in 4th chair partner always punishes you by jumping to 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: 1 key card for @Hs, excluding @Cs...    but a big swing in a short match|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will attack @C before @D - finessing @D into the hand without @SS-trick|pg||
nt|po-s: as he has very few entries to the spades...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: Didnt bother about the @dQ expecting South to have 3 @ds|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding will take longer than the play|pg||
nt|jtr: There are a few less experienced pairs in the field remember|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 IMP - the first for NL|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe South didÂ´nt like his hand with 2 suits without stopper|pg||
nt|po-s: I think the 4spades doubled got misscored - - it was 2 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plus N was already a passed hand so had some leeway to stretch to bid over 3H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: well played|pg||
nt|peachy: and he did do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Fu expected either weaker hand with @D & @S or  stronger would take another call|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: yes, 3 trumps, a spade and 4 tricks in the minors -- EW can't do anything about that|pg||
nt|po-s: particularly now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: too right -- pure values in @S & @D = old fashioned 1@D instead of 1N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: note - would NOT do that if @D & @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think well judged actions from both players|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, shouldn´t have covered|pg||
nt|larrymori: covering was probably not right|pg||
nt|larrymori: gives an entry to the north hand|pg||
nt|larrymori: the high spades rate to be separate so better than 33 @cs|pg||
nt|po-s: in the other room declarer won the forst heart, finessed - covered diamonds and played a club (queen), unblocked ten and then finessed clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: now S must find the right lead to set, will she? small d but of course we see all cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No danger, @H Ace will not be missed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza got to 3NT so 12 more coming to Bulgaria.  Up 35-0 now.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Al|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: Patrick Huang tells me that Lin has played for Taiwan in the Venice Cup, and that Nie is from China where she is a celebrated Go player|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean *he|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kantar article in most recent ACBL Bulletin would have said 3N was the ONLY decision|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|peachy: thanks for the info|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contradiction in terms. if it is the only call, there is no decision|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: if you want to spy on the other room while still watching this one   http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|d3|pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  next door, @s misguessed|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|po-s: well....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  But wait a minute - only 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- was declarer supposed to play @CQ before @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter on this hand, but if Klinger held 3@C instead of 4 -- he would be truly endplayed now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: a swing is possible here -- but more likely EW in the OR will also reach 3N declared by E |pg||
nt|xenya: but we will see|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice @c10|pg||
pc|h6|nt|shevek: I thk he lost 1@s, 1@h and 2@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the first double was questionable also, since S is not prepared for a response even of 2D. a 2C overcall has flaws too of course|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: what should we say of this 2H overcall, at unfavorable colors facing a passed partner with a poor and short suit, no real hand, and the worst possible holding in the opps' suit? ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the diplomat in me votes for "fearless"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Ish & Bach both strong backgrounds in Acol -- would be surprised if they also play 3NN|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a hand, where you might bid 4 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then the spades block & N can duck a club|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess he will have to go for clubs then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if W doesnt shake a spade...|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|tez: nice coment shirley..i agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question will be if they "reconnect" the tables |pg||
nt|larrymori: with the @cs 33 and the |pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, if N had known toi pass the second double, it would have been NS who collected 500 against nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: I would open the E hand at any colors. many would disagree of course, but it is an opening bid by many well-respected yardsticks|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H was again a transfer to 4S :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  almost :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they lost connection again..... |pg||

nt|pelu: italian waiter ? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has 3 stoppers in the @S-suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=art game force|pg||
nt|shevek: Apteker also opened 4@s in bd 19|pg||

nt|marlowepi: absolutrely|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@D sh be alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  NS playing Precision so 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C [16+ HCP]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H u mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i told the computer to display -- wonder where @S came from|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 4@S if my 6 4 were 10 9|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S as usual puppet to 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: hard to bid it in the "suit" the opps opened|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|peachy: so much to find out, even after 1H opening|pg||
nt|hlortz: cosmic ray no doubt :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember it's north's unexpected @H shortness that makes this possible and south won't be able to work things out.|pg||
nt|po-s: but only three spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 2 @H? is shortness?|pg||
nt|larrymori: might end here|pg||
nt|larrymori: accepting the xfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how to bid these perfecto hands...|pg||
nt|po-s: nono, 1NT I´m sure was banatural|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont think 2 @H was accepting transfer |pg||
nt|po-s: "acceptin" yes|pg||
nt|larrymori: why else would he bid it after a natural 1nt|pg||
nt|po-s: bot liking|pg||
nt|po-s: not|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is bot like!|pg||
nt|larrymori: reluctant bid after his move with the 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Bach in the tank?  dont like that |pg||
nt|po-s: are you Dutch?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|po-s: I know|pg||
nt|larrymori: well if he bids @ds, it will get them out of the hole|pg||
nt|sybarra: but seems strange to me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and possible director call (imo) |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: operator may have missed the subtle pointing to bidding card |pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  in mp, rather be in 3N or 5@d?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A lucky 3 NT here |pg||
nt|po-s: Did he really make nine tricks on the previous hand?|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is take/out to @s..strong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 ball, or 18-19 ball or natural @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: N to double? |pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
nt|peachy: W has max and six cards, well done to Pass|pg||
nt|po-s: if 3D is only inviting....|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could end here?|pg||
nt|po-s: you kidding?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: isnt it forcing??|pg||
nt|larrymori: gotta be right to raise to game|pg||
nt|po-s: at least invitational IMO - would be forcing for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GF by UZPH, but at lease forcing here|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt N can pass,  with huge hand but now what |pg||
nt|marlowepi: well he caNT SPLINTER:):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: If he "splinters" it will go all pass |pg||
nt|po-s: of course there is the possibility of a misunderstanding (1D opening)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another swedish international predicts  D from N|pg||
nt|po-s: In 3NT he must duck clubs twice to have a chnce|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if 3 @S what does S do? |pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: how would you like to pass as E then put THIS dummy down in a mere 4 spades then watch pd go down?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Patrick Huang |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Agree - will West make his 620? Double-finesse in @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam good facing as little as:  KQxx   Jxx    x   AKxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- when W didn't play his last spade to tap S|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s or pass i thk|pg||
nt|tez: :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ashley Bach also led a small @C  [the 6]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 3S, planning to bid 4C over3N|pg||
nt|po-s: I didn´t say it would make but that would be his only chance - 3 x clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the dutch guys wont even mind that much if they get to slam, the auction will have taken a year off NS lives|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and that is a slightly aggressive responsive double by South, but part score swings are generated by pushing your opponents around|pg||
nt|flash: note the 2@C call - the 6-card suit outweighs the 4-card length in @Hs, despite the fact that partner is far more likely to hold @Hs than @Cs|pg||
nt|flash: but, we seem to have run into the question of whether the 'free bid' shows values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 spec telling me that NS are NOT playing Precision at this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has good cards facing a splinter, but unable to cue 4D he must bid 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and S should have more than that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the spade finesse is on I make 630 vs 620|pg||
nt|peachy: but|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks, Shrley and Hi all.|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was always going to bid 3@s, but no harm in seeing whether his opponents accidentally pass him out in 2@s doubled first|pg||
nt|po-s: what was the phrase? Youthful?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||
nt|peachy: i see no chance for OT|pg||
nt|tez: they are leading 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again we see the lead middle from 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: EW can defeat 4@S on a @S lead (DD decl can 2xfiness in @D and make)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: all leads 2/4......better way to describe it   (thx spec) |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with the @S-vois, South has a few values|pg||
nt|hawe45:  void|pg||
nt|peachy: if 3D was GF he cant pass now...or can he|pg||
nt|flash: SJ Simon counseled :  how much worse could your hand be...    not much!!!???|pg||
nt|peachy: Also "How to bid misfits?"  A: "Don't"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must take his chance - 4 @c was the first bid from North, which was - maybe - NOT forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: a spec says 3D asked for D stopper|pg||
nt|flash: most would play a cue bid forcing to game in major or NT, but only to 4-level in minor???|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that is a sensible way to play it|pg||
nt|flash: again, need to remove shoes to count losers in S hand???|pg||
nt|peachy: hearts behaving, Bulgaria can hardly lose on this deal, or Lavazza gain|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: I suppose on this lie of cards North-South actually had some play for 4@h|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|tez: 3 down is bad news for ew|pg||
nt|pelu: so all leads = I have a higher card in this suit!!|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes horrible suit breaks for decalarer good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: if you have singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: lol:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: again OR just back,  I think the Italian waiters should be removed from that room!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt Mullamphy seems to be operating a bit here -- maybe HOPING to get to 8@S with his 2 sure trump tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: this is very close|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: i would feel like the unluckiest person born|pg||
nt|peachy: I love all our Polish specs who help with NS system interpretation, for the benefit of all our gallery|pg||
nt|flash: 250 will be 6 IMPs back - tightening the match significantly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South find out, that this lead is a singleton?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: without def help, that is|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N were sure both on same page, would probably follow through with 4C. but wants as little confusion as possible hence 4D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: @S9 is discouraging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead may make N work|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu: nice start for decl|pg||
nt|hlortz: still looks like -800 though|pg||
nt|tez: 1 way ticket for 800:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is smart enough to know that N would not X with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with the 2 @S bid, the long clubs should be with S |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think N could have tried 5C over 4H, but he weas undoubtedly afraid S might think all this was cuebidding for hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S bid 4 @H because he thought that was perhaps where they were suppose to play |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 7 rounds of bidding & 7 kilos of sweat later, a push|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: and they arent helping so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and so declarer. but what about defence?|pg||
nt|peachy: but not for 3C|pg||
nt|po-s: true - but declarer is supposed to bid 1NT normally with the balanced hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|xenya: EW seem to bid every game in sight -- and a little bit more|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|flash: i've had a question about the 'free bid' issue|pg||
nt|po-s: but there defenders began with a club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy -1 after  a @s ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S!!!|pg||
nt|xenya: vital, yes, but can wait|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Put @D 3-1 and this would cost|pg||
nt|sybarra: think that bidding might be discussed later?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (I do) |pg||
nt|po-s: not for that long|pg||
nt|larrymori: Bach rescued his side by bidding 3@d|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: brb get coffee|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N was probably always doomed to succeed, but trump lead makes him sweat more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if nobody has mentioned  halftime scores now posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even after this start, N has a lot of work|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: why not q of @H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade lead from getgo needed to hold it to 4|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|tez: @h again pls|pg||
nt|flash: there was a marvelous historical (not hysterical) explanation of the roots of this concept in a recent Bridge World|pg||
nt|flash: my roth-stone training suggests that is you aren't forced to make a call, any call you choose to make is for a reason|pg||
nt|flash: usually values, although extra shape might compensate|pg||
nt|flash: the 'modern' game is, of course, on a totally different tack|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza on the board with an overtrick IMP in 3NT on 21.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also a logical lead since E has clubs, W surely has Ds, and hearts dont rate to be a major source of tricks for NS|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|d3|nt|dburn: that would have been trickier - not sure why South did not see it through by bidding 3@d to show both red suits|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: well, not to crash your party, but I think the latter applied here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|po-s: was this the best?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|tez: trying only 800|pg||
nt|flash: in any case, the pause b4 passing protected South's position in the post mortem...   well, i thought about bidding more...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: doesn´t matter - or your old "sproll" |pg||
nt|po-s: and to clarify - No it wasn´t|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: three NS pairs in a part-score!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now comes a push|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if W returns @s|pg||
nt|peachy: w has to return a trump, otherwise making, and surely will|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good move from E - to take @s king and return @c offering losing choice to declarer|pg||
nt|flash: South looks for the Undo button|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close match|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: in the auction, South limited his hand by 2S instead of bidding a more ambiguous (as to strength and shape) 2C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: spec points out my silly error, easy enough on trump lead as club goes on heart even if finesse loses|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|hlortz: 3n @@ 2nd turn not a delicate bid, i prefer 3@C sort of 3rd suit forcing|pg||

nt|peachy: hah, you belong to the school of "Always bid to win the post mortem" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- who thought that hand would NEVER end|pg||
nt|peachy: Lavazza not used to scores like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  West is lucky here - a Multi would nok be a success|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - South opening|pg||
nt|tez: other room 4@s doubled..specs said:)|pg||
nt|flash: specs now up to 387 and still very little harassment...   i mean few comments   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the unlikely event that i passed originally as E, i doubt i could bring myself to pass 4S when pd bids it facing a passed hand at unfavorable vul with an unlinmited hand behind ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him. if i did summon such conservatism, and then watched 4S go down, i'd head for the bar|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not used to countries that drink tea instead of coffee either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that confirms it -- definitely NOT Precision|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Italy keeps on trying 3 NT with 24 balanced HCP|pg||
nt|xenya: well it seems there were for the defence that might have let it through and declarer was never more than 1 down|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peachy: not much of fit anywhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And in 3 NT, you must hunt the 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yeah - @H not 3-3|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  May be doubled|pg||
nt|po-s: Sara needs to take 10 more victory points han SouthSweden|pg||
nt|shevek: 1NT, any idea?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can all get whatever we are imbibing in here,  this is mundane |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5D a good save. 4S cold single dummy on elimination thanks to 9 of hearts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: S passes another opening bid by many standards|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, if the suits were majors I'd open.|pg||
nt|loganrun: Forcing|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmm|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1NT forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I'd open S at any vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be better to have the minors reversed, but you cant have everything all the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an interesting problem over 1H. i dont think 2H gets the job done. prefer 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: splinter would be my choice|pg||
nt|xenya: or cruel rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: does making only 4 seem 1 too few?|pg||
nt|loganrun: this part score may well be doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will N pass or D?|pg||
nt|xenya: *were options |pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: Maybe someone in the audience can tell us what 2@D is|pg||
nt|peachy: club position fortunate|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts never break friendly in Japan|pg||
nt|peachy: aonly a few ricks for declarer here, we'll see how few|pg||
nt|peachy: tricks*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This time - in 3 NT - the @D-suit must be handled well|pg||
nt|po-s: now 2S|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might even keep West out  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Brave man, East|pg||
nt|shevek: what was wrong with pass?|pg||
nt|po-s: I think they play 14-16 NT so the 10point responder always assumes 16|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|flash: on this day in history, a modern, aggressive player passed a rotten 11-count in 2nd chair...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will this break the streak of all hands declared by either North or West?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: which would in your book be weaker, Pass or 4D by N over 3H?|pg||
nt|tez: makeable 7@h..i belive they will stop 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam in board 5 was missed in OR (4@S + 3)|pg||
nt|tez: they are not playing with open cards:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting the OR is connected to us  but we are not reconnected to them |pg||
nt|sybarra: or should I say they were|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  temptation  to compete on 5th level?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for a double of 4@H at MP?|pg||
nt|jtr: Might be necessary|pg||
nt|jtr: If we make 3@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but not that UNfriendly, surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 10-13, 2NT asking - 3@C = minimum, 3@D asking for singleton, 3Nt = singleton @S|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c pls|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X making, so 5@CX only cost 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At this level no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: (not being picky sorry)|pg||
nt|hlortz: that IMP on 21 is suspect even it looked like 660 to me tho maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 2@C may be  18-19 bal   [same as EW 2@D opener]|pg||
nt|po-s: is double penalty?|pg||
nt|loganrun: weak raise in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You'll get 200 here, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
nt|po-s: is this a hand that wants ruffs or to tap declarer?|pg||
nt|po-s: tap apparently|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South does his best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a lot of losers....maybe better to pass if you like your offensive chances, inviting pd to bid 5S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, at least 11 spades and not much defense. when in doubt bid one more|pg||
mb|3D|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he would be happy with four - that would mean his opponents could make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they can - may have stolen the pot here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  looks like 300|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - behind the suit|pg||
nt|loganrun: after partner doubled for takeout - sure|pg||
nt|po-s: not on this particular one...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be beaten |pg||
nt|xenya: with careful defence|pg||
nt|peachy: three unescapable losers, will be a ppush|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so easy to defend - @D-ruffs etc.|pg||
nt|po-s: but West will overruff hearts or clubs very soon|pg||
nt|loganrun: and south has trouble getting back to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway, this gave noting away, the @H-finesse South can handle himself|pg||
nt|po-s: he will probably try the CQ which holds, then what?|pg||
nt|po-s: all this one needs is two finesses|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||
nt|tez: wrang i m here ..trust me pls:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 11 tricks to me too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6 trumps, 2 ruffs, 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the hand, N will tell S he should have had the 7 of clubs in place of the 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: and, lo and behold, the auction proceeded smoothly (in both rooms)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another NT-bid without a sure stopper...|pg||
nt|po-s: good sacrifice against 120|pg||
mb|3N|nt|shevek: play a @d maybe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: almost same auction other room,  but instead of 2 nt, E bid 2 sp |pg||
nt|loganrun: Jack of diamonds works best|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe a diamond directly, but sometimes West has the CA|pg||
nt|loganrun: great card|pg||
nt|shevek: for different reasons neither west nor east can play trumps :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has by far the best reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @d break will be big disaster for declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: apprximately 2 down?|pg||
nt|xenya: well W dropped a trick when he failed to put up the Q, but that was far from obvious?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes you told him 7@H he could have just bid 6 LOL|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now no @D-finesse|pg||
nt|flash: low @S a bit surprising?   North would like the 9 to lead the Q, but...|pg||
nt|flash: ah - there was a 1@S call...|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  Any lead 660|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA, 3 clubs and 2 diamonds, including a ruff |pg||
nt|po-s: So East wins and plays a heart, D ruff, Club to ace? and a heart?|pg||
nt|shevek: ouch|pg||
nt|po-s: since undoubled|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mistiming let's @HT score?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The non-competitive auctions continue.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
nt|xenya: S was naturally hoping for a club honour when he bid 3N -- that was not to be|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|hawe45:  670 os their way|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||
nt|po-s: and in the other room West bid 1H making one finesse ok|pg||
nt|xenya: could be same 2 off on this lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10 instead of @c9....|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: one spade and two clubs would be different|pg||
nt|hlortz: /relate/|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nie had conquered the world of  "Go" some 20 years ago and turned his interest to bridge in recent years.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, u r right, four|pg||
nt|shevek: why so keen? to play @h?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For no reason|pg||
nt|po-s: aces should mostly be ducked - a lesson which has not yet reached my country|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  But here only 600|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cancel, too early here|pg||
nt|peachy: he can still take 9|pg||
nt|peachy: or more if def allows :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So in fact it was a good lead, leading the @S King, and West takes 11 tricks - here only 9|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead in OR, that ALONE tells me it was a good lead, plus, I would have led Q or 10 = further evidence...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N plays a third spoade and throws a D, so can W, and E plays a fourth spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not 100% inescapable. but the defense is easy enough|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  next door 4@s made when defence offered @c trick to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that South, who had a maximum for his initial pass, did not take some action when a weak no trump came back|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain by noticing that the players at this level aren't afraid to pause and consider their play(s)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: or that in Strong Club context, he didnt open|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain even more by noticing when they pause|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so you will be in Reno next month?|pg||
nt|xenya: a club honour in the N hand that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or K & Q to fall singleton |pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: probably private, too :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: well, justice served, in a sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry provate|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps an endplay in diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does @CK transfer threat for a squeeze?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems to me that either way W gets an overruff. maybe i am missing something|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, not much chance to catch up if the cards dont cooperate by giving some options|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: Thanks for the trainingin "Go", he is a very good card plaer in bridge, but his biddng is a bit old fashioned.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|flash: @C2 is UDA - encouraging|pg||
nt|peachy: where could he get rid of them?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen some New Zealand and Australian pairs using this 2@C opener -- but don't recall ever seeing it from an ACBL representative|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tez: no|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  End-plys possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  play|pg||
nt|peachy: The open room had some conn probs in earlier matches|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H Ace, @C KIng, @H back and the @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South knowa WeatÂ´s distribution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And doesÂ´nt matter, whether West has single og double @H from the beginning|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But badly enough, the @C Jack comes down, which means 10 tricks without this endplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: so he overkilled |pg||
nt|tez: no=undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Total Trick fans -- this hand is off by 2!  [22 trump but each side can only make 10 tricks]|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: note that NS are lucky in that S has the @S8|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange @H-shift anyway|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcwla: Lavazza has now bid to slam on 22 -- off two top tricks -- so the rout continues.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: i dont understand this|pg||
nt|peachy: it may be a failing on my part!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, East didÂ´nt tahe the @C Ace, sleeping !!!|pg||
nt|peachy: the pause here probably is some external prob, surely declarer is not thinking like this'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now safe to play last trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing hearts|pg||
nt|hlortz: surely only 620//|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you giving too little credit to EW then :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: 200 - 10/58 for NS|pg||
nt|po-s: I don´t think I would have covered the club|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  They insist on giving gifts in the @S--suit|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly mattered at that point|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Good card-reading!|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is just a claim |pg||
pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Right pe-s - West could have the bare Ace...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  - and good defence by East|pg||

nt|loganrun: Jack of diamonds was a great card but not as good as what happened|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe it was an element of surprise for west |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West was too fast, East could hardly have a double with only small @D|pg||
nt|loganrun: for surprise - he took awhile to play the ace|pg||
nt|po-s: kids is nice - Johan just turned 50|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suppose W wins lead in hand and leads club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Netherlands will double their lead, rare against this team|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Move to board 9 - this one looks flat|pg||
nt|xenya: i suggest we watch it -- just in case|pg||
nt|po-s: Right Hans, Lavazza only lost two matches of the qualifying 12|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK ready for board 8 then|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  lot of spades by NS, but 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this a funky multi?  |pg||

mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: This could be trouble for N-S|pg||
nt|peachy: a lucky 12 tricks here, but we'll see|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - 1NT was 14-16, which explains why it bought the hand on the previous deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you know the players in OR P-O?|pg||
nt|po-s: Pass???|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: hi Bart|pg||
nt|tez: hi Bart:)|pg||

nt|bbramley: can zmud bid 1NT here to show 4@S and minor?|pg||
nt|flash: halfway through the match - close and entertaining|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 4+  unless exactly 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass over 1 @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not find on cc |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sounds like a dance shirley|pg||
nt|xenya: or 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: negative free bid working here|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the end of day 2  Lavazza was in the lead of the 12-round swiss qualifying|pg||
nt|hawe45:  undo|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: this 4S is too strong for my standards, cannot have two side suits controlled|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing 1nt=long minor and major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i already said the defense was easy. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know what they did in match 9|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: is that raptor? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is there a name for it|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 31-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final|pg||
nt|peachy: seems the organizers dont post match results until the following match is completed, been that way so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh   |pg||
nt|peachy: oh well, guess it works to mix it up...!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S took a line of play that could never succeed there|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm rooting for the Netherlands to get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't know the name, i just know how they play|pg||

nt|xenya: 2@D? -- major + minor?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been Double Negative|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Saved |pg||
nt|peachy: I guess they will get to this slam now, E showing shape I assume|pg||
nt|flash: how light does one open in 3rd chair?   the more lead-directional the call, the lighter it might be???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=one-round force|pg||
nt|chick: a clear violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone else prefer to pass 1@S?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S absolutely needed trumps 22 because one club had to be ruffed to set up the suit, and later a spade had to be ruffed. if Ds are 3-1 the hand cant make|pg||
nt|peachy: but don't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass would be eminently sensible|pg||
nt|chick: no, but I prefer to bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would prefer 1N if semi-force or non-force|pg||
nt|jcwla: E did not switch to @S when in with @HA -- all went bye bye on the @D's -- 11 to Lavazza on 22|pg||
nt|hlortz: odd looking to me west dbls stiff in unbid suit  east with k 5th doesnt bid them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe it shows a near-opening in one major|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8:  N  3NT-1 in the OR|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, Roland said earlier was made with +1 bd7|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard bids 2 @D,  if not I will |pg||
nt|sybarra: (over 2 @C)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- you just don't know what hand partner holds for 2@C when 1N is absolute force|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, should have been -300 -- unless W didn't play 2 rounds of hearts at the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans -- is your plan to PASS reopening DBL?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No the 1 NT, which should mean, that I was too week for 1 NT directly |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@H is an option|pg||
nt|chick: yes, raija, and it kept them out of a very good (but unfortunately unmakeable) slam|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22, EW in the OR did bid and make 3N on basically the same defence: @H lead ducked by N|pg||
nt|po-s: how about "Polish"?|pg||
nt|bbramley: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E apparently assumed N had announced 4 spades so the double would be more for clubs and hearts. not condoning that line of thought just attempting to explain|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless 2@H was xfer to @S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: no chance, without def erring|pg||
nt|tez: i m chicken..i have no idea for convention names|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello po, you are always welcome :)|pg||
nt|tez: hi PO|pg||
nt|othered1: which brings us back to playing the other 6+card fit a level lower :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would make it hard to play 2H, the single most likely correct contract when W doubles|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  any reason for West to bid immediately?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared a pass by North who could well have had a heart fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 2M being the bad weak 2|pg||
nt|larrymori: maybe more like 10(good 9) to 13|pg||
nt|po-s: so the actually play Ekeblad|pg||
nt|larrymori: seems logical|pg||
nt|marlowepi: more like Inkblot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you see what you want to see:)|pg||
nt|larrymori: 5M and 4+ m|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a "reverse" muiderberg|pg||
nt|po-s: some of us might even jump to game with East hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: bidding the minor |pg||
nt|larrymori: except he had @ss so he probably went low|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very soft shape for a game bid. since you have already started with a preempt & gotten by N, you can make the accurate valuation bid of 3H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: still - with no club fit..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait - errare humanum est|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  tourney site |pg||
nt|flash: still a long way to go for N-S to reach game after this start?   (the balancing X certainly helped)|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead here|pg||
nt|loganrun: This has no chance even on a non club lead as long as West is still not thinking about the last hand|pg||
nt|po-s: if a spade, three rounds of diamonds, ruffed overruffed, and a heart|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hlortz: this will make with a good view in @H suit i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks - it is bedtime but I must see my expartner overbid - alittle|pg||
nt|peachy: i am betting on diam lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the Italian pairs often use DBL in mid auction to just say  extra points|pg||
nt|loganrun: the 6 and 7 of hearts come into play|pg||
nt|shevek: ok kids, against suit contracts we lead shortage |pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: holding four bad hearts i would incline to pass. game is unlikely and i have some defense. if pd bids after i pass, i will be very well placed to act, but if i bid 1N, i will have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to stop bidding before i have much usefuyl info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for Klinger if Apteker does Pass 1@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all that from a guy who has to blow the dust off the green card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA then ruffing finesse might hold this to down 1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: and which one is ex?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (sorry I do not know) |pg||
nt|hlortz: needs a deep finesse here :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't think he can make it even with a perfect guess - more clubs will sink it|pg||
nt|tez: many thanks all..here 4.09 am..bye all..see you..enjoyed|pg||
nt|hlortz: really?n follow to 3 @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Tez @H  pleasant dreams |pg||
nt|bbramley: i see, henry, so he'll threaten to dump both spades - yes, that would be PERFECT guessing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  we have comfortable sitting at home, with coffee and double-dummy deals, not so they|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, pressure of a big event|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must be declarer at this board, we might see an NL-score  now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol yes the deep 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 4@H in OR - but here the lead: a small @S from S?????????????????|pg||
nt|hlortz: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: N did well to show his max, assumedly Dbl meant it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't quote me on that|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 imps|pg||
nt|pelu: to K|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said "ugh"  and would you believe there is spec with that bbo name? |pg||
nt|flash: if South, holding KJx, wouldn't bid NT, that was no longer a possible/plausible strain|pg||
nt|peachy: OR overcalled 1NT with S hand, no wonder they got to game|pg||
nt|hlortz: well unless 2@D xfer not making the case for it im just confused :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wel sure, but the question is why E ddnt bid spades. of course it shows extras|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West surely counted on a @C-.suit in East|pg||
nt|po-s: If you guys don´t stop I´ll leave and go back to bed - but I guess that would please yoy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 2 told me something|pg||
nt|larrymori: without them got to jack it up but might get the transfer 4@s bid|pg||
nt|po-s: moment of truth|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You canÂ´nt go wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: how about 3N EW (suggested by a spectator)?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  and world-wide watching |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now lead any minor for down 2  -- even @DJ works -- ruff, @HA  @D ruff @C uppercut to re-establish @C10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they bid 2D a;ready|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet 3 @H was pass or correct|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: so it could be a dblwhammy for them, dbld game and a plus unmaking slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah -- yes i can live with that tactic|pg||
nt|larrymori: i will bet lol|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: oops my bad lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a cnfusing auction:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: see i *said* i was confused.. meanwhile 3@C not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Raija predicted 23 a push so 35-12 at the halfway mark.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but he has an awfully good hand and i dont see a better call for him if he is going to bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it helps to know that both of the round kings are offside :)|pg||
nt|xenya: this inelegant contract might make...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even on a @D-lead from East, you should have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|po-s: must be a commentator|pg||
nt|peachy: lost that one|pg||
nt|shevek: he was thinking abt @ds chris :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: i guess that works too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The @h shift is rather clear|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Won @DK at trick 2, advanced @CQ and got clubs wrong later, playing for the double finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: Merijn home here, fortuitous rightsiding|pg||
nt|po-s: hmm, overruff and a heart would make it more difficult for West|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: in a dition to different club play then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|bbramley: that will simplify the defense - if he hadn't cashed @SA it gets complicated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 4-4 in majors on S odds are good for a @d Hx on S|pg||
nt|hlortz: lavazza lucky on bd 22 or it would be lots to not much|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Not sure how much -150 is worth|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: about 5/58 at the moment|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: But looking at past hands in this match, I dont expect them to be in slam other room, no matter how biddable|pg||
nt|peachy: I am glad that the big name teams are not yet on vugraph, giving others the chance to experience that thrill as players|pg||
nt|flash: of course, Mandala, youngster that he (still) is, decided that the South hand was a 1NT overcall   :)|pg||
nt|shevek: fair enough, south knows the opening lead lesson , he thought west was short!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting possibility for end-playing W for @c lead|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or East thought 2N was different from what West thought|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C-lead would have been better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just small club toward Jack|pg||
nt|po-s: if they play 3NT I lead club from North|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  easy to see from my comfortable home seat|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  definitely agree|pg||
nt|peachy: while for the "names" it is bread'nbutter|pg||
nt|xenya: no, likely down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East is declarer...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but on E?|pg||
nt|po-s: I understand - but believe that it won´t be allowed over 4H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Make that 180|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  or so, yes. more practically|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: it was a clear misdefense by E in the other room. he simply did not analyze the hand. |pg||
pc|dT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|xenya: but i can't wait to see the result from the other room on 23|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but much less sexy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|po-s: probably the same|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|chick: the other table seems to be having a bit of connection trouble|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Give up|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: bah needed ot be small sp|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1 off|pg||
nt|po-s: still down|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: i think Giorgio Duboin was the  1 ranked player in the world for many years -- with a recent overtake by frequent teammate Fulvio Fantoni|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin gonna make this well done,,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double squeeze time?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must be a strong field|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It ain't bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct declarer technique on Boards 1, 4, and 7 in this room would have the MY team up by about 30 instead of struggling|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also here a couple of IMPÂ´s for Italy - just taking their tricks|pg||
nt|flash: seems unlikely that Lavazza will lose IMPs on this one?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam! |pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 3NT in the OR on a @C lead from N.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Winning contracts are few this morning / evening|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: another good slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ken Rae is from the Shetlands|pg||
nt|peachy: a likely 3NT here now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East has a difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think that did NOT make overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  cashing @SJ means can't play any other squeeze|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: that could very well be a Strong Two |pg||

nt|peachy: 11-18 5+ H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D 4+ [unless 4=4=3=2]|pg||
nt|xenya: not unexpectedly, 6 was a push -- 4@SX down 1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @D - can they bid it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i will bet on 3N by E:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt want to anyway since the minor cards are marked in the W hand already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5-11 HCP  5/6@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the bidding in OR will be copied here?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: Nunes still in the box after @SK|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like he was down 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A silent 4 @H - coffe-board|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: even a spade lead does not defeat 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9:  S  4@SX-3  500 to EW|pg||
nt|peachy: partscore deal here, most likely|pg||
nt|po-s: you´re such a blood thirsty person|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is a scope for variations|pg||
nt|po-s: overruff in diamonds and a heart would have made I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes quessing the @H-positionm |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: chance for North-South to retaliate by reaching a lucky slam of their own - 6@c and 6NT both make if played by North (who has bid clubs)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After 2 @D -- West will have some work to get to 6 in a black suit |pg||
nt|peachy: they better play well, it is not easy to take 9 there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making if they bid it, i mean, not them getting there|pg||
nt|po-s: no they opened a canape 1S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! failed directly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  Normally E/W would make 620 in 4 @H, but here...|pg||
nt|xenya: not normally, PO, no|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S = what guys?  1 nt|pg||
nt|bgn: no thanks, not today. Just watching NEC :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do EW play 2/1 GF even in comp? or neg free bids?|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl not my choice..|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@c some countertakeout|pg||
nt|shevek: obviously west is thinking|pg||
nt|po-s: 15 pretty poor points - 2H is enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S was one-round force, but wow -- that's quite a 3@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: crucial moment, go or not to go|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm betting no|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: time for Blackwood |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 NT on the N hand is excellent|pg||
nt|peachy: even if one does raise on three sometimes, doing so with S hand would be sick|pg||
nt|peachy: 2c is 10+,  GF if fit and then 2+ cl|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 4 @H you get 12 tricks - in 6 6 @H only 10|pg||
nt|flash: these stopperless NT calls are frightening!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i dont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defeating this 4 @H will bring NL in front|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think the real score is 10-17|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of science in action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 controls I am told|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When 2 @D is majors, I would lead @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No success this time though|pg||
nt|po-s: Was South really contemplating anything but Pass or  was Sylvan really thinking?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You  are welcome - in 3 @S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Geoff Breskal won the Gold Cup many years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: many many years ago|pg||
nt|hlortz: indelicate but effective|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David Edwin in the audience remembers when|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this event is well-known for collecting "names" in Yokohama, the organizers do their best to attract "stars" giving national players fine possibility to compete  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no good lead for South|pg||
nt|peachy: Have to stay away from spade lead to have any chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best he could do|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - 6@c, as a spectator points out, will not make if East leads her diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 3S is fine. you have an AK and you are nonvul. most of the time S has 6 spades. even if 5 no great harm shd come to you|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best spot:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: a case for cashing the ace - not done|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way, and 2@D looks like an artif GF, or maybe this range balanced|pg||
nt|po-s: perfect bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: jxx didnt feel like stopper|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: this is more a lucky one than the 6NT was, there he only needed spade finess|pg||
nt|gracelin: I was in Yokohama for the NEC cup last year.  This Latin team did very well but they are missing Diego this time.|pg||
nt|dburn: all academic - they aren't going to bid a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3 Ds need heart shift|pg||
nt|peachy: this at least one down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South could double for the lead|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess was the screen |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately our operators do not speak English, so I can't explain how to reconnect after a crash|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is a bilingual specctator to help Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's all in our manual, but that's also in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: they soudn't.  This is amuch worse slam than last board which only needs a finesse.|pg||
nt|peachy: is Diego B in another team or not there this year?|pg||
nt|po-s: and isn´t|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope! |pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: this might be tricky both for declarer and  defenders|pg||
nt|po-s: that HQ is a good card, otherwise declarer might have  difficulties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This one should depend om finding the @S Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we think 2 @D= 18+ |pg||
nt|pelu: they play tranfer-ans on 1@C - so 1@S sh be a normal 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm little conservative with 25 hcp total|pg||
nt|hlortz: but i guess they are high enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a danger that S will take a phantom though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best spot for N/S then|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: tk he is not cming thisyear.|pg||
nt|flash: semi-sensible lead for a push...|pg||
nt|shevek: the operator has to wait for both bids|pg||
nt|shevek: keyboards can be quite noisy :)|pg||
nt|po-s: stiff king might have been though|pg||
pc|h9|nt|loganrun: 2H seems straightforward but 4H has some obstacles in the play|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H is just begging for EW to bid the vul game and make it by finessing partner for H queen which they would not otherwise do|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was thinking of sac in those colors?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not every lead kills this 4 @H - but IÂ´m sure, the @C Ace did|pg||
nt|peachy: seems this is now going set, straining my eyes for way to make, but no|pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto is a great player but not the miracleman|pg||
nt|bbramley: plenty high - even with a moderately friendly lie i don't think he'll make it|pg||
nt|pelu: in 4@H Nunes played @H to 8 and A in trick 2!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it wasn't easy i guess |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: not sure when   late 70's    early 80's I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative shift that turns out to be good|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it was safe|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe two if def really alert|pg||
nt|larrymori: east had to bid 3nt to give a chance|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  East might think, that South is in position to get a @C-ruff - not North. He must play @H Ace and another @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- this could have been dead minimum 2@H  [5+@H, 10+ HCP]|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi David|pg||
nt|flash: i'm getting some coaching in the 'modern' game - distribution first; stoppers later...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, minimum, but not dead minimum. the suit is good, and there is a residual fit for E, and the hand has 2 aces|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW probably have H stop in practice if W is dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A @D is OK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: still could be achieved i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i would expect Honor doubleton or better for 3@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: with 3 1/2 defensive tricks??|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have been with E playing, |pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Stay with us, you are on soon anyway|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6N+1 52/58|pg||
nt|gracelin: Seems EW use a similar scheme like CAPP against opponent strong club opening.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The stopperless NT is called practical bidding. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but giving up over 2@C is a mystery -- that appears to be the winning approach|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one pair made 7N by South|pg||
nt|ady: bet possible for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1977 it was. Thanks to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13 tricks, I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps S has a count now -- from the bidding and N's discards, so he may well return a @D -- no...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is best now? @c, trumph or @d against the triple void?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D would have been best - but very soon we shall see declarer check, if @S are 3-3|pg||
nt|po-s: he knows partner has five spades and from his discards nothing in hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: but no denying their in great spot|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|flash: something about old dogs and new water dishes...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually @SK is still interesting -- would Klinger duck to preserve entry to dummy?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: might as well have used the HK, what else to do with it?|pg||
nt|peachy: toss it under the ace?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will do next time|pg||
nt|pelu: but still down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: but it could be our hand and it might be strategically crucial to let him now over 3H that this is an above-average dummy for spades as weak D openers go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be possible to use double by the weak 2 bidder for a hand like this, so that 3S can show better spades and/or a somewhat higher offense-to-defense ratio|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Apteker will get this right -- 3@H bid needs shortness somewhere because of limited HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: realistically it is not likely that N willl want to use double of 3H for penalty purposes after opening a weak 2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why a club shift? and if that is what E asked for, why did he?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think my copy of CC says 1st discard is upside-down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart would seem marked from both sides of table|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: i agree, with everyone bidding so much W is likely to be short in spades|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: after all if he were short elsewhere he might have led that suit at trick 3|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bbramley: i like his line of play: he needed 1 of 2 club finesses through south, plus the spade finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: really? spade to king?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From the bidding East has been warned|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- also likely 4 hearts, so E has a singleton club|pg||
nt|xenya: and has nothing to pitch|pg||
nt|po-s: he could try a club from dummy in case opps don´t notice he is in his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S will discard @cJ on next @h|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  I bet - that is a push :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if wins @SA gets extra @S trick, but cannot establish @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too much drama -- after small @D I thought he'd already made up his mind :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: EW make some diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, I think E should have tried for game by bidding 2NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: something seems to have happened to the website - board scores disconnected|pg||

nt|peachy: Here is today's bulletin, editors Barry Rigal and Rich Colker -  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec2010_data/bulletins/blt1.pdf|pg||
nt|peachy: identical auction so far as in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this DBL gets more votes :)     |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very likely that 3N makes but 4H does not (or that both do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure notes talk about Matt's DBL - but i won't be able to find it in time :(|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: X by E should show extras, convertible vcalyues|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This slam is better |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Klinger would duck the @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H-P-3@S???|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I dunno about that, E had only one club stopper|pg||
nt|bbramley: polish club, usually a weak nt, but sometimes...  18+ HCP|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton kings here one on one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: with his rabbi,  N  or S can make game in either red suit |pg||
nt|peachy: nice safe contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  could be too high (if NS find @h ruff) |pg||
nt|kakasi: Iy[ [ÌûÖBBO©çÌ¨mç¹Å·G@@]Tª êÎAêxEBhEðÂ¶ÄAà¤êxJ«A»ÌÌ¿âÉYESÆ¦Ä­¾³¢ÆÌ±ÆÅ·B|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  possible. this system is popular in Bulgaria |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: nice fillers and suit in dummy|pg||
nt|flash: only 21 HCP - and the opps are bidding...   |pg||
nt|peachy: but not any more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For a 21Â´er, North has a weak hand|pg||
nt|flash: now, i have a preference...   5-card suits are shown?  4-card suits aren't???|pg||
nt|peachy: not when the opp bid it?|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I misunderstood|pg||
nt|flash: now you're teasing?   3@C puts things up a level, but we're not escaping this any more cheaply??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will South rebid 3@S over 3@C or ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S helps with shape, but without an honor  yuk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4D autosplinter (if ti is)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will show his shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 4@D is minorwood  [RKCB in @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - the key is that south needs to hear about @H filler to really get excited|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could save a trick by playing another @H, pitching another club -- not clear why he changed the plan|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Oh, that 5-level again|pg||
nt|pelu: coprrection : Nunes maded 41Hs - correction by operator (misclicks)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep thought if he played @H to the 7 he'd make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will e/w get in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec points out 4 @S makes |pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@D=artif weak, 1@H=nat but could still be a weak nt (F1?), 2@D nat NF|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@S makes, lose 1 of each|pg||
nt|sybarra: no doesnt make,  think it loses a trick in each suit,,  |pg||
nt|flash: might North have called 2@H over 1@S, instead of Xing again?   (thnx, Deb)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When I was young(er), this pass was for playing 2 @D RD|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm having a conversation with two specs, forgive my inattention please|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise they can make bluff-RD|pg||
nt|flash: only 2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I agree...!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks, kakasi explaining what to do for the operator in Japanese|pg||
nt|kakasi: I[v[ÌÊð\¦·é½ßÅ·B|pg||
nt|hlortz: now 4@H from n?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems unlikely that spades will play better than clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, I would, but I am not them :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||
nt|peachy: 9 count and support|pg||
nt|po-s: will East be satisfied with 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: 4C|pg||
nt|sybarra: right bart, I shouid double check  what spec say :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki finally reveals his true nature|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hate to splinter with singleton Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: or 6? no..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C looks fine|pg||
nt|po-s: he won´t get much cooperation I think - well maybe 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easte must have been very close to a D|pg||
nt|flash: certainly i expected partner to make this call - if i didn't bid 3@C earlier, i pass and try not to look too ready for the axe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hard bid to explain is not Matt's double but rather 5H|pg||
nt|chick: wonder why he ran from 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bingo!|pg||
nt|peachy: now P|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont hold up your bingo card yet, they have not IDed a spade control yet|pg||
nt|xenya: i never do|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, after the lead and the favorable DA position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker may have given the show away with his DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be tickled pink to play 5DX after W volunteered the suit over my X|pg||
nt|chick: but he can't let it go undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course -- failure to hear a 4@D call probably means some @S values -- but who knows|pg||
nt|loganrun: This is your coffee board Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable source says they were playing Precision yesterday -- so probably today too :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  decent logic!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have CC for their teammates who usually play Precision, but decided NOT to do that this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: except that the 4H call doesnt make much sense if EW are playing Precision|pg||
nt|po-s: for me this sequence shows extras|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would be happy to pass 1 NT as Northe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree PO, but is @cQ extra?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hlortz: defense wants to make sure declarer has an entry for the @D finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: a little relief here for Zimmermann, match is not yet out of hand by any means|pg||
nt|flash: a sexy 3 IMPs?|pg||
nt|othered1: can anyone translate this auction?|pg||
nt|po-s: the drawback being that we might miss a 44fit in spades (since I would support to 2H directly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he uses it toplay trumps...|pg||
nt|po-s: then a small which is wrong if KJ bare|pg||
nt|peachy: dia shift there could have held but partner's suit is normal |pg||
nt|peachy: I think 4H was an offer to play, |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Duboin's silence against 1@S-2@S has paid off with 6 more on 25 as Bulgaria's E/W got to 2NT/W-2.  Lavazza to within 11.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this is why 3@S probably wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: yes Marshall - just a bit trickier|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont show this auction to your novices class:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bidding 2N does not rule out getting to 3H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @S D is "only" 1400, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan Martel says they were hyperaggressive yesterday too|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: 4H|pg||
nt|xenya: no matter what W does now, declarer will only lose 2 more trumps |pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i like 4D better than 3S--the slam interest is underscored, as opposed to 3S|pg||
nt|sybarra: where are we going? |pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: 4S was not a strong effort, i think, N should put S in the picture with some sort of fit-showing club bid|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes then 4@H clearly control bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 4D-4H, now S can bid 4N=  "i am still interested, but i dont have a spade control"|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, I dont think 4H was control, he has to show it at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: but again, I dont have their notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and another keypoint for partnerships   would 3@C-4@C be forcing?  [key is to be on same page]|pg||
nt|po-s: where is Barry? a lot of relays|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true p-o, thought needed about timing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is lurking in the wings|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: she can pitch a @H forcexample|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's 5 more imps for NANIWADA|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets see,  auction in normal life ...we can figure out..landing in same spot  with 3 or 4 bids?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but pass after 1nt is rather close when S has something i @c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hlortz: 200 52/58 so far|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: it was a 16IMP swing on the 6@D fiasco|pg||
nt|po-s: trump ace I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: even then he has an re-entry on @H10 - to take the @D-finess :(|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, OR stayd in partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: a ping-pong match|pg||
nt|jcwla: Already 10 coming to Bulgaria, slam would have been an extra 5.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: this could be tricky?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club was best chance|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bbramley: keeping control against spade tap|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - one more cup|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: to specs: sorry rooms not connected,  we are trying our best to keep running score |pg||
nt|pelu: ny calculation are 42-6 for Zimmermann - but.......(:(:|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, scores are back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Healthy lead Sandqvist-McIntosh have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But much can still happen in an uneven field|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any views on 2@S there/|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, this event seems to revolve around how well you kill the less experienced pairs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon it's a bit quacky |pg||
nt|hlortz: i dislike the ambiguity of 2@S limit *or better*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Being in the right place at the right time|pg||
nt|jtr: That too|pg||
nt|chick: the other table bid 6@D but made it|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki will wonder why wrang didn't lead his (necessarily) singleton diamond - might drop it for that reason|pg||
pc|sA|nt|flash: i've had a suggestion that X of 2@H might not have been penalties...   the 'modern' game strikes again?  all Xs below 2NT are t/o???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: then it was lucky they DID bid it, the loss would have been significant|pg||
nt|hlortz: better a natural entry to dummy , it looks suspicious if you LET declarer get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: Al Holland in other room had same |pg||
pc|sT|nt|poohbear: arry who?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: why the SQ?|pg||
nt|flash: the Open Room auction certainly looks ripe for a penalty X|pg||
nt|flash: (move your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen to see the auction_|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hlortz: passing 4@C in OR was quite a position....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking over these boards, it must be acknowledged that there were a few interesting decisions to be made. but most of these IMPs have slithered one way or the other due to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: essentially unforced errors|pg||
pc|h4|nt|po-s: shouldn´t he have played another club to indicate he doesn´t know anything abt diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to agree|pg||
nt|po-s: it seems as if you really could squeeze everything out of East with relays you would bid 3NT|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|peachy: too bad about the error in decl play, pressure pressure of big event|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|bbramley: i say he drops it|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N kind of made that comeback for them|pg||
nt|sybarra: well true |pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 6 @H in the OR hee |pg||
nt|shevek: results before the last round: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 7 IMPs a board...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: heres a sexy little number|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh should I say W is and E is still thinking|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: why is that, Henry?|pg||
nt|peachy: S is strong enough to open naturally, with longest suit, follow up with diamonds twice|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, interesting. as for me, I hate hands like S's - points in short honours and main suit (@c) w/o controls |pg||
nt|peachy: hah, if gets a chance...|pg||
nt|flash: natural; limited|pg||
nt|flash: asking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 7H to get a trump lead:)|pg||
nt|shevek: at the end of the Swiss, ties will be broken by IMP quotient|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  E will give a hand|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: ew could scramble 8 tricks in s[ades|pg||
nt|peachy: ooh, and they are going for it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  UNDO|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: major suit cards placedbadly for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H??!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  time for W to show big fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open room have finished by now|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes if a world class defender puts u in dummy dont finesse...!|pg||
nt|flash: 6-card suit; no outside 4-card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi jeff and roland|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Jeff|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi Marshall|pg||
mb|d|nt|jtr: Great bid:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is N a chicken?|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, I would just bid 3D, 3S sounds too weak|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps 3S is their sys|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best game on EW 3nt on W|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is a near Yarborough -- the @D10 spoils the picture |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Art Garfunkel?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=5+@H & 5+@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think East and West have minimum, both oif them|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S - OUF|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester makes no other|pg||
nt|po-s: will East comply - Lebensohl probably|pg||
nt|fann4: And Sveta|pg||
nt|fann4: Very aggressive 2@D overcall here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has just had great success pushing EW around, and undoubtedly wants to go to the well again right away|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agressive and may mislead partner to 5@d sacrifice|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S is a good bid - for E/W, now East waill avoi the @D-lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=6-13 HCP, 4+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: to put necomers in the picture - SARA needs ten more vPs than SouthSweden to qualify|pg||
nt|shevek: in the KO phase, the team with the higher position from the Swiss gets a ½IMP carryover|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
mb|3S|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: they also play CAPP over 1NT opening, so 2D shows both maors.|pg||
nt|flash: practical call?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not Garfunkel   this GF gets more respect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=@D   go figure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has now bid only only the suit in which he has about 6% of his HCP :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and in the OR they are in 6 nt by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: with a sp lead |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the unbid portion of his hand his per capita HCP average is 2.5 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Klinger had option to bid 4@H to show solid/1-loser suit|pg||
nt|shevek: try to be impartial PO :) (commentator's ethics, etc...)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW cannot miss game now|pg||
nt|po-s: now game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I almost didnt belive that he took the @D-finess -|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, South has NO 3 @C-bid|pg||
nt|shevek: I didn't cheer when ish played in 7@h missing 1 ace (and made it)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: no double from South, slightly surprising|pg||
nt|jbgood: point taken|pg||
nt|po-s: doubledummy on a spade lead ducked and another spade...|pg||
nt|po-s: give up a club and a diamond, then throw South in at the end for a heart favor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to bid 3S here i think, and then W will bid 4D|pg||
nt|peachy: this game, if they stretch, could also make if def finds a wrong lead|pg||
nt|peachy: so match not over yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S is Puppet to 2N   making 3@C INV   [where immediate 3@C would be game force]|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another monster result for Bulgaria here.|pg||
nt|po-s: is 12 a max?|pg||
nt|fann4: There is not much to the play here, so worth having a look at the play of the @H suit on the previous hand.|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  Strange decision - West has the hand for bidding 4 @S|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose the operator will catch up with comparisons when has a chance|pg||
nt|kakasi: åÏÅµå¤©çAÌpÌ©çÅà¢¢Æv¢Ü·B|pg||
nt|peachy: unfortunately Nied did not understand that Lin was already bidding W hand|pg||
nt|po-s: shouldn´t be worse than a finesse|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hawe45:  Good lead|pg||
nt|shevek: that was the problem, the lead :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  OK - thatÂ´s better|pg||
nt|po-s: but he might simply go for hearts in a simpler fashin|pg||
nt|po-s: fashion|pg||
nt|po-s: DJ isn´t very good either, is it|pg||
nt|xenya: it is not|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@H looks down 1, -50 a good save vs. 3@D making 110 or 130|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E decided there was no way to show, so he i susing KC hoping to hide his hand as declarer:)|pg||
nt|po-s: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: EW are adopting the NS strategy of self-destruction :(|pg||
nt|peachy: bit score relief for Naniwada now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6 more imps for NANIWADA |pg||
nt|fann4: @HQ109 opposite A85432   what is the best play (in isolation) for 5 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: so, Lavazza team MUST stretch to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duboin has perfect picture to find 4@H jumpm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bocchi is the best at stretching:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  11 or 12 tricks = same result - 6 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he shows acceptance for hearts|pg||
nt|po-s: and decent diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: oh, thats why he is so tall?|pg||
nt|po-s: have I supported anyone? ANYONE?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South will easily make 7 tricks...|pg||
nt|xenya: and perhaps concern about clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|po-s: so it leaves a club or a heart|pg||
nt|xenya: complex hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 3 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s it - you sit up here in the cold North, trying to find out, how to bid 4 @S - and North just did it|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3-2 spades plus 3-3 hearts or QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there was a case for a low D lead after the NT bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: @H10    really??|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very bad lead this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure about result on 10, but before it was 22-17|pg||
nt|peachy: as well as her own|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds heavily in favor of W shortness being in Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 2 top hearts and Ds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Absolutely NOT, po!|pg||
nt|xenya: nice auction|pg||
nt|po-s: and that is not only by looking at his hand....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Now Herman just needs to find Forrester's entry to get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Keep looking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: little does he know it's in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he must have one after 3@H without A and Q, right?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North had no good lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: although he might suspect it |pg||
nt|po-s: this way is no good though|pg||
nt|sybarra: down 3!! |pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: maybe the @CA and another would have been better?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East just wanted to se the @H-signals from N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Unblock...|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps nothing is lost yet|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: this is a good example of aggressive bidding -- EW got just a bit too high, but that induced NS to go overboard too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i am tired -- was thinking West declaring @S  :(|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Voila they say in France|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a low club lead fro N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: responses to RKC are 1430 ONLY when trump=@H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|po-s: but now North can break communications should declarer duck the diamond|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: Bas really didn't want a ruff, I think he was trying for a lead not to give a trick or something|pg||

nt|peachy: what was that?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S could have discarded losing spade on heart Q|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt "we" want to pitch one spade?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, S got helful @c A lead |pg||
nt|gracelin: So Lin's balamce turned a plus score into a minus one.|pg||
nt|peachy: the match 9 scores are now up http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: chalk that up to the EW system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the wide range 2N put South under a lot of pressure|pg||
nt|po-s: nice  auction because the HK is onside|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: correct - he could have from the beginning though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Lavazza still leading??|pg||
nt|shevek: how's 6@d?|pg||
nt|po-s: how many VPs is 21 imps?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S plenty high already|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wrang sitting East gets full charge for 6N-1  [after partner asked key cards then bid 6@H - he pulled to 6N]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More coffee|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to find diamond slam after 1NT|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|peachy: "we" did...|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW will probably end up in 3NT here.|pg||
nt|peachy: No, Nie's jump did it, IMO.  |pg||
nt|xenya: another game missed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reverse black suits in W hand & very likely Ron would open at 4 level at these colors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S alerted because system on over DBL -- so MAX = 12 HCP|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, by 8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D best here i think|pg||
nt|loganrun: Not bad PO better played by South|pg||
nt|shevek: 23-26|pg||
nt|shevek: sry 20-10VPs|pg||
nt|po-s: the other table: Klinger opened the east hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|peachy: Open room was allowed to play in 4C, good for them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway the match seems to give a big score for the ladies|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think I know some folks who would open 4 @S on W hand|pg||
nt|flash: obviously, the defense has the first 4 tricks available here|pg||
nt|po-s: so EW had no problem finding 4S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lay-down slam even with ! 4-0|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|hawe45:  E/W 130 in OR is a good result for NL|pg||
nt|po-s: funny hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, Lin might double the weak NT opening with a stronger hand.|pg||
nt|flash: Multi - weak 2 in a major; 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Big result for Italy in OR|pg||
nt|flash: knowing quite well that a 2@S call won't be forthcoming|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a few good hands in a row for them|pg||
nt|xenya: potentially|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, you think that´s why he opened 1NT to make South declarer in diamonds (with a transfer bid)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s can make 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|peachy: right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for South Sweden - itÂ´s only 50 kilometers from here...|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: anybody see a result other than down 3?|pg||
nt|chick: not unless E drops a card on the table accidently|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, making. but that would be 5D :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: only a @C lead will give 6@H a problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt look good for playing in Ds|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry - the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That's what you get for overcalling 2@S vul against not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is dead as a rat|pg||
nt|ady: should be over the top   minor suit queens badly placed|pg||
nt|hlortz: 2@S was a sort of prebalance but south didnt know that|pg||
nt|jtr: He had a  tough decision|pg||
nt|peachy: I think best now to bang down the spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead the @D Ace - and lose 620|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S making on same auction in the other room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe down 4 if Klinger ducks 1st @D|pg||
nt|fann4: A flattish board again.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the auction i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange choice|pg||
nt|po-s: no Hans not to South (Africa)|pg||
nt|loganrun: good plan - although not fashionable I would open 1D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder on what page of his classix text on Losing Trick Count he recommends opening that hand? :):)|pg||
nt|po-s: East showed hearts - I´m surprised West didn´t bid 3H|pg||
nt|xenya: well W could have AK of hearts -- if not, 5@D is on a finesse -- good odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Black humor|pg||
nt|po-s: odds come down a bit when North had intervened|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|mdgraham: which rat's that, Roland? |pg||
nt|gracelin: they might wrongsided the 3NT cntract, but luckily, DJ is in north hand.|pg||
nt|peachy: must find H in either slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Puppet Stayman auction   3@D=at least 1 4-card major   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can do it a lot later in 6D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W shows 4 diamonds, winning heart play stands out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 8.5 losers, with over 1/3 of his points a KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no ideas about 6@h in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: tricky to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: @H switch beats it as we all can see -- but N can't|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: no spade lead and we are talking numbers...|pg||
nt|peachy: but thsat is of course seeing all four hands|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is the TOP|pg||
nt|peachy: I think diamond could possible be even better|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S Jack would have worked well...!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy upgrade to 15-17 NT borderline    K&R says hand worth 14.70  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=not 5@H/@S and MINIMUM|pg||
nt|loganrun: Now 3NT could go off on a spade lead but not on this hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  660 here and 650 at the other table, I presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: One of my cats brought back a dead rat last night. Thanks very much|pg||
nt|xenya: yes he can|pg||
nt|peachy: no lead attractive from N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could go down smaller if ace of clubs club now:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the wonders of this part of the imp scale   300/400  still 14 IMPs -- thanks Nick|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: How was breakfast?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to our operator, and not least kaksi. We have an accurate score on the board now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well done guys!|pg||
nt|peachy: Bravo, kaksi, Roland and operator!|pg||
nt|peachy: kakasi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: kakasi whose real name is Satoshi Imai|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defence is @C Ace and a @H - double-dummy|pg||
nt|peachy: Groenenboom can play whichever club, he doesnt know yet it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West has the @H Queen, he will get it anyway|pg||
nt|po-s: good sacrifice in 5C|pg||
nt|hlortz: well the 10@H dropping is a clue also..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C is 4-card Stayman|pg||
nt|po-s: The diamonds are so good, and the aces are not NTfriendly|pg||
nt|rodal f: For specs BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|po-s: but this one he passed as West|pg||
nt|othered1: Potential for a 2-way swing here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this one is a better hand, but still a comfy pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Will @D 10 followed by the 9 wake up South?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are EW playing 4-card majors?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade lead seems odd if 5-card majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision -- 5-baggers|pg||
nt|po-s: they just transferred and bid game over 1NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  And @H 10|pg||
nt|peachy: probably will lead diamond, leastr self-destructive without seeing all hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has stronger spot cards in club but he might go after spade since he has no entry for the long club suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing now    4@S=RKCB  5@C=3 keycards, 5@D asks @HQ  5@S=yes and @SK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|peachy: likely not making|pg||
nt|peachy: well, as long as they dont go for 7, all good for bulgaria|pg||
nt|hlortz: will E find a @C lead? i bet no|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: chance to make six now|pg||
nt|peachy: and either works, even without entry to clubs, friendly hand for ew|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I goofed, clubs dont work LOL|pg||
nt|po-s: yes East has made a slam try|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hlortz: up k@D ruff a @H 2 trumps exit a @D think he could make dbl dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also OK|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, with 1-1 @Cs and double @H finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I found Convention Card Stefanov used in Beijing with Aronov -- will see how much applies [if my network stabilizes]|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: reverse count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N said   a) no 4 card major  b) not 4333   [so 4@C & 4@D or 5@C/@D]|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  anyway, 5-6 imps back to Kitty's |pg||

nt|marlowepi: can make double dummy of course. diamond king and spade finesse. but declarer should put in the diamond ten at trick one to try to force a dummy entry|pg||
nt|peachy: other table behind a bit, maybe still some connection issues? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what a bloody result next door!|pg||
nt|po-s: seems you lose a spade a heart and 3 minor tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N had 8 tricks he would probably just be taking them rather than letting himself go down 2 extra tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: yup, gold star to lavazza for the 6@D in the or|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just reward. the tiny extra edge came in|pg||
nt|po-s: and denied a diamond control it seems - so West should perhaps admitted to having that -asy to say when you see everything|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another 2-bid here - by North? |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|peachy: could well be duplicated here|pg||
nt|xenya: right, so the 3@D bid was not also quite natural but also correct|pg||
nt|po-s: - and perhaps one in the wash|pg||
nt|hlortz: undo?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the original Blue Team Club -- North would open 3@C  -- how's that for useless trivia|pg||
nt|po-s: anyway, you say 23 is 20-10 in VPs, so another 2 imps is what SARA would need|pg||
nt|sybarra: as predicted... |pg||
nt|po-s: grat hands..|pg||
mb|3S|nt|peachy: ah, no|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's not the end )))|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes is that multi?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can play either opp for honor x, but this gains on the layout shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: wrong bidders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert must mean 1@C=2+   which North surely has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another 6 @H - with @D behaving|pg||
nt|po-s: but he gave up the possibility to get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: must include the stong version |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i double the operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 14 is the last board of the match; restart 10 minutes to the hour with the last match today|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps the issue here is the margin, rather than the outcome?  as long as both finish in the top 8, they advance to the KO phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more coffee-board|pg||
nt|fann4: The bidding should be starting with 1@H by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rotate 90 degrees please:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2C?|pg||
nt|peachy: i like 2C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is more like a 2C opener than a 2C rebid|pg||
nt|flash: of course, the higher a team finishes, the more control they retain over their opponents in the KOs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment in Europe  is for 1x-(1@H)-DBL to DENY 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have another Italian DBL that can't be described confidently|pg||
nt|xenya: boards 10 and 12 are potentially very good for Sara|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IsÂ´nt 6 @H a fair shot from SouthÂ´s position?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hardly the 18-20 HCP  [semi]balanced hand most of us expect for 4@H|pg||
nt|shevek: no no, I say 19-22 is 20-10VP|pg||
nt|shevek: 23-26 is 21 VP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously missing Gower's opening PASS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  New leader now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: yes, it only took 24 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: lets see how 3NT fares...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S or 4@C now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what now by S?  XX?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: 2@H now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3C by N would have been an underbid|pg||
nt|chick: a nice reverse into 2@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17:13 in Japan now|pg||
nt|flash: 1@D shows at least 4 and a shapely hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: Operator -pl UNDO!|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C usually shows 9 card in the minors, either way|pg||
nt|po-s: mind you - that is to pass South Sweden - it does not mean that SS get knocked out as they are 5th at the moment|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1NT - not my chioce |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to get it corrected |pg||
nt|bbramley: 3-1 trumps would have made it much more complicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker is liking this more and more with each round of bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: hasn't north done a lot of bidding, considering the @SK isn't full value?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Short of entries, East might play @D to the Ace.|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe 1@s was Xfer to 1NT?|pg||
nt|shevek: Dbl I mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  here was the 4 + @D and 5 +   major again |pg||
nt|po-s: now we know that 2D shows opening with D and longer hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: it may go 3S and 3NT, not a great contract.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H probably shows the 1444|pg||
nt|po-s: yes it was|pg||
nt|fann4: The @C ruff will later see the @HQ falling - an easy 4@H.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fortune favors the bold|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
nt|peachy: aceless softie, unless to my surprise 4C were forcing, cant be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each player wary of void in partner's other suit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: a VERY lucky 3N...|pg||
nt|hlortz: w needs to overtake the @H trick 1 and play @S to beat 5@C easy for these guys im sure|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and not a great slam because of having to guess @S at trick one  :)|pg||
nt|po-s: ajor|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|peachy: not at all, 3S the last making one, but if EW in other room play 15-17NT (I dont know if they do) might go same way|pg||
nt|flash: although it might just be patterning out (1354 or 1345) with a max for not opening 1@C|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D-1S-2C shows 5-4 or 4-5 minors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are in GF and S is unlimited. N has good cards, good IN-OUT valuation|pg||
nt|othered1: Wouldn't north have bid the same, to imply stiff @S, if the @SK work a working K?|pg||
nt|sybarra: fast arrival "hopefully"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe aceless and somewhat soft, but all values are working|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: nice fit|pg||
nt|chick: at least they got into a makeable game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, might|pg||
nt|po-s: 3S shows good with short diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: according to sys card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- why so pessimistic?   [even if it is the max they can make]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: nice judgment by Merijn Groenenboom|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I expect a flat board, losing 1 spade, 1 heart and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was same in other room (correctly) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently it was, but i dont know why S bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course VIctor Mollo's Hideous Hog said   you have to bid bad slams -- because so many good ones go down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s because of the cue-bid - bidding with closed eyes 6 @H, it is a fair slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Slam score at board 10|pg||
nt|po-s: silly bid, 3S IMHO|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: theygot there anyway, at least|pg||
nt|peachy: in the other room, bulgarian EW put NS to a guess, well done|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky @C position and @D hold-up will let this make|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D shift now isnt declarer in trouble?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe not |pg||
nt|othered1: duck one, pull trump, lead @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Ish lay down the ace of clubs now?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||
nt|po-s: this time the hearts behave. You need to guess how to treat diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy slam|pg||
nt|po-s: I would have had more understanding for 4S|pg||
nt|po-s: in my humble opinion|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hlortz: fortunately this is a simple 4@S making so we arent missing anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might lose @C to ensure game??|pg||
nt|sybarra: only if @D's break I thnk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has semimasked his club holding, but declarer shd still go right in trumps|pg||
nt|fann4: So now declarer will surely lose a trump trick, but then make the @CQ.|pg||
nt|fann4: Oh sorry, I missed the take out dbl with the changed bidding. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S almost has to have a stiff heart to double at these colors facing a PH|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: our predictions havent really fetched tonightm have they Sveta :)|pg||
nt|xenya: @C shift was needed to beat it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@s on board 9:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 17:)|pg||
nt|xenya: imps|pg||
nt|xenya: lucky|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be a simple cliam by operator (easiest) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: why not just transfer to @s' /|pg||
nt|peachy: would be pretty conservative not to be in game vul IMPs|pg||
nt|hlortz: so 6 imps for staying out of game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Terrific bidding by Bulgaria in this match.  No bidding on last bd at least in OR.|pg||
nt|loganrun: If you can see around corners this is cold but declarer can't|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i want to be in it if it is on 32 trumps. actually you need more, but it is still worthwhile. anyway when i said "easy" i meant easy to make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wonder why S didnt temporize with 4D which looks like a freebie. maybe that would have been KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly what i was thinking Marshall  when i used the "p" word  [pessimistic]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thought it stood for Pusillanimous|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if E thinks S has only one top club honor, all the more so|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sfoxa:  u r right, Raija|pg||
nt|shevek: that explains 1NT bid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: and he got that wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra2: then invite?  maybe I missed something earlier|pg||
nt|flash: we were speaking of shoes earlier - as usual, Mandala-Bocchi have their bidding shoes on!!!   another monster result|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|po-s: good play - the ten might be fromAJT|pg||

pc|d3|nt|jtr: There will be a few in slam on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: may make 12 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose  usage|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|fann4: Not sure what 3@C meant, presumably some @C losers, so surprised no @CA lead.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

pc|cA|pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  They have a VERI BIG set here|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  VERY|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|jbgood: but will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|gracelin: because in this sequence EW can stop in 2S, while if you transfer, you need to followup with 2NT. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Small @C would have worked fine|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: @C switch coming too late...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jtr: seems a big play not finessing the @s and taking 11|pg||
nt|peachy: one more down doesnt matter, 2N not making either|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok |pg||
nt|peachy: while if in 2NT and game makes...|pg||
nt|flash: while this is playing out...    thnx to NEC for their continuing sponsorship of this great tournament|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: east can get most of the match points if entering with A@H   cashing dimonds and finessing 10@C     |pg||
nt|peachy: then opps have more and they wont lie silent|pg||
nt|peachy: the 1pt hand was squeezed, beautiful!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but no more problem now - u r right again - overtrick|pg||
nt|po-s: You could even have slam in diamonds and be playing 3D going down|pg||
mc|8|nt|hawe45:  3 @S I suppose|pg||

nt|ahollan1: indeed they've had a very nice set|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 13 might cost|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final knockout round -- SARA currently in 15th place, OZ in 3rd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and seems in keeping with partnership style to be aggressive|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Will this be the flattest of flat 4@S's I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably not|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S for n/s    west will need to lead clubs to hold to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: some wont bid game perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: why should it be flat   not all will lead a club|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you everyone, was a pleasure to keep company with you all, incl kibitsers!|pg||
nt|flash: next match scheduled in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you miss slam you should make exactly five|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as has our Vugraph Operator -- well done!|pg||
nt|po-s: if South had discarded a heart he could have endplayed declarer for 2 down|pg||

mb|1C|nt|hlortz: yes thx much|pg||

nt|peachy: Last board now, thank you to Japan Contract Bridge League, BBO, and our Roland Wald, for bringing this event to vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: if it's customary for NS to open that light, they must have some machinery to let them stop low |pg||
nt|po-s: and if in 2NT you still need to ddo the right thing in D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's true|pg||
nt|po-s: correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and not all bid what we think they should:)|pg||

nt|po-s: if that isn´t a slamgoing hand...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing that is a "better hand" 4S bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: tolld 2x16 sorry |pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing they have one bid for all splinters|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: i think most will be in game|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks to Japan Contract Bridge League and BBO for bringing this prestigious event on vugraph. Thanks to Roland Wald for his ongoing work to keep the vugrraphs staffed.  And thanks ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: so what? stiff heart and say Axxxx only in spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: specs think splinter, but when in my own experience Ish prefers i response to cover all splinters (clarified on next round), so 4H would be a better triple-raise hand than 4S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: ouch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that could be painful|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do the rest of you open 1@D  or  1N [15-17]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  they managed to reach it - hope, W make it, too |pg||
nt|peachy: Here is the tournament website http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|hlortz: needs trump shift but that will just hold it i think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9?|pg||
nt|peachy: Jim "Flash" Gordon, quick on his feet, humor, great analysis. And Hans from the cold North, wonderful!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nite all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would show 4+@H but show length as natural players do [@S first when 55]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing 15-17, I would be in game as East|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd prefer 1@d as well|pg||
nt|fann4: This can go for 800, so there could be a new leader.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too good suitwise for 1N facing unpoassed hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  due to 5-4 distribution|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Oh - new plansRight spot - they played the same system...|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a reasonable bet, neeed clubs to behave|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perhaps Drijver thought that 3@C implied heart fit|pg||
nt|shevek: a big thank you to our excellent operator, to NEC for staging this great event, and to the JCBL (Akito Omasa)|pg||
nt|shevek: and last but not least thanks to our spectators who give us a reason to be here in the first place|pg||
nt|po-s: a well needed 8 for EW just came in|pg||
nt|loganrun: And thanks to Nicoleta and her 'kid' stories|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: W nwi|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx also to Patrick and Raija for the commentary :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: is|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Patrick and Shirley, always enjoy working with you :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess the next set starts 1.5 hour from now.  Thanks all.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Our gratitude to the JCBL and to Akito Omasa for brining this wonderful tourney to BBO.  Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: W nei is"go"world champion!!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and at midnight,  it is time for bed for me |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But there is a losing option - the @H-finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: a very thin game that could be beaten on a trump lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: but now...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Highly exciting and involving set of boards.|pg||
nt|peachy: Specs, you were so very quiet this match, you all are free to comment to us as much as you like :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: rarity on OR a passed out board|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everyone, see you soon|pg||
nt|jcwla: One pd of mine says the passout decision is the best part of his game.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely bid Ish and Ash  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heart and spade P-O Sitions may make this tricky|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: just under an hour|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - needs onle @S-suit 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  only|pg||
nt|peachy: I thought about that. Many play fit jumps by PH|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-switch is bad - tka this trick|pg||
nt|hawe45:  take|pg||
nt|peachy: he will figure it out.  Must take|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He might as well; he knows spades are 4-4 after the lead, no?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a fast duck in @CÂ´s from West very soon - and we shall wee|pg||
nt|hawe45:  see|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but you need less luck in 2N and you won't go down 3 vulnerable |pg||
nt|xenya: good stop|pg||
nt|po-s: yes  absolutely - he might go down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good lead, what barryrigal suggested from his hidden loge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unanimous -- i think key is proud to reverse to 2@H over 1@S response|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: sone sunshine for Sweden - 4@S +420 in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kovachev must have forgotten he's not playing precision on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Mullamphy upgraded earlier NT, here Klinger downgraded|pg||
nt|hawe45:  100 in 4 @S D looks very cheap|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: but needs correct timing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h ruffs before @c ruffs|pg||
nt|sybarra: we start again in about 20 min |pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jbgood: nothing but clubs to lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: Standings after 34 boards: 1. Sandqvist - McIntosch 66,8%, 2. Herman - Forrester 61,3%, 3. Brock - Sheehen 60,5%|pg||
nt|jtr: He is thinking of a trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: Chmurski - Puczynski 56,2% (13)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  and transmission will resume in an hour and a half |pg||
nt|po-s: do we know the score at all?|pg||
nt|peachy: gnite Shirely:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even undoubled, that would be too little|pg||
nt|xenya: exact tie after this board|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: results: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|hlortz: doesnt matter here but the slow j@C suggests e has another as w aj dbltn you would see a and prompt j :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s better than the finesse|pg||
nt|bbramley: he can claim 9 on a crossruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra2: supposedly another 10 inches on top of the 18 we got over the weekend |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm going to watch some more, only 9PM here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and once again it is snowing in Wash. DC......|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good night, Shirley.|pg||
nt|peachy: bummer, clear and cold here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ty all :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why 8 of D? 6 would say "i like both" then N could choose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not again -- he asked for @H  and only NOW thinking about what to play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: those are the moves that turn partner's hair white|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhhh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reverse suit preference?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Matt needed 2@D as transfer to @H  ---  maybe that will be in Ron's next set of notes :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|peachy: better get the hearts going|pg||
nt|peachy: make a snowman and have fun|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|po-s: so how would you defend?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, I had forgotÂ´n the thidr @S in dummy - that changes my opinion|pg||
mc|9|nt|jtr: Yes, awkward|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great recovery by the Dutch who were 0-16 doesn at some point|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all in 20 min. |pg||
nt|po-s: hard not to get nine tricks|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|brgpro: both pairs open all 11 counts|pg||
mb|2D!|an|5!s & 4!h|nt|imp_jan: this the penultimate brd, in close match|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brgpro: 2@d=5@s and 4@h i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Reverse F-word.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 2@d showing a weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|imp_jan: seems that ew are talked out 3nt|pg||
nt|brgpro: so EW missed their 3NT here|pg||

nt|jcwla: Lavazza also did not bid the magic-fit 6@H on 12 so it will be a push, still 13-10 with four to compare.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2 boards remain in the match --  semi-finals after the break will also be 2 16-board segments|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4S a lucky make|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ady: 3NT  gets the best score here   but they may end in 5 or 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: true, but might lose to 98x in spades with West|pg||
nt|po-s: closer to ten|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: East set up a number of set games a few years ago|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@D needs to go a bit|pg||
nt|jtr: Naturalists vs Scientists|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 3@H from South?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: really dislike Sylvan's 5@C bid in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: south opened the hand in open room and stole the contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: dbl?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec wondering if 1S = both minors|pg||
nt|fann4: Well, one way to go plus is to stop at the one level.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Not so terrible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, not penalty, anyway  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe just showed clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: when you have a good fit as EW here, bidding too much may easily push opps into  something they wouldnt bid if left to themselves|pg||

nt|po-s: 6 was not best|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: south will have to give 1 trick|pg||
nt|hlortz: i think w should have bid say 3@H the round before rather than giving opponents the option here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why the 6???|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|nt|jtr: His partner bid it for him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|po-s: unblocking...|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|jbgood: that was careless - ruff a spade and throw a club on di king..|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North  can NOT have the @H Ace - in which case he just had played on @S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N/S made it easy for Duboin|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brgpro: time of the truth|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would toss a coin|pg||
nt|brgpro: would u jan?|pg||
nt|brgpro: no clue whatsoever|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd play @SQ|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or a credit card (modern times)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: to be honest|pg||
nt|brgpro: E can have @cK...who knows|pg||
nt|jcwla: 13 will give us a new leader -- Netherlands' S with the 6-5 @S/D hand chose to overcall 1@C w/an esoteric 3@S and while 3@D came home 3@S will not.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont believe in credit card... i am a poor guy|pg||
nt|brgpro: so i toss a coin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set. Many thanks to our excellent operator, and to Jan, Jack, Sunil and Jordan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Second half in about 55 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzch: now North has been examining EW CC for a long time.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is not checking on convention card...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: usually bocch is fast as lightning, but he knwos when to take his time|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is checking their faces...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|imp_jan: pffff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's Dutch for "wrong guess"|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he trusted the face of his screen mate |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bad luck.. but i think @SQ is % wise better|pg||
nt|imp_jan: they look very innocent|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all -- so long for now.|pg||
mc|6|nt|sunsamvar: Tx al for watching|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye now|pg||
nt|brgpro: bye|pg||
nt|imp_jan: this feels like scoring a goal in soccer just before half time |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and to Jack, Jordan, Roland and Jan... has been a pleasure commentating with you this tight match|pg||
nt|vugraphzch: Zimmermann 54 - Burgalia 1 (after 9 boards comparison)|pg||

nt|jtr: Roland, do i still get pay|pg||
nt|jtr: still get paid the same amount if they miss a board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: jolly good|pg||
nt|hlortz: all commentators get double pay for the annoying idle time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Make that triple|pg||
nt|hlortz: you are most generous!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Beers all round!|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand now (I think) |pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  Seems makeable - 3 NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt or 2@D ?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: just 2 boards ago i remarked how close the match was:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator in Yokohama,  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: huh??   West really passed 1@S      believe it or not, i'm speechless  ..... starting now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to all of my co commentators  great to have y'all |pg||
nt|larrymori: it was and the slam hand was a huge swing|pg||
nt|po-s: Klinger overcalled 1NT on West....|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i wouldnt want this auction on my tombstone|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx NEC for bringing this to bbo |pg||
nt|fann4: Missing getting 800 on the previous board cost SouthSweden a vital 4 imps.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: EW were incredibly lucky to win IMPs on 31|pg||
mb|3N|nt|po-s: seems to be an Aussie thing to bid NT as often as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and to our wonderful specs....love the comments|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You must be a good guesser, Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: But with this tame looking board it would not have been enough.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade to the ace and a small back|pg||
pc|s7|nt|larrymori: been noticing that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as if swedes never bid NT:)|pg||
nt|fann4: That's true Marshall, but EW in the OR should not have bid to 5@C.|pg||
nt|po-s: let us see how he guesses spades|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  Sorry - to me makeable means, that is is possible - not SURE|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: if EW in OR bid 4S instead of 5C, 12 IMPs swing the other way|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fann4: Apparently they will keep this site open for updates on other matches.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: for me most SUREs are just makeable and most makeable's are down|pg||
nt|po-s: he goes wrong - yes -noo? after the long thought|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He makkes it - there is BBO transmision to NL|pg||
nt|nunes2002: fra 30 minuti inizia il 2° tempo|pg||
nt|po-s: did Duboin consider a diamond back or is he falsecarding the spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After that long thought - is it ethical with @sAK?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|po-s: never!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|po-s: and Ish|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Exactly my point Ralf|pg||
mc|6|nt|sybarra: when we played agst them, thought it was 1 club always |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we see you back in about 15 min |pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing neither pair bid 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back in 30 mins with the second half|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: playing in thew same tempo @sA and a small.....|pg||
nt|po-s: theory being either use the cards God gave you OR don´t become misled beacause you happen to have the ten|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think Duboin took time to ponder his options bcos Drijver played too fast to trick 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: does not matter for me...|pg||
nt|po-s: yes, a diamond could haqve been right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Ok Bye for now and thanls all|pg||
