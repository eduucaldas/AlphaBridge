nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
nt|petergill: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: this is the 3 segment of the 3 round quarter finals|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last 12 boards of a 36 board quarter-final in New Delhi, India|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Ruzbeh|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet heart partscore to start, perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Geoffrey and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi and welcome to all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its close after the first 16|pg||
nt|roswolf: very looks like a good match|pg||
nt|roswolf: a partscore to start|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3NT needs to be played by North to have a chance|pg||
mb|1C|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
nt|dslee: For results : http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
mb|1H|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now we will compare the scores|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that last board may well produce a swing - as even 3@s on spot on defenc cant make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: fireworks from the formidables is to be expected|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
nt|roswolf: 51 imps behind with 16 bds to go is a lot|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcarroll: 3@D = transfer|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|xenya: still, with a little bit of luck...|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
nt|loganrun: South did better here than in the closed room|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT ambitious    needs luck  as shown with result in CR|pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi David|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: look fairly standard from what I saw last set|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like a prepared 1@D and a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 pair played multi 2@D the other normal weak 2|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to my co-commentator Frank Budai|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|petergill: South would balance with a Dbl if he was in the pass-out (last to speak, or balancing) position. |pg||
nt|roswolf: now if this makes.|pg||
nt|xenya: this appears to be makeable|pg||
nt|ady: may settle in 3@C|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can well start with taking first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that this is the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark: good afternoon|pg||
nt|ady: hi     late start|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and the comeback would begin|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a trump and two clubs|pg||
nt|dslee: -2|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
nt|loganrun: although 3S rather than 4H would win the hand - still not off yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good double - wrong ace for a maximum penalty godd still going down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not yet though|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  been pushed too high    cant make 4 if diamonds attacjed early|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome to New Delhi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the 1 hour delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed.....will catch up at claiming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunit|pg||
nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead gives declarer some work to do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mind you now I look they were different pairs :)|pg||
nt|dslee: W should have competed in 2@S rather than 2@H|pg||
nt|panja: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|panja: but we might see a non@H lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: attacked|pg||
nt|ady: only if you take them     trying to make with club finesse may end up with 6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|xenya: declarer should simply set up clubs|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Hi James, Martin and specs I'm Frank from hot Norway. Just -23C now:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks to be -1 from here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: well declarer is favorite|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|figo: last deal was potentially a very good outcome for DSM|pg||
nt|ady: well you never know|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: Yes, the trump leads are very good defence. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: 5@C wasn't making either, but it is normal to take out insurance on hands like these|pg||
nt|roswolf: btw do we know the systems|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Sinil     Liz|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraid i don't|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H was aggressive and may have led to a game raise - south knows his customer!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: A bit unfortunate - the bidding looks reasonable, unlucky to find the trumps stacked. So first imps to CBAIlookk|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence never touched trumps, declarer could probably hold his losses to only his five top losers|pg||
nt|xenya: but we can work it out i think -- in general|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|chick: could it show something in hearts besides?|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 13 now on @H finn|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make n/s   but would not be allowed to play there|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  N guessed right... he could have saved himself a headache by not cashing the Ace of @cs first|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|s9|nt|ady: the biddng was similar in CR  and east managed a heart lead|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: @C ruff is always likely tho|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|chick: safely making contract is always good |pg||

nt|mcarroll: After 3 frantic boards - a little placidity?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the open room, N made 5@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS rather got away with that I'm afraid..|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well played to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: director has been called for settling a dispute|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: dispute resolved - scores remain the same|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 4@H    may have difficulty getting there|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence at the other table correclty led trumps, but they switched away from trumps too early. |pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a solid start for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a 4@S for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart barrage might occur|pg||
nt|roswolf: ns strong club ew 2/1 i am told|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 imps to the trailing team|pg||
nt|xenya: so 12 imps on the 1st board -- a promising start for the trailing team|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup :)|pg||
nt|figo: will sumit open 1S here ?|pg||
nt|figo: some hold up ?|pg||
nt|loganrun: wd North but the defence erred|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: allowing declarer to ruff the club high |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this bid won't make N's day any happier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tell us about the players Sunit, please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S husband and wife as far as I recall|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: McGann dows not like passing |pg||
nt|sunit: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I could be wrong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hI liz|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like south's doubl|pg||
nt|roswolf: could receive a bloody nose|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ok. I can leave so they come back:)|pg||
nt|sunit: rajeev and himani are a husband- wife pair from Mumbai|pg||
nt|ady: north take-out double has given them a chance|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes 4@H is a great contract|pg||
nt|dslee: How will 6@D be bid :) am sure, rajeev and himani will handle this well. 1@S opening would be helpful for rajeev|pg||
nt|dslee: ahhh|pg||
nt|dslee: any issues operator?|pg||
nt|dslee: or they are taking some time to think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: all are in thinking mode.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: with their hands on their heads|pg||
mb|1N|nt|frankaus: X or 1nt here  - 1NT 4 me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a very strong weak raise|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm, I am sure, Rajeev and Himani will have a strong argument once this deal is over|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: S need to run |pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the obvious escapes us at the table|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2S is the last making contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 117 was 1 imp to n/s 3@D -2 in the other room|pg||
mb|3N|nt|james_h: but bidding 2@d here is a poor IMPS bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I might have made a horrible takeout double with the South hand because of the 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C with the fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree unless playing 2/1|pg||
nt|xenya: what would you suggest, Jeoffrey?|pg||
nt|roswolf: axe|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Hang on a min Rodal :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit: I am not sure which Banerjee is this but must be from the railway team|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too much, four obvious losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still S there now for him|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass actually|pg||
nt|xenya: over 3@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500 is cheap vs 2140|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: we'll give you 2 more hands|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: if pard cant act then game unlikely|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, when fixed stay fixed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that S in Open did not bid|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H by north conservative|pg||
nt|petergill: South is disciplined enough to stop bidding, despite 19 HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: downgrading KQ doubleton, Frank? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: solid game no dangers visible|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be bloody indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: that lead for the max i think|pg||
nt|figo: action time !|pg||
nt|ady: its inevitable e/w will get to game  once est opens   should meet wth a similar result to CR|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: east liked the hidden diamond fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this one really does require a lot of work|pg||
nt|ady: by South   sorry|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if vul they may hav pushed on to game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems a little conservative to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: trying for a club ruff seems best|pg||
nt|loganrun: West might have bid 4S at his second turn - if 2C is naturalish - his hand has improved - now this has happened|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||
pc|d3|nt|davidstern: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes this banerjee is from railways.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not EW's fault that they did not bid the cold grand slam next door|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sunit: only way to beat this contract is after cashing both the clubs north has to play a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, this may make now|pg||
nt|sunit: difficult though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too late|pg||
nt|xenya: on best defence that is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  in modern bidding, strong dbl on 1N is out of date |pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes the whole hand needs to be downgraged imo|pg||
nt|dslee: not the easiest of hands to play, but the cards are friendly in 6@D, J9 rolls|pg||
nt|ady: 7 tricks is the limit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|davidstern: This will make if declarer is careful in the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Needed a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No ambitions in life, DS? 7@D!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes good try next please :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup |pg||
pc|h5|nt|dslee: least 6 :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks only and no real pressure on E/W - i cant see a 9th ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes in first position, but a balancing dbl over 2@H is very much in vogue|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still may be OK if he runs a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|sunit: no can still beat|pg||
nt|loganrun: Tough for South but it doesn't matter|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sunit: with a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence dropping tricks i think|pg||
nt|figo: guess rajiv will be disppointed by the C suit in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: well, whether South runs or not depends on your parameters for doubling 1NT   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can be endplayed to lead away from @DK|pg||
nt|sunit: why?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I suppose if the heart finesse was wrong 4@H might not make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: whereas west cards were in spades where he thought they werent|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: Me neither|pg||
nt|sunit: no he can exit a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what trump? I cash all my trumps but one|pg||
nt|sunit: no endplay here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What are you going to throw on the spades?|pg||
nt|dslee: and 1@S I thought from Bhabesh would help Rajeev to decide on the line well with his hand|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|petergill: Good club lead - this looks like 200 to NS|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankaus: with a flattish 1 count u know this is not a gr8 spot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzdz: rapid play - missed tricks|pg||
mc|7|nt|mcarroll: Unless the defence slip|pg||
nt|davidstern: The defence have now put this at risk by forcing declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll watch your discards and endplay you|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I claim that only a heart lead beats it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sumit(West) is one of the brightest young stars of Indian Bridge|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: slam time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice overtrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might generate more action|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N 1NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a few more imps back|pg||
nt|xenya: good chance missed, still 5 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup with a large deficit you need to take ALLyour chances|pg||
nt|figo: hi all|pg||
nt|loganrun: West must take a lot of the blame for this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes.....some discussion going on betw. E-W|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mcarroll: Certainly looks like it|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, but its a routing slam Rodal :) so your on your last legs here :)|pg||
nt|figo: welcome to this finals|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: double? :)|pg||
nt|james_h: routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be a battle of the minors here|pg||
nt|sunit: i agree, roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: it looked like -4 or so at the beginning|pg||
nt|ady: south likely to open and west overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|panja: who owns Club suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S   excellent e/w     must avoid playing in 4-4 heart fit in the slam zone|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D, 6NT and 6@S are all interesting possible contracts on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to David Carlisle|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west butts in|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes should have been - defence were too hasty|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3NT - vul is about a 50/50 shot here and better when North opens as he did - a chance for EW|pg||
nt|ady: double also ok|pg||
mb|r|nt|james_h: 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N=12-14?|pg||
nt|ciaran: E/W need to be careful here again - W will be thinking slam now, but E has the wrong values for him|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might regret this|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: U have counted the months?:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice @S fit|pg||
nt|sunit: Delhi, The Crown plaza hotel is the venue|pg||
nt|roswolf: i can understand easts double at the score|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcarroll: 1@C either 11-13 balanced or strong|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is a good lead it seems|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5 tricks in NT |pg||
nt|petergill: West passed his 12 count, donwngrading the singleton queen|pg||
nt|frankaus: KR values it at 17.25-  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=kq+aq96+qj8+aj75|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi David, GM and welcome to this match from New Delhi- India|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c shows strong,without fit (in std carrot)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: west hand is a problem hand for the weak nters as you can (and they have) missed their spade fit.  With such decent @s's i'd have opened 1@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 7@S makes..|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should take some action|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should go quietly|pg||
nt|xenya: considering 2@H?|pg||
nt|figo: NS are real life partners as well |pg||
nt|figo: simple bidding to start off|pg||
nt|loganrun: South can see the diamond suit as a source of tricks and should bid 4C as happened in the closed room |pg||
nt|ady: re-double cry for help|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: on repeated trump leads this can fail|pg||
nt|ady: playing 6@S  a decent score|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C inverted minor raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, not inverted minor, 1@C must be Strong Club|pg||
nt|roswolf: must be|pg||
nt|loganrun: South must now save|pg||
mb|1N|nt|james_h: I dont believe South has shown his clubs naturally, he may have implied them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be implied now so 4@C to come?|pg||
nt|james_h: the fact the 3h is not alerted makes me think its just natural|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: looks as if they might pefewr the 4-4 fit... unfortunately|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C would be 5+ clubs, 8+ points, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 trumps, a club and a @H and @H ruff to lose |pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward to play|pg||
nt|garnetts: Taking full advantage of the vulnerability 3@D is the bid of the younger generation lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Late alert of 3H|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H looks like an overbid |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D and 2@S natural|pg||
nt|petergill: EW in game-forcing auction |pg||
mb|2C|nt|james_h: ok, south must have shown clubs |pg||
nt|po-s: he has shown clubs when he doesn´t rebid NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the 4@D cue does not improve the E hand so they quit in time|pg||
nt|davidstern: Combined 24 cound stopped well short |pg||
nt|sunit: can be beaten by 2 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT Pass 3@D should excite East|pg||
nt|figo: sry , disconnection |pg||
nt|figo: team many hands here did not opt for commonwealth trials and hence DSM will reprsent India |pg||
nt|figo: so that extra edge to the finals will be missing|pg||
nt|figo: of course there are 2 berths for India , host country and kejriwal team will be the other team |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W must be happy with this lead, not @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hei Peo|pg||
nt|james_h: I think McG will drive this bus home now in the snow|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and a 9 card minor fit to boot as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tourney website|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: more imps fpr leaders|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  lacking the spot cards, 4th best (or low for some) is the best lead with the W cards in @ds|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer try to steal a spade to make?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: though 3n is far from easy; a tempo behind imo|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: well at  least they will get a plus score     might even turn out to be a good score for e/w if in CR they get overboard in a heart slam|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D shows 4@S 3@D 5@C and thus only one @h opposite Axxx = perfect, so heading for 6@D or even (unlikely) 7@D |pg||
nt|roswolf: south is right to duck on genral principles|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice to see that Mike Lawrence has so many fans in India. They even named a club after him as you see on the scoreboard|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D sets @D as trumps, 4@S cue bid of ace or king or both|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not here|pg||
nt|dslee: one saved :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: true David|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: why nt play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Markku M. Mäkelä|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all!|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sunit: now only 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought W would pass, then bid 2@S if needed|pg||
nt|petergill: Not looking for 7@D, as West is a passed hand, and "8 trumps" is not enough for 7@D to be a good % chance|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: This bus has snow chains James?|pg||
nt|andyv:  is it stealing?|pg||
nt|athene: actually no need to steal, especially - opps don't have anything to cash|pg||
nt|garnetts: west has no choice but to lead a club |pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: bingo David|pg||
nt|ady: down 1 in 6@H in CR|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: this will require some work - lets c if Namit brings it in|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: super fast play.....missed tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok np|pg||
nt|roswolf: not|pg||
nt|figo: and Himani to claim soon|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: or not enough|pg||
nt|andyv:  just has to guess correctly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep a guess...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Played by north would likely be no problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems dangerous|pg||
nt|loganrun: 10 imps comes back|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|chick: looks like it will make now|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sunit: wow|pg||
nt|xenya: avoiding a @H ruff -- looks ok|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: No heart cue bid, as West had already guaranteed singleton or void heart in the bidding|pg||
nt|dslee: For all those of you dont know Sumit - he is one of the very promising youngsters from India, I would rate him the best in the new generation|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|ady: unlucky for e/w pair in CR|pg||

nt|james_h: sorry Rodal, this it too tame for me|pg||
nt|james_h: I demand more "fast lane" hands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: but this time the @S save is too expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And might even aggravate the opps into the grand|pg||
nt|po-s: spade save is 2000 I think|pg||
nt|po-s: and 7clubs more|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1700 might enough|pg||
nt|james_h: West is considering her options|pg||
nt|po-s: right, I counted 6 spade tricks, forgot the ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  no reason for W to fly with the Ace|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @HA there's no rush anyway|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, should have hoped for a missguess it seems..|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|davidstern: But need to get there |pg||
nt|ady: around a 20 imps swing on the heart split   mind you 6@H is not a great contract    needs decent trump split  plus spade finesse|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice 4@S for N/S if they get there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid at both tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems to be biddable|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w might overstretch here|pg||
nt|figo: NS to play standard with lot of gadgets |pg||
nt|figo: EW also playing standard |pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk5: How are you going to bid a grand slam with any accuracy when opps bid spades like mad as happened in the other matches?|pg||
nt|james_h: opening 1@c with this hand when looking at the NS (terrifying animals :) ) may not be appealing|pg||
nt|po-s: is 2C clubs or strong?|pg||
nt|figo: 4S for NS ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Very aggressive action by EW in the CR |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ciaran: Very favourable layout here for E/W - @SQJ doubleton, @DQ9 onside, @C 3-3, @HJ right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a classical weak 2, but I know a lot of players who would open 2@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: By exlution blackwood EW should have a easy line til 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR somehow found and made 3@c here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand wd probably have been opened in 3rd or 1st position|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino suggests pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a doddle :)|pg||
nt|xenya: reaching 3N looks obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: E worth an invite with two Axxx suits opposite a 15-17 NT, |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be beaten if clubs played before declarer can establish diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: Did North really pass?  |pg||
nt|ady: 1@S ?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: thats with A@H right |pg||
nt|roswolf: might not make of course|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can't believe he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes|pg||
nt|dslee: I would had expected a 2@C overcall and then come in with a x to show @S suit on 2/3 @H by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: its an underbid but she gets a chance to rev theing up now|pg||
nt|james_h: things|pg||
nt|po-s: I doubt that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising S did not show both Majors?|pg||
nt|james_h: lets see|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but unlikely as @Hq is a stand out lead|pg||
nt|dslee: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: P??|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 2@C really a limited opening? I mean, after all she has a 3 loser hand. Impossible to catch up later I predict. I agree with PO|pg||
nt|james_h: Ciara(West) in crying|pg||
nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 21 points and the opps have ignored you ... and found a fit ... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good sign for finding fit with partner - N must be short in @h|pg||
nt|ady: still west can go up with the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|loganrun: Same contract - first to 7 wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game in @c looks attractive|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: only fit left is @C's  - I like A 2NT gets the values across and N is marked with a few @s's on the auction|pg||
nt|figo: ah ha|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they dont have the theoretical points required, but maybe they will take the view that 3NT may be as likely as 2?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Will probably stop in 2N and be thankful to make|pg||
nt|xenya: courageous bid, 4@S |pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nonvulnerable game - not usually right to stretch|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even more unlikely into the aq10 :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2@S could be a 3 card raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tip i think is good when you have to make up a large deficit is either to upgrade or downgrade your values on every hand so as to engineer a swing|pg||
nt|garnetts: As they say he couldn't bid 2@C but could bid 5@C |pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: yep, spade now gives south some losing options...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Panja|pg||
nt|nerio24: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks made in closed room   playing in 3 spades|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: not sure of the EW system here....2@D either a straightforward Multi (so to speak) or possibly a bad-suit weak two|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If they do play clubs East must win the first diamond - West has to duck his king...|pg||
nt|figo: strategy !!|pg||
nt|dslee: this was a framed hand for 2@C overcall and then come with a X to show his @S , Himani will safely bid 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: we call that back seat driving |pg||
nt|mmmakela: now lost the good spade save|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that Mike Lawrence has a carryover of 2 IMPs, not included on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|panja: so a Club ruff is the fourth trick for the defence?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  idee fixe|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S plays 4NT in Open|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see any problems here|pg||
nt|roswolf: following that principle i might have treated it as a 20 hcp hand and say open 2nt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: told 2@D=5-7, 5+cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red lead brings 8th trick, what about 9th?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure about the 3@h bid seems a bit much - then again 3@s looks like a make and opposite @sHx even with the known 4+ @s with east woukd have good chances|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nasty break|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: sorry, 0-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: I dont think unlikely Sunil  with tht diamond suit there to provide discards|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: when you try a speculative lead and declarer ducks, you always hope you found a good thing|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: S really doesn't want to lead any suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: What was Hamilton's 2D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Some alerts have not been entered in this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|davidstern: Can certainly understand this auction - north unfoirtunately has a very good 2@S bid and east has a small amount of interest only|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: manageable perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: trump now S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: yes, a passive defence should do the job|pg||
pc|s3|nt|po-s: Probably there was a West face when Pass came back|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, the crux of the matter is that the West hand is too good for 2@C|pg||
nt|james_h: lol PO|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why W is so reluctant to lead pd's suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Difficult decsion whether to ruff high or not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in  |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3@S discard @C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: @C8 does not tell anything to East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|xenya: the fact that declarer didn't try to cash the @CK indicates he has another club|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|panja: good point|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be some overtricks here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: well, E seemed to encourage, and if so maybe wrong..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If the @C's broke 2/2 and hugh was able to sneak the @c9 into dummy this would make as it is hes blocked|pg||
nt|dslee: push driving :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: 2@C is 5 card Stayman so 2@D denies|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: 1 or 2 too high    still leaders will gain|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: in which case there's far less long-term future in spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: possible end play here - W is probably going to discard 3@h and now @ha and another should produce 2@d tricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in 4@S probably ruff high|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kdr_fm: using the entry to finesse @D and play for split @d honours it looks like|pg||
nt|dslee: Dmampur will get a bid lead now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: west is sure the missing spades are 5-4, rather than 6-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 more rounds of @c would have been better |pg||
nt|garnetts: it is true that 5@S doubled was the par |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed......will claim at the end|pg||
nt|xenya: E worked it out|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  next door S managed to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tempting to cash @DA, but a ruff/discard (heart) would have led to 2 down|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good going south|pg||
nt|roswolf: very overtrick is an imp back|pg||

nt|yo_yo: a few slams |pg||

nt|mcarroll: 190 a very uncommon score|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, I hate to lose that argument with pd:)....uh... sorry pd... didn't think you really meant it when you overcalled 1@s....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: 'you don't think much of his overcalls'|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A useful 2 overtrick imps for CBAI|pg||
nt|mcarroll: indeed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they have to play so - if they are there|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  well played, yes.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well guessed|pg||
nt|petergill: NS could probably have made 1NT - it was a close decision - South's lack of spades being one factor against opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just gets home but a good battle|pg||
nt|roswolf: all to np avail though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good bridge though which is what we like|pg||
nt|roswolf: another game hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead is trickling away|pg||
nt|roswolf: and this could be another chance for the trailing team|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another chance for Formidables?|pg||
nt|loganrun: A poor slam but it makes - NS will probably not bid it here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzgh: When she saw dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec says EW will get to slam here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ciaran: Of course that is what he played for - trying to tempt a cover and pin the 109 to run the suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: One suited|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whow they were in 4NT in the open room flat board|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS turn for 4@S :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 19 a double part score swing to dhampur|pg||
nt|figo: some action board here after some time |pg||
nt|loganrun: But South with a club void may well push as in the closed room with the club void|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  have a chance to get on the scoresheet here     can make 4 hearts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|xenya: brb|pg||
nt|roswolf: now some action possible now|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sfoxa:  I was told, after @d Q lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low club lead against 3NT and you are bound to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gary Hanna|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Roland, Nick and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: a splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may make a try|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes 200/500 depending if club ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Another hand where a spade slam may be investigated, but they need to stop at 4S|pg||
nt|frankaus: operator can we know the score from the previous rounds pls|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H A 2way shot|pg||
nt|roswolf: east must pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D looks like spades + another|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told dont - D + higher|pg||
nt|ady: even playing in 4 diamonds will give e/w their first swing|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andyv:  seems like a reasonable slam... not sure why it would go down|pg||
nt|athene: how do you fail in 6@H?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: viewgraph probably represented the true state of affairs there...|pg||
nt|andyv:  trumps are 2-2 and only need to ruff 2@cs in dummy|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H should be cold..but on wrong @C guess 3N will be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing a Strong Club system, opening on a good 10 or 11-15 is OK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well that w A so 200 lol|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C might be better by North as a fit jump |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what happened there?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Difficult decision for S now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No defence any more|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT GF Raise, 4@H very weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: will ask for the link.....just a sec.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: unfortunate chooce|pg||
nt|nerio24: no problem now|pg||
nt|roswolf: the cannon is wheeled out|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard|pg||
nt|roswolf: now north should subside|pg||
nt|roswolf: east was considering a raise and/or 3nt|pg||
nt|xenya: did E pass a forcing bid? |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: double conventional    capp perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still makes I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: very agressive action by South|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  I imagine E tried to ruff a @d low|pg||
nt|loganrun: I was asked why it is poor - spades 2-2 is 37.5% and less with this preemption - plus there could be a heart ruff in 6S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes declarer set off ruffing clubs but very carelessly ruffed a diamond with the @H2|pg||
nt|athene: there was a hand in a set earlier this morning where declarer had something like @S63 in dummy and ruffing with the @S6 stopped an overruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts was a sign off but west moves on..|pg||
nt|athene: west is always bidding slam with that hand after 1@H|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @S suit not getting mentioned here so far|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Any single-suiter?|pg||
nt|ady: or dont|pg||
nt|frankaus: 26 zars so i would open it playing std|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This tournament at the Crowne Plaza in New Delhi is in honour of Mr Mohan Lal Bhartia, an industrialist who loved playing rubber bridge and promoting bridge. Two teams from this ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: event qualify to play in the Commonwealth Bridge Championships held near the Commonwaelth Games in New Delhi in late October 2010|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but may also be a swing tactic|pg||
nt|loganrun: Well bid but they loose imps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: Got it right|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well done|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: single suitor i think.. woolsey|pg||
nt|dslee: 10 points is a dicy set of points, you dont know whether 2@D is underbid or not|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good choice - when N could not cue 4D, he needs a lot to make slam|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahhh|pg||
nt|ady: yes  I think so|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H needs @D 3-3 and @SA onside, so 4@H is where you want to be|pg||
nt|mmmakela: serious overbidding|pg||
nt|dslee: x|pg||
nt|ady: now they are too high   but at least they will get some imps |pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: just a question of six or seven|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s too much testosterone|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like EW play double here to say I have no honour |pg||
nt|figo: it appears that NS are in ' recovery ' mode but it is not unlikely to happen this way |pg||
pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: well, asks about the grand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: and what a strange lead|pg||
nt|figo: i mean ' likely ' |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|panja: 100% in Match points|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||
nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting push board|pg||
nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thats quite a raise by east on a 5 count but the clues are there - pd at least 6/4 opps bidding @D pd short .. good bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: also good judgment!!!|pg||
nt|dslee: Its not likely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: yup but east knew his customer!|pg||
nt|figo: another undoubled let off for DSM in this room|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|figo: anyone knows the overall score in this match ? i just joined in |pg||
nt|dslee: 10 points decision - as I said no one is sure if 2@D was an underbid, so 2@C there would had shown 10 points and have helped NS to stop at the right level|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mcarroll: @SQ switch causes lots of problems for declarer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: ????|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kdr_fm: both @s onside easy 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: network outage...will update scores at the end|pg||
nt|petergill: East has all prime cards - AK10 in the long suit, no queens and jacks, hence opening 1H|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: A spec informs me " they played dont"|pg||
nt|dslee: Results : http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|garnetts: one off is likely as West may cash out ---|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|po-s: North might have T9xxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if there are too many losers, but the defence cannot get at their winners in time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not a great double there|pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidstern: This will provide declarer with the entry to set up diamonds|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: I can't see any way that could have made from the point we saw it to|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Score confirmed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: well, he can ruff two clubs and hope for a non-existent spade-diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N was a passed hand|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S can pass 2 dias with comfort imo|pg||
nt|dslee: yes and so 2@C would had been good, or 3@C shows 10 -11 and 4-4 in @C and @D|pg||
nt|figo: before this set DSM led by 32 imps and now this to add - match tapered off as one sided affair |pg||
nt|dslee: last 3 deals was against Many hands, they were all over the place|pg||
nt|figo: even though the score shown here may not be the actual one for this set|pg||

nt|athene: a very embarrassing flat board there for both teams :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yesterday morning, there were tight slams on three of the first four boards - this morning, it pays to stay low|pg||
nt|xenya: any other lead followed by a low clun would have almost certainly beaten it |pg||
nt|xenya: *club|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|petergill: whereas East passed his 11 count on Bd 27 as it was 4333 and short of aces, and on Bd 26 West didn't like the bare queen in his 12 count, and could not open 1@C as it was Strong ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could be trappy for e/w|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how to keep out of 3N and can a major game be made|pg||
nt|roswolf: moe imps back|pg||
nt|roswolf: more|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think the play went the way we saw it|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks flat|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes...probably a miskey in the 2nd last trick|pg||
nt|loganrun: 23 back in 2 boards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much for either side here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona: well a couple of missed chances for Scotland here...|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what strength 1nt is? 14 could be weak or mdeium|pg||
nt|athene: medium|pg||
nt|nerio24: In the closed room South was the declarer|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: E/W may get to 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: 14-16|pg||

nt|petergill: Thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: yes, that's what a lot of kibs are suggesting to me|pg||
nt|chick: probably right|pg||
nt|andyv:  it was weak in the OR:)|pg||
nt|athene: 12-14?|pg||
nt|figo: 5C + 2s + 1H on top |pg||
nt|figo: NS will go high |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the formidables have scored 21 unanswered imps so far this set|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzgh: She did|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this looks a desperate try by west..|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to catch 2@C, with their trumps 3-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed |pg||
nt|vinbtech: Hobson's Choice really|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and comes to the same 9 tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: thanks|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should raise|pg||
nt|dslee: I hope they dont fly this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: thanks Christine|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT by south not seeing all the hands seems a fair spot|pg||
nt|davidstern: Are EW playing strong club?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or has he simply avoided a reverse rebid|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y precision i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S is the best shot and defence need to be accurate i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  with 19hcp, S is not going away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trivial 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Standard, EW play Strong Club|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Panja|pg||
nt|dslee: INT and be done with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Open Room must have crashed, so we are not getting comparisons, but they bid and made 4@S on this board|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2H is a good result for N/S since it looks like E/W will make 2S, though it might be hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S asking for a @S stop|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  who will play this board will be disappointed heavily - all possible honours are off side|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the balance      5-3 fit in hearts   but part score only|pg||
nt|garnetts: good auction next door--although I would pass 1NT |pg||
nt|mmmakela: good pass by N|pg||
nt|figo: prediction withdrawn|pg||
nt|dslee: rajeev will be cool for a while now figo|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  including 4-0 @d break|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: On the spade lead S will be very happy until trick 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: but e/w fall into the trap|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should have down valued J@C and opened 1N imo|pg||
nt|dslee: is Bhabesh thinking of 2@C? |pg||
nt|mmmakela: E might compete|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|athene: 2@S is the best they can do at this point i guess|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS lead by 20 imps before this set|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: but hope for declarer!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: constructive raise i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks good for the leaders|pg||
nt|dslee: here he goes|pg||
nt|garnetts: certainly he should |pg||
nt|garnetts: north will bid 2@D surely |pg||
nt|mmmakela: easy 2 D call now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ciaran: 2C from N forces 2D from S, and 2H is then to play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: again they decide not to push for the nonvul game|pg||
nt|ady: nice stop by e/w   via leb 2NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D to Q |pg||
nt|dslee: ns plays 1@D opening 3 cards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: missing pass over 3@S by North |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this can make - needs East to guess trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  won't get there|pg||
nt|athene: but they can't get there|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can't move|pg||
nt|dslee: figo, how correct you were :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in MP could try dbl and the magic 200|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: east should have bid 2@D then redoubled that, to show 44 majors|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 4H should prevail |pg||
nt|ady: should be down now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a lead teaser he now has 8|pg||
nt|panja: 2S down one..will be two IMPs for NS?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: running to 2@H like this sounds like 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: e thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: As South denied 4 spades (else South would rebid 1@S), 2@S is a safe rebid, cannot be raised to 4@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ciaran: May not have been E thinking - they are playing with screens|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  the Italian teams of the 60s made a fortune by not opening 1N with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: alternatively east could redouble|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wanted to declare himself - didn't want the lead coming through all his tenaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: There was some ask for clarification of NS auction|pg||
nt|ciaran: Brave double from Hamilton should pick up 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hugh will be thinking what did i do to deserve that .. lovely contract nice lead ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not that I would|pg||
nt|ady: nice routine 3NT  |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9 now lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: probably down 1 -- but might make if he gets @Hs right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: No problems in 3NT. 4@H also is cold|pg||
nt|figo: hmmm...........|pg||
nt|dslee: my prediction was wrong that Rajeev will take it easy :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ciaran: Thanks Christine|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: They have yo write it down so slower than |pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot understand why playing precision prevents 2@D--surely it only shows four over 2@C |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vinbtech: w/ E showing minors and 2H, the S9 should provide the 10th trick|pg||
nt|dslee: STD|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he'll be smiling|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will lead 4th highest next time!?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: now a sneaky @S6 |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: The cold is affecting me!|pg||
nt|athene: but EW could still organise it so that they scramble to 2@S by east|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: for example let's say east bids 2@D then redoubles|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|athene: and now west wants to play 2@S but from the other side|pg||
nt|dslee: worst is that @D also foes not break :( another few IMP to Dhampur|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: What about conceding two diamonds and claim?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spades are irrelevant|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1st satisfied w 1 NT, then after opps bid clubs has KQ in their suit and pushes to game, where's the logic?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: sso *he* bids 2@H and then redoubles that!|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y thats right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dslee: foes=does, apologies for typo|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: cant really see how to make  going up with A@C  does not solve anything either|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is on, but is not a great contract, needs no @H ruff, clubs to break and (if played by South) @SK onside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hope so!  worked for Chas Goren, usually right for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  I don't know if EW have that sophisticated of a partnership|pg||
nt|athene: this also has the advantage that partner has to suffer :) and you can go off and find a danish pastry and coffee  vendor|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, that I do think is the best reason for that bidding, Bill:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Not unaccompanied!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|figo: some kib asking how N bid 3NT w/o H stopper; answer is this 3NT is ART bid with long solid minor ( well J was missing ) |pg||
nt|garnetts: Logic?   |pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  @d switch|pg||

nt|chick: sad, but a very reasonable play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, but I think Short and Walker will be disapointed with these pushes..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: West did well though to play @dJ and not a lazy 6 might have gone @d 8 safety play ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Followed your advice roland|pg||
nt|davidstern: Slam time|pg||
nt|davidstern: And sacrifice as well|pg||
nt|vinbtech: slam save too|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - phone call. Back now :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar opens S |pg||
nt|petergill: After this 36 board quarter-final, the semi-finals are 48 boards and the grand final 64 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: so you would open 1@S, Frank?|pg||
nt|xenya: 32 imps and 10 boards to go|pg||
nt|vicky888: bad board for khandelwals|pg||
nt|dslee: operator, any "visible" NS reactions?|pg||
nt|garnetts: It follows the pattern of the other hand where you pass and then bid 5@C |pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hardly any reactions.....just a couple of words exchanged|pg||
nt|ady: had 9 sure tricks   could have played out all top cards and made 10 with J@D coming down in 3|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's a more solid-looking weak two |pg||
nt|frankaus: good W2@H|pg||
nt|chick: probably a good weak 2, as opposed to bidding a multi-like 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to set 6@h which is practically cold and find out it's a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difference of style; in the other room South opened 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 20 declarer went down in 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting 4@S EW here -- but they are unlikely to get anywhere near it|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a good sac here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes, N trying too hard to create swings|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe the guys are feeling too much pressure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|james_h: tactical 1@s ... prefering to opening 1@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  3@s relay to 3N?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6 clubs from south looks ok now|pg||
nt|andyv:  good 6@c hand here|pg||
nt|athene: many people play it forces 3nt so that north can then show a minor 1 or 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can compete in spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes that was costly, and more to come|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: unusual|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nasty for W will he pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east might venture a call here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: cant fault east's pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: or west?|pg||
nt|panja: that is a monster of a hand for a direct 4@H raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: are NS playing preclike?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-suiter I suppose|pg||
nt|garnetts: might even show clubs |pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: yes, an opening 2@d says that you haven't got an opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I play it that way|pg||
nt|athene: it looks here as though it's clubs, though|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lucky 12 tricks here with @C breaking and both diamonds onside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: time fo0r a @D part score|pg||
nt|roswolf: or game if they start to shoot!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: strong club we were told|pg||
nt|dslee: DONT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: In the open Room, EW bid and made 2@S|pg||
nt|eamongall: Oops I slept in |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Eamon|pg||
nt|andyv:  but NS may play it strictly as a @c xfer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Minimum for the strong type|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes - either minor suit slam works but probably not biddable|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But they seem to be edging towards it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North trying to show a really good diamond raise - cannot have spades|pg||
nt|petergill: I would pass, like Kachchu|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: lost connection.....back on track|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead would solve declarer's club guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: @H lead knocks this|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead - this keeps the defence in with a chance|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E digging a deeper hole|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  best for e/w   another chance for e/w to put some imps in the plus column|pg||
pc|dA|nt|james_h: Hi Eamon, did the snow eat your internet?|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like I missed some imps ..boards 1 3 4 ... but its ok ..there is still 25 boards in this match so maybe another 100 imps to be shared |pg||
nt|andyv:  or MSS and S's 6@c was p/c|pg||
nt|andyv:  either way, good contract|pg||
nt|ciaran: I'm giving up on predictions :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unfortunate - by north unlikely E would find a @h lead ... may well lead to a swing if open room N playing str NT  1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|panja: a result based on personalities rather than methods|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy 140 but 2 IMPs to MLC|pg||
nt|nerio24: another swing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh no trots out fsf|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks as if game is now predestined|pg||
nt|dslee: WOuld had used Garbage stayman sitting south|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now dbl is t/o|pg||
pc|d8|nt|loganrun: 3NT is very tough to beat here - lucky to say the least but 2NT is normal|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eamongall: We have very skinny snow in Dublin North this morning and it just stopped |pg||
nt|ciaran: N has a four card fit, but no honours in partner's suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2/1 for e/w|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|panja: y.....with a wide range opening....4@H would not be this strong...|pg||
nt|panja: still strong 1@C means 1@H limited to 17..not 15 as in Precision|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|athene: of course 6nt has the same twelve tricks but declarer in 3nt wasn't risking the spade to the king|pg||
nt|ciaran: Was an agressive jump to 5D|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like a very lucky pickup for CBAI|pg||
nt|mcarroll: impressive though|pg||
nt|xenya: i would respond 1@S as N and rebid @Hs as S even facing N's pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope brakes applied|pg||
nt|dslee: do the "garbage" and all these are not needed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: has perfect shape but rotten hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ciaran: N's 1S showed 3 controls, I believe - 2 for an A and 1 for a K|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 13 now|pg||
nt|figo: many players at least in India frown at computer dealt boards , feeling that these are mostly wild and swingy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcarroll: Open N is in 3NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  normal contract, normal lead -looks like one more push|pg||
nt|davidstern: No good if you arent there though|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: If S shows 6@Cs and 4+ @D in the bidding the N hand improves in limoiting Major suit losers?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: limiting|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eamongall: Ciara Burns and John Murchan will get some imps ..thats for sure .. |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: fortuitous club lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the X of 4@H cost 5 to tie the match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and makes 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|nerio24: Rajeev called me last night informing that the top 2 teams would be representing India, but there was a technicality about his team not registering so  3 and 4 would have a playoff ...|pg||
nt|nerio24: to decide the second team.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcarroll: Yes Ciaran thet play control responses over the 1@C opening a 1@D respose would be 0-7 HCP|pg||
nt|garnetts: The double is a transfer double---meaning that partner can play it for minus some number |pg||
nt|mmmakela: I might have downgraded the N hand to start with|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|figo: this is a myth , far from mathematical truth |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Defence needs to ruff in, cash the @D before it goes away and |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|james_h: in fairness to them, they have generated a lot already|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|petergill: hope for club misguess - alas......|pg||
nt|frankaus: that solves the @C guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: @CA play was premature|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|figo: boards so far in this match will vindicate that there is no reason to feel that way|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: I was thinking playing any method that 1@S has more appeal than 1NT |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: YES|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|mmmakela: and I downgrade very seldomly|pg||

pc|cJ|mc|7|nt|ady: seems got heart wrong on 2nd round|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: 6 clubs a good bid, whatever I think|pg||
nt|athene: and the count wasn't rectified for a spade-diamond squeeze on east|pg||
nt|ciaran: Certainly, but any minor honour would be far more valueable - @D K instead of @S K and slam is good|pg||
nt|davidstern: Blackwood and three key cards would work a treat|pg||
nt|vinbtech: not much good if u r there as well|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will probably get to 3 nt and go down here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 25 points not enough this time?|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   may get to 3NT     might make if west leads spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: good solid result in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|figo: good try but didnt work |pg||
nt|garnetts: off even|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: lots of shape here - this auction could end with the word double |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not a terrible slam. I for one would be proud to be in it|pg||
nt|petergill: East was hoping to cash a 2nd @D after @CA, but @CA was not a necesary play on any layout|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they reach 3N it will make on clubs|pg||
nt|panja: good 5@C spot for NS in CR...could easily end up in 3N..if E does not preempt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eamongall: Whats this Twitter thing ...says I can get tweets from the Camrose2010 ...or something |pg||
nt|loganrun: Good board for EW in the closed room - North on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: interesting collection poll 4 contract ? 5@C 4 me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon so|pg||
nt|chick: first NS have to get in the action|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 12 imps to N. Ireland which has edged out to an 18 imp lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lucky set for CBAI - the NIBU slam on board 1 had much better odds, but went off.  |pg||
nt|vinbtech: 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: prefer 2@C since they are playing strong club|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|dslee: this is straight finally - no complications|pg||
nt|panja: interesting...how come they made only 12 tricks playing in @D?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|panja: now..once can see what South is thinking|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand the 3@C bid -- unless it shows what N has -- 10hcp and 7 not so good clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: a quiet pass will ne some imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: scores are available on that link|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: S "I have one too"|pg||
nt|panja: the second position preempt has to be well defined...else this problem is bound to crop up|pg||
nt|ady: nice fitting hand e/w    did well to reach 6@D CR|pg||
mb|3C|nt|james_h: Hanlon played with Carroll yesterday, can anyone explain why?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can bid 1S with that?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Running scores and standings are here: http://www.camrosebridge.com/|pg||
nt|panja: will have to be played carefully|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: some would raise hearts with north|pg||
nt|andyv:  must show 0-4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind a raise by N|pg||
nt|ady: will need to make to make up for - 500 in CR|pg||
nt|roswolf: south inactive ----passive|pg||
nt|loganrun: But 3NT on the lie of the cards makes even on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|panja: well..ok, @S loser has to be conceded|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@C was strong?|pg||
nt|panja: especially on a @D lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh too active by west -will perhaps push them to 5@CX|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: NS were very conservative in Open|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: network outage.....will update the scores at the end.|pg||
nt|xenya: had W elected to open, slam would have been reached almost automatically i think -- not so easy now |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N struck oil with his absurd 1@H :)|pg||
nt|dslee: 1@H is transfer to @S as per their system|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eamongall: SNOW :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Late arrival due to weather|pg||
nt|andyv:  in big @c auctions, the more room you take up in bidding, the better off you usually are|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: commentators curse strikes again, no double and no 5@C :)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 3D= 4144 8+; more likely 11+|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: Some sort of spade raise is a must on the North cards - 3@S weak, or - if not playing that way - then 2@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: friends need some swings soon |pg||
mb|4D|nt|kdr_fm: 6@S double dumy seems to be there - but 4@s the likely spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes, EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes 1 c strong and I think 1 spade 3-6 with 5 cards|pg||
mb|5D|nt|james_h: thanks for responces ... McGann was snow delayed it seems|pg||

nt|nerio24: looks like it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3ed @C gives prom|pg||
nt|james_h: He was not issued his CBAI Snow Shoes in time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: In Open John Carroll opened  the W hand 2@D - Multi, !!, 4@H - pass or correct  from Garvey, Double by S - (not greeted with approval by the commentators)|pg||
nt|eamongall: Blue Club stuff for Murchan Burns ..well it used to be when they played a few years ago |pg||
nt|james_h: Blue in the face club|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The defence slipped and 4@H doubled made so more imps to CBAI|pg||
nt|cuttysark: More likely a heart?|pg||
nt|loganrun: North thinks that the double of 1D by South was take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome Sunil|pg||

nt|mcarroll: on 7 3NT +2 in open - Wales now lead by 18|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I was wrong with "one more push" - in  7, in OR after @c lead 3NT had been made|pg||
nt|roswolf: OR 3@CX ouch|pg||

nt|andyv:  i think 3N is right....the 2@s bid in closed room at least told declarer where his tricks were coming from|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: chance for Glyco;s to make up by bidding the vul game here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Glycols|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another very thin game - slim chance for Glycols to gain a few imps|pg||

nt|roswolf: 770 is an unusual score|pg||

nt|ciaran: Tight 3N for N/S here.  Looks like an accident for NIBU in the other room - playing in 5HX|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: time for a pairs 2@s ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  nice tip|pg||
nt|xenya: but normal result anyway -- slam is very hard to make on a @D lead|pg||
nt|ady: yes    nice lay for n/s    |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah then i withdraw my comments:):):)|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks absurd but 5@D has a cintilla of a chance here ---east would need to lead a heart before the AK are drawn |pg||
nt|nerio24: 4H can also make|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eamongall: Carrot Club here .. .weak or strong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Roland3@H might have stolen the board|pg||
nt|petergill: India is pretty good at bridge - India sometimes makes the quarter-finals of the World Championships|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks possibly trappy|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 1nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-6 is not a two-suiter in my view|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's the multi again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a perfect 2@S opening|pg||
nt|panja: EW are unlikely to have bid the way it showed on last deal|pg||
nt|roswolf: the comeback contibues!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Particularly not with a rotten 4-card suit and a great 6-carder|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: esp when the 6 carder is strong and the 4 carder weak|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what was 2@S ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Preference|pg||
nt|ady: wandered into 4@H in CR    had 8 tricks  but managed only  7   probably too spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|nerio24: preference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H showed both majors|pg||
nt|xenya: preference i guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N now by W?|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the double but i would do something! -|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the whole thing looked too awful with the double|pg||
nt|ady: took|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: right|pg||
nt|ady: hi all     sorry a little late|pg||
nt|petergill: Some of the top Italians have abandoned 3@C and 3@D weak jump overcalls, and would overcall 3@C on these East cards to show 6 clubs and 4 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I would|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen worse!!!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: pick a slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello David|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tournry website and gives the results of the swiss league and the 8 qualifiers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Both Souths pass 1@H - I think it is right to raise with 4-card support|pg||
nt|dslee: Knowing east he would, because he would think thats the safest :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: Yes the Carvey preemptive tactics pushed them too far|pg||
nt|ady: ok    thx|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  N could have had a great result by passing 2@h|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|nerio24: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Playing a strong club your hand cannot be very strong|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but hard for south to envision game after his ptr has passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should go -1 i think|pg||
nt|panja: S shd double for D lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no a trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|panja: a @D and trump better perhaps?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup ok|pg||
nt|panja: rather, @D QA ruff and trump|pg||
pc|d3|nt|james_h: I dont like 1@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|xenya: but N may lead a @H...|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart lead likely|pg||
nt|panja: not perhaps...even a @C now..I would think|pg||
nt|xenya: for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: small spade now needed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|james_h: inviting trouble|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S by E in Open|pg||
nt|james_h: Ok, I MUST like it now :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup another huge swing to formidables|pg||
nt|xenya: 7 spades, 2 @H ruffs and the @CA|pg||
nt|roswolf: will be only a 14 imp difference|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ciaran: Well, 4S makes, so -800 not a disaster against the -790 for 4SX|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't think he can|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't either... but with that vul and S not making any game try, pass may not be so bad|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar to last hand in a way|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so a push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - but when he has 9 red cards....|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 3@d |pg||
pc|d4|nt|kdr_fm: cold on a dummy reversal type play @SAK and another then play for @C 3/2 AK and finally Q with @s set up|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sunsamvar: -150 may be a great score for N/S|pg||
nt|petergill: Only 4 boards to go in the match, with NS leading by 25 imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: N/S were clearly on different wavelengths about the second double|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, as with 3@C if it makes the so did 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not sure what W hoped to get with the dbl... only suit he can really support is @c (and possibly @hs) while 2N seems just too obvious.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vikant Mehta|pg||
nt|vicky888: Hello all, a tight match for sure between DSM and formaidables!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Vikant welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Vikant:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: play paused for a minute.....directors intervening at another table|pg||
nt|vicky888: NS have 2nd/4th/6th leads.. low from doubleton|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3NT from East is best - depends on the card played at trick one - jack is the winnwer|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|chick: spades can go away on the clubs and diamonds, so must cash the A now or lose it|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has to hold his @h losers to 2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panja: really a trick hand....the sacrifice in the CR is worth as an insurance..|pg||
nt|loganrun: winner|pg||
nt|dslee: David, will u bid 3@S as east?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|xenya: just count your tricks -- spades are unlikely to be 4-0|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: no safety plays in the trump suit needed here|pg||
nt|petergill: South's spade-showing Dbl deterred East from rebidding 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: does south need to overtake?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  this helps|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: alternatively 3 rounds of clubs and finesse diamond seems more straight forwar|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@s is a fine bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: Yes but not if partner had passed already |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: yes i think he did - wd|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: or just give one - nicely played.  have to use gib so see if any slam on|pg||
mc|9|nt|eamongall: seems they are joining the room |pg||
nt|james_h: I like Ciara and John, but I'd also like a shut out|pg||
nt|eamongall: but there was also another 18 imps to CBAI on boards 7-8 |pg||
nt|garnetts: it is nevertheless a dangerous bid |pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: rapid play - missed tricks - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so easy make now|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that North hand is a bit too good for a weak 2@H, agree Ralf?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: yes.  not a weak 2 with 9hp and 6-4 in red suits|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Ferguson hoping to find a distribution that would defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Vikrant|pg||
nt|vicky888: hello all|pg||
nt|ady: this should be flat    just 2 aces to lose in a heart game for e/w|pg||
nt|frankaus: with electronic scorers - it could these days be possible for players to know the match running score would u favior that peter??|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table on Bd 33, West bid 2NT over 2@C, 3@S from East, 3NT by West = final contract |pg||
nt|vicky888: seems to be a part score hand|pg||
nt|po-s: If declarer had won the 2nd diamond in hand and played on hearts...|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi po|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi PO nice to see you here|pg||
nt|po-s: hi, a couple of mistakes there|pg||
nt|xenya: otherwise NS might have gone for a save|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a slam for e/w|pg||
nt|garnetts: seems to me that a 1D is the best lead too--poor South got it all wrong --as was said might have switched to a trump|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd've ruffed low the 1st heart ruff not to promote the 7|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW can rub it in by bidding a slam on a finesse |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is unbelievably lucky. You need spades to be 6-3|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wilkinsona: trouble is, to some extent they have had a few and not taken advantage..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries in the closed room as West led a heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes quite instructive though|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i think they will land up in 5@C|pg||
nt|xenya: or some blockage in the suit if 5-4|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was not reached on board 8 in CR...1 imps to Dhampur|pg||
nt|xenya: but now a great result for the leaders from the CR|pg||
nt|nerio24: good possibility|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: Yes, not a swing hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: bridge is unlike other contests - players do not know the state of the match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again :) made 3N on 8 but only in 2 so just 1 imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: most would open N with 15 nansino points|pg||
nt|frankaus: *cansino|pg||
nt|athene: declarer ducked the heart in the last hand, playing for singleton ace offside in the end position?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder what dbl by E is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: competitive I hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: play paused for a minute|pg||
nt|andyv:  i prefer 1N forcing by W if they play that|pg||
nt|vicky888: showing singlto in clubs... i prefer 1s-2s to be more constructive for tht double to come in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange to do that with a weak opening opp a weak raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, N's 3@c bid isn't exactly textbook with this vul:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he'll be happy if this is passed out though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: presume S has passed and W is cogitating?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petergill: I haven't thought about that idea - my gut feeling is "Not a good idea", but I don't know. Yoru thoughts, Frank?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i guess not|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: play resumes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why force opps to rescue|pg||
nt|po-s: how come nearly 10 times as many kibitzers are watching the nno-Gupta table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its 42-2 this set to Dhampur|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: "Whenever 3NT is an option ...."|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bob Hamman|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well. so much for predictions|pg||
nt|frankaus: it works well over 50% IMO|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eamongall: Peter Pigot reckons he would bring home 6@S .. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: old joke - passed out? How did the bidding go?|pg||
nt|ciaran: that should help E find the lead! (assuming S bid 5D and W doubled)|pg||
nt|po-s: please be quiet!|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are not glamorous enough?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ciaran: Looks like 6S has play - only a diamond from E puts it under pressure. Even then, can make I think|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another doomed marginal slam|pg||
nt|eamongall: I just came over from OPen to see this board |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like 4@d, 2@h, 2@c + 1@s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless they play here and east misguesses clubs, of course.....|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi from India :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C is a great contract   but with K@H with west might fail unless he leads a heart|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes time for me to have a nice Scottish malt Liz|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even worse, now bids 4!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|eamongall: looks like an 11 trick hand to me ...but 12 was made in other room |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well 5@C is a far better contract requiring only the @Hk with the opener|pg||
nt|xenya: now they should get there -- E has an easy 5@H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not me, cansino points or no, N has nothing to justify an opening in my book|pg||
nt|james_h: almost a slam here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like with the odds, just needs the last trump in dummy to score, ie 3-2 break|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The consensus here seems to agree |pg||
nt|ady: or heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  may win a couple of imps here (NS)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: South ain't got no sensayuma|pg||
nt|vicky888: 5c sacrifice will be 3 down|pg||
nt|petergill: EW need 37 imps in 3 boards  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 3 making?  may lose a bundle too|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Hope you enjoy it - rather early for me :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|rodal f: 4@H at W and a @S lead for 12 I belive|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Have some Indian beer instead :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you - one of my pleasures :)|pg||
nt|ady: I think 5@C  -4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 31-0 this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Peter Goodman|pg||
nt|petepunt: aft all |pg||

nt|xenya: ugh|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi welcome|pg||
nt|po-s: that´s a big Hi!|pg||
nt|roswolf: is that right|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this is a tricky contract too|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And now we get a chance to see for ourselves|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Who promised us that bridge is fair?|pg||
nt|frankaus: it would need some trialing - some may manipulate the pace to take advantage of knowing the score  towards the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't agree with the bidding and 3@s may not make |pg||
nt|vicky888: going for a down or two|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eamongall: Murchan is lucky he is not in a slam ....opening with that kind of "put in your own word" |pg||
nt|andyv:  this may not make|pg||
nt|athene: when south rose the @CA that was a suggestion he held the @CQ too|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok back to the other room ...my vote is down 1 by Padraig O Brien |pg||
nt|ciaran: Much more interesting on a @D lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Bidding as correcter|pg||
nt|ciaran: My predictions have been wrong so far, but I back Padraig to make this.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, a spade lead gets @CK into play|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 33 is a good example that bridge is a bidder's game. Even if 3NT failed at the other table, their team still gains 2 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|dslee: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: well, this may sneak hime. East has two awkward discards if the diaomds are cashed|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: Played from W in open and @C lead away from the K made the opportunity for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c should ask for @h back|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Claim soon|pg||
nt|vasanti: .|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: NS will wish they stayed in bed --then it will have been the right type of nightmare |pg||
nt|nerio24: should be 4S from W|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kdr_fm: Dedication Peter - pay to go away to commentate ... Roland just needs another 30 or so of you !!|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|chick: fortunately for N, he can force a second club trick|pg||

pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: play will be fast|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  now @s back and E will have to guess which suit to cash|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but spade needed now..|pg||
nt|andyv:  10@h should be asking of @s|pg||
nt|vicky888: claim time?|pg||
nt|loganrun: So he is careful but the cards lie well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petepunt: looks like match has swung on 1 lead so far ?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  now making....don't know the logic behind a @c lead on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: super fast play - missed tricks|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
mc|11|nt|ciaran: the problem is E's @S9 - may need a deep finesse to make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong, 1@d negative, 1@H stronger, 1@S artificial reply|pg||

nt|ady: n/s   have to p lay 4@H   on 4-3 fit  to make game    assuming a club lead in no-trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: I knew Padraig would not let me down!|pg||
nt|ady: or cam make 5@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so DSM LOOK AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS q/f|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl is dangerous at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vicky888: too weak for tht jump??|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess 3@h is not GF|pg||
nt|andyv:  W likes that bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: well both fits have been found - who will blink first|pg||
nt|po-s: how many boards?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think west had a clear 6@S BID ANYWAY|pg||
nt|loganrun: And diamonds for that matter|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: that looks suspiciously forcing |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but is 5@D natural now, or simply a cue bid?|pg||
nt|chick: don't know, but either will do|pg||
nt|chick: I'll bet he passes though|pg||
nt|frankaus: we have a 9 card M fit wit game values|pg||
nt|chick: bad suits, doesn't know if pard has the honors in the right places|pg||
nt|chick: (which he doesn't)|pg||
nt|frankaus: opp a weak NT  slam is a minor miracle |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: She!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S asks for Majors and strength|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW took 8 tricks in OR. what about doing the same in defence?|pg||
nt|petepunt: both @d wrong prob 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he has already, 40 imps worth :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: 16 bd sets|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: x3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 sets|pg||
nt|nerio24: good bidding|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: South seems to be getting the diamonds into the game, but it is alwyas hard to diagnose opposing doubletons|pg||
nt|petergill: Had South pased the Double, EW would have been in serious trouble|pg||
nt|panja: W's problem must have been to judge whether 5@H was stiff or @HK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: test|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: 3@C has to be max without a Major|pg||
nt|ciaran: the bad diamond break dooms 3N here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 5 tricks will be good going.  May try @sA and @d finesse playing W for @dHx or HHx|pg||
nt|petergill: East has only 3 tricks and no more, so the vulnerable Double without any suit texture is very risky|pg||
nt|panja: in case of @HK what were the chances that two Aces were missing?|pg||
nt|xenya: well it was not clear to E that W had such good @Ds and @Ss|pg||
nt|panja: on the other hand, after hearing 5@D and looking at @H stiff and two black Aces...W might have crossed 5@S either by bidding 6@C or 6@S...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: just forget the play and write down the score|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: flat board it seems|pg||
nt|nerio24: should be -1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is the best way to play the @H suit ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low towards the jack|pg||
nt|vicky888: play a low heart to jack, |pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: connection lost....claiming at the end.....bid is correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: score updated|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west will be happy with this lead|pg||
nt|loganrun: NS judged this well of sorts|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I am informed I am wrong |pg||
nt|eamongall: about the team|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon was taking insurance with 4@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: First imps to NI|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: over the last few hands NS have played very well it seems...|pg||
nt|andyv:  they certainly have made good decisions|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and have bid this well|pg||
nt|andyv:  Board 10 not returning a @s is about the only play that I can be critical on|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H was quite pushy|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is but it works... hard to argue with success... I do it all the time and haven't found anyone to listen:)|pg||
nt|athene: well, it works if he makes this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is there that much to the play?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way it can't make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west coming to the same conclusion I think...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only one loser if East has Honour10|pg||
nt|panja: rather..W could have..|pg||
nt|ady: north will know south is short in diamonds  therefore should settle for game in to-trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: and in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would have thuoght club was even more obvious in the other room where West had bid spades and not been supported|pg||
nt|dslee: would be some IMP for Formidables |pg||
nt|po-s: still some time until the lady has sung|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: can play east for Q10 or K10 dblton   or either hand for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: same contract  aalso by North make in CR|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|james_h: How date he lost us IMPs|pg||
nt|james_h: dare|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS LOOKS FLAT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|kdr_fm: up to 6 now|pg||
nt|nerio24: Alok who was east was having a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if NS are playing a strong @c system, 3@h is still an overbid when no fit has been found|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|james_h: Tom used to be better at insurance|pg||
nt|panja: so only 4 more boards to cover 28 IMPs?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: true - maybe she is on a diet|pg||
nt|dslee: these are two of the top 5 teams from India - Formidables represented india in BB|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: 3@H is quite a good bid, as it acts as a system-tester. Do EW have the capability to stop in 3@S if that is the limit of the hand, or do they have to bid to 4@S and go off  |pg||
nt|james_h: (his former career)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes my question is in the second round do you play for !KQ or H10 ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: But then he got a better offer!|pg||
nt|loganrun: I presume that 2NT by North was a long minor - South hoped he had 4 tricks |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|roswolf: 5 anyway|pg||
nt|ady: does not need the 3-3 club break for 12 tricks  with K10 hearts doubleton has 3 heart tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ciaran: can test diamonds, then play on H and end up taking a S finesse for a 9th trick, but you're then 2 off|pg||
nt|panja: y5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|eamongall: I am wrong ... I just thought as no sign of Greenwood Anderson on this team ..it had to be the 2nd team |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Time to thank our wonderful operator in Delhi|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: H10|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: And another 13 imps to DSM who are doing rather well|pg||
nt|ady: yes      thx|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|loganrun: As a spec pointed out 2NT is Leb - which on the auction is a long minor|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: It's very spectacular to pin the 10|pg||
nt|xenya: why Roland?|pg||
nt|xenya: ah |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: YES RESTICTED CHOICE I SUPPOSE|pg||
nt|vicky888: i doubt with strong club system if 1nt should be there|pg||
mc|13|nt|ady: in fact can make 13 tricks as  they lay|pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: EW having short discussion|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: how ?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
nt|ady: I think KQ doubleton either hand better   though low towards jack can gain if east has stiff 10 and you guess well|pg||
nt|xenya: if you go by the restricted choice, you should play for KQ it seems|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and to the organisers and to Roland and BBO for bringing us this broadcast|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks to all for watching and the great commentary...|pg||

nt|petergill: At the other table, Badal Das passed throughout on the East cards, making the match securely won for his team|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 imps for Dhampur on board 9 as 3N was found in CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el - is the link for scores|pg||
nt|loganrun: 5C is making according to a spec - but we see all 4 hands - went off in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: last board for this round and the tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: some players yawning|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: thanks, Christine|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you Sunil, and our excellent operator who has done a great job|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they made up for 8 :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: seems 4@H   should make with both black kings well placed  even with bad heart split|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 more to play this session, NS needs to get a few imps now to achieve a positive attitude for the last 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: DSM on the way to a huge victory|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting auction in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east thought that 2@D was majors|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C 16+ or bal 11-15|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 @s + 2 @d + 1 @h + 1 @c - where is the 7th? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H is a decent contract here but killed with the 5-0 break|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to our good operator Ruzbeh, to Frank Budai for comments, and to the Indian bridge organisers in New Delhi for making this broadcast possible|pg||
nt|vbman: this will be exiciting|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't thing 1N all that common on 5422|pg||
nt|dslee: some EW actions here|pg||
nt|loganrun: Thank you for all your comments - I can not answer them all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: dbl|pg||
nt|vicky888: has to be|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some pairs play 1minor (1nt) 2minor = both majors|pg||
nt|ciaran: Could be more IMPS for NIBU here - E's 10 count was worth a game bid opposite a 14-16 NT, but they may stay lower here due to playing a different range|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks good for 20-22|pg||
nt|nerio24: wow|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes Raja had been royally good :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some players would respond 4@D with the East hand - 5-5Majors, no slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: SF at 9:30 am IST|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision-style|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h seems middle of the road... you can bid 4@h and opps will always bid 4@s or you can pass and hope to buy the hand later.|pg||
nt|roswolf: should reach 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks to all the commentators for their words of wisdom|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks to roland wald and the bbo team|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: There was none - but it is scored as making|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice gadget|pg||

nt|vugraphzdz: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kdr_fm: schance here 6@c is on|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: It did make defensive error|pg||
nt|frankaus: TU Peter fine operating Ruzbeh|pg||
nt|vbman: he wont sell out|pg||
nt|panja: or 3N..|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for scores|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will they get to spades now?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eamongall: I must say ...the camrose2010 website even tells you where to buy fish and chips ...as well as all the useful bridge information |pg||
nt|eamongall: Designed by Mr Officer ..hurray for him |pg||
nt|mcarroll: In Open E backed in with 3@C after much the same auction and plays there|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: got away|pg||
nt|vicky888: tripathi lost the opportunity to gain 9 IMPs and settled for 3 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks all....esp. the commentators and BBO team|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: North never seems to overcall normally |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: ignore my last comment --it's the other way round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Means doing without Texas transfers, but here it gets the lead to the right hand|pg||
nt|petergill: North might raise this to 6@S|pg||
nt|po-s: I´m afraid I would have|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: wow, that's an unusual lead choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This auction will inevitably make the weaker hand declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  they own the @s suit...no choice with that vul|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why pass has a lot of merit|pg||
nt|xenya: re that slam hand -- perhpas E could have cuebid 4@H directly over 4@C -- he shouldn't be ashamed of his hand i think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: sorry QF 3/3 tom. 9:30 IST not SF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East bid 4@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@S looks to make 6@S 5@C +@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@H cold|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petepunt: 6@C tough to bid|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: returned a heart didnt cash @CJ ?|pg||
nt|dslee: laltu showed discipline :) most will take it to 3 :) with the @C and the @H stopper, guess laltu is scared of kushari :) seen how Kushari blasts him when he does some of these :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know the suit lacks lead potential but nothing would stop me bidding 1@S |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: K10xx rather than KQxx|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes, might miss a good game if u pass|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or even a slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It makes little sense to me to enter the auction at the 4-level|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Acceptable with a different type of suit, but A109xxx is rather asking for trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: North is probably trying to salvage something from a bad session|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Better at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he knows the majors are breaking badly... so why i wonder|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think East will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: E in think mode|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will cost a million and a half on the mandatory trump lead|pg||
nt|vicky888: difficult for N to judge tht|pg||
nt|vbman: this 8 carder is a computer dealt hand|pg||
nt|vbman: in such hands the dealer doesnt let u out in the cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational?|pg||
nt|roswolf: very good result for formidables in the other room|pg||
nt|panja: y..either game should make..|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, strange EW sold out there|pg||
nt|panja: for Nt..E would like his cards..the lower honours especially|pg||
nt|panja: for 4@S..there might be 4 fast losers..as far as E's picture goes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup maybe considering choice of strain|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks to all the viewers|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Results at http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vbman: especially if the opps have a fit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ciaran: should make 9 tricke for 5 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wrong again :)|pg||
nt|dslee: 1@H pass by Kushari would had been interesting :) as one of the specs pointed out, surely laltu would Neg x|pg||
nt|roswolf: also e/w know they having a good set|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is mighty close here needs a club lead to break game |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wrongly or nor would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|loganrun: West knows what East has - but East is very good for his bid - West is fortunate but still has to make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Not sure where East got a slam invite from|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the 4@D bid tells East that bad breaks are posssible and his ptrs @D points are probably wasted|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But I think he will escape the double and so not lose much|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so the salvage operation worked like a dream|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: He is about @SK short of an slam invite imo|pg||
nt|panja: the problem with this hand is the deceptive 1@C opening...|pg||
nt|panja: it kind of suggests to W that there would be wasted values in Clubs in the E hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: North's case for 6@S is that parner must have many spades to bid "5 over 5" in front of partner, and the kings figure to be onside in opener's hand|pg||
nt|po-s: if West had the DJ instead of the one in clubs....|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, I guess they wont risk anything now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: would have been a dream had 4@H made in the other room  IE|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this will gain a few more imps|pg||
nt|ady: east expecting further bidding    may get the value of a non vul gamed  in this contract|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: If West's double is penalty showing values in diamonds he cannot have the right cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: i should have thought the @DK lead is far less likely to give away a trick|pg||
nt|athene: you know the @DA is almost certainly over you|pg||
nt|athene: but club lead could have found declarer with the queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of spot cards in the @d suit makes it almost even odds with a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: or even something like Jxx with declarer, AQx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the pips in diamonds are poor so I go with Easts lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ciaran: Good try from Micheal - hoping partner has @HKx |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 8 i guess with everyone bidding close vul games these days, defenders shd also be trigger happy on the double button when the trumps break badly|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get out of his own way... has to cash Ace of @s|pg||
nt|dslee: very honestly, I would bid 3 :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|james_h: and struck gold|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||
nt|james_h: another example of fortune favouring the bold|pg||
nt|petergill: Part of the case for North to pass 5@S is that if 5@s scores 680 it might be a pick-up anyway against 200 or 500 at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: 650 is still secure|pg||
nt|petergill: South could claim 650 if he wants to|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done to R L Kejriwal team, who join Formidables and two other teams in the 48 board semi finals|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: don't think East ruffed that @CK |pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an inspired defence?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sunsamvar: This is a great hand for the 1nt opener to be showing a 5-5 in majors and getting his ptr to declare 4 of a major|pg||
nt|po-s: risking is staying out of games as well|pg||
nt|xenya: true Panja, yet staying out of game on game-going values seems too cautious, particularly considering the state of the match|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|panja: now, @D to A..and a @H finesse perhaps..|pg||
nt|panja: or a @C ruff and @H finesse..if xruff is to be embarked upon, best to cash whatever on could in @H|pg||
nt|loganrun: These misfit hands rarely play well|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: A @d back --> ruff, trump king, club ruff high, draw trumps |pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
nt|petergill: The top two teams in this event qualify to represent India in the Commonwealth Games Bridge Championship in New Delhi in October|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia is sending their Open and Women's teams to the Oct 25-31 Commonwealth Games bridge in Delhi - if your country is interested and eligible to send a team, let someone in ...|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Have they played a lot of boards? I sympathise|pg||
nt|dslee: but now, debabrata might end up making 3|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  now going down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: playing for 12 hours now i think|pg||
nt|vicky888: on the brd of 4@c NS earned 6 IMPs as it went 1 down in OR|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|garnetts: this is now the thrid time North has acted unilaterally without consulting partner in an auction--cost each time |pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: E said he nearly made a game try|pg||
nt|vicky888: CR*|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bit of a tide towards Dhampur|pg||
nt|dslee: sry kushari|pg||
nt|roswolf: a quieter board|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be the clinching board all n/s have to do is avoid bidding the 2-ace slam|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, this should seal the match|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: normal to reach 3nt here and go down|pg||
nt|dslee: EW partial more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW intervention in the other room kept NS safe|pg||
nt|ciaran: Did well not to|pg||
nt|dslee: x|pg||
nt|panja: interesting bidding in the other room...|pg||
nt|panja: they will bid this 6@D.....I guess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dslee: from sunit|pg||
nt|dslee: ok, he dint :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  at first look, no game for NS on this hand|pg||
nt|vbman: 3 nt makes?|pg||
nt|vicky888: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy?|pg||
nt|loganrun: This seems a straightforward 3NT by North - but it is sometimes foolish to predict|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1H - shows spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: x = raise to 2S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure of the wisdom of these canape overcalls |pg||
nt|chick: makes the second bid much easier in competition|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: sure, if partner expects a canape |pg||
nt|ciaran: A much longer auction in the other room to reach the same contract|pg||
nt|vbman: no at hand i think|pg||
nt|panja: two cue bids by North...and then ace ask by S, still the 6@H bid hoping the KC out was @HK..and that it was inside|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petepunt: 4 likely now|pg||
nt|ady: 6 of either minor for e/w    clubs safer|pg||
mb|3C|nt|james_h: There is too much sex going on up north these days, they should focus their minds on bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not easy to reach|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: but it could confuse the suit lengths|pg||
nt|chick: doesn't usually matter with 6-5 ... pard will have one of the two suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  N also opened 1@d in OR... made it easier for E to bid|pg||
nt|po-s: now?|pg||
nt|panja: now all that S needs to do is to check on Aces...|pg||
nt|panja: if aggressive, he will and stop in 5@H..if passive...we might see a 4@H bid here itself|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@c was ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: DD only 8|pg||
nt|vbman: you see h ak in east|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: mini - splinter|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after that W has 3 useful points, not 7|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: very surprised they not in 4 then every card in the west hand is full value - surely worth a 3@d game try ..|pg||
nt|vbman: wow|pg||
nt|vicky888: well lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow great lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, @c or @s lead look right from E point of view|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but N can duck|pg||
nt|vbman: and pray for opps to cash hearts for rectification|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|po-s: diamond is no good|pg||
nt|roswolf: well loudly quiet!?:)|pg||
nt|panja: this is an anti-sci session...so I thought..|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dslee: why did they reach this now? Going by the safe logic, this should be passed :) Important IMP for formidables I guess|pg||
nt|po-s: but def should prevail|pg||
nt|roswolf: should is the operative word|pg||
nt|dslee: :)|pg||
nt|ady: predictable to play 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: what you say is right, Mike, but in cases like this, all you really want to do is make pard pick one of your two suits|pg||
nt|eamongall: Its not that James surely ... its lack of game time against players of EBU and Team Silver level |pg||
nt|panja: you win..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: very sensible|pg||
nt|panja: oh ok..RKC will take them beyond 5@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting--should North act here?   I would bid 4@H over 3@S which was bid next door---third in hand an issue maybe |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petepunt: but @h likely 4-1 after x|pg||
nt|andyv:  no need for that|pg||
nt|xenya: well-controlled auction |pg||
nt|roswolf: and well done to dhampur SM who must surely win now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|james_h: I blame the non sectarian sex|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: it will matter if partner is 2-2 in your suits, but that probably can't be the case here |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 losers so 6 imps to the trailing team|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kdr_fm: super swicth from S|pg||
nt|panja: sorry I missread the last line of bidding in CR..it was a 5@S response to RKC there|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: -3 now|pg||

mc|12|nt|andyv:  yep|pg||

nt|james_h: That's been the trouble with the north...it's all sects and violence...|pg||
nt|athene: but even if west covered the @CJ from @CH9x that wouldn't be enough|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wrong|pg||
nt|ciaran: 4H look a good contract here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nice trump coup|pg||
nt|andyv:  but not ducking 1st @s seems anti bridge|pg||
nt|vbman: thats true|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx all Im will disappear to a touney in a mo|pg||
nt|po-s: really?|pg||
nt|dslee: think|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C can go down here...if W ducks two trumps and the Declarer misguesses Clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: W / S taking a water break|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: play resumes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: knowing being well behind in the match I would've dbld here also|pg||
nt|garnetts: What does double of 4@S show?   It may be best on balance to say you have a borderline 5@H bid --leaving 5@H as a value bid |pg||
nt|ady: Himani may have ventured further   it only really need east to have 5 diamonds headed by king to make a slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|james_h: However, I love traveling up there these days|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes you are just in a bad contract, Bill;)|pg||
nt|vbman: he thinks opps are going to run hearts once they have achance|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: well, you were certainly proved right on that one :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|chick: same situation here again :)|pg||
nt|athene: it happens :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now will e/w get carried away on this one|pg||

nt|dslee: 3NT again?|pg||
nt|vicky888: looks like EW will play in partgame of Heart|pg||
nt|mmmakela: just about right,|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mcarroll: 13 not so dull in Open, Carvey have a chance to make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Gary.. have fun and gl!|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@C-3NT now ros?|pg||
nt|panja: best to play the hand in 1Nt, not in some Clubs|pg||
nt|nerio24: though 4 makes as the cards are|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I've got lots of Mrs R. references which I'll not be repeating|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why 2@D when he know they have @S? 2@H a good lift|pg||
nt|ciaran: ..or at least making - we should find out shortly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: My turn for tempting fate, NS will bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|vbman: by gary|pg||

nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like mulder berg|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: what does the word " recidivist " mean ...I need to understand a spec comment |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Backsliding - repeat offender|pg||
nt|andyv:  N really wants to get in this one?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wrong again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|loganrun: Unfortunately you must reopen with a double and this is tight but all is well|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: last board for this round...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks to all|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 is ok in many occasions even if promises 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I'm surprised that W hasn't shown the spades yet|pg||
nt|james_h: Etymology: French récidiviste, from récidiver to relapse, from Middle French, from Medieval Latin recidivare, from Latin recidivus recurring, from recidere to fall back, from re- + ...|pg||
nt|james_h: cadere to fall |pg||
nt|eamongall: sorry I asked ...back to bridge |pg||
nt|garnetts: we agree then-|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: back later if there is more|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eamongall: a @H 2@S s ...oops theres one gone |pg||
nt|james_h: McGann stuck for a lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  W could have a bit of a better hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  4@s or 3N will both make easily|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|james_h: I might have tried a trump|pg||
nt|james_h: cos I see call da cards :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: well all pass is possible i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: 4@H is close to 50%, at this vul..a good bet|pg||

nt|andyv:  yuck|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not now|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  need to get to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: As Usual, Hanlon McGann are not shy about bidding vulnerable games |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Welcome to the Camrose series from Edinburgh - Ist session of NIBU v Ireland|pg||

nt|vbman: and lose spades forever?|pg||
nt|andyv:  those spades can afford to be lost|pg||
nt|vbman: despite 2 aces l dont think s hand is defence oriented|pg||
nt|ady: 2H opening must be conventional   maybe 3 suiter ?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzdz: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||

nt|panja: both Majors perhaps...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nerio24: 6S could make on the previous hand....then it won't be so bad!|pg||
nt|dslee: I think none of the players needs any introduction, Rajeev and Himani am sure is going to play a strong game to pull up the deficit|pg||

nt|andyv:  S would like N to not dbl|pg||
nt|vbman: most dont balance with dbl in such hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't on this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  puts too much pressure on partner|pg||
nt|vbman: but the vuln and side strenth|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the 3nt punt|pg||

nt|dslee: no way - pass now|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzgh: That is how it was explained to South|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm sensible|pg||
nt|po-s: 3S might make unless def establish a heart|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT advance sac to stop the majors i expect|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|dslee: Had this been white, laltu would had x to show his majors|pg||
nt|dslee: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@C inverted?|pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: Hi |pg||
nt|james_h: This is a battle between a 2 wal club NS and a 1 way club EW|pg||
nt|james_h: way|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW are playing precision, dbl of 2S should have shown max for the bidding but hardly inviting E to keep bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a good Pass fro W|pg||
nt|andyv:  who invited W?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S better pull!|pg||
nt|panja: thx Vlad, all|pg||

nt|dslee: but I guess, here too, he should show that he has a 9 card major holding|pg||
nt|vicky888: 4 down?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, if East leads back a heart....question is, could the lead be from KJ10|pg||

pc|s3|nt|andyv:  exciting hand... somehow the feeling is N could have done better|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vbman: he hadto bid a game somewhere and let partner try to make it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|loganrun: East - imho opinion has made the bid on his second chance rather than his first (1NT)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|vicky888: much of give and take of IMPs does really happen during bidding... its like plz take some IMPs!! No, No... i dont need that many IMPs, lets settle for fewer... kidding :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  as usually, in CR we started with 2 last boards|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Second borderline 4@S in a row for Hanlon Mcgann - just the type of situation in which they thrive|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like -1|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|athene: maybe that wasn't available for him|pg||
nt|panja: two down now..|pg||
nt|panja: it is better to play in the long suit of the weaker hand..as this hand demonstrates|pg||
nt|po-s: strange way of playing - seems to never provide more than 7 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: nice trump switch by E -- N still could make it but took a wrong line|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||
