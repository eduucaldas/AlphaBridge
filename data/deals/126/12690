nt|xenya: expect it to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  3rd hand vul against not is a rarer place to open light|pg||
nt|rodal f: My we invite Lasse Aaseng to help commenting.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Lasse|pg||
nt|lasseaa: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S in OR amazing|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: funny result here from open|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|varange: who can help us out with the systems they play?|pg||
nt|po-s: Hej alla norrmän - East i closed må vare meget duktig|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Let's see if E/W will find 4@h here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, perhaps not ha-ha funny, but strange funny|pg||
nt|paulg:  i saw this next door and brogeland seemed to ask his partner to transfer to game ... and then gave him the option of playing it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzec: hi Lasse!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: interesting- this hand might produce a big swing and will!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|baldfriede: Looks like they are on their way.|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that 2@s doesn't show support for the hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to tell if E has a good hand or not:)|pg||
nt|hantveit: velkomment tilbake|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: hi all. welcome back. Final Half now!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: 3@C was a new one for me can Lars exsplain it for specs + me?:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|keylime:  At the other table, North began with an aggressive 3@c, and South was able to direct the spade lead for down 1.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|baldfriede: 3nt is of course an alternative.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: asking for @S check|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This should make with a few overtricks.|pg||
nt|varange: what to lead? Spade is unattractive.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C+1@H+2@D=top 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will cost blood, sweat and tears|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4@h will be easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: and having no entries, it is probably a good idea trying to find partner's long suit outside of spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: overtricks to follow-very friendly lay out of cards|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec tell 4-4-4-1 but is it always a single major. Y|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So slam lost by there system|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: an option here by north would be to bid 3nt directly over 2clubs|pg||
nt|hantveit: East might try to lead a low spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: The score is wrong! Should be 39-17 to hordaland|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janhamhurg: about 2 off so 600 swing possible|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|varange: what would you lead from south?|pg||
nt|lasseaa: not the system, in pratice, same bidding in the other room|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Closer to 3 off, maybe more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree so 500+300makes 13|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 4, if W continues trumps |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3clubs is not an exciting contract, will be over quickly|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|keylime:  I'm from the classic school of preeempts, especially in 2nd seat.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: even in a context of strong club, the north opening bid seems a bid light|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and in a natural system its def to light|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: just my opinion though|pg||
