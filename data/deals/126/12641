mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||

nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|joest: would the panel open east's hand with 1@c or 1NT?|pg||
nt|larrymori: 1@c aces and spaces better played from the other side|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|joest: and if partner responds, say, 1@h you rebid what?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@C -- also four aces so much more valuable -- this hand evaluates to 18.3 on kaplan/rubens: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=a96+at+a4+a97632|pg||
nt|joest: well we know that double isnot a support double|pg||

mb|p|nt|larrymori: suppport x |pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: actually an adjunct of support double is that it occasionally shows a strong hand w/o direction|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|joest: one of the great features of support doubles is to be able to raise, then bid again to show extras|pg||
nt|larrymori: rebid is tough but gives the chance to get to the only cold game|pg||
nt|joest: this auction has worked out very well for east|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you feel that support doubles are mandatory with three trumps?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: no|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcwla: Still it will be 7 more for winning the auction and making at both tables.|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you don't make a support double partner with five spades and four clubs and a good hand will bid 5clubs when they jump to 4hearts so I always make a support double|pg||
nt|joest: hard to see selling to 2@h as east, particularly after partner has shown a sign of life|pg||

pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||
nt|peachy: 9 count and support|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d3|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||

mb|4C|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||

nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: nice fit|pg||
nt|chick: at least they got into a makeable game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, might|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|peachy: theygot there anyway, at least|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: our predictions havent really fetched tonightm have they Sveta :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  u r right, Raija|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jtr: There will be a few in slam on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: may make 12 now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: but will be happy with 11|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c4|nt|jtr: seems a big play not finessing the @s and taking 11|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: east can get most of the match points if entering with A@H   cashing dimonds and finessing 10@C     |pg||
nt|peachy: then opps have more and they wont lie silent|pg||
nt|peachy: the 1pt hand was squeezed, beautiful!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but no more problem now - u r right again - overtrick|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c7|pc|h9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: sry - not qq but 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they have 18 HCP and no fit, and have already bid once|pg||
nt|peachy: even if it was pseudo|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and are vulnerable|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra2: the 130 am is Tuesday for NY |pg||
nt|larrymori: upgrade here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: quite right too - Londoners should get up twenty minutes later than Parisians|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|joest: welcome back David. Its early in London!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|larrymori: David wakes when I might still be up|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: lucky heart layout|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|larrymori: yes|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might not have -- weak trumps and @C shortness not known to be useful.  But this one - as Aretha sang in "Freeway of Love," "Don't know what you're doin', but you must be livin' ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: right."|pg||
nt|joest: would you bid 3@h or settle for 2?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|larrymori: 3 upgrade|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|joest: sort of borderline i think|pg||
nt|dburn: these days, 2@h can be some grotty weak no trump with three hearts|pg||
nt|joest: partner has a perfecto and we need some things to go right|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: in this auction it does not work but over 1@c I like 3@h to be a 2 1/2 raise|pg||
nt|joest: just a sec.  I'm going to the dictionary to look up 'grotty' but I think I know what it means|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcwla: 2 for me - pd's whole hand could be wasted @C values.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: so when you happen (purely by accident) to have an opening bid with four hearts, you raise to 3@h|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|joest: great result for Kitty's though|pg||
nt|larrymori: with a hand that evaluates upwards but not the std 3 values|pg||
mc|10|nt|jcwla: 6 to Kitty's on 28 - they made 2@C here and 2@D with 2 overtricks in the CR.|pg||
nt|larrymori: where pard expects mroe|pg||
nt|larrymori: more|pg||
nt|joest: ok thx everybody|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all.  So long for now.|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes thx|pg||
