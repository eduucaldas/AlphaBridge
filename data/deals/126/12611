nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
nt|petergill: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: this is the 3 segment of the 3 round quarter finals|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last 12 boards of a 36 board quarter-final in New Delhi, India|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Ruzbeh|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet heart partscore to start, perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Geoffrey and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi and welcome to all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its close after the first 16|pg||
nt|roswolf: very looks like a good match|pg||
nt|roswolf: a partscore to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now we will compare the scores|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that last board may well produce a swing - as even 3@s on spot on defenc cant make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcarroll: 3@D = transfer|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi David|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: look fairly standard from what I saw last set|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like a prepared 1@D and a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 pair played multi 2@D the other normal weak 2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to my co-commentator Frank Budai|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty gary|pg||
pc|c6|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|petergill: South would balance with a Dbl if he was in the pass-out (last to speak, or balancing) position. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can well start with taking first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that this is the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark: good afternoon|pg||
nt|ady: hi     late start|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good double - wrong ace for a maximum penalty godd still going down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not yet though|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  been pushed too high    cant make 4 if diamonds attacjed early|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome to New Delhi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the 1 hour delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed.....will catch up at claiming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunit|pg||
nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead gives declarer some work to do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mind you now I look they were different pairs :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: attacked|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Hi James, Martin and specs I'm Frank from hot Norway. Just -23C now:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks to be -1 from here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Yes, the trump leads are very good defence. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: 5@C wasn't making either, but it is normal to take out insurance on hands like these|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Sinil     Liz|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H was aggressive and may have led to a game raise - south knows his customer!|pg||
mc|9|nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pg||

mb|3D|nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Peter:) and welcome|pg||
nt|petergill: The weak 3@D raise will probably buy the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Borderline whether Bhabesh should enter with 3@H or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: NS can gain some IMPs by a X but....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I would pass. If partner can't double again, it's probably not our hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: And if it is, 3@D will go down|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|petergill: India's top players are very disciplined in the bidding - hence Bhabesh's Pass. |pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||

nt|mcarroll: After 3 frantic boards - a little placidity?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the open room, N made 5@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS rather got away with that I'm afraid..|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well played to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: director has been called for settling a dispute|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: dispute resolved - scores remain the same|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 4@H    may have difficulty getting there|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence at the other table correclty led trumps, but they switched away from trumps too early. |pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a solid start for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a 4@S for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart barrage might occur|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: allowing declarer to ruff the club high |pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: this bid won't make N's day any happier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tell us about the players Sunit, please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S husband and wife as far as I recall|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: McGann dows not like passing |pg||
nt|sunit: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I could be wrong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hI liz|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Ok. I can leave so they come back:)|pg||
nt|sunit: rajeev and himani are a husband- wife pair from Mumbai|pg||
nt|ady: north take-out double has given them a chance|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes 4@H is a great contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: X or 1nt here  - 1NT 4 me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a very strong weak raise|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: S need to run |pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the obvious escapes us at the table|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2S is the last making contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 117 was 1 imp to n/s 3@D -2 in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: but bidding 2@d here is a poor IMPS bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I might have made a horrible takeout double with the South hand because of the 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C with the fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree unless playing 2/1|pg||
mb|4S|nt|james_h: Hang on a min Rodal :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit: I am not sure which Banerjee is this but must be from the railway team|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too much, four obvious losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still S there now for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: we'll give you 2 more hands|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that S in Open did not bid|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H by north conservative|pg||
nt|petergill: South is disciplined enough to stop bidding, despite 19 HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: downgrading KQ doubleton, Frank? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: solid game no dangers visible|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: east liked the hidden diamond fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this one really does require a lot of work|pg||
nt|ady: by South   sorry|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if vul they may hav pushed on to game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems a little conservative to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: trying for a club ruff seems best|pg||
pc|c2|nt|davidstern: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes this banerjee is from railways.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sunit: only way to beat this contract is after cashing both the clubs north has to play a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, this may make now|pg||
nt|sunit: difficult though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too late|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in modern bidding, strong dbl on 1N is out of date |pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes the whole hand needs to be downgraged imo|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: This will make if declarer is careful in the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Needed a heart lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: yes good try next please :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks only and no real pressure on E/W - i cant see a 9th ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes in first position, but a balancing dbl over 2@H is very much in vogue|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still may be OK if he runs a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|sunit: no can still beat|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sunit: with a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, whether South runs or not depends on your parameters for doubling 1NT   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can be endplayed to lead away from @DK|pg||
nt|sunit: why?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I suppose if the heart finesse was wrong 4@H might not make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: whereas west cards were in spades where he thought they werent|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: Me neither|pg||
nt|sunit: no he can exit a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what trump? I cash all my trumps but one|pg||
nt|sunit: no endplay here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What are you going to throw on the spades?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: Good club lead - this looks like 200 to NS|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|frankaus: with a flattish 1 count u know this is not a gr8 spot|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: Unless the defence slip|pg||
nt|davidstern: The defence have now put this at risk by forcing declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll watch your discards and endplay you|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|james_h: 1imp pick up here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: agreed, if you are certain partner cannot hold (for example) AKQJ sixth  plus an ace |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now has to ruff as @H pitched|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SAK965H8DAK52CJT5,SQ2HKJT643DJ63C96,ST87HQ97DQ7CKQ842,SJ43HA52DT984CA73|sv|n|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 4@S is easier to make than to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, it's *that* easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a positive or negative trailbid no problem. Non now eigher|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S is too much with a 6-loser hand. A trial bid would have been in order imo|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: Perhaps Sumit liked the way his honours combined well - the kings being with aces - the ten with the jack - all good features|pg||
nt|petergill: or perhaps Sumit believes that vul games at imps should be bid on the smell of an oily rag|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trials bids after 1M 2M usually show a 6-loser hand|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|petergill: This line of play is much safer than ruffing a @d in dummy, which might lose to an overruff if @D's are 5-2 or 6-1|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Chokshi did indeed venture a 3@C trial bid. Sunit was a co-commentator in the previous set|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: after lots of discussion sumits claim is accepted.|pg||
pg||

nt|rodal f: Some fun again?|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT is possible here for N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I claim that only a heart lead beats it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sumit(West) is one of the brightest young stars of Indian Bridge|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: slam time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice overtrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might generate more action|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Certainly looks like it|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, but its a routing slam Rodal :) so your on your last legs here :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: double? :)|pg||
nt|james_h: routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be a battle of the minors here|pg||
nt|sunit: i agree, roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S   excellent e/w     must avoid playing in 4-4 heart fit in the slam zone|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D, 6NT and 6@S are all interesting possible contracts on this hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: west butts in|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N=12-14?|pg||
nt|ciaran: E/W need to be careful here again - W will be thinking slam now, but E has the wrong values for him|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might regret this|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: U have counted the months?:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice @S fit|pg||
nt|sunit: Delhi, The Crown plaza hotel is the venue|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 1@C either 11-13 balanced or strong|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is a good lead it seems|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5 tricks in NT |pg||
nt|petergill: West passed his 12 count, donwngrading the singleton queen|pg||
nt|frankaus: KR values it at 17.25-  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=kq+aq96+qj8+aj75|pg||
pc|s6|nt|james_h: 2@c shows strong,without fit (in std carrot)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: west hand is a problem hand for the weak nters as you can (and they have) missed their spade fit.  With such decent @s's i'd have opened 1@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 7@S makes..|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should take some action|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankaus: on repeated trump leads this can fail|pg||
nt|ady: playing 6@S  a decent score|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C inverted minor raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, not inverted minor, 1@C must be Strong Club|pg||
pc|sT|nt|james_h: I dont believe South has shown his clubs naturally, he may have implied them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be implied now so 4@C to come?|pg||
nt|james_h: the fact the 3h is not alerted makes me think its just natural|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: looks as if they might pefewr the 4-4 fit... unfortunately|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C would be 5+ clubs, 8+ points, I think|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Late alert of 3H|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H looks like an overbid |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D and 2@S natural|pg||
nt|petergill: EW in game-forcing auction |pg||
pc|c3|nt|james_h: ok, south must have shown clubs |pg||
nt|po-s: he has shown clubs when he doesn´t rebid NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the 4@D cue does not improve the E hand so they quit in time|pg||
nt|davidstern: Combined 24 cound stopped well short |pg||
nt|sunit: can be beaten by 2 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT Pass 3@D should excite East|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  W must be happy with this lead, not @d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Hei Peo|pg||
nt|james_h: I think McG will drive this bus home now in the snow|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and a 9 card minor fit to boot as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tourney website|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  lacking the spot cards, 4th best (or low for some) is the best lead with the W cards in @ds|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer try to steal a spade to make?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: though 3n is far from easy; a tempo behind imo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: well at  least they will get a plus score     might even turn out to be a good score for e/w if in CR they get overboard in a heart slam|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D shows 4@S 3@D 5@C and thus only one @h opposite Axxx = perfect, so heading for 6@D or even (unlikely) 7@D |pg||
nt|roswolf: south is right to duck on genral principles|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice to see that Mike Lawrence has so many fans in India. They even named a club after him as you see on the scoreboard|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D sets @D as trumps, 4@S cue bid of ace or king or both|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sunsamvar: true David|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sunit: now only 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought W would pass, then bid 2@S if needed|pg||
nt|petergill: Not looking for 7@D, as West is a passed hand, and "8 trumps" is not enough for 7@D to be a good % chance|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: This bus has snow chains James?|pg||
nt|andyv:  is it stealing?|pg||
nt|athene: actually no need to steal, especially - opps don't have anything to cash|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: bingo David|pg||
nt|ady: down 1 in 6@H in CR|pg||

nt|james_h: sorry Rodal, this it too tame for me|pg||
nt|james_h: I demand more "fast lane" hands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: but this time the @S save is too expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And might even aggravate the opps into the grand|pg||

nt|po-s: and 7clubs more|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1700 might enough|pg||
nt|james_h: West is considering her options|pg||
nt|po-s: right, I counted 6 spade tricks, forgot the ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  no reason for W to fly with the Ace|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @HA there's no rush anyway|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, should have hoped for a missguess it seems..|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|davidstern: But need to get there |pg||
nt|ady: around a 20 imps swing on the heart split   mind you 6@H is not a great contract    needs decent trump split  plus spade finesse|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice 4@S for N/S if they get there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid at both tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems to be biddable|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk5: How are you going to bid a grand slam with any accuracy when opps bid spades like mad as happened in the other matches?|pg||
nt|james_h: opening 1@c with this hand when looking at the NS (terrifying animals :) ) may not be appealing|pg||
nt|po-s: is 2C clubs or strong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Very favourable layout here for E/W - @SQJ doubleton, @DQ9 onside, @C 3-3, @HJ right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a classical weak 2, but I know a lot of players who would open 2@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: By exlution blackwood EW should have a easy line til 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR somehow found and made 3@c here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand wd probably have been opened in 3rd or 1st position|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino suggests pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a doddle :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: E worth an invite with two Axxx suits opposite a 15-17 NT, |pg||

mb|2S|nt|ady: thats with A@H right |pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but unlikely as @Hq is a stand out lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: P??|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 2@C really a limited opening? I mean, after all she has a 3 loser hand. Impossible to catch up later I predict. I agree with PO|pg||
nt|james_h: Ciara(West) in crying|pg||
nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 21 points and the opps have ignored you ... and found a fit ... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good sign for finding fit with partner - N must be short in @h|pg||
nt|ady: still west can go up with the ace and switch to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game in @c looks attractive|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: only fit left is @C's  - I like A 2NT gets the values across and N is marked with a few @s's on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they dont have the theoretical points required, but maybe they will take the view that 3NT may be as likely as 2?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Will probably stop in 2N and be thankful to make|pg||
nt|xenya: courageous bid, 4@S |pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nonvulnerable game - not usually right to stretch|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even more unlikely into the aq10 :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2@S could be a 3 card raise|pg||

pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: not sure of the EW system here....2@D either a straightforward Multi (so to speak) or possibly a bad-suit weak two|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If they do play clubs East must win the first diamond - West has to duck his king...|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that Mike Lawrence has a carryover of 2 IMPs, not included on the scoreboard|pg||

nt|mcarroll: S plays 4NT in Open|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: told 2@D=5-7, 5+cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red lead brings 8th trick, what about 9th?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure about the 3@h bid seems a bit much - then again 3@s looks like a make and opposite @sHx even with the known 4+ @s with east woukd have good chances|pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: Some alerts have not been entered in this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|davidstern: Can certainly understand this auction - north unfoirtunately has a very good 2@S bid and east has a small amount of interest only|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: manageable perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: trump now S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: yes, a passive defence should do the job|pg||
pc|s2|nt|po-s: Probably there was a West face when Pass came back|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: in which case there's far less long-term future in spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: possible end play here - W is probably going to discard 3@h and now @ha and another should produce 2@d tricks|pg||

pc|d5|nt|panja: 100% in Match points|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||

nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting push board|pg||
nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nice cards NS but unfriendly split in @S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 6@S is a decent contract, but many pairs would locate @SQ and a keycard missing and thus stay out of slam|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: The Splinter promises 4+ spade support, which makes being off @SQ less of a problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only because of South's intermediates|pg||
nt|rodal f: Style by building up the CC. At team minisplinter and splinter can be useful. Not that good at match.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South had Jxxx for example, it's not a good slam|pg||
nt|petergill: If North does RKCB, he also can take into account that if it is a minor suit ace that's missing, it might run away for the defence if not cashed at Trick 1|pg||
nt|petergill: South could have less for the splinter. North has a very close decision - Pass, 4NT, or cue bid to pass control of the decision-making back to partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are we here Gurudutt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Yes sir.. Bhabesh is Thinking|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not sure what their splinter range is. It needs to be defined specifically|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 4@H take to much space for getting controll at a smallslam in my eyes|pg||
nt|petergill: @S7 is a possible opening lead. If declarer has Kxxx in dummy opposite J109xx, the thought that opening leader might have Axx but never Qxx might lead declarer to play @SK at Trick ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 1  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like to splinter with intermediate values. 9-11 or 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So I would have bid a Jacoby 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H splinter should be narrowly defined (e.g. 10-12 HCP) due to the space it consumes|pg||

nt|petergill: whereas East passed his 11 count on Bd 27 as it was 4333 and short of aces, and on Bd 26 West didn't like the bare queen in his 12 count, and could not open 1@C as it was Strong ...|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: how to keep out of 3N and can a major game be made|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wilkinsona: well a couple of missed chances for Scotland here...|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what strength 1nt is? 14 could be weak or mdeium|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphzgh: She did|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this looks a desperate try by west..|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to catch 2@C, with their trumps 3-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed |pg||
nt|vinbtech: Hobson's Choice really|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and comes to the same 9 tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: thanks Christine|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT by south not seeing all the hands seems a fair spot|pg||
nt|davidstern: Are EW playing strong club?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or has he simply avoided a reverse rebid|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y precision i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S is the best shot and defence need to be accurate i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  with 19hcp, S is not going away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trivial 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Standard, EW play Strong Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Open Room must have crashed, so we are not getting comparisons, but they bid and made 4@S on this board|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2H is a good result for N/S since it looks like E/W will make 2S, though it might be hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S asking for a @S stop|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  who will play this board will be disappointed heavily - all possible honours are off side|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the balance      5-3 fit in hearts   but part score only|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  including 4-0 @d break|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: On the spade lead S will be very happy until trick 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: but e/w fall into the trap|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should have down valued J@C and opened 1N imo|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|athene: 2@S is the best they can do at this point i guess|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS lead by 20 imps before this set|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: but hope for declarer!?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ciaran: 2C from N forces 2D from S, and 2H is then to play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: again they decide not to push for the nonvul game|pg||
nt|ady: nice stop by e/w   via leb 2NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D to Q |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: missing pass over 3@S by North |pg||

nt|athene: but they can't get there|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can't move|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: east should have bid 2@D then redoubled that, to show 44 majors|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 4H should prevail |pg||
nt|ady: should be down now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a lead teaser he now has 8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: running to 2@H like this sounds like 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: e thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: As South denied 4 spades (else South would rebid 1@S), 2@S is a safe rebid, cannot be raised to 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ciaran: May not have been E thinking - they are playing with screens|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  the Italian teams of the 60s made a fortune by not opening 1N with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: alternatively east could redouble|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wanted to declare himself - didn't want the lead coming through all his tenaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: There was some ask for clarification of NS auction|pg||
nt|ciaran: Brave double from Hamilton should pick up 6 IMPs|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ciaran: Thanks Christine|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: They have yo write it down so slower than |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vinbtech: w/ E showing minors and 2H, the S9 should provide the 10th trick|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he'll be smiling|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will lead 4th highest next time!?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: now a sneaky @S6 |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: The cold is affecting me!|pg||
nt|athene: but EW could still organise it so that they scramble to 2@S by east|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: for example let's say east bids 2@D then redoubles|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|athene: and now west wants to play 2@S but from the other side|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: What about conceding two diamonds and claim?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spades are irrelevant|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: sso *he* bids 2@H and then redoubles that!|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y thats right|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|ady: cant really see how to make  going up with A@C  does not solve anything either|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is on, but is not a great contract, needs no @H ruff, clubs to break and (if played by South) @SK onside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hope so!  worked for Chas Goren, usually right for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
mc|9|nt|andyv:  I don't know if EW have that sophisticated of a partnership|pg||
nt|athene: this also has the advantage that partner has to suffer :) and you can go off and find a danish pastry and coffee  vendor|pg||

nt|petergill: After this 36 board quarter-final, the semi-finals are 48 boards and the grand final 64 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: so you would open 1@S, Frank?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's a more solid-looking weak two |pg||
nt|frankaus: good W2@H|pg||
nt|chick: probably a good weak 2, as opposed to bidding a multi-like 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to set 6@h which is practically cold and find out it's a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difference of style; in the other room South opened 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 20 declarer went down in 4@S in the other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|james_h: tactical 1@s ... prefering to opening 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s relay to 3N?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6 clubs from south looks ok now|pg||
nt|andyv:  good 6@c hand here|pg||
nt|athene: many people play it forces 3nt so that north can then show a minor 1 or 2-suiter|pg||

mb|1H|nt|xenya: unusual|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: cant fault east's pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, an opening 2@d says that you haven't got an opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I play it that way|pg||
nt|athene: it looks here as though it's clubs, though|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lucky 12 tricks here with @C breaking and both diamonds onside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: time fo0r a @D part score|pg||
nt|roswolf: or game if they start to shoot!?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mcarroll: In the open Room, EW bid and made 2@S|pg||
nt|eamongall: Oops I slept in |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Eamon|pg||
nt|andyv:  but NS may play it strictly as a @c xfer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Minimum for the strong type|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes - either minor suit slam works but probably not biddable|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But they seem to be edging towards it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North trying to show a really good diamond raise - cannot have spades|pg||
nt|petergill: I would pass, like Kachchu|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: lost connection.....back on track|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead would solve declarer's club guess |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mcarroll: @H lead knocks this|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: E digging a deeper hole|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Hi Eamon, did the snow eat your internet?|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like I missed some imps ..boards 1 3 4 ... but its ok ..there is still 25 boards in this match so maybe another 100 imps to be shared |pg||
nt|andyv:  or MSS and S's 6@c was p/c|pg||
nt|andyv:  either way, good contract|pg||
nt|ciaran: I'm giving up on predictions :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unfortunate - by north unlikely E would find a @h lead ... may well lead to a swing if open room N playing str NT  1NT - 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|athene: of course 6nt has the same twelve tricks but declarer in 3nt wasn't risking the spade to the king|pg||
nt|ciaran: Was an agressive jump to 5D|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like a very lucky pickup for CBAI|pg||
nt|mcarroll: impressive though|pg||
nt|xenya: i would respond 1@S as N and rebid @Hs as S even facing N's pass|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@H has a couple of flaws|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: chance for Glyco;s to make up by bidding the vul game here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Glycols|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another very thin game - slim chance for Glycols to gain a few imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the overcall worked this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to play for that @c layout though|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  and 5@h coming next? really cruel board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you are going to pre-empt, I like 3@H better than 2 at these colours|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes with the @D fin on 9 tricks roll in|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I think we won't see any more imps in this match ... rooms not joined it appears |pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|ciaran: Tight 3N for N/S here.  Looks like an accident for NIBU in the other room - playing in 5HX|pg||

mb|1S|nt|eamongall: Carrot Club here .. .weak or strong |pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4-6 is not a two-suiter in my view|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's the multi again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a perfect 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Particularly not with a rotten 4-card suit and a great 6-carder|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: esp when the 6 carder is strong and the 4 carder weak|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what was 2@S ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Preference|pg||
mb|3C|nt|nerio24: preference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H showed both majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: right|pg||
nt|ady: hi all     sorry a little late|pg||
nt|petergill: Some of the top Italians have abandoned 3@C and 3@D weak jump overcalls, and would overcall 3@C on these East cards to show 6 clubs and 4 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I would|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: pick a slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello David|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tournry website and gives the results of the swiss league and the 8 qualifiers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Both Souths pass 1@H - I think it is right to raise with 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes the Carvey preemptive tactics pushed them too far|pg||
nt|ady: ok    thx|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||

nt|andyv:  N could have had a great result by passing 2@h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nerio24: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Playing a strong club your hand cannot be very strong|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but hard for south to envision game after his ptr has passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should go -1 i think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|james_h: I dont like 1@s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|james_h: inviting trouble|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S by E in Open|pg||
nt|james_h: Ok, I MUST like it now :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well, 4S makes, so -800 not a disaster against the -790 for 4SX|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't think he can|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't either... but with that vul and S not making any game try, pass may not be so bad|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar to last hand in a way|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: so a push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - but when he has 9 red cards....|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 3@d |pg||
pc|dA|nt|kdr_fm: cold on a dummy reversal type play @SAK and another then play for @C 3/2 AK and finally Q with @s set up|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: -150 may be a great score for N/S|pg||
nt|petergill: Only 4 boards to go in the match, with NS leading by 25 imps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: N/S were clearly on different wavelengths about the second double|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, as with 3@C if it makes the so did 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not sure what W hoped to get with the dbl... only suit he can really support is @c (and possibly @hs) while 2N seems just too obvious.|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: no safety plays in the trump suit needed here|pg||

nt|roswolf: does south need to overtake?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  this helps|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is unbelievably lucky. You need spades to be 6-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: trouble is, to some extent they have had a few and not taken advantage..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries in the closed room as West led a heart|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: i think they will land up in 5@C|pg||
nt|xenya: or some blockage in the suit if 5-4|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was not reached on board 8 in CR...1 imps to Dhampur|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Yes, not a swing hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: we are not glamorous enough?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ciaran: Looks like 6S has play - only a diamond from E puts it under pressure. Even then, can make I think|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another doomed marginal slam|pg||
nt|eamongall: I just came over from OPen to see this board |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like 4@d, 2@h, 2@c + 1@s|pg||

nt|dslee: Hi from India :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: 5@C is a great contract   but with K@H with west might fail unless he leads a heart|pg||

pc|d9|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: well 5@C is a far better contract requiring only the @Hk with the opener|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: not me, cansino points or no, N has nothing to justify an opening in my book|pg||
nt|james_h: almost a slam here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like with the odds, just needs the last trump in dummy to score, ie 3-2 break|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The consensus here seems to agree |pg||

nt|andyv:  may win a couple of imps here (NS)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Who promised us that bridge is fair?|pg||

nt|eamongall: Murchan is lucky he is not in a slam ....opening with that kind of "put in your own word" |pg||

nt|eamongall: ok back to the other room ...my vote is down 1 by Padraig O Brien |pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: Bidding as correcter|pg||
nt|ciaran: My predictions have been wrong so far, but I back Padraig to make this.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, a spade lead gets @CK into play|pg||

nt|eamongall: I believe this is the Northern Ireland 2 team ...made up from finishers 4 5 and 6 in their trials |pg||
nt|andyv:  well, that was one break:)|pg||
nt|athene: there were a lot of indications available to north there|pg||
nt|athene: his partner ruffed with the @DQ so probably hasn't got another trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well done - and your predictions are back on track Ciaran|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if he found lead from AJx i'd be stunned|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 34: 11 easy tricks in 3NT, the play at the end might not have been exactly as recorded|pg||
nt|roswolf: some action here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chick: well he did get his clubs, right after the opps got 6 tricks :)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: how will East go about this one?|pg||

nt|vicky888: unlucky EWs at other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as many as +470 would have brung|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction should die quickly|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  I agree Bill... I don't think @s return was that hard to find but N didn't want to lead away from K@s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eamongall: BBO players teabag1 and The Bishop ... make up the team (Mike Coffey and John Lavery ) |pg||

nt|ady: or cam make 5@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so DSM LOOK AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS q/f|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl is dangerous at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vicky888: too weak for tht jump??|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess 3@h is not GF|pg||
nt|andyv:  W likes that bid|pg||

nt|po-s: how many boards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that looks suspiciously forcing |pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: South seems to be getting the diamonds into the game, but it is alwyas hard to diagnose opposing doubletons|pg||
nt|petergill: Had South pased the Double, EW would have been in serious trouble|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: 3@C has to be max without a Major|pg||
nt|ciaran: the bad diamond break dooms 3N here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 5 tricks will be good going.  May try @sA and @d finesse playing W for @dHx or HHx|pg||
nt|petergill: East has only 3 tricks and no more, so the vulnerable Double without any suit texture is very risky|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vicky888: flat board it seems|pg||
nt|nerio24: should be -1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is the best way to play the @H suit ?|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: over the last few hands NS have played very well it seems...|pg||
nt|andyv:  they certainly have made good decisions|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and have bid this well|pg||
nt|andyv:  Board 10 not returning a @s is about the only play that I can be critical on|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H was quite pushy|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is but it works... hard to argue with success... I do it all the time and haven't found anyone to listen:)|pg||
nt|athene: well, it works if he makes this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is there that much to the play?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way it can't make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west coming to the same conclusion I think...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only one loser if East has Honour10|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sunsamvar: and in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would have thuoght club was even more obvious in the other room where West had bid spades and not been supported|pg||
nt|dslee: would be some IMP for Formidables |pg||
nt|po-s: still some time until the lady has sung|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: up to 6 now|pg||
nt|nerio24: Alok who was east was having a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if NS are playing a strong @c system, 3@h is still an overbid when no fit has been found|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|james_h: Tom used to be better at insurance|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: true - maybe she is on a diet|pg||
nt|dslee: these are two of the top 5 teams from India - Formidables represented india in BB|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: 3@H is quite a good bid, as it acts as a system-tester. Do EW have the capability to stop in 3@S if that is the limit of the hand, or do they have to bid to 4@S and go off  |pg||
nt|james_h: (his former career)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sunsamvar: yes my question is in the second round do you play for !KQ or H10 ?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: But then he got a better offer!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d6|nt|ciaran: can test diamonds, then play on H and end up taking a S finesse for a 9th trick, but you're then 2 off|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eamongall: I am wrong ... I just thought as no sign of Greenwood Anderson on this team ..it had to be the 2nd team |pg||

nt|nerio24: wow|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes Raja had been royally good :)|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|athene: wow, that's an unusual lead choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: returned a heart didnt cash @CJ ?|pg||
nt|dslee: laltu showed discipline :) most will take it to 3 :) with the @C and the @H stopper, guess laltu is scared of kushari :) seen how Kushari blasts him when he does some of these :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: K10xx rather than KQxx|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It makes little sense to me to enter the auction at the 4-level|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Acceptable with a different type of suit, but A109xxx is rather asking for trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: North is probably trying to salvage something from a bad session|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Better at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he knows the majors are breaking badly... so why i wonder|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think East will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: E in think mode|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will cost a million and a half on the mandatory trump lead|pg||
nt|vicky888: difficult for N to judge tht|pg||
nt|vbman: this 8 carder is a computer dealt hand|pg||
nt|vbman: in such hands the dealer doesnt let u out in the cold|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: Results at http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vbman: especially if the opps have a fit|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ciaran: should make 9 tricke for 5 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wrong again :)|pg||
nt|dslee: 1@H pass by Kushari would had been interesting :) as one of the specs pointed out, surely laltu would Neg x|pg||
nt|roswolf: also e/w know they having a good set|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Not sure where East got a slam invite from|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the 4@D bid tells East that bad breaks are posssible and his ptrs @D points are probably wasted|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But I think he will escape the double and so not lose much|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so the salvage operation worked like a dream|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: He is about @SK short of an slam invite imo|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: North's case for 6@S is that parner must have many spades to bid "5 over 5" in front of partner, and the kings figure to be onside in opener's hand|pg||
nt|po-s: if West had the DJ instead of the one in clubs....|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, I guess they wont risk anything now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: would have been a dream had 4@H made in the other room  IE|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: If West's double is penalty showing values in diamonds he cannot have the right cards|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i should have thought the @DK lead is far less likely to give away a trick|pg||
nt|athene: you know the @DA is almost certainly over you|pg||
nt|athene: but club lead could have found declarer with the queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of spot cards in the @d suit makes it almost even odds with a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: or even something like Jxx with declarer, AQx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the pips in diamonds are poor so I go with Easts lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ciaran: Good try from Micheal - hoping partner has @HKx |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 8 i guess with everyone bidding close vul games these days, defenders shd also be trigger happy on the double button when the trumps break badly|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get out of his own way... has to cash Ace of @s|pg||
nt|dslee: very honestly, I would bid 3 :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|james_h: and struck gold|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||
nt|james_h: another example of fortune favouring the bold|pg||
nt|petergill: Part of the case for North to pass 5@S is that if 5@s scores 680 it might be a pick-up anyway against 200 or 500 at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: 650 is still secure|pg||
nt|petergill: South could claim 650 if he wants to|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done to R L Kejriwal team, who join Formidables and two other teams in the 48 board semi finals|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think East ruffed that @CK |pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an inspired defence?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: This is a great hand for the 1nt opener to be showing a 5-5 in majors and getting his ptr to declare 4 of a major|pg||

pc|h2|nt|petergill: A @d back --> ruff, trump king, club ruff high, draw trumps |pg||

nt|dslee: sry kushari|pg||
nt|roswolf: a quieter board|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal to reach 3nt here and go down|pg||
nt|dslee: EW partial more likely|pg||

nt|vicky888: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: x = raise to 2S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure of the wisdom of these canape overcalls |pg||
nt|chick: makes the second bid much easier in competition|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: sure, if partner expects a canape |pg||
nt|ciaran: A much longer auction in the other room to reach the same contract|pg||
nt|vbman: no at hand i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 4 likely now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|james_h: There is too much sex going on up north these days, they should focus their minds on bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: but it could confuse the suit lengths|pg||
nt|chick: doesn't usually matter with 6-5 ... pard will have one of the two suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  N also opened 1@d in OR... made it easier for E to bid|pg||
nt|po-s: now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@c was ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: DD only 8|pg||
nt|vbman: you see h ak in east|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: mini - splinter|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after that W has 3 useful points, not 7|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: very surprised they not in 4 then every card in the west hand is full value - surely worth a 3@d game try ..|pg||
nt|vbman: wow|pg||
nt|vicky888: well lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow great lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, @c or @s lead look right from E point of view|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but N can duck|pg||
nt|vbman: and pray for opps to cash hearts for rectification|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|po-s: diamond is no good|pg||
nt|roswolf: well loudly quiet!?:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dslee: why did they reach this now? Going by the safe logic, this should be passed :) Important IMP for formidables I guess|pg||
nt|po-s: but def should prevail|pg||
nt|roswolf: should is the operative word|pg||
nt|dslee: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: what you say is right, Mike, but in cases like this, all you really want to do is make pard pick one of your two suits|pg||
nt|eamongall: Its not that James surely ... its lack of game time against players of EBU and Team Silver level |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petepunt: but @h likely 4-1 after x|pg||
nt|andyv:  no need for that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|james_h: I blame the non sectarian sex|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: it will matter if partner is 2-2 in your suits, but that probably can't be the case here |pg||
pc|cK|nt|kdr_fm: super swicth from S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: -3 now|pg||
nt|po-s: this is a beginning...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  yep|pg||
nt|athene: @CA and another looks better? lead the jack only gains against stiff nine|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petepunt: would have bid it with 5@H for sure|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: @CA, club gains against stiff king OR queen with east|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|po-s: diamond to nine?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: and another couple of imps to NIBU|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: yes there was down now|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|roswolf: accurate defence|pg||
nt|dslee: no saving now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i mean ignoring the fact of this having no play anyway :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: as you would far rather be in a 6-2 fit than a 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|chick: If the 5-2 suit is trump and badly split, maybe yes, but I think most of the time, you will lose the same tricks in either contract.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather thought South would get the diamonds right there |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you might get forced as well - as is being graphically demonstrated here |pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was hoping for some horrible defensive crash and a no-loser club suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  no need to play A of @s is what I meant:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|dslee: for the benefits of the specs, 3 out of 4 players here are on BBO, Kushari=Kushari, Choksi = Sunit, Subhash = offthebend, can add them to your friend list|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d2|pg||

nt|po-s: was that 5 positive?|pg||
nt|po-s: and a diamond?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|vbman: so he will finesse in cl for 2-3 down|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got a chance at the @C lead. Pitched a @D and 10 was on|pg||
nt|james_h: dull board here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: 1@H response would have made it more difficult for the defence against 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now Bhabest has an easy heart lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzea: Other semi final scores : Many Hands 113 & R L Kejriwal 29|pg||

nt|petergill: for the last 16 boards of this semi, I think Formidables, who have a team of six, will sit out Kiran and Satya, who played the first 32 boards|pg||

nt|vugraphzea: :) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, this session started 15 minutes late|pg||
nt|petergill: Another 11 count opened by Kushari, not opened by Satya|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzea: That was due to stoppage in between due to bad health of one of the Players. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Do we need to pay the plane ticket for have the pleacure to watch that, if time is at scedual? Or will u make the event online at BBO?:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: The other 11 counts were Bds 19 and 20, on whcih Kushari's team gained 17 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D Multi|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H Pass or Correct|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A new chance for NS by defence|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: 3@S makes the hand more interesting. In an ideal cardplay world, the defence needs to get their @D and @H tricks before they go on dummy's clubs |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And they will|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|petergill: -1. Kiran Nadar tried to slow the auction down by opening 2@D instead of 1@S, but ironically 1@S would have reached 2@S via Drury, whereas 2@D ended up in 3@S due to her partner's ...|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Welcome to the Camrose in Edinburgh|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Discussing system Burns McGann|pg||
nt|athene: hard to say how high it will go..maybe just a gentle 3 of something|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H is presumably non-forcing ("negative free bid")|pg||
nt|athene: if it's forcing he is short of a few big cards :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Karel De Raeymaeker|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty, Christine|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D must be west's|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nice opening board for N/S as 2NT is hairy|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Welcome to everyone and thanks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S would like N to not dbl|pg||
nt|vbman: most dont balance with dbl in such hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't on this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  puts too much pressure on partner|pg||
nt|vbman: but the vuln and side strenth|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the 3nt punt|pg||
nt|roswolf: is likely|pg||
nt|dslee: no way - pass now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even 3@D is too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: 3nt makes here|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzgh: That is how it was explained to South|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm sensible|pg||
nt|po-s: 3S might make unless def establish a heart|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT advance sac to stop the majors i expect|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|dslee: Had this been white, laltu would had x to show his majors|pg||
nt|dslee: yup|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: 2@C inverted?|pg||
nt|frankaus: nicely rightsided|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Hi |pg||
nt|james_h: This is a battle between a 2 wal club NS and a 1 way club EW|pg||
nt|james_h: way|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW are playing precision, dbl of 2S should have shown max for the bidding but hardly inviting E to keep bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a good Pass fro W|pg||
nt|andyv:  who invited W?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S better pull!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: from|pg||
nt|andyv:  smart:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and N is a sadist to allow S to sit for the rdbl|pg||
pc|sK|nt|james_h: Nice work by NS here, 2NT a good raise, 3d a trial bid (I expect)|pg||
nt|dslee: but I guess, here too, he should show that he has a 9 card major holding|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: well, if East leads back a heart....question is, could the lead be from KJ10|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they find the killing defence?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: not sure why south didn't jump on 5@C|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vbman: 1h is make or 1 down but they want to stay awake|pg||
nt|vicky888: that rdbl was sos??|pg||
nt|andyv:  1H should be cold|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't know why W redbld... have to trust pd sometime|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: take the money and run.....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: I count 5 clubs, 4 diamonds, and a spade.  next :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  exciting hand... somehow the feeling is N could have done better|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vbman: he hadto bid a game somewhere and let partner try to make it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|vicky888: much of give and take of IMPs does really happen during bidding... its like plz take some IMPs!! No, No... i dont need that many IMPs, lets settle for fewer... kidding :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and thanks to Peter and Frank too|pg||
nt|petergill: If Sumit somehow saw all our praise of his bridge, he showed us he's human after all. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Thanks to all, aspecialy the specs for there inputs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 31: On @D3, if East plays @D6 rather than @D2, the position of @DQ would be even less clear to South, in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would have been nice to have a natural 2@D available, as N-S had at the other table|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Now helped by Satya's artificial 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the defence switches to hearts in time|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW by a needed + if 3@S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Again, it's a logical defence after cashing a club honour|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Forget about beating 3@S if partner does not have @HJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: What abought the @C color Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you'll have to play for it|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D was some sort of artificial raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: @CA, @HQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Never mind|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D is quite some bid, on not much at all|pg||
nt|rodal f: And after @HQ a @D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's true that there is a Scissors Cup in 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond will cut communications|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: but there are also entry problems in 3@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forget it. A new @H and EW would been of|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: I could beat 4@D. |pg||
