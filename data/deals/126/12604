mb|1D!|mb|d|nt|jtr: Maybe timing is awkward though|pg||

nt|jtr: Helped by the bidding more at this table|pg||
nt|jtr: Essentially you want to duck a trump and lead @ds so as not to get an honour ruffed|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer slightly mistimed it next door|pg||
pc|h2|nt|patricck: at least one trump has to be played or the 4th round of @H get overruffed|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, as i said, duck one|pg||
nt|jtr: Or can you?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: good evening all!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello William|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: hi everyone - this table was 5 boards ahead at the break so a slight delay restarting|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Raija :)  welcome  and hi Mike :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an| could be short|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all. Welcome to the second half   |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this all comes down to how much trouble south can cause with his trump holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: W hand looks like one of mine :(|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: EW play 5cM strong NT, NS 5CM strong NT as before|pg||
nt|lestergold: some very good players here|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: If you diagnosed the trump position 4@H can be made here|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome David :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: welcome back all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East's nickname is "Binkie" |pg||
nt|lestergold: Callaghan highly respected one of england';s top player s heather Dhondy a very prominent respcted player Hallberg world class|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even with the bad spade break 4@S has some chances|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|nt|mdgraham: also the name of Death's horse in the Terry Pratchett Discworld books|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Ewart I do not know as well but I believe considered a good player|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidstern: I played with Brian Callaghan in a team in San Remo - good team mate|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Gunnar seems to be selling his hand short|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: @HA and another is down immediately; the missing @H8 might influence declarer's decision a bit, perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 3@h shows 1-4-4-4|pg||
nt|athene: there are lots of ways to play this heart suit - you might lead small from west and then judge what to do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The bad communications will perhaps make playing trumps with 2 losses|pg||
nt|athene: for example lead to the @H10 and then if that loses to the @HJ, finesse south for the @HK too|pg||
nt|athene: if you think north will fly in with the @HK when he has it (especially @HKx) this gives you decent odds|pg||
nt|athene: but at this level you expect north to play low even from @HKx, most of the time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with that William|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and at least from Coyle|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|peachy: not any more|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: That line still effectively gives you better odds than the Ace and another play, but Ralf is right....there are communication issues here as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Callagahn's nickname is Binky h e invented Binky points a c0omplex fine tuning variation on Miltons |pg||
nt|davidstern: Passed 1@C then simple preference|pg||
nt|peachy: he was giving leeway for balancer|pg||
nt|davidstern: And he looks a little like a Binky|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: but I would not have been able to do it....|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|athene: the other interesting play is, if declarer leads to the @H10, you win the @HK as south|pg||
nt|athene: then he might lay down the ace, and you have your two trump tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: if anyone can find a way of making this , Halberg might|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|patricck: the 8@H popping might make him suspicious about that, but would still be a nice play|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|davidstern: Not true I will back GIB or Deep Finesse|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think it is cold|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|s6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get rude awakening re the @S break |pg||
nt|davidstern: 6 tricks in side suits and 4 trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: but thats only three losers and where are his oher losers?|pg||
nt|davidstern: He is on the right track|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|jtr: Seems to have been successful even so|pg||
nt|kit: 4-3-3-3, stuff in their suit -- can't be right to bid 3 over 3 with that|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think so|pg||
nt|ady: what was the double of 2@S  opposite a weak no-trump?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: negative|pg||
nt|Walddk2: take-out, whatever|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But she was a bit light opposite 12-14|pg||
nt|ady: goes with his hand    negative|pg||
nt|patricck: if by successful you mean getting 140 instead of 100 well sure..... but I wouldn't get too excited about it|pg||

nt|davidstern: Yes if they played perfectly why would we turn up and play against them|pg||
mb|1C|an|could be short|nt|sybarra: fencing better ......|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@S by N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am not a big fan of 2@C as found in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: what's wrong with 1nt?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Better than 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: unfortunately for EW, east might be a bit too weak to go stayman so the hearts might be lost|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: When you bid 2@C with a hand like that, there is a risk that you will miss a 4-4 heart fit because advancer is not strong enough to bid|pg||
nt|athene: i guess a fair 7-count is enough facing a 1nt overcall - that's a good 15 up to about 18, isn't it, for most people?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no time to get the clubs going, but this lead is still very nice for declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: lets face it 4@H wouldn't necessarily have made anyway...delcarer still had to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever leads his partner's minor after a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you don't even need a stop:) let alone a double stop :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion it´s not impossible to ask for majors on E and perhaps play a major contrace on 4-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Partner, I opened 1@D. Next time I'll open 1@S, then perhaps you will lead a diamond"|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Binky's erropr was actually the worst|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: because you can go for a beer afterwards, David - there's a decent pub just round the corner |pg||
nt|lestergold: altho Gunnar got more things wrong|pg||
pc|s7|nt|davidstern: Ah you chose the one and only AUstralian who doesnt drink|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Binky and Heather had a carding discussion after the hand - maybe there was more on the pervious hand than met the eye|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: i have a lot of sympathy for north - i think his lead would be the majority choice|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|patricck: your partners respond well to sarcasm Roland? :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|athene: usually south has a weak notrump and spades works out a lot better than diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not when 1@D shows 4+ as it does for this N-S pair|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes clearly count in clubs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: sure, diamonds are more of a real suit than clubs, by a long way|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: In my experience one has to be careful when inviting slam with absolutely zero in partner's suits|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he more drove to slam than invited it|pg||
nt|kit: problem is that West does have more than a minimum, so signing off in 4@H looks too conservative|pg||
nt|kit: And East doesn't have much wriggle room over the 4@D call|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 4@d was non-serious?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4NT is OTT though|pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT being a serious slam try|pg||

mb|3C|an|Baron|nt|athene: the point is, if you bid 5, and last player bids 5 over you, that shows a decent hand|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|athene: south is a little worried about his weak trumps and lack of keycard|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: you start off with below 50 for diamonds behaving then you have to calculate a massive cut for hearts not playing for three tricks then factor in the black suit finesse position ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: pretty decimated percentage|pg||
nt|davidstern: I really dont think this is worth my brainpower let's just say it is a sheit slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: not to mention a shortage of entries to try things from dummy|pg||

nt|davidstern: Note that Dhondy is on the comeback trail|pg||
nt|davidstern: The worst thing about the MP score is that you will lose to those in slam who will actually make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 6H with the bad trump split - a bit optimistic even if they break!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was a passed hand so very unlikely to have two aces *and* @HKJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 6@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: e/whave the points but i dont think they can make zip|pg||
nt|peachy: no, N overcalled 1D|pg||
mb|1D|nt|patricck: certainly some nice cards in this set|pg||
nt|sybarra: does everyone pass the N hand?  hoping to get back in?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I hope they dont find a 4-3 major fit as that wont work|pg||

mb|1H|nt|davidstern: I may do it on some occasions and not others|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: come on Mr Simpson|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: with @h 2-2 and @c 3-3 no problems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North definitely taking the low raod at the moment |pg||
nt|lestergold: er i think we might here something from north on thie next round|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this for real?|pg||
nt|davidstern: North did in fact bid 1@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@H might show spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: sorry, my mistake|pg||
nt|mdgraham: np|pg||
nt|lestergold: needsd a trump lead to creat any probs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davidstern: Wonder why North didnt try 2@S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|lestergold: and Binky found it|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|athene: i ssouth fiddling around trying to elicit a club cue-bid?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Not convincing|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why 3@D shouldn't be natural at the point when he bid it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand their bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: but declarer has time to develop  long spade|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: (4-5-4-0 good hand)|pg||
nt|davidstern: He will make just 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can set up a long spade even without a ruff|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|athene: but now he has to have something weird|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 3@H is better over 2NT; then he'll get the club cue bid he is looking for|pg||
nt|patricck: agreed Roland|pg||
nt|athene: these advance cue-bids are very dodgy - in my experience partner never knows what is going on - but here it worked out ok|pg||
nt|athene: south might just decide to bash in the slam over 2@H - the point being, you will make it even if you are off @CAK, a lot of the time|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: a spec suggests that 2@H agrees hearts so it's easy from there|pg||
nt|patricck: It is a reasonable slam, although one that might easily go down on some days.....with the magic @C position of course today it doesn't really matter what declarer chooses to play ...|pg||
nt|patricck: for he will be alright|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, south might have various strong hand without five hearts, for 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't think 2@H sets the trump suit clearly and unambiguously|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 1H from east showed spades btw|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|h3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the comeback trail has wandered off into the brush again|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|patricck: could declarer take two rounds of trumps and then go for a ruffing club finesse.... or is that relying too much on a 2-2 @H break?|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: Ewart did well to not get too excited with his hand|pg||
