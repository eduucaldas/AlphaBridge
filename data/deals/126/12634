nt|drorp:  Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  huge drama yesterday, let's hope we'll have something similar today|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: Hello everyone ...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: this is the last 16 boards of the final|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzxr: we begin slowly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Indeed. Delfour won on total points after a 10-6-106 tie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 106-106|pg||
nt|drorp:  and after making a huge 3rd segment comeback :)|pg||
nt|djneill: hi Dror and David, I'm late to this but I did see that amazing comeback against Zimmerman yesterday by Delfour|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West is good for 2@S, with four-card trump support. He will bid game now.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzxr: and the had a 420 difference for the total point|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally I would be content to let the board pass out if West can't open|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: if you want some information : http://www.ffbridge.asso.fr/actualites/actualites.php?do=detail&id=383|pg||
nt|brolucius: West realised that he had a good hand and makes a splinter bid in case his partner is enormous with nothing much wasted in clubs.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|drorp:  yep his hand is really almost best possible for 2@S|pg||
nt|djneill: yes I hope there is voice commentary - and here it is:  http://mp3.live.tv-radio.com/ffb/all/ffb-32k.mp3|pg||

pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Not much of a dream if you are not fluent in French...|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: :)|pg||
nt|djneill: should East have even paused to bid 2N, or was he looking for 3N, seems at imps that a 9fit and a prayer = game|pg||

nt|brolucius: doomed.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|drorp:  thin game here, both 5@D and 4@S will work (optimal card lie for NS)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I try to limit myself to one absurd comment per session. (not easy)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  it surprisingly gained 6 imps|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|drorp:  i wonder what will N bid now, i think 2@S should show 3|pg||
nt|drorp:  and the diamonds are way too bad to bid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|djneill: as long as they let george jacobs comment, I'll be overjoyed, he is funny|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither North nor South had any cause to consider protecting against 2@H. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Simple slam I am told. It is when @HJ falls and you guess @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funny how easy things are from up here|pg||
nt|drorp:  wow, he game forced|pg||
nt|drorp:  after the X, 3@D is surely 3 cards, as he could pass with a hand that doesn't have a comfortable bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  when the E-W pair at the other table bid 3N and made an overtrick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  on a combined 23 count|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|drorp:  Strong result getting to game here|pg||
nt|henryb:  this looks like a comfortable contract|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Best line in 6@H on a club lead is to cash two top diamonds and if the queen does not drop finesse spades|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|drorp:  now a diamond ruff with Q and declearer has a bit of a guess|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|djneill: is that a form of restricted choice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|djneill: restricted choice of course is when one of equivalent cards (honors) is played perforce, it tends to deny the other one, or maybe that's too simple but that's how I remember it :-)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb:  Declarer should lead the @cJ from dummy in case North has K10x|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|djneill: so roughly 2/3 of the time if North drops the Queen South will have the Jack, but this is different maybe....|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a little bit tricky, because North would have to decide whether to ruff at all with Q-J. With that holding, he would probably have scored a trump trick anyway, if declarer ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Here is a coffee hand for all of us. NS will get their two aces in 3NT|pg||
nt|djneill: or maybe he would for that reason, etc, it goes back and forth, if he can read the situation - in general he would not since there are other situations where it would just tempt pd ...|pg||
nt|djneill: to make a mistake, e.g if East had just 2 hearts and North Hxx and ruffed it low, losing a natural trick|pg||
nt|djneill: anyways, here, West chooses to double 3S, rather than bid 4@h with just 5 cards, but they are good|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not like to risk 4@H. A double gives partner the chance to pass or bid 3NT if he wishes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North considering a spade raise.|pg||
nt|djneill: Should North do it?|pg||
nt|drorp:  yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think East is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  has to put the pressure on|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  with clubs 4-4 3N makes, and I think 5@d makes also, but 4@h does not|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: So much for 3NT|pg||
nt|drorp:  2NT-3NT now, it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are on the same side of the screen|pg||
nt|djneill: big 5@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://mp3.live.tv-radio.com/ffb/all/ffb-32k.mp3  for live audio commentary in French|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: It's from this table|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: For the french commentary is Philippe Cronier and Vincent Combeaux|pg||
nt|drorp:  K@S isn't worth anything, so 5@H is enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East probably needed some thought before bidding 5@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4NT should be natural; with club support you just support or bid 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Palau wasn't sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's hardly a triumph to be in 5@D. It goes down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe West can bid 5@S now as a transfer to 5NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not kidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A slow 5NT is not the way to do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: "nice dummy, pd, thank you!"|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a singleton spade in dummy, North's signal will have been suit-preference. He played a low card - for clubs.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laure is a very meticulous operator, so she will not (and should not) enter bids until both players have bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|drorp:  Thomas is still thinking if slam is possible, or if 5@C might be a better contract, but he should realize that 3NT is best spot opposite a partner who has strengh in @D|pg||
nt|djneill: here, East can eliminate all the suits but clubs and can choose to play either side for the cK potentially, but once East finds South with 1@h and 3@d, it's 100% to play the @cA ...|pg||
nt|djneill: and another, if South has the @cK it is doubleton and he is endplayed|pg||
nt|djneill: or take the club switch :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: Levy leads under  a jack !!!|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: There is a slim chance in 6NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT makes if North ducks one round of @S as Jan Jansma points out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then they will not get @SA|pg||

nt|djneill: consider yourself, one of us|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Unlucky for you, Roland that there are no accents or cedillas involved. I know how you like to parade your keyboard skills.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|drorp:  can W bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill: North scrapes up a 1@c opening, East doubles since too strong for a simple 1@h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|drorp:  so he'll get to play 2@H instead :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A double followed by a change of suit shows a big hand, so 2@H adequate at this stage.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What did you çay, David?|pg||
nt|djneill: so, pass 2@h for a 5-1 fit, or bid higher to show a few HCP|pg||
nt|drorp:  west might be tempted but his hand is bad, even opposite a 20 count game is not very likley to make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fokal: guillamin 'S 1@s shows 0-7 so he is kind of maximum now|pg||
nt|drorp:  wow, game forced, now they're in trouble|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C seems a bit much with a singleton heart.|pg||
nt|djneill: the @dJ is potentially a huge waste|pg||
pc|h2|nt|drorp:  4@s is the least worse spot now|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Impossible for Guillaumin to know that he has the right cards for game|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Since 2@H was non-forcing, 3@S is known to be on three-card support.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|djneill: anyone like 4@h chances?|pg||
nt|fokal: won't be cheap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Declarer is unlucky. He has the 4-3 heart break that he needed, but there are a few high cards missing in the dummy.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: A pre-empt usually does not include a void, although anything is possible in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|drorp:  yes, would've bid on with 3 hearts fit, but now was impossible|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fokal: otherwise they might end up in 4@s much more difficult to defeat|pg||
nt|drorp:  2@H bid shows about 17 to bad 20, can't see a reason to bid with W with stiff @h|pg||
nt|fokal: agree with dror|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, the ace was good but the singleton heart a big turn-off.|pg||

nt|henryb:  and can Michel then realize that all his cards are working|pg||
nt|henryb:  including the 109 of spades|pg||
nt|cicus: S bid out his hand quite cheaply|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I have just started to read a new book that suggests a 5-4-3-2-1 point-count for the honour cards, including the 10. This is aimed at the bidding of balanced hands. It is true that ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: aces are over-valued when two balanced hands face each other, and queen and jacks are under-valued. The trouble with a new valuation scheme is that it falls apart when partner does ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: not have a balanced hand too. The author recommends opening on three Q-J combinations, for example.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did you eat a humble pie, Mike? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did prefer clubs over diamonds before|pg||
nt|cicus: nor can I S's pass when N has already given preference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would he change his mind?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Michel would have been bettwe off jumping to 4@c|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, it is much harder to add up the points in your hand. "I had an interesting 42-count the other day..."|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are 60 points in the pack instead of 40.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course the author is dead right about the honours being inaccurately values at NT. When you have fifteen points opposite ten, all aces and kings, there is usually very poor play ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for 3NT.|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: East is playing 4@S in the Closed Room, I am told.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: 3@D was an attempt to show a feature and excellent club fit by a hand who passed 1@C. I can follow Michel's way of thinking|pg||
nt|henryb:  I can also. But 4@c after the initial pass and minimum preference would also be clear|pg||
nt|cicus: I prefer to send clear messages. 4@C would have been best, now that NT is out of the question|pg||
nt|cicus: the trouble with 3@D is that it feels natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wouldn't try it on a pick-up partner, but NS have been partners for a very long time, and a successful one|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is useful for the vugraph aidience as it makes the match much closer|pg||

nt|lestergold: he appears to have played for @sK with west|pg||

nt|Walddk2: NS are in 6@H next door|pg||
nt|cicus: it takes up too much space so it must carry a well-defined message|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid over 5@S|pg||
nt|drorp:  Hi again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Dror, wb|pg||
nt|cicus: good save as 5@S makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Palau had no other option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C was not game-forcing and 3@S later would be slammy|pg||
nt|cicus: I am warned that N has no clubs so on a club lead 5@S is -2, thanks|pg||
nt|drorp:  5@S could be set on founding the @C ruff (not too hard), but anyway 6@h-1 isn't a bad score|pg||
nt|henryb:  If so, it shows a system limitation, I think. |pg||
nt|cicus: -1, that is|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is here 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they smoke cigars?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: we are back :|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Returning to the previous hand, I would not be ashamed to make a non-forcing bid with 11HCP, three trumps and no aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh no, Chemla was knocked out yesterday|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: The N/S cards were very difficult to bid, on the last board. North had great shape but his trumps were 9-high so he did not want to be too enthusiastic.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chmitty: now they bid 4@s|pg||
nt|drorp:  didn't like the 4@H bid in the other room, but 3@S also seems like an overbid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S splinter in support of hearts|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chmitty: can they make ?|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S a bit of an overbid but 2@S does not feel right|pg||
nt|drorp:  now N isn't stopping, 6@H is the minimum he'll play|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C a sound spade raise presumably|pg||
mb|4S|nt|drorp:  good bid by W, he knows he's going to 4@S anyway so he shows his suit on the way|pg||
nt|cicus: EW may even save in 6@S|pg||
nt|drorp:  this exact 4@C bid should prevent E from sacrificng|pg||
nt|henryb:  wow. not only 4@c but 4@s as well by west. They mist play VERY sound vulnerable overcalls|pg||
nt|brolucius: They play strong notrumps, so the 1NT rebid is weak.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp:  once he bid 4@c, he knew he'll bid 4@S, otherwise he would just bid 3@S|pg||
nt|drorp:  thomas should X now if it's forcing pass situation (i think it is)|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|chmitty: yes he will make|pg||
nt|chmitty: if defence plays @s then he can easily play @h from dummy to the queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have a match if he does|pg||
nt|cicus: Michel could have tried 5@C as a lead director just in case of|pg||
nt|henryb:  I understand, but driving to 4@s on the West hand seems like a lot!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree Gábor, 5@C would have been a clever bid|pg||
nt|cicus: W did not have the right to bid 3@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps he had enough of clever bids with 3@d a few boards ago?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: just for remind you 3 segments of 16 boards for the finals|pg||
nt|cicus: N is endplayed into bidding 6@H now|pg||
nt|drorp:  i can't see N not bidding 6@H here, knowing it's atmost 1 off|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chmitty: I bet we have one Roland :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Who would have thought that before this set started?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D denies three-card spade support, so South settles for 3NT.|pg||
nt|drorp:  I'm guessing that 2@C forced the 2@D bid and 3NT showed 5-3-3-2 hand|pg||
nt|drorp:  because if 2@C was normal CB, why wouldn't N bid 2@H?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some were surprised that Delfour did not concede|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 2@D also denies a maximum of 14 points. Thanks for that info.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: belated lead director|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had to bid. For all he knows both 5@S and 6@H could be making|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|chmitty: take in dummy and play @h presumably|pg||
nt|drorp:  exactly, in imps the odds are very much in favour of bidding on at these kinds of huge fits|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Wrong tactics by Palau methinks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|drorp:  wow... bad save didn't he think he has 2 tricks? (@S+@D)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would 6@H make with the cards he has?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DK seems useful|pg||
nt|cicus: hard decision. was not sure of @SA making a trick|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Natural move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need a little luck to make this and find it|pg||
nt|drorp:  a@S must make a trick imo, how can north bid 4@H with void|pg||
nt|drorp:  south*|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Thomas' bidding does not imply that he is void in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree with Dror|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: And Michel can't be void in *two* suits|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: mci|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can they imagine at this table that the match is so close ? What do you think Roland, I missed the first boards ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes they can|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT making off 2 aces is just one of many good boards for E-W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H is another, not obvious to be in it|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry had phone call|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: he is still thinking about it :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb im gonna make that coffee |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Maybe North did not bid 2@H because they do not want to give away that information every time. It is up to South to look for a heart fit over 2@D (or 2NT to show 14) if South does ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: indeed hold four hearts as well as five spades.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: I could not come up with anny other explanation|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I am told that the method is called Roudi(nesco) and: answer apre codified : 2@d= mini misfit, 2@h = mini fit ,2@s = maxi fit 2NT maxi misfit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|chmitty: Quantin psyched 1NT and played there|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many hands left pleas asks spec?|pg||
nt|drorp:  grand slam time|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 3NT by the Roudi bidder denies four hearts. Well, I am sure we have all heard everything we want to know about that! |pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 16 is the last board|pg||
nt|chmitty: 7 boards left|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laydown grand slam now. Feinscheckers would of course bid 7NT and make it on a squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: plenty of time|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 10 extra points for style :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is play for 6@S but it is unlikely they will stretch that far.|pg||
nt|drorp:  4@S here, slam might appear to make but there are not enough tricks because spades are 3-0 and clubs 5-2|pg||
nt|brolucius: A ruffing finesse in clubs provides discards for the two heart losers in the north hand.|pg||
nt|drorp:  anyay bidding slam seems very hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You can always see that by clicking on MOVIE|pg||
nt|chmitty: stay with us :) lol|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fokal: 6@s doesn't make on @h lead I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: Thomas said we have to hurry up .. the director is happy .. he doesn'thave to work|pg||
nt|drorp:  3@D now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I see, the breaks are bad.|pg||
nt|drorp:  i play 4@D as showing void|pg||
mb|3S|an| !c|nt|drorp:  i'm not sure squeeze plays there, west has 87X diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oops, that may be enough|pg||
nt|drorp:  and double squeeze won't work because east discards after dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: they may play in 3NT |pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: Michel's fault for not having @D8|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  anyway, i can't see how they won't bid the grand slam on a non interrupted bidding (very surprised they didn't at the other room)|pg||
nt|drorp:  N has a good hand opposite splinter, 3 small cards and 2 extra spades, but still his hand is too weak to do anything|pg||
mb|5C|nt|chmitty: they do|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm points there sadly heart guard a little duplicated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only Palau does not get funny ideas ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: will Palau imagine his partner holds 4 cards in @h later in the play ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: honest palooka certainly takes this off without effort|pg||
nt|drorp:  i expect him to bid 5@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and so does Palau|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not over just yet|pg||
nt|chmitty: now ... he knows thar Fantoni hols all the big cards ... so no other hope|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Paau will have to read his partner's count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1900 specs will get it down, but we are not playing|pg||
nt|chmitty: Guillaumin will play the 9 and is supposed to produce a Smith echo later on|pg||
nt|chmitty: let's see|pg||
nt|chmitty: if this partnership can do it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south must play q and west will give the biggest signal their methods will allow|pg||
nt|chmitty: they signal with the 2nd highest card|pg||
nt|lestergold: we know that there are often ambiguities in this position even wit a reg pard|pg||
nt|chmitty: on top of that if Fantoni plays the Queen, he denies the ten in hand ....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: and then the 9 has to come from 109xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chmitty: hummmm|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if that doesnt scream things from the roof tops! could it ve fronm Ten x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe this will be interpreted as values in spades, but West can't really have any points on this auction, can he?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well is ther any other hope in any case?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni must be maximum for his leap to 3NT opposite a 2@H range asking|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldnt on the lead be suit preference priority is to show information in the known long asuit buid and led|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT in the balancing seat shows 11-15 for them|pg||
nt|chmitty: Palau knows Fantoni can't hold K107x ... he would hace ducked from dummy|pg||
nt|chmitty: I mean K98x|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as east will get more than one bite of the cherry its onconceivabl that this contract will make|pg||
nt|chmitty: K97x :) lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would PYG have played from 109x or 10xx   a low one?|pg||
nt|chmitty: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Apart from the bad breaks, East's strength-showing cuebid might have caused declarer to play the clubs incorrectly.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|drorp:  but west made a strengh showing overcall :)|pg||
nt|drorp:  he should get it right, surely after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has shown diamonds and East has shown strength. It's true that East has now revealed the top heart honors.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On some deals, the ruffing finesse is better because you can take one discard as you pass the @CQ. That does not apply here because you would still have three losers if the @CQ was ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: run to the @CK with East.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, if you go for the ruffing finesse, you can sometimes take a club ruff or two first (perhaps bringing down the @CK in either hand).|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chmitty: no other choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: will level the score |pg||
nt|chmitty: the 10 of @c : I have @h@h@h@h@h|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|drorp:  hmm they don't know about the stiff @H yet, N will have to blast the grand now|pg||

pc|c8|nt|drorp:  okay then...|pg||
nt|drorp:  k@C is marked now i think, if west had only AKJTxx @D he wouldn't overcall 1@D, he would bid 3@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree with that, really. Why not mentiond A-K-x-x-x at the one-level. Not so valuable in diamonds, it is true.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: or 6@D fishing for a H control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No further ado, 7 it is|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is there some reason Michel did not bid 4@h over 2@s? Some systemic reason?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: He wouldn't want to bid 3@D, vulnerable.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|lestergold: in these situations especially part score I do not automatically lead partner's suit when I hold A or K unsupported |pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: Hi David|pg||
nt|brolucius: What happened to Fantoni-Nunes? Did they lose yesterday? They had a big lead when I was commentating.|pg||
nt|cicus: 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They lost all 54 IMPs and were out on total points|pg||
nt|drorp:  You picked the wrong segment to commentate then :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They also failed to cash two aces against 6NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wow! They did have a few bad boards (surprising ones) even when I was watching. Missed a small slam where 13 tricks were on a finesse against the trump king.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The East hand was packed with queens and jacks.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cicus: 1NT?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: I approve|pg||
nt|drorp:  yep, not much choice with 5@C and 4@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is always allowed to open 1@c with that hand.|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd bid Landy here then some number of @Hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 12 unopposed bids to go totally overboard on a misfitting 26 combined miltons .... vetry strange|pg||
nt|drorp:  just like other table did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would never show 4-7 as a two-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  i like this idea, you're not afraid to go on the 3 level even on a misfit|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: By the way, this is the genuine perfume hand, 4711, Kölnisches Wasser|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes it helps to involve partner in the decision|pg||
nt|brolucius: Before I was (rudely) disconnected, I was going to say that the South hand was difficult express. I see that Thomas has taken teh same route as they did at the other table.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think this should be a game try in spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  and not 4-7|pg||
nt|cicus: if he's had @SK instead of @DK, game would be odds-on|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can bid 3@S for the game try.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also known as Eau de Cologne|pg||
nt|drorp:  why won't 2N, 3@C, 3@D be game try in @S?|pg||
nt|drorp:  or, 3@S as david says :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think 3@H should show longer hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: changement de leader !!!!! amaising !!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: now er that seems 4 bids to getto a normal contract rather than 12 to go to broadmoor|pg||
nt|drorp:  i think he showed his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|drorp:  4-6, 4-7 with game try values|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since partner has given preference to the higher suit, he will have at least one card more there. So, you would need two cards extra in hearts to suggest that as a trump suit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  what would you do with 5-6-1-1 and a decent hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: er sorry for foreign specs broadmoor is where in england we send our criminally insane|pg||
nt|drorp:  probably 4@S :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  you are young|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: Guillaumin would prefer the first @d to go to North, but how can he achieve that ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s to dummy ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: but you need the @s ace as a communication|pg||
nt|drorp:  same bidding as the closed room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Tim Bourke makes the good point to me that 3@H might be a better start. When you are 7-4 you rarely want to play in the four-card trump suit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am old and have already gone down enough in my lifetime :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Haven't we all?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or put it another way. What do you call AQ109654?|pg||
nt|drorp:  so you could bid 3@S, with 6-5 why would you bid 3@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  trumps???|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need some way to show longer hearts and 2@C then 3@H is the only one available.|pg||
nt|drorp:  it's true that 7-4 is a single suiter, but when you're strong enough to describe your hand there is no reason not to do it, here he would find an easy 4@S game opposite Kxxxx@S and nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: on club leads S will have to start both majors from hand, so only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  and if North held Kxxx of spades and a stiff heart we would be applauding the choice of Landy|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact even 9 is lucky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and what if Partner passes 2@C, Dror? It has happened you know|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Easy for East to read South for the singleton diamond after he has shown such length in the majors.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe North has KQ or KJ or QJ or KQJ so that he has to win the diamond anyway|pg||

nt|brolucius: On the 5@S deal, at the other table, East opened 1@H and the bidding stopped in 4@S. East held @HK-Q-J-x-x and an A-J-x, so very reasonable to open, but it did not work out ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: luckily. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@D too much now on the South cards (if forcing).|pg||

nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cicus: an unlucky slam|pg||

pc|h2|nt|brolucius: East did well to bid up because of his fitting diamond cards.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chmitty: Cabanes was a bit optimistic with his 3@h bid indeed|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@s is a decent enough contract, and GIB would make it|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: so some of the lost lead recaptured here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: So would we all, Henry|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should have done more than 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With all cards in view|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|brolucius: OK, he was facing a passed hand, but no damage in saying that his own hand (which had also been limited) was very slam suitable.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: The fact that East at the other table went for 1100 when overcalling 2@H on a seven-card suit explains why it is recommended that you do not make such bids on a five-card suit.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chmitty: I mean 3@c sry|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  6@s needs either spades to come in or the @d finesse, Well above 50%|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chmitty: most of the lead, yes, if not all|pg||
pc|cT|nt|drorp:  1100 seems a bit too much i think he can escape for 800|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: 9/10 imps indeed an expensive adventure no game or double but a big swing on a part score hand|pg||

nt|brolucius: If South reads the opening lead as a singleton, there is something to be said for playing a trump to the king. On the basis that if East holds the trump ace you will lose a ruff ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: anyway. No doubt that is what declarer did at the other table.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, pass it out|pg||

nt|lestergold: well this is a more genuine candidate for a pass out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they going to listen now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will open nv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes can open 2@H 10-13 5+ cards in their methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: he likes his spades and his shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, 2@H would also show an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So he needs a singleton or void|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: fantoni goes to pie|pg||
nt|cicus: interestingly, S missed that also|pg||
nt|henryb:  this was less certain than playing a club|pg||
nt|brolucius: I must look at that one again afterwards. I was not really concentrating and it seems that I may have missed one of the best plays of the match (by West). |pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: And Delfour takes the leadership|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: to what??  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT by West is a little better than 4@S, but not so easy to get there when South opens 4@D :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North will be worried.|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@dX is better than 4@s|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: In effect the same auction as in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michel Bessis was very aggressive when he bid on over 4@S. Thomas could have had much less|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: EW might have won the board now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We shall see|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is a transfer to clubs. South has two possible rebids: 2NT and 3@C, but there is a difference of opinion as to which should show the better club fit. Some play one way, some ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the other.|pg||
nt|drorp:  assuming south could bid 2NT to show good fit, N should pass now|pg||
nt|drorp:  but the vul is tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: But West's double is surely for take-out. No way East can pass it with those spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: not so sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Nubes unlike closed room doesnt wait for auction to fizzle out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Enterprising lead|pg||
nt|drorp:  yes very nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you have found that, David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Generous adjective.|pg||
nt|drorp:  won't work in this case though :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to go. May see you later|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would not have found it, now or in the future.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Henry|pg||
nt|brolucius: You think he is hoping to feign a singleton?|pg||
nt|brolucius: An awful 3NT by any standards, so N/S have done well here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Fantoni will bid but will let him play there?|pg||
nt|drorp:  this will make, so Laffineur are about to regain the lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|chmitty: if Fantoni is let to play in 3@c he has a lot of reasons to make 9 triks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why PYG preferred hearts we will never know|pg||
nt|fokal: guillaumin though that 4@c shows @d + @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: For PYG is @h/@d|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: That's also my guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think very good chance that he will get the clubs right|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: west is odds on to have short club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Declarer says: 'I was not born yesterday, my friend!'|pg||
nt|fokal: :'(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, maybe 4@C showed the red suits for him|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|chmitty: it did|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chmitty: East final pass probably denies 4 cards in @d ... so fantoni already knows 4@s + 5@d by West|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|chmitty: and he can test the @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is but could just as well be 4252|pg||
