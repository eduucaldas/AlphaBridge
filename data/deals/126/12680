nt|jcmax: hope to make a t/o double of hearts later.|pg||
mb|2H!|an|6card. 8-11hp|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|drewsky: I think it also matters what minor the oppopnents open relative to your length in their minor as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 3H by West?|pg||
nt|Rafa: Winner here represents Norway in the European Champions Cup in November|pg||
nt|drewsky: At the other table, west opened north's 5 card minor, so a delayed takeout double of hearts was not to be considered|pg||
nt|jcmax: The cards lie very favourably for EW and exactly where you wwould expect them to be with this bidding. But does W have enough to drive to game?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|jcmax: I don't think so, after all partner only balanced|pg||
