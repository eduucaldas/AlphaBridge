mb|1D|mb|p|nt|janm: THis looks like a trouble hand for whoever buys it, with things breaking badly all over the place|pg||
nt|larrymori: want to stay low|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d!|nt|janm: If Madala has decided to hide his Majors, it's a good decision, but since 2@d was alerted, and it clearly isn't inverted, it probably says something about Majors|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|larrymori: if 2@d shows the majors 5-9 is X penalty for the majors?|pg||
nt|janm: I'll guess that it's 5 spades, 4 hearts, weak, but wonder what West's DBL is then|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: If 2@d did show 5-4 in the Majors, Madala has now done a good job of describing his hand - presumably he could afford to bid 3@d because this pair plays that 1@d promises at least ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4 and probably an unbalanced hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: But maybe Bocchi expected more values for the bidding|pg||

pc|cK|pc|d5|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: The A of clubs lead is good for declarer, since he can guess that it's from AK and pick up the whole suit with a ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|larrymori: that was done for him lol in the best way|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi all|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Peggy|pg||
nt|pbundy: Hey Larry :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: He wants to go right........|pg||
nt|janm: The club plays have been good for declarer, but he's still very far from home. If he gets the hearts right (should he?), he'll have 1 heart, at least 2 clubs, and as many diamonds ...|pg||
nt|janm: as he can score, presumably about 7|pg||

nt|peachy: and off we go, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: great misfit to begin with |pg||
nt|peachy: the tournament website did not have them unless I completely missed it|pg||
nt|hlortz: what do ew play? ns polish club for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morning all:)|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome to this 14-board Qualifying Match 10.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hey Jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Al.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peachy: The Youth tem is well placed in the current running score|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure - but I will knos some of their gadgeds - and spects will help me - I hope :):)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, to watch the 6th qualifying Match from Yokohama|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to be England Ladies against a japanese team|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NEC Bridge Festifal|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone and welcome back |pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play 1N=15-17,  Klinger-Mullamphy transfer over their 3+ 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to get there if W bids|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - He will sure risk 2 @S|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: however n/s do not play at speed of light (until the end of hand) |pg||
nt|peachy: Qualification Match number 7 on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|2C|nt|peachy: The tournament website for those interested, scores from Match 5 are not yet there but will sonn I'm sure http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: from NEC Bridge Festival in Yokohama, Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 15th NEC Cup. 12 rounds of qualifying (Swiss), 14 boards per match. This is a match from round 7 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello V|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker-Gower are the "South" part of Team South Sweden -- they're from South Africa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heavy promotion of the N hand will likely allow 3N to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have a CC that says NS play Precision with variable NT [sometimes 10-12, other 14-16]|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and now?|pg||
nt|peachy: esciting hand, afteralll|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the current leaders versus  2|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: they found the @S lead in the other room |pg||
nt|marlowepi: case for Slead but H normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's a WBF card from 2008 - so maybe they played for Bulgaria in Beijing|pg||
mb|3D|nt|peachy: oh well, cant spell|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Raija Davis, Hans Werge and Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the ecats site has a CC for the Italians from the 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 3rd @D might bring some problemes|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings -- not updated for Round 7 yet |pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well called peter|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H should make because of the @c discard on the @S Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and with this lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|peachy: W got worried and pulled|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: a bit harsh to attribute a result to a normal lead?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  @S 10 was an option|pg||
nt|flash: the trump split will slow declarer down a bit|pg||
nt|xenya: creates a small problem for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  udca|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: ruffing with the 9 seems to be correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s not the way everybody would play. Ruff with the Jack og King and play against the Queen. But no argument against success|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Polish Club, EW 5card major and 15-17NT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|flash: declarer will probably start on one of the pointed suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His problem is, that @S King might be by the 1 @D-bidder |pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is weighing his options|pg||
nt|flash: mentally going through each possible line - trying to find the safest/ most reasonable|pg||
nt|flash: all not lost if the @SK off-side|pg||
nt|peachy: against this opposition, it pays to be careful|pg||
nt|flash: that looks like the most probable choice from here|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has a rather strong clue to the location of the @DA...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some interesting decisions at several stages of the auction here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: udca=Upside Down  Count  Attitude|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Raija.|pg||
nt|peachy: Jordan:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello raija, jordan, rehi Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru 8 matches posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Marshall.|pg||
nt|peachy: Al:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think this is match  10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Either N or E might have made a double at their turn.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can see 3C with the N hand, but double looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C in context of Precision probably shows longer @C|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: and actually -- a number of big clubbers use  1@D-2@H as Reverse Flannery - to show the 5@S 4@H weak responding hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
nt|flash: declarer's problem, if the @SK is, indeed, offside is the lack of an entry to hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Both of these teams are prime candidates for winning the whole event|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may accept the invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should we say it this way - @S-shift was not killing|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Yokohama. hi to all|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had few options, but that certainly clarified/simplified things for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argument for @S is that partner has all the points -- even if @H strikes strength -- may not be entry to East's length|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: now should go down, he doesnt have the ricks any more|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: he lead 9, so....N had to count (3) |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh you mean N  sorry |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: Netherlands, with a strong young team, is also among the favorites|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: can no lnger make|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|flash: declarer's home now - on virtually any line where he doesn't revoke|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|chick: this is not going well at all for the declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: was making when he was in dummy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: the idea of ruffing losers ought to have occurred to declarer sooner than it did|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|nt|othered1: On the other hand, you may beat 3N off the top if partner has @HAKxxx, but not @SAKxxx|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|janm: I guess EW play a Strong club and 1@d is just a noise|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|janm: Now E has presumably shown a weak NT, don't know if he can still have 3 spades, but probably|pg||
nt|pbundy: 7@D anyone?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|janm: No thanks!!|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm betting not myself|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|larrymori: is that your idea of good percentage? lol but 6nt makes too with the @s breaking|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably they'll find out they don't have any 8 card fits and have lots of values and controls and end in 6NT, which is a very reasonable place to play the hand - can try for 3-3 ...|pg||
nt|janm: spades and then take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|larrymori: no need for the finesse|pg||
nt|pbundy: 12 with the diamond finesse ... or, as you say, spades breaking|pg||
nt|larrymori: if the spades break|pg||
pc|h9|nt|janm: Right, and there's time to try both - duck a spade and then if they don't break, take the diamond finesse|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello David|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Must be a flat board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- played the 2@H bidder to hold ZERO @H honors|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of Roland choices here.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  Here 3 NT better be played by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. the case for a spade is that if you are beating this with hearts your heart ten is redundant, whereas if spades is the right suit the heart ten may be of some use on defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Lavazza brought this time Duboin-Sementa, Bocchi, Madala, and Guido Ferraro|pg||
nt|flash: all right, folks - we've got a relatively small group in this room (to watch two of the best pairs in the world), so pls move down to the front of the auditorium and feel free to ...|pg||
nt|flash: ask questions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  Hello PEO|pg||
nt|po-s: is there a link to standings?|pg||
nt|xenya: hello PO|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems here, that 4 @H depends on the @C-suit|pg||
nt|flash: Polish Club - several possible hands|pg||
nt|flash: in this case, the strong(est) option|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: but this might not be flat -- particularly after the double by W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  EastÂ´s double is OK - for the minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ecats should still have convention cards for both pairs online from Beijing 2008 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly hand, endplayed into making 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3-loser hand|pg||

nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: overcals in minor vuln sh normal be on 6 card suits - so S passed where mane clubplayers would bid 2@C|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
nt|hlortz: for sure vul too dangerous to overcall at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N take any action now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e., is it worth is?|pg||
nt|peachy: strongest is 19+ any shape|pg||
nt|flash: our operator threw up a small false card|pg||
nt|flash: didn't slow us down, however   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = ART Game Force [2-way Checkback]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know why Sementa didn't bid 2@H :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
mb|3D|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
nt|pelu: and prob @Ss bad for declayer - act 2@H down 1 - EW tahe the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i freely open 1N with a 5-card major, but here i would open 1S. i doubt we have a game if pd responds 1N, and if pd is 35 in majors we will play wrong suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either 2C was Puyppet or E is already steaming trying to get the swing back|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
nt|hlortz: dubion must be worth another try here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Henry.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may not try. he may just bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe 2NT has dual meaning|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin ..my typing is lacking|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 IMPs to Bulgaria on 1 - Lavazza got to 5@D and that was doubled and set 3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1 = 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that much point in trying when YOU have eight controls. partner is likely to drop you even when you want to be there|pg||
nt|peachy: even a player with no pulse would get that dbld, I think,|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  And defense can have some fun against 4 @S, when they play the 13th @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not updated after round 3 yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow, what do they open?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NO 8+ fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: think e will make exactly 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 losers  and no problem with ruffing @Ss|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see where E found the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East trusted South - a mistake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why 5@c now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough decision atr trick one, probably wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: so ifyou changed @H and @D in west's hand, you would open 1N, Marshall?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa, this is hard to believe.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||
nt|hlortz: notice ns lead low from xx unlike most [non polish] pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was max of 14  presumably  2N or 3N said not great hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to David Greenwood|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|peachy: despite bad trump breakm, declarer still makes|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I'll always believe you should have made it, partner."|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: 1H was 4+ 7+HCP, a diamond canape possibility|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: an unlucky downer (2?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||
nt|hlortz: s taps the dummy to shut out the long spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Brock's point of view I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  for standings after session 1|pg||

nt|pelu: also almost standard in denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer another X|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: instead, Beauty picked up 5 IMPs for missing game when the Latin played in a weird 4-2 spade fit|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah i see not common in USA|pg||
nt|flash: headed for 11 tricks?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  You have almost an opening bid - and your partner doubles 1 @S - should they have 790, then OK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|po-s: South should have cashed the HA if he had had it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  AActually South should have played the @D King maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: but club is no good since declarer can ruff high and throw a dia|pg||
nt|hawe45:  10 I think|pg||
nt|peachy: let me ask our BFF (best friend forever) GIB...|pg||
nt|flash: @D honor now keeps 11 in play|pg||
nt|peachy: he says 11 or 12|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S needed to switch, but W needed to win first trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my fault - was chatting -- 2@C WAS 5-Card Stayman  and the pair defines using it with 53 majors -- transfer then 2/3 NT = 52|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even opposite this dog 6N has fair play: Qx   KTx   Kxx  QJTxx|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  OK - I made a new count|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  But declarer should then guess, whether SouthÂ´s doubleton is Q or 10 |pg||
nt|peachy: Bulgaria has a rare chance to get considerable headstart|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: i would just pass as E and collect all the 100's i can|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: there ought to be a Law against doing that...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c3|nt|jtr: How does 5@d do?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I just wee, that Englands opponents are the junior team, a pair from Czech Republic at the other table|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, W didn't double, so E was never tempted|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it doesn't seem like big result for EW - they could win 5@c|pg||
mc|12|nt|sybarra: N may hop q here |pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said earlier,  we will not be playing at speed of light (like the brazilians) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: poor Giorgio -- @DQ onside AND  both pointed suits 33|pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 6NT/E in the OR.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|hlortz: we see here the strong part of 1@C |pg||

mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: 5@c on EW. can they find it?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Good old Irving Gordon, originally from Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I bet David played against him a few times|pg||
nt|jtr: And in teams with him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awfully good hand for a weak 2, if that is what it is|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red suits lie well for NS - for 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway well done by both sides as 4@H was cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: usual 1@C is like a weakNT|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club, weak no trump in use for North-South|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18, 5c S|pg||
nt|flash: we had a famous baseball player in the old days "Shoeless" Joe Jackson...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their convention card from Sao Paolo just says "2-way checkback"|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  vul 2N seems a bit rich with W hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, Sveta:)|pg||
nt|flash: supposedly because, as a country boy, wearing shoes hurt his feet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then:  xx   KTx   KQx   QJTxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: in Hans' case, not removing his shoes might indicate fewer tricks than available...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4-9 HCP, 5+@H & 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|peachy: I still have suspicion 2NT was not denying hearts, perhaps to show the 12-14 instead of more wideranging options included in 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hi Raija, welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not cold, I think. You have a losing option in @C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like X or 3@D?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: 2N vul against not has limited appeal|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure Scotland wasnt joined to europe when he was there:)|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to overcall, perhaps on the basis that his hand is too good - immediate overcalls destructive in nature|pg||
nt|peachy: nt apparent;ly 16-18 or something|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  S to the rescue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice 5 @D - if they bid the slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now - why is West passing?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW off the hook |pg||
nt|pelu: NS could also go for penalty against EW - 2@CX = 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say that the W hand looks more like what I usually hold|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes e came in expecting the weak hand in south|pg||
nt|dburn: if classical strong club, yes - 17-19 or even 17-20 more common ranges nowadays|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I'm old school|pg||
nt|flash: this is the kind of deal which decides matches - much less short matches like this|pg||
nt|flash: to some extent, the @D call helps North - whatever values South has might well include some in @Cs|pg||
nt|peachy: good decision, 5D would only tumble one or so|pg||
nt|xenya: very unlikely at these colours and with W being silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction in OR '|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H denies a top honor  - but that doesn't surprise Klinger|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: dblfits all around, and now that was brought to daylight|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - the lead must be a @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Service-double - earns nothing, helps N/S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|xenya: strictly speaking, yes, but you can get a fairly good count on the E hand i think|pg||
nt|flash: East suggests defense vs 5@Ss and strongly suggests that West not bid more (especially vulnerable)|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree with Jim's explanation, for what its worth|pg||
nt|flash: Hans actually sneaked in a good point - suggesting/directing the @D lead was important here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   1N already said 12-14|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even w/o dbl - could be gain for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NorthÂ´s opening bid pushed E/W to game, equalling the match|pg||
nt|othered1: with no trump lead and very friendly breaks, this can play well on cross ruff.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you see they made 5 in the other room,   @h and ht continuation |pg||
nt|hlortz: oh im NOT defending their bidding LOL you have 19 pard opens and you dont move past 3n.|pg||
nt|peachy: X more flexible|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: as cards lie, can make 5 by going up ace, |pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Nice @D-suit - brings 4 tricks to East-West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - cancel|pg||
nt|po-s: Hans, asusual you are right - North will cover the Dten and yes, four tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D could lead to 3D cold for 3N or 4S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why South volunteered a bid in front of partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
nt|peachy: this has chances to chke, and I think it will|pg||
nt|peachy: S sensibly signs off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer D from W on the first round of bidding. 15HP behind opener|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s 9 - "partner, I have clubs" - seems so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here than in OR|pg||
nt|flash: XX shows 1st round control|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: K or Q from S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think best was to fly @CA, ruff @H  top @D pitching @C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|flash: notice that the @D lead would hold this to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I am surprise the diamond lead didnt come, after West's valiant effort|pg||
nt|flash: to quote David Berkowitz:  if  i'd bid @Cs, would you have led a @D????|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: Yes true|pg||
nt|peachy: make*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- I'd try 2N|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice for once to see instant scoring outside Scandinavia and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can we hope for America to follow suit?|pg||
nt|hlortz: in 10 or 20 years|pg||
nt|peachy: she could even play low and make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should have bid 5 @C - to get a @D-leas...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: X for me|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  sure... 40 or 50 years from now|pg||
nt|peachy: I was only defending E bidding which may have been systemic:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: this plays very well|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  ACBL just got around to approving negative dbls:)|pg||

nt|peachy: Hi Hans, sorry I am late|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello kibitzers:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: I see we have a strong match going here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|xenya: too well perhaps|pg||
nt|peachy: Hans, I didnt know you had good sense of humor :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have had|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Some play this DONT -. or others, where D = 1-suiter|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wasnt just 19, it was about the crispest 19 imagineable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 3N|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: top D before H ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- unblock Ace first|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  But now the @C-guess will decide - and East will fix it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: 3N is my second choice|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not on a club opening lead she couldnt|pg||
nt|peachy: not opening lead|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|jtr: What do we think of West's 2NT though?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S should have played trumps from the very beginning|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1D response showed four+hearts, 2C was puppet to 2D and 2S inviting with four|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK - not much the defenders can do to hurt him since he has one spade trick and two of each|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D is my LAST choice :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N could fail cold for 4S though, and on many hands where E would not trake you out|pg||
mc|10|nt|peachy: Might have been wise to cash HA, it could disappear on the club|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pbundy: with west opening the bidding, 6@H a very reasonable contract.  i see no way to bid it, however.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|janm: I'm not sure whether the diamond opening or the club opening chosen in the other room (because their system allowed it of course) makes it easier to bid this|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbundy: now their hole is getting a bit more serious.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|janm: The semi-natural 1@c opening makes it clear that the singleton is valuable (and also keeps South from showing a non-fitting hand by bidding clubs naturally), but the 1@d opening ...|pg||
nt|janm: makes it clear that the diamonds are well-placed. At any rate, NS here have failed to bid the slam and they're now in serious trouble after only 4 boards|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|pbundy: of course, i'm not sure of all n/s's methods...but - bocchi might have bid his suit at some point...  either 3@H over 2@S or 3@H over 2@C|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|janm: Or 2@h over 2@c?|pg||
mc|12|nt|larrymori: 3@h?|pg||
nt|janm: Certainly if he had 3@h available to show a self-sufficient suit and a good hand, that would have given them a chance|pg||
nt|ferlema: oki. mañana lo llamo por TE|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, i think that 2@H wouldn't have been near enough over 2@C|pg||
nt|janm: It's funny that we're now saying this match is extremely one-sided - somehow it seems much harder to catch up when you're 35 IMPs behind with 12 boards to play than it was to get ...|pg||
nt|janm: those 35 IMPs in 4 boards :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: EW 2@H perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see losers here|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 2 the overcall of 2 @C pushed e/w to 3 @D -1 |pg||
nt|hlortz: 3n here for ns will they bid it?|pg||
nt|dburn: he needed to, for some reason - not quite sure what that was all about|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - he went up with the jack on the first round of hearts|pg||
nt|flash: our skepticism of the board 2 result is the 1 IMP on the scoreboard so far|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem with 2N is that it is an underbid|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: likely 3S by S|pg||
nt|dburn: but I don't have much idea why he did that, with K9x in his hand|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was a case of "monkey fell from tree"|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: this alert?  is it "could be 2" |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe playing for West to have @h10x and no entry, but that seems a bit of a view|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree with W's pass -- the fact that you are behind the opener doesn't matter much with his holding -- no tenaces, just controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+@C, not 4@C & 4@D [1@D]|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Still no game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not everybodyÂ´ s taste that 2 NT - facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes you need to make that call with an undistinguished balanced 16. here you are close to 8 trix in yr own hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL expects to hear more @H from LHO|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: this will be a very tight match, both teams have some of the world's best pairs playing,  and Fantunes, perhaps theeee best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW rate to go minus in game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to hear more hearts, it matters little what you do|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: if S doesnt bid them now, the S willl be lost forever|pg||
nt|flash: X reasonable, but now without risk - my partners always bid 2@D...|pg||
nt|flash: note the 1NT call without a stopper|pg||
nt|flash: values first, shape 2nd??|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sounds right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and you will be outbidden in a lot of hands:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: pretty good 6@H here with west opening|pg||
nt|peachy: now this 1NT will drive bulgarians to six|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hlortz: anyone X 1@H with south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no thin double by South|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 cards suits?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  strange 1N... even if playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin has obviously heard "6-4, come alive"|pg||
nt|flash: and maybe even 6-5|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I erred, Fantoni-Nunes not playing now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can take the first 11 tricks against 1 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even Kokish might think North too good for 1@H overcall :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|po-s: JC doesn´t quite believe the explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: prob same as open rm|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N takes the push to 3...faster than I could type|pg||
nt|peachy: not a bad choice, d finesse near 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi: its over|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|andyv:  why not a simple raise?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow aggressive double|pg||
nt|jtr: Just right at MPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in their lucky day EW win @s game|pg||
nt|peachy: good start, W raised|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main problem - to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: lose 2h and 3s|pg||
nt|flash: the stopperless 1NT does have its potential drawbacks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and against 2 NT also|pg||
nt|peachy: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: how about 3NT Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm starting to think that the long run winner for South is to PASS the DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: good decision by West here - that raise wasn't automatic|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm unfamiliar with ew system, for me raise would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|peachy: they did well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=transfer|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: even if Gower doesn't lead a minor -- still only 9 tricks  [i think]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S bids 3S, as he should, they arein slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: sounds like penalties, with good hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: Aiming for the KOD Roland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S probably wanted to dbl the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going for the KOD is tempting at MP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KOD = Kiss of Death|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead - only a @S could give S some problems|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Let me count|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Edgar Kaplan is rolling over in his sepulchre Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
mb|6H|nt|hawe45:  Here they only get 10, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments from now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: aka 200|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -200 at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead was better, and logical on the auction and the W hand|pg||
nt|chick: kind of a waste of the 10|pg||
nt|peachy: its cold, dont think any lead woulda caused a prob|pg||
nt|flash: but an important lesson:  the defenders can't see your hand...|pg||
nt|peachy: silence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  20 tricks in difference or so|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks simple enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pause -- in case Klinger has ducked @DA??|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wrong J by pd - and he has 3 of them :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bulgaria matched the 4@S contract on 19 - and two overtricks for 2 IMPs to 23-zip.|pg||
nt|hlortz: bulgarians are going full speed ahead|pg||
nt|peachy: N gambled, W could have had Ax spades and KQxx xlubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N could easily turn out to be an underbid, e.g. if N held:   KJxx   Axx   AKQxx  x   they would play 3N with 6D near cold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction from Vladi Isporski|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: and on board 18 West kept NS out of 4@s by opening 1@s on five low and a pile of dingo's kidneys|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  and should get it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not 500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 25 3@S-1 was above average for NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: total waste|pg||
nt|chick: although I guess a pitch on the J doesn't do much|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 16 top tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: about 16|pg||
nt|jtr: A few tricks here|pg||
nt|hlortz: 7 @D @H or NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you would expect a flat 7N across the field |pg||
nt|jbgood: no|pg||
nt|jtr: Even my grandmother would manage 9 i think|pg||
nt|jbgood: there are always a mix-up somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in Central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far the standard fo card play has not matched the quaity of the bidding|pg||
nt|tez: nicely played|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hawe45:  @S-guess is worth 1 IMP here|pg||

nt|tez: 1@c opening means..nat or 16+any hand..polish club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I agree with 5 @H |pg||
nt|dburn: I neither - they were 19th in the standings after four rounds, but not sure what they did in their last match|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some will not even be in a grand slam. Just wait and see|pg||
nt|po-s: which it probably ewas|pg||
nt|xenya: on 18, EW in the other room didn't find the 4@S save -- 8 imps to World Youth|pg||

nt|sybarra: slightly different auction in other room  since 1 @H=sp |pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least that's what the old convention card says :(|pg||

nt|peachy: but S decided not to even look, reasonable decision with 4333|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tez: he will bid pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree  but S has to like his hand |pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  3@d by S seems to make things easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @d suit most likely the one in question |pg||
nt|flash: 2@D natural and VERY positive|pg||
nt|flash: grand slam easy from here - far more difficult to reach at the table?|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D 5+ C or D, usually gf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A 2 C-overcall by East, might have brought some trouble for N/S |pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C|pg||
nt|flash: SPECS!!!   287 people in here and there's virtual silence!!!   c'mon - talk to us|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N did not want to lead a trump because he was worried about hearts affording discards. he preferred clubs to diamonds for an unusual reason--they were weaker, i.e. he hoped the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ten would best serve the defense if the suit was not attacked from his side|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: at least 3@c gets some strength across i imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: to Zmud|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be at sprint speed of play |pg||
nt|pelu: 6@Hs will only cost 800 - but rish that opp bid 7 - and then he also has to bid 7@H|pg||
nt|tez: and also 7@s..then:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (when he decides play) |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning, afternoon, evening, as you please|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Roland!|pg||
nt|po-s: it looks like 8 tricks|pg||

pc|cT|pg||

nt|mdgraham: one pair in 4@H|pg||

nt|flash: check the Daily Bulletins - they're among the best in the world...   a Rigal-Colker production paid advertisement...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: 4@H?! That will make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: two in six|pg||
nt|peachy: nice switch|pg||
nt|xenya: trappy hand -- they are bound to end up in 3N -- and they did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=long suit game try -- not sure why that is an alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S brought his rabbi  (play ace with K is singleton off side) |pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: he has a cost free chance to try find the Q|pg||
nt|dburn: and of course, whenever you open some minimum in 4th chair partner always punishes you by jumping to 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: 1 key card for @Hs, excluding @Cs...    but a big swing in a short match|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: Didnt bother about the @dQ expecting South to have 3 @ds|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding will take longer than the play|pg||

nt|hawe45:  1 IMP - the first for NL|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: well played|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|peachy: now S must find the right lead to set, will she? small d but of course we see all cards|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|tez: nice coment shirley..i agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question will be if they "reconnect" the tables |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: I would open the E hand at any colors. many would disagree of course, but it is an opening bid by many well-respected yardsticks|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H was again a transfer to 4S :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@D sh be alerted|pg||

nt|ahollan1: remember  NS playing Precision so 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C [16+ HCP]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H u mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i told the computer to display -- wonder where @S came from|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  in mp, rather be in 3N or 5@d?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A lucky 3 NT here |pg||
nt|po-s: Did he really make nine tricks on the previous hand?|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is take/out to @s..strong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 ball, or 18-19 ball or natural @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: N to double? |pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
nt|peachy: W has max and six cards, well done to Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: how would you like to pass as E then put THIS dummy down in a mere 4 spades then watch pd go down?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Patrick Huang |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- when W didn't play his last spade to tap S|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s or pass i thk|pg||
nt|tez: :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ashley Bach also led a small @C  [the 6]|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: and that is a slightly aggressive responsive double by South, but part score swings are generated by pushing your opponents around|pg||
nt|flash: note the 2@C call - the 6-card suit outweighs the 4-card length in @Hs, despite the fact that partner is far more likely to hold @Hs than @Cs|pg||
nt|flash: but, we seem to have run into the question of whether the 'free bid' shows values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 spec telling me that NS are NOT playing Precision at this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has good cards facing a splinter, but unable to cue 4D he must bid 4H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the spade finesse is on I make 630 vs 620|pg||
nt|peachy: but|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks, Shrley and Hi all.|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was always going to bid 3@s, but no harm in seeing whether his opponents accidentally pass him out in 2@s doubled first|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||
nt|peachy: i see no chance for OT|pg||
nt|tez: they are leading 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again we see the lead middle from 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: EW can defeat 4@S on a @S lead (DD decl can 2xfiness in @D and make)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: all leads 2/4......better way to describe it   (thx spec) |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with the @S-vois, South has a few values|pg||
nt|hawe45:  void|pg||
nt|peachy: if 3D was GF he cant pass now...or can he|pg||
nt|flash: SJ Simon counseled :  how much worse could your hand be...    not much!!!???|pg||
nt|peachy: Also "How to bid misfits?"  A: "Don't"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must take his chance - 4 @c was the first bid from North, which was - maybe - NOT forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: a spec says 3D asked for D stopper|pg||
nt|flash: most would play a cue bid forcing to game in major or NT, but only to 4-level in minor???|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that is a sensible way to play it|pg||
nt|flash: again, need to remove shoes to count losers in S hand???|pg||
nt|peachy: hearts behaving, Bulgaria can hardly lose on this deal, or Lavazza gain|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: I suppose on this lie of cards North-South actually had some play for 4@h|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tez: 3 down is bad news for ew|pg||
nt|pelu: so all leads = I have a higher card in this suit!!|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes horrible suit breaks for decalarer good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: if you have singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: lol:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: again OR just back,  I think the Italian waiters should be removed from that room!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: i would feel like the unluckiest person born|pg||
nt|peachy: I love all our Polish specs who help with NS system interpretation, for the benefit of all our gallery|pg||
nt|flash: 250 will be 6 IMPs back - tightening the match significantly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South find out, that this lead is a singleton?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|peachy: without def help, that is|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: @S9 is discouraging|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: nice start for decl|pg||
nt|hlortz: still looks like -800 though|pg||
nt|tez: 1 way ticket for 800:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is smart enough to know that N would not X with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with the 2 @S bid, the long clubs should be with S |pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: and they arent helping so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and so declarer. but what about defence?|pg||
nt|peachy: but not for 3C|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: EW seem to bid every game in sight -- and a little bit more|pg||

nt|Walddk2: also when he isn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess I would ask if you sit for the X on the N hand |pg||
nt|peachy: this could still we a tiny plus for BEAUTY against 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: hah, you belong to the school of "Always bid to win the post mortem" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- who thought that hand would NEVER end|pg||
nt|peachy: Lavazza not used to scores like this|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hawe45:  West is lucky here - a Multi would nok be a success|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - South opening|pg||
nt|tez: other room 4@s doubled..specs said:)|pg||
nt|flash: specs now up to 387 and still very little harassment...   i mean few comments   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the unlikely event that i passed originally as E, i doubt i could bring myself to pass 4S when pd bids it facing a passed hand at unfavorable vul with an unlinmited hand behind ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him. if i did summon such conservatism, and then watched 4S go down, i'd head for the bar|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not used to countries that drink tea instead of coffee either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that confirms it -- definitely NOT Precision|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|peachy: not much of fit anywhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And in 3 NT, you must hunt the 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yeah - @H not 3-3|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|marlowepi: S passes another opening bid by many standards|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, if the suits were majors I'd open.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I'd open S at any vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be better to have the minors reversed, but you cant have everything all the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an interesting problem over 1H. i dont think 2H gets the job done. prefer 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: splinter would be my choice|pg||
nt|xenya: or cruel rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: does making only 4 seem 1 too few?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: Maybe someone in the audience can tell us what 2@D is|pg||
nt|peachy: club position fortunate|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts never break friendly in Japan|pg||
nt|peachy: aonly a few ricks for declarer here, we'll see how few|pg||
nt|peachy: tricks*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This time - in 3 NT - the @D-suit must be handled well|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might even keep West out  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Brave man, East|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: on this day in history, a modern, aggressive player passed a rotten 11-count in 2nd chair...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise no entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: which would in your book be weaker, Pass or 4D by N over 3H?|pg||
nt|tez: makeable 7@h..i belive they will stop 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam in board 5 was missed in OR (4@S + 3)|pg||
nt|tez: they are not playing with open cards:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting the OR is connected to us  but we are not reconnected to them |pg||
nt|sybarra: or should I say they were|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for a double of 4@H at MP?|pg||
nt|jtr: Might be necessary|pg||
nt|jtr: If we make 3@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but not that UNfriendly, surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 10-13, 2NT asking - 3@C = minimum, 3@D asking for singleton, 3Nt = singleton @S|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c pls|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X making, so 5@CX only cost 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At this level no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: (not being picky sorry)|pg||
nt|hlortz: that IMP on 21 is suspect even it looked like 660 to me tho maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 2@C may be  18-19 bal   [same as EW 2@D opener]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: You'll get 200 here, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
nt|po-s: is this a hand that wants ruffs or to tap declarer?|pg||
nt|po-s: tap apparently|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he would be happy with four - that would mean his opponents could make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they can - may have stolen the pot here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be beaten |pg||
nt|xenya: with careful defence|pg||
nt|peachy: three unescapable losers, will be a ppush|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||
nt|tez: wrang i m here ..trust me pls:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 11 tricks to me too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6 trumps, 2 ruffs, 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|s7|nt|flash: and, lo and behold, the auction proceeded smoothly (in both rooms)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another NT-bid without a sure stopper...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost same auction other room,  but instead of 2 nt, E bid 2 sp |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  @d break will be big disaster for declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: apprximately 2 down?|pg||
nt|xenya: well W dropped a trick when he failed to put up the Q, but that was far from obvious?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes you told him 7@H he could have just bid 6 LOL|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now no @D-finesse|pg||
nt|flash: low @S a bit surprising?   North would like the 9 to lead the Q, but...|pg||
nt|flash: ah - there was a 1@S call...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Any lead 660|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA, 3 clubs and 2 diamonds, including a ruff |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mistiming let's @HT score?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The non-competitive auctions continue.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: one spade and two clubs would be different|pg||
nt|hlortz: /relate/|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nie had conquered the world of  "Go" some 20 years ago and turned his interest to bridge in recent years.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, u r right, four|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But here only 600|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cancel, too early here|pg||
nt|peachy: he can still take 9|pg||
nt|peachy: or more if def allows :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So in fact it was a good lead, leading the @S King, and West takes 11 tricks - here only 9|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead in OR, that ALONE tells me it was a good lead, plus, I would have led Q or 10 = further evidence...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N plays a third spoade and throws a D, so can W, and E plays a fourth spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not 100% inescapable. but the defense is easy enough|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door 4@s made when defence offered @c trick to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that South, who had a maximum for his initial pass, did not take some action when a weak no trump came back|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain by noticing that the players at this level aren't afraid to pause and consider their play(s)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: or that in Strong Club context, he didnt open|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain even more by noticing when they pause|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: so you will be in Reno next month?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: probably private, too :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|peachy: well, justice served, in a sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry provate|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps an endplay in diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does @CK transfer threat for a squeeze?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems to me that either way W gets an overruff. maybe i am missing something|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, not much chance to catch up if the cards dont cooperate by giving some options|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gracelin: Thanks for the trainingin "Go", he is a very good card plaer in bridge, but his biddng is a bit old fashioned.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|flash: @C2 is UDA - encouraging|pg||
nt|peachy: where could he get rid of them?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen some New Zealand and Australian pairs using this 2@C opener -- but don't recall ever seeing it from an ACBL representative|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tez: no|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  End-plys possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  play|pg||
nt|peachy: The open room had some conn probs in earlier matches|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H Ace, @C KIng, @H back and the @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South knowa WeatÂ´s distribution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And doesÂ´nt matter, whether West has single og double @H from the beginning|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But badly enough, the @C Jack comes down, which means 10 tricks without this endplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: so he overkilled |pg||
nt|tez: no=undo|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: note that NS are lucky in that S has the @S8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: Lavazza has now bid to slam on 22 -- off two top tricks -- so the rout continues.|pg||
mc|11|nt|peachy: i dont understand this|pg||
nt|peachy: it may be a failing on my part!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, East didÂ´nt tahe the @C Ace, sleeping !!!|pg||
nt|peachy: the pause here probably is some external prob, surely declarer is not thinking like this'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now safe to play last trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing hearts|pg||
nt|hlortz: surely only 620//|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you giving too little credit to EW then :)|pg||
pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|janm: I love to bid over the opponents' strong clubs, but the North hand has too little shape and too many values |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|janm: 1@d presumably negative and 1@s probably natural (only because I'm looking at his hand & it wasn't, otherwise it might be a double negative)|pg||
nt|janm: Sorry, "it wasn't alerted"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: This might have gotten them a little too high, with only one spade trick and the hearts not lying at all well|pg||
nt|larrymori: this is not a promising contract|pg||
nt|janm: If the Italians can stay low in the other room, the match will be getting a little more even|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pbundy: they stayed low enough to go plus|pg||
nt|janm: I'll bet on only 7 tricks for declarer, and another 5 IMPs for the Italians|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; the contract needs a lot of racing luck - and - not there|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm: Bocchi setting up his side's tricks, without giving declarer any he's not entitled to|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||

nt|pbundy: plus - that wouldn't get him 9 - so - he didn't go for it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|h4|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome to Bart Bramley |pg||
nt|ahollan1: it couldn't cost to cash that last trump :(|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  lot of spades by NS, but 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: This could be trouble for N-S|pg||
nt|peachy: a lucky 12 tricks here, but we'll see|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - 1NT was 14-16, which explains why it bought the hand on the previous deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: hi Bart|pg||
nt|tez: hi Bart:)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS in OR also missed 3NT in board 4 - so the standing is 3-33!|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 very exciting pais here Kit,  however  because of crashes rooms not connected,  Peter has running score |pg||
nt|bbramley: can zmud bid 1NT here to show 4@S and minor?|pg||
nt|flash: halfway through the match - close and entertaining|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tez: negative free bid working here|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the end of day 2  Lavazza was in the lead of the 12-round swiss qualifying|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: this 4S is too strong for my standards, cannot have two side suits controlled|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing 1nt=long minor and major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i already said the defense was easy. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know what they did in match 9|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: is that raptor? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is there a name for it|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 31-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final|pg||
nt|peachy: seems the organizers dont post match results until the following match is completed, been that way so far|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: oh oh   |pg||
nt|peachy: oh well, guess it works to mix it up...!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S took a line of play that could never succeed there|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm rooting for the Netherlands to get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't know the name, i just know how they play|pg||
nt|peachy: best bridge on the planet in front of us, what a treat|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  They might be there after board 7 - but we need OR-result|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, they lost 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure you have played agst them |pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D? -- major + minor?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well lookee here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Saved |pg||
nt|peachy: I guess they will get to this slam now, E showing shape I assume|pg||
nt|flash: how light does one open in 3rd chair?   the more lead-directional the call, the lighter it might be???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=one-round force|pg||
nt|chick: a clear violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone else prefer to pass 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S absolutely needed trumps 22 because one club had to be ruffed to set up the suit, and later a spade had to be ruffed. if Ds are 3-1 the hand cant make|pg||
nt|peachy: but don't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass would be eminently sensible|pg||
nt|chick: no, but I prefer to bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would prefer 1N if semi-force or non-force|pg||
nt|jcwla: E did not switch to @S when in with @HA -- all went bye bye on the @D's -- 11 to Lavazza on 22|pg||
nt|hlortz: odd looking to me west dbls stiff in unbid suit  east with k 5th doesnt bid them|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8:  N  3NT-1 in the OR|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, Roland said earlier was made with +1 bd7|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard bids 2 @D,  if not I will |pg||
nt|sybarra: (over 2 @C)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- you just don't know what hand partner holds for 2@C when 1N is absolute force|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@H is an option|pg||
nt|chick: yes, raija, and it kept them out of a very good (but unfortunately unmakeable) slam|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22, EW in the OR did bid and make 3N on basically the same defence: @H lead ducked by N|pg||
nt|po-s: how about "Polish"?|pg||
nt|bbramley: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E apparently assumed N had announced 4 spades so the double would be more for clubs and hearts. not condoning that line of thought just attempting to explain|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless 2@H was xfer to @S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: no chance, without def erring|pg||
nt|tez: i m chicken..i have no idea for convention names|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello po, you are always welcome :)|pg||
nt|tez: hi PO|pg||
nt|othered1: which brings us back to playing the other 6+card fit a level lower :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would make it hard to play 2H, the single most likely correct contract when W doubles|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  any reason for West to bid immediately?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared a pass by North who could well have had a heart fit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: still - with no club fit..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait - errare humanum est|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  tourney site |pg||
nt|flash: still a long way to go for N-S to reach game after this start?   (the balancing X certainly helped)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hlortz: this will make with a good view in @H suit i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks - it is bedtime but I must see my expartner overbid - alittle|pg||
nt|peachy: i am betting on diam lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the Italian pairs often use DBL in mid auction to just say  extra points|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: holding four bad hearts i would incline to pass. game is unlikely and i have some defense. if pd bids after i pass, i will be very well placed to act, but if i bid 1N, i will have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to stop bidding before i have much usefuyl info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for Klinger if Apteker does Pass 1@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all that from a guy who has to blow the dust off the green card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA then ruffing finesse might hold this to down 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: and which one is ex?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (sorry I do not know) |pg||
nt|hlortz: needs a deep finesse here :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't think he can make it even with a perfect guess - more clubs will sink it|pg||
nt|tez: many thanks all..here 4.09 am..bye all..see you..enjoyed|pg||
nt|hlortz: really?n follow to 3 @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Tez @H  pleasant dreams |pg||
nt|bbramley: i see, henry, so he'll threaten to dump both spades - yes, that would be PERFECT guessing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  we have comfortable sitting at home, with coffee and double-dummy deals, not so they|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, pressure of a big event|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must be declarer at this board, we might see an NL-score  now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol yes the deep 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 4@H in OR - but here the lead: a small @S from S?????????????????|pg||
nt|hlortz: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: N did well to show his max, assumedly Dbl meant it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't quote me on that|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 imps|pg||
nt|pelu: to K|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said "ugh"  and would you believe there is spec with that bbo name? |pg||
nt|flash: if South, holding KJx, wouldn't bid NT, that was no longer a possible/plausible strain|pg||
nt|peachy: OR overcalled 1NT with S hand, no wonder they got to game|pg||
nt|hlortz: well unless 2@D xfer not making the case for it im just confused :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wel sure, but the question is why E ddnt bid spades. of course it shows extras|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  and world-wide watching |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now lead any minor for down 2  -- even @DJ works -- ruff, @HA  @D ruff @C uppercut to re-establish @C10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they bid 2D a;ready|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: so it could be a dblwhammy for them, dbld game and a plus unmaking slam.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hlortz: oops my bad lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a cnfusing auction:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: see i *said* i was confused.. meanwhile 3@C not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Raija predicted 23 a push so 35-12 at the halfway mark.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but he has an awfully good hand and i dont see a better call for him if he is going to bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it helps to know that both of the round kings are offside :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even on a @D-lead from East, you should have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|po-s: must be a commentator|pg||
nt|peachy: lost that one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i guess that works too|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: Won @DK at trick 2, advanced @CQ and got clubs wrong later, playing for the double finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: Merijn home here, fortuitous rightsiding|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|peachy: in a dition to different club play then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|bbramley: that will simplify the defense - if he hadn't cashed @SA it gets complicated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 4-4 in majors on S odds are good for a @d Hx on S|pg||
nt|hlortz: lavazza lucky on bd 22 or it would be lots to not much|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Not sure how much -150 is worth|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: about 5/58 at the moment|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: But looking at past hands in this match, I dont expect them to be in slam other room, no matter how biddable|pg||
nt|peachy: I am glad that the big name teams are not yet on vugraph, giving others the chance to experience that thrill as players|pg||
nt|flash: of course, Mandala, youngster that he (still) is, decided that the South hand was a 1NT overcall   :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Make that 180|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: it was a clear misdefense by E in the other room. he simply did not analyze the hand. |pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: but i can't wait to see the result from the other room on 23|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: bah needed ot be small sp|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i think Giorgio Duboin was the  1 ranked player in the world for many years -- with a recent overtake by frequent teammate Fulvio Fantoni|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin gonna make this well done,,|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|nt|flash: again, in a short match, a huge swing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 NT seems better than D|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 4-card @S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  "names" will appear in finals - it's obvious )))|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, no doubt, including some excellent japanese teams who might be there|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: South is not enjoying this hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|xenya: from what we've seen before, looks uncharacteristic that EW stopped short of game here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so well played by E|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Nice defense|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|janm: And a quiet part score hand - much as we all hate to let the opponents play 2@s, oops - wrong! East couldn't stand it and shows the other two suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbundy: i would surely bid with east's hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: Well, EW seem to have bought it for something they can make, with the black suits so favorable|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must be a strong field|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It ain't bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct declarer technique on Boards 1, 4, and 7 in this room would have the MY team up by about 30 instead of struggling|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also here a couple of IMPÂ´s for Italy - just taking their tricks|pg||
nt|flash: seems unlikely that Lavazza will lose IMPs on this one?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam! |pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 3NT in the OR on a @C lead from N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: another good slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ken Rae is from the Shetlands|pg||
nt|peachy: a likely 3NT here now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East has a difficult lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that could very well be a Strong Two |pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure it is|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a rare beast|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18 5+ H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D 4+ [unless 4=4=3=2]|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: Nunes still in the box after @SK|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like he was down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even a spade lead does not defeat 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9:  S  4@SX-3  500 to EW|pg||
nt|peachy: partscore deal here, most likely|pg||
nt|po-s: you´re such a blood thirsty person|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is a scope for variations|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: chance for North-South to retaliate by reaching a lucky slam of their own - 6@c and 6NT both make if played by North (who has bid clubs)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After 2 @D -- West will have some work to get to 6 in a black suit |pg||
nt|peachy: they better play well, it is not easy to take 9 there|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Normally E/W would make 620 in 4 @H, but here...|pg||
nt|xenya: not normally, PO, no|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S = what guys?  1 nt|pg||
nt|bgn: no thanks, not today. Just watching NEC :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do EW play 2/1 GF even in comp? or neg free bids?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: crucial moment, go or not to go|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm betting no|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: time for Blackwood |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 NT on the N hand is excellent|pg||
nt|peachy: even if one does raise on three sometimes, doing so with S hand would be sick|pg||
nt|peachy: 2c is 10+,  GF if fit and then 2+ cl|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 4 @H you get 12 tricks - in 6 6 @H only 10|pg||
nt|flash: these stopperless NT calls are frightening!!!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: i dont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defeating this 4 @H will bring NL in front|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think the real score is 10-17|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of science in action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 controls I am told|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Geoff Breskal won the Gold Cup many years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: many many years ago|pg||
nt|hlortz: indelicate but effective|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David Edwin in the audience remembers when|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this event is well-known for collecting "names" in Yokohama, the organizers do their best to attract "stars" giving national players fine possibility to compete  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no good lead for South|pg||
nt|peachy: Have to stay away from spade lead to have any chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best he could do|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - 6@c, as a spectator points out, will not make if East leads her diamond|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: a case for cashing the ace - not done|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way, and 2@D looks like an artif GF, or maybe this range balanced|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|peachy: this is more a lucky one than the 6NT was, there he only needed spade finess|pg||
nt|gracelin: I was in Yokohama for the NEC cup last year.  This Latin team did very well but they are missing Diego this time.|pg||
nt|dburn: all academic - they aren't going to bid a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3 Ds need heart shift|pg||
nt|peachy: this at least one down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately our operators do not speak English, so I can't explain how to reconnect after a crash|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is a bilingual specctator to help Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's all in our manual, but that's also in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: they soudn't.  This is amuch worse slam than last board which only needs a finesse.|pg||
nt|peachy: is Diego B in another team or not there this year?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: this might be tricky both for declarer and  defenders|pg||
nt|po-s: that HQ is a good card, otherwise declarer might have  difficulties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This one should depend om finding the @S Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we think 2 @D= 18+ |pg||
nt|pelu: they play tranfer-ans on 1@C - so 1@S sh be a normal 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm little conservative with 25 hcp total|pg||
nt|hlortz: but i guess they are high enough|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: tk he is not cming thisyear.|pg||
nt|flash: semi-sensible lead for a push...|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: 2H is just begging for EW to bid the vul game and make it by finessing partner for H queen which they would not otherwise do|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was thinking of sac in those colors?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not every lead kills this 4 @H - but IÂ´m sure, the @C Ace did|pg||
nt|peachy: seems this is now going set, straining my eyes for way to make, but no|pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto is a great player but not the miracleman|pg||
nt|bbramley: plenty high - even with a moderately friendly lie i don't think he'll make it|pg||
nt|pelu: in 4@H Nunes played @H to 8 and A in trick 2!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it wasn't easy i guess |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: not sure when   late 70's    early 80's I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative shift that turns out to be good|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it was safe|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe two if def really alert|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East might think, that South is in position to get a @C-ruff - not North. He must play @H Ace and another @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- this could have been dead minimum 2@H  [5+@H, 10+ HCP]|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Hi David|pg||
nt|flash: i'm getting some coaching in the 'modern' game - distribution first; stoppers later...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, minimum, but not dead minimum. the suit is good, and there is a residual fit for E, and the hand has 2 aces|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: still could be achieved i think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: with 3 1/2 defensive tricks??|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stay with us, you are on soon anyway|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6N+1 52/58|pg||
nt|gracelin: Seems EW use a similar scheme like CAPP against opponent strong club opening.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The stopperless NT is called practical bidding. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but giving up over 2@C is a mystery -- that appears to be the winning approach|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: one pair made 7N by South|pg||
nt|ady: bet possible for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1977 it was. Thanks to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13 tricks, I suppose|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|flash: something about old dogs and new water dishes...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: might as well have used the HK, what else to do with it?|pg||
nt|peachy: toss it under the ace?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will do next time|pg||
nt|pelu: but still down 1|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: why a club shift? and if that is what E asked for, why did he?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think my copy of CC says 1st discard is upside-down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart would seem marked from both sides of table|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bbramley: i like his line of play: he needed 1 of 2 club finesses through south, plus the spade finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: really? spade to king?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  I bet - that is a push :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW make some diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: 4 more tricks for declarer, 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 11 IMPs to NL   21-17|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: sorry still on previous|pg||
nt|bbramley: whoa, didn't someone bid 3NT?  i must have been seeing things|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes i thought you must have :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||

mb|p|nt|pbundy: the italians may well think they are ahead; not expecting to lose on the vulnerable slam hand, i would guess|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|sybarra: just a question for the commentators:  do you think the players can feel the "flow" of the set?|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|nt|pbundy: oh definitely.|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT?!?|pg||
nt|pbundy: although, as mentioned - sometimes you have no idea that something bad - or good - has happened at the other table|pg||
nt|pbundy: no double no trouble|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pbundy: well; sort of :)|pg||
nt|janm: Of course they don't know exacty, but they surely know that the first 4 were good for EW and the rest even or good for NS|pg||
nt|janm: Can Bocchi infer the short diamonds in Madala's hand from the 3NT bid? He must know from his partner's bidding that it wasn't based on a lot of strength, so must have someplace to ...|pg||
nt|janm: run to if he got doubled and that has to be diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: If he knows partner is short in diamonds, 5@c might be biddable|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pbundy: wow; now we can see why people make a bid like 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Obviously the A of spades and K of hearts are great cards, and Qxxx in support of partner's second suit, but...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|c2|pg||

nt|peachy: you keep spilling them?|pg||

nt|peachy: oooh|pg||
nt|peachy: giggle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @S bid by South -- 3@D is no walk in the park|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 3NT failed by 3 in the OR so Lavazza to within 35-18.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/goldcup/goldcupwinners.htm|pg||
nt|peachy: Marshall the standup comic :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, I think E should have tried for game by bidding 2NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's a Precision 1D opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: something seems to have happened to the website - board scores disconnected|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably sitting down however|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore in @s for EW|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ady: e/w sure to get to game   but should be down 1|pg||

nt|peachy: identical auction so far as in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this DBL gets more votes :)     |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very likely that 3N makes but 4H does not (or that both do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure notes talk about Matt's DBL - but i won't be able to find it in time :(|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: X by E should show extras, convertible vcalyues|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I dunno about that, E had only one club stopper|pg||
nt|bbramley: polish club, usually a weak nt, but sometimes...  18+ HCP|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton kings here one on one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: with his rabbi,  N  or S can make game in either red suit |pg||
nt|peachy: nice safe contract|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sfoxa:  could be too high (if NS find @h ruff) |pg||

nt|flash: only 21 HCP - and the opps are bidding...   |pg||
nt|peachy: but not any more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For a 21Â´er, North has a weak hand|pg||
nt|flash: now, i have a preference...   5-card suits are shown?  4-card suits aren't???|pg||
nt|peachy: not when the opp bid it?|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I misunderstood|pg||
nt|flash: now you're teasing?   3@C puts things up a level, but we're not escaping this any more cheaply??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will South rebid 3@S over 3@C or ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S helps with shape, but without an honor  yuk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4D autosplinter (if ti is)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will show his shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 4@D is minorwood  [RKCB in @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - the key is that south needs to hear about @H filler to really get excited|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Oh, that 5-level again|pg||
nt|pelu: coprrection : Nunes maded 41Hs - correction by operator (misclicks)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep thought if he played @H to the 7 he'd make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will e/w get in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec points out 4 @S makes |pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@D=artif weak, 1@H=nat but could still be a weak nt (F1?), 2@D nat NF|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@S makes, lose 1 of each|pg||
nt|sybarra: no doesnt make,  think it loses a trick in each suit,,  |pg||
nt|flash: might North have called 2@H over 1@S, instead of Xing again?   (thnx, Deb)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When I was young(er), this pass was for playing 2 @D RD|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm having a conversation with two specs, forgive my inattention please|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise they can make bluff-RD|pg||
nt|flash: only 2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I agree...!|pg||

nt|kakasi: I[v[ÌÊð\¦·é½ßÅ·B|pg||
nt|hlortz: now 4@H from n?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems unlikely that spades will play better than clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, I would, but I am not them :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||
nt|peachy: 9 count and support|pg||
nt|po-s: will East be satisfied with 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: 4C|pg||
nt|sybarra: right bart, I shouid double check  what spec say :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki finally reveals his true nature|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: or 6? no..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C looks fine|pg||
nt|po-s: he won´t get much cooperation I think - well maybe 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easte must have been very close to a D|pg||
nt|flash: certainly i expected partner to make this call - if i didn't bid 3@C earlier, i pass and try not to look too ready for the axe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hard bid to explain is not Matt's double but rather 5H|pg||
nt|chick: wonder why he ran from 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bingo!|pg||
nt|peachy: now P|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont hold up your bingo card yet, they have not IDed a spade control yet|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, after the lead and the favorable DA position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker may have given the show away with his DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be tickled pink to play 5DX after W volunteered the suit over my X|pg||
nt|chick: but he can't let it go undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course -- failure to hear a 4@D call probably means some @S values -- but who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: defense wants to make sure declarer has an entry for the @D finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: a little relief here for Zimmermann, match is not yet out of hand by any means|pg||
nt|flash: a sexy 3 IMPs?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he uses it toplay trumps...|pg||
nt|po-s: then a small which is wrong if KJ bare|pg||
nt|peachy: dia shift there could have held but partner's suit is normal |pg||
nt|peachy: I think 4H was an offer to play, |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Duboin's silence against 1@S-2@S has paid off with 6 more on 25 as Bulgaria's E/W got to 2NT/W-2.  Lavazza to within 11.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this is why 3@S probably wrong|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: bidding 2N does not rule out getting to 3H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: 4H|pg||
nt|xenya: no matter what W does now, declarer will only lose 2 more trumps |pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i like 4D better than 3S--the slam interest is underscored, as opposed to 3S|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S was not a strong effort, i think, N should put S in the picture with some sort of fit-showing club bid|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes then 4@H clearly control bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 4D-4H, now S can bid 4N=  "i am still interested, but i dont have a spade control"|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, I dont think 4H was control, he has to show it at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: but again, I dont have their notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and another keypoint for partnerships   would 3@C-4@C be forcing?  [key is to be on same page]|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: she can pitch a @H forcexample|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  now it's 5 more imps for NANIWADA|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chick: it was a 16IMP swing on the 6@D fiasco|pg||
nt|po-s: trump ace I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: even then he has an re-entry on @H10 - to take the @D-finess :(|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, OR stayd in partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: a ping-pong match|pg||
nt|jcwla: Already 10 coming to Bulgaria, slam would have been an extra 5.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|bbramley: keeping control against spade tap|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to specs: sorry rooms not connected,  we are trying our best to keep running score |pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: ah, scores are back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Healthy lead Sandqvist-McIntosh have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But much can still happen in an uneven field|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any views on 2@S there/|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, this event seems to revolve around how well you kill the less experienced pairs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon it's a bit quacky |pg||
nt|hlortz: i dislike the ambiguity of 2@S limit *or better*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Being in the right place at the right time|pg||
nt|jtr: That too|pg||
nt|chick: the other table bid 6@D but made it|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki will wonder why wrang didn't lead his (necessarily) singleton diamond - might drop it for that reason|pg||
pc|hA|nt|flash: i've had a suggestion that X of 2@H might not have been penalties...   the 'modern' game strikes again?  all Xs below 2NT are t/o???|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was lucky they DID bid it, the loss would have been significant|pg||
nt|hlortz: better a natural entry to dummy , it looks suspicious if you LET declarer get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: Al Holland in other room had same |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|s4|nt|po-s: why the SQ?|pg||
nt|flash: the Open Room auction certainly looks ripe for a penalty X|pg||
nt|flash: (move your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen to see the auction_|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hlortz: passing 4@C in OR was quite a position....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking over these boards, it must be acknowledged that there were a few interesting decisions to be made. but most of these IMPs have slithered one way or the other due to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: essentially unforced errors|pg||
pc|cT|nt|po-s: shouldn´t he have played another club to indicate he doesn´t know anything abt diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to agree|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: too bad about the error in decl play, pressure pressure of big event|pg||
pc|c5|mc|12|nt|bbramley: i say he drops it|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3NT is a take out at @D if Xed. Did Madala do well?|pg||
nt|janm: NS seem to have trusted Stefanov to have values for his bid, not realizing it was just a route to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|larrymori: if south can bid freely, it seems that north should have bid game|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|pbundy: well; NORTH trusted him to have his values :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|janm: We've seen that South doesn't always have his values, though :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2 suiter and the 3nt psych is exposed|pg||
nt|larrymori: but he did drive it to the 4 level|pg||
nt|pbundy: i must admit i wouldn't pass with north's hand.  even if south is bidding "only" on lots of shape, north's cards sure seem to be working|pg||
nt|pbundy: i also much prefer only 2NT w/ east's hand here|pg||
nt|pbundy: seems to soft and skimpy for 3@C|pg||
nt|larrymori: k@h A@s are big side suit cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: EW seem to like to bid thin games|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|pbundy: and it may pay off after north clearly didn't have an obvious spade lead - or club|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|sybarra: making way too many here...   wonder why no @S return |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, even 6 |pg||
nt|peachy: interesting hand here, we'll see how the players deal with it|pg||
nt|po-s: who is Vondracek (was hoping sombody else wd ask)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N kind of made that comeback for them|pg||
nt|sybarra: well true |pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 6 @H in the OR hee |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 7 IMPs a board...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: heres a sexy little number|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh should I say W is and E is still thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: why is that, Henry?|pg||
nt|peachy: S is strong enough to open naturally, with longest suit, follow up with diamonds twice|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, interesting. as for me, I hate hands like S's - points in short honours and main suit (@c) w/o controls |pg||
nt|peachy: hah, if gets a chance...|pg||
nt|flash: natural; limited|pg||
nt|flash: asking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 7H to get a trump lead:)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sfoxa:  E will give a hand|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: ew could scramble 8 tricks in s[ades|pg||
nt|peachy: ooh, and they are going for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: major suit cards placedbadly for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H??!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  time for W to show big fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open room have finished by now|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes if a world class defender puts u in dummy dont finesse...!|pg||
nt|flash: 6-card suit; no outside 4-card suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jtr: Great bid:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is N a chicken?|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, I would just bid 3D, 3S sounds too weak|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps 3S is their sys|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best game on EW 3nt on W|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is a near Yarborough -- the @D10 spoils the picture |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Art Garfunkel?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=5+@H & 5+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester makes no other|pg||
nt|po-s: will East comply - Lebensohl probably|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S is a good bid - for E/W, now East waill avoi the @D-lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
mb|2N|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: they also play CAPP over 1NT opening, so 2D shows both maors.|pg||
nt|flash: practical call?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not Garfunkel   this GF gets more respect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=@D   go figure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has now bid only only the suit in which he has about 6% of his HCP :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and in the OR they are in 6 nt by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: with a sp lead |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the unbid portion of his hand his per capita HCP average is 2.5 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Klinger had option to bid 4@H to show solid/1-loser suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I almost didnt belive that he took the @D-finess -|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: no double from South, slightly surprising|pg||
nt|jbgood: point taken|pg||
nt|po-s: doubledummy on a spade lead ducked and another spade...|pg||
nt|po-s: give up a club and a diamond, then throw South in at the end for a heart favor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to bid 3S here i think, and then W will bid 4D|pg||
nt|peachy: this game, if they stretch, could also make if def finds a wrong lead|pg||
nt|peachy: so match not over yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S is Puppet to 2N   making 3@C INV   [where immediate 3@C would be game force]|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another monster result for Bulgaria here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Strange decision - West has the hand for bidding 4 @S|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose the operator will catch up with comparisons when has a chance|pg||

nt|po-s: but he might simply go for hearts in a simpler fashin|pg||
nt|po-s: fashion|pg||
nt|po-s: DJ isn´t very good either, is it|pg||
nt|xenya: it is not|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@H looks down 1, -50 a good save vs. 3@D making 110 or 130|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E decided there was no way to show, so he i susing KC hoping to hide his hand as declarer:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: EW are adopting the NS strategy of self-destruction :(|pg||
nt|peachy: bit score relief for Naniwada now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6 more imps for NANIWADA |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: so, Lavazza team MUST stretch to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duboin has perfect picture to find 4@H jumpm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bocchi is the best at stretching:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: oh, thats why he is so tall?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|po-s: so it leaves a club or a heart|pg||
nt|xenya: complex hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 3 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s it - you sit up here in the cold North, trying to find out, how to bid 4 @S - and North just did it|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very bad lead this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure about result on 10, but before it was 22-17|pg||
nt|peachy: as well as her own|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds heavily in favor of W shortness being in Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 2 top hearts and Ds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Now Herman just needs to find Forrester's entry to get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Keep looking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: little does he know it's in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he must have one after 3@H without A and Q, right?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North had no good lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: although he might suspect it |pg||
nt|po-s: this way is no good though|pg||
nt|sybarra: down 3!! |pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: maybe the @CA and another would have been better?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East just wanted to se the @H-signals from N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Unblock...|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps nothing is lost yet|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Voila they say in France|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a low club lead fro N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: responses to RKC are 1430 ONLY when trump=@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|po-s: but now North can break communications should declarer duck the diamond|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: Bas really didn't want a ruff, I think he was trying for a lead not to give a trick or something|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|ady: this likely to be around average     double for north might have gain quite a bit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht can happily keep the @HK8 over dummy's @HQ7|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: preserving more options this way perhaps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 5@S showed @HQ  said nothing about @S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: I would think a higher club from W would make it clearer for partner to return @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Endplay for overtrick instead|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but playing the sox off this hand!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: yes, Lin is a very agressve bidder.  Nie didn't take account for that.  |pg||
nt|peachy: indeed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|peachy: Bob Drijver, sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 pickups in a row will put Oz in the lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: seems it's a good thing (for EW) that W's hand is closed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bbramley: yes, good trump plays, now an extra club loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: play k of @C ruff with ace of @H and ht.  home |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5/6/6/14|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if that 3rd D was ruffed, a spade could come back and heart queen could be promoted via another D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: 22-18|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What if East now ruffs an uncovered @C Q???|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: two pairs in 6@S!|pg||
nt|po-s: post mortem: he could always make it if I keep the CK|pg||
nt|xenya: E's final pass may not be unreasonable (@SQJ looks like a waste), still a bit timid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: reverse black suits in W hand & very likely Ron would open at 4 level at these colors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S alerted because system on over DBL -- so MAX = 12 HCP|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, by 8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D best here i think|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|peachy: Open room was allowed to play in 4C, good for them|pg||

nt|gracelin: agree, Lin might double the weak NT opening with a stronger hand.|pg||
nt|flash: Multi - weak 2 in a major; 2@H pass or correct|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: anybody see a result other than down 3?|pg||
nt|chick: not unless E drops a card on the table accidently|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe down 4 if Klinger ducks 1st @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kakasi: 10Ô [hÌÊð³¦Ä­¾³¢ÆÌÅ·B|pg||
nt|flash: for those with a strong stomach, click on Movie; highlight this board; click on Open Room and use the Next button to see how the defense went astray in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction i mean|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: which rat's that, Roland? |pg||
nt|gracelin: they might wrongsided the 3NT cntract, but luckily, DJ is in north hand.|pg||
nt|peachy: must find H in either slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Puppet Stayman auction   3@D=at least 1 4-card major   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can do it a lot later in 6D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W shows 4 diamonds, winning heart play stands out|pg||
mb|5C|nt|po-s: tricky to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: @H switch beats it as we all can see -- but N can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: no spade lead and we are talking numbers...|pg||
nt|peachy: but thsat is of course seeing all four hands|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is the TOP|pg||
nt|peachy: I think diamond could possible be even better|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|Walddk2: One of my cats brought back a dead rat last night. Thanks very much|pg||
nt|xenya: yes he can|pg||
nt|peachy: no lead attractive from N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could go down smaller if ace of clubs club now:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the wonders of this part of the imp scale   300/400  still 14 IMPs -- thanks Nick|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: How was breakfast?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to our operator, and not least kaksi. We have an accurate score on the board now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well done guys!|pg||
nt|peachy: Bravo, kaksi, Roland and operator!|pg||
nt|peachy: kakasi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: kakasi whose real name is Satoshi Imai|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defence is @C Ace and a @H - double-dummy|pg||
nt|peachy: Groenenboom can play whichever club, he doesnt know yet it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West has the @H Queen, he will get it anyway|pg||
nt|po-s: good sacrifice in 5C|pg||
nt|hlortz: well the 10@H dropping is a clue also..|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  And @H 10|pg||
nt|peachy: probably will lead diamond, leastr self-destructive without seeing all hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has stronger spot cards in club but he might go after spade since he has no entry for the long club suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing now    4@S=RKCB  5@C=3 keycards, 5@D asks @HQ  5@S=yes and @SK|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|peachy: likely not making|pg||
nt|peachy: well, as long as they dont go for 7, all good for bulgaria|pg||
nt|hlortz: will E find a @C lead? i bet no|pg||
mb|6H|nt|peachy: chance to make six now|pg||
nt|peachy: and either works, even without entry to clubs, friendly hand for ew|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I goofed, clubs dont work LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: up k@D ruff a @H 2 trumps exit a @D think he could make dbl dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also OK|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, with 1-1 @Cs and double @H finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: reverse count|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  anyway, 5-6 imps back to Kitty's |pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that's greedy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is Ron's favorite application of Losing Trick Count:)|pg||
nt|chick: gutsy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can probably generate a couple hands where that was declarer's 9th trick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: is the discarding odd/even?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if they have way to find @DQ they were going to find the grand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: I think this will fall apart for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500 not unlikely|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jbgood: and a club to the king|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: what if N now cashed 5 clubs or so  |pg||
nt|chick: there are a lot of hands that N could hold where he could now cash 7 more tircks|pg||
nt|chick: tricks*|pg||
pc|hK|nt|po-s: well done|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I doÂ´nt like this @H Ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6@D over 5@S?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Verhees did very well to land 4@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must face thew facts partner MUST have values in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- Mullamphy's odd @S7 was encouraging|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: indeed -- does 2@S NS make?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: and he did|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still in time!|pg||
nt|peachy: it doesnt matter if he does or doesnt, entry to diam must be killed|pg||
nt|po-s: - it would be nastier to play back a club before taking the ruff...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hlortz: easy from up here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: all went well, as we already know.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  The 130 for Verhees will not be mentioned after the match|pg||
nt|peachy: so looks like Lavazza prevails in this match and keeps their  1 position in the running scores|pg||
nt|flash: Zimmermann won the Transnational Teams in Sao Paulo and has retained the same team for the Rosenblum in Philadelphia|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jtr: wow|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: i wonder whats going on, connection? or they thinking? or me?|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess south is thining, in case his partner has CA|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am not sure now. It's been too long.|pg||
nt|peachy: no way to contact the operator, they dont speak english or read|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: This was a good play, whats the name of this Deschapelles? even if declarer had Qxxx hearts, it was right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Merrimac Coup|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: Thanks Roland, I dont remember the names much :(|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: excellent|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Squeeze me oartner!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: well done in both rooms|pg||

nt|janm: Sorry, of course declarer needs to pitch dummy's club on the third spade honor|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|janm: But if E doesn't ruff, then declarer wins the K of diamonds but then maybe can't handle things since he can't give up the diamond or there will be an uppercut|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably Mdala|pg||
nt|rodal f: I feel|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Sorry - Presumably Madala's 1@s bid showed either a hand without 4 spades that wanted to bid, or perhaps diamonds - probably whatever it would have meant over 1@c if they're ...|pg||
nt|janm: playing transfer responses|pg||
nt|larrymori: what was double?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|janm: Not sure about DBL, but it sounds like extra values and nothing intelligent to bid|pg||
nt|janm: I don't think Bocchi was going to play 3@hx|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|pbundy: no :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|larrymori: certainly 4@h clarified it|pg||
mc|10|pg||

nt|marlowepi: can make double dummy of course. diamond king and spade finesse. but declarer should put in the diamond ten at trick one to try to force a dummy entry|pg||
nt|peachy: other table behind a bit, maybe still some connection issues? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what a bloody result next door!|pg||
nt|po-s: seems you lose a spade a heart and 3 minor tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N had 8 tricks he would probably just be taking them rather than letting himself go down 2 extra tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: yup, gold star to lavazza for the 6@D in the or|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|peachy: could well be duplicated here|pg||
nt|xenya: right, so the 3@D bid was not also quite natural but also correct|pg||
nt|po-s: - and perhaps one in the wash|pg||
nt|hlortz: undo?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the original Blue Team Club -- North would open 3@C  -- how's that for useless trivia|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: ah, no|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's not the end )))|pg||
mb|2H|nt|po-s: wrong bidders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert must mean 1@C=2+   which North surely has|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: 14 is the last board of the match; restart 10 minutes to the hour with the last match today|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps the issue here is the margin, rather than the outcome?  as long as both finish in the top 8, they advance to the KO phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: 2C?|pg||
nt|peachy: i like 2C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is more like a 2C opener than a 2C rebid|pg||
nt|flash: of course, the higher a team finishes, the more control they retain over their opponents in the KOs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment in Europe  is for 1x-(1@H)-DBL to DENY 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have another Italian DBL that can't be described confidently|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|Walddk2: yes, it only took 24 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: lets see how 3NT fares...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S or 4@C now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what now by S?  XX?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@H now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3C by N would have been an underbid|pg||
nt|chick: a nice reverse into 2@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17:13 in Japan now|pg||
nt|flash: 1@D shows at least 4 and a shapely hand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pelu: Operator -pl UNDO!|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C usually shows 9 card in the minors, either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to get it corrected |pg||
nt|bbramley: 3-1 trumps would have made it much more complicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker is liking this more and more with each round of bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: hasn't north done a lot of bidding, considering the @SK isn't full value?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: it may go 3S and 3NT, not a great contract.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H probably shows the 1444|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
nt|peachy: aceless softie, unless to my surprise 4C were forcing, cant be|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: a VERY lucky 3N...|pg||
nt|hlortz: w needs to overtake the @H trick 1 and play @S to beat 5@C easy for these guys im sure|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|peachy: not at all, 3S the last making one, but if EW in other room play 15-17NT (I dont know if they do) might go same way|pg||
nt|flash: although it might just be patterning out (1354 or 1345) with a max for not opening 1@C|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D-1S-2C shows 5-4 or 4-5 minors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are in GF and S is unlimited. N has good cards, good IN-OUT valuation|pg||
nt|othered1: Wouldn't north have bid the same, to imply stiff @S, if the @SK work a working K?|pg||
nt|sybarra: fast arrival "hopefully"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe aceless and somewhat soft, but all values are working|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: nice fit|pg||
nt|chick: at least they got into a makeable game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, might|pg||
nt|po-s: 3S shows good with short diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: according to sys card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- why so pessimistic?   [even if it is the max they can make]|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: nice judgment by Merijn Groenenboom|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I expect a flat board, losing 1 spade, 1 heart and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was same in other room (correctly) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently it was, but i dont know why S bid it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: theygot there anyway, at least|pg||
nt|peachy: in the other room, bulgarian EW put NS to a guess, well done|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||
nt|po-s: this time the hearts behave. You need to guess how to treat diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hlortz: fortunately this is a simple 4@S making so we arent missing anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might lose @C to ensure game??|pg||
nt|sybarra: only if @D's break I thnk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|peachy: our predictions havent really fetched tonightm have they Sveta :)|pg||
nt|xenya: @C shift was needed to beat it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@s on board 9:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 17:)|pg||
nt|xenya: imps|pg||
nt|xenya: lucky|pg||
mc|10|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be a simple cliam by operator (easiest) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: why not just transfer to @s' /|pg||
nt|peachy: would be pretty conservative not to be in game vul IMPs|pg||
nt|hlortz: so 6 imps for staying out of game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Terrific bidding by Bulgaria in this match.  No bidding on last bd at least in OR.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Depends whether they were in agreement about how much the DBL showed - if N thought it showed this much, he'd bid game; if S thought it didn't, he'd bid game.|pg||
nt|pbundy: wow - i'd have opened 1@D with the west hand|pg||
nt|janm: But your 1@d would show diamonds, Peg :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, i understand........... i'd do it with a big @C too tho - i think - despite almost no experience playing it!|pg||
nt|janm: Well, I think I'd downgrade and not open a weak NT with the W hand, and that's sort of what a Strong Club 1@d bid shows, so maybe not|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that we just ended with a whimper|pg||
nt|larrymori: yuppers|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Probably not|pg||
