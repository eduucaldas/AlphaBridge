pc|s6|pc|cT|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: declarer should lead the ten of hearts from dummy at an early stage. this has the most ways to win.|pg||
nt|roswolf: it might come down to south doing a crocodile coup in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: S can always overtake the Q@d|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was thinking..lead the @D3...ten, ace then maybe six towards dummy - if S plays low, N wins Q and has to concede a ruff-sluff, if the hand had been eliminated. Not possible now of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: course|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: the club jack is the pseudo threat|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: when S plays the ten od Ds on first round of suit, clear for N to unblock the queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then no crocodile necessary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will be most annoying for North in the other room if his team-mates come back with -100  |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heart length is surely with N, so if he has Qxxx (no nine) the heart ten on 1st round of suit works by brute force. even if he has Q9xx, he may not cover, and if perchance he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has Qx after all  it is almost sure he will not cover|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but.........|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think Hedy's reference to "@H 9x @@ S" was an endorsement of this play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if hearts are 33 it makes no difference which heart is led from dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe i should not have said it |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think if declarer had ducked a diamond earlier he might have pulled it off|pg||
nt|roswolf: i just dont see how the defenders can go wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 imps to harangozo rather than a 7 the other way = big swing in a tight match|pg||

nt|hedyg: i remember my 1st ever teamgame competition i was told: never double a partial except if you have enough SURE tricks to beat it in your hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: such as opps playing 3 M and you have AKQJ10 in the suit was the example i was given|pg||
nt|gulyas: slam only goes down cos of the 4-0 trumps in fact|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a little extreme but sound enough principle|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4D|nt|hedyg: just a little extreme :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4-0 trumps is not enough to beatthe slam, also spades must be 5-1|pg||
nt|csabi: and if they go down in 6@C they still win 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: makes no diff, u lose a @D and a trump (discard 4th @H on the @SK at end)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes fielders choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if spades wre not 5-1 it would be an easy make with correct single-dummy handling of trump suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would they go to 6@c when N passed twice first?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: well done, lot of imps coming in|pg||

nt|hedyg: but luckily for him he is only worried about making 11 tricks|pg||

nt|kemeny: 2cl is the forcing NT answer - they cannot stop in 2@c, but nobaody stops there anyway, and over 1nt its easy to give full description|pg||

pc|h5|nt|cicus: the main advantage of 1NT GFR is that the hand eventually playing NT is concealed|pg||

pc|s6|nt|cicus: 4@C, then pass achieved an undesired goal, the @C lead, after which the hand is cold|pg||
nt|cicus: if E had doubled, there were chances West would have found the @D lead|pg||
nt|cicus: or if E hadn't bid at all|pg||
nt|projekt1: but who did know it,that after seeing all cards a @d opening lead will be desired|pg||
nt|cicus: X would  have carried the message that he had some defence and that must be outside of clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: and then W could have exercised a judgement|pg||
nt|projekt1: well without 4@c could be the @d lead the favorite|pg||
nt|cicus: what E wanted was a @D lead, looking at his own hand - and he suggested otherwise|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, only a trump lead is successful now, but that is self-evident|pg||
nt|cicus: east will be kind of endplayed|pg||
nt|projekt1: I am not so sure, that after 3@c (both majors) he should mange the biding to achieve a @d lead. |pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|projekt1: it would be amazing if the player would themselves comment their decisions|pg||
nt|projekt1: also in soccer, every player would explain by their headsets what they think .. and the visitors could hear it |pg||

nt|gulyas: húzó parti|pg||
nt|cicus: alakul|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: W may suspect something|pg||
nt|cicus: but West knows S has to have something for his double when NOT SHORT in spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: az a kérdés, hogy a 3 dámájából melyiket hívja:)|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes it is a disadvantage to see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: from the commentator's point of view|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: lehet teríteni|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cicus: úgy értem, K-Ny mansgémje|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: no chance for EW|pg||
nt|cicus: if they play a forcing game, N crossruffs,|pg||
nt|cicus: if they draw trumps, spades are high|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact , even long|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: well played for a push|pg||
nt|projekt1: again 5-6 IMP closer |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and now he know nothing in @hs...|pg||
nt|projekt1: well Dumbovich can play despite a low @c the Q|pg||

pc|sT|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|cicus: and N did not bid more than 2@H with @DKQJ |pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: valaki elfelejtette, hogy hol volt a pikk 8as...|pg||
nt|projekt1: play with open cards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: oh my god|pg||
nt|cicus: so as we Hungarians say, 'hallgatni arany'|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: ?|pg||
nt|cicus: this hand is certainly a triumph for educated bidding|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c8|nt|sundiszno: he didn't let them guess themselves|pg||
nt|sundiszno: let's assume dumbovich would have got it right even honti would play a low club smoothly|pg||
nt|cicus: which means it's sometimes good to keep quiet|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzdm: N has queen of heart and no the queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: this board has sealed Honti's fate|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|cicus: az igazságnak tartozom annyival, hogy igen nehéz tök reménytelen felvételt játszani|pg||

nt|cicus: na, ebédszünet|pg||
nt|cicus: (legalábbis nálam) :)|pg||
nt|projekt1: jó étvágyat|pg||
nt|cicus: he played for the opponents having made a silly mistake|pg||
nt|sundiszno: an 8card suit for the end of this set|pg||
nt|cicus: well, it seems it's easier with open cards|pg||
nt|projekt1: so much about seal|pg||
nt|vugraphzdm: so the heart wasnt  good|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 3 comparisons left|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and 20 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: két õrült, vagy vmi nem úgy történt, ahogy láttuk:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzdm: last board of the segment now|pg||
nt|cicus: excellent open room result|pg||
nt|projekt1: to play 128 boards in 2 days is something, like to run 42 km.   a Marathon|pg||
nt|cicus: if you are rooting for Harangozo|pg||
nt|sundiszno: can be repeated here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: 14 fejütés|pg||
nt|cicus: isteni illatok jönnek a konyhából|pg||
nt|cicus: tough decision, 3NT and 3@H and X may all be right|pg||
nt|cicus: 3NT is a good practical choice|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: kis hamis|pg||
nt|sundiszno: szalay and harangozo bidding till 4@d with this crazy hand, but didn't get doubled|pg||
nt|sundiszno: strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: van, aki ezt a 3@H-t jobb színnek játssza (én is)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I doubt the result will be duplicated, though|pg||
nt|sundiszno: you need 6,67 imps/comparison :)|pg||
nt|cicus: W has to double now if Hont wants to win this match|pg||
nt|cicus: they can win 10 IMPs playing 4@S redoubled|pg||
nt|sundiszno: operator stuck|pg||
nt|sundiszno: but 4@s was made with an overtrick|pg||
nt|cicus: this trump suit presents a suit play problem: what play is best if you want to lose only 1 trick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|projekt1: a very strong play from Harangozo-Szalay|pg||
nt|cicus: someone will have to bid 3NT if they are to play it|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|projekt1: a suit preference in @c to let ruff a @h is the easy way |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|cicus: mert ha nem biztos, hogy ez lehet az aduszín, akkor csak kizárjuk a partnert|pg||
nt|vugraphzdm: szerintem o ugy gondolta hogy biztos ez lesz aduszin|pg||
nt|cicus: Mit jelent erre ugyanis a 4@C? Kulcslicit? Önálló szín?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sundiszno: dbl is polish, meaning don't lead @ss|pg||
nt|sundiszno: ...maybe|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: Maybe xxx of @Hs and @DK not pulling full weight should have restrained S from bidding 4|pg||
nt|projekt1: @h2 from Dumbovich and after the tump ace a low @c|pg||
nt|cicus: hard to pass though with 2 kings|pg||
nt|cicus: well, bidding is only an approximation in many cases|pg||
nt|cicus: uhhhh|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|sundiszno: that's a lot|pg||
nt|cicus: 9 away|pg||

nt|cicus: but with those minor doubletons...|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|cicus: zárom soraimat, sziasztok|pg||
mc|11|nt|cicus: I admit I don't know the solution|pg||
