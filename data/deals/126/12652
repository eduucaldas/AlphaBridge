nt|gracelin: the qualifying rounds are half way through.  The last qualifying spot last year is 192 VP, or 16 VP/match. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lavazza has scored 21 VPs on average after 6 matches|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Zimmermann close behind|pg||

mb|1D|nt|peachy: NEC Bridge Festifal|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone and welcome back |pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - He will sure risk 2 @S|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and now?|pg||
nt|peachy: esciting hand, afteralll|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the current leaders versus  2|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oh well, cant spell|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Raija Davis, Hans Werge and Jim Gordon|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hlortz: well called peter|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H should make because of the @c discard on the @S Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and with this lead...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|peachy: W got worried and pulled|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|flash: a bit harsh to attribute a result to a normal lead?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S 10 was an option|pg||
nt|flash: the trump split will slow declarer down a bit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Polish Club, EW 5card major and 15-17NT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|flash: declarer will probably start on one of the pointed suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His problem is, that @S King might be by the 1 @D-bidder |pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is weighing his options|pg||
nt|flash: mentally going through each possible line - trying to find the safest/ most reasonable|pg||
nt|flash: all not lost if the @SK off-side|pg||
nt|peachy: against this opposition, it pays to be careful|pg||
nt|flash: that looks like the most probable choice from here|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has a rather strong clue to the location of the @DA...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
nt|flash: declarer's problem, if the @SK is, indeed, offside is the lack of an entry to hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Both of these teams are prime candidates for winning the whole event|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may accept the invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should we say it this way - @S-shift was not killing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Yokohama. hi to all|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had few options, but that certainly clarified/simplified things for declarer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: now should go down, he doesnt have the ricks any more|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: he lead 9, so....N had to count (3) |pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: oh you mean N  sorry |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They will get to 3NT eventually and that will make with spades 4-4 despite the awkward breaks in the minors|pg||

nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||

nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2N vul against not has limited appeal|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure Scotland wasnt joined to europe when he was there:)|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to overcall, perhaps on the basis that his hand is too good - immediate overcalls destructive in nature|pg||
nt|peachy: nt apparent;ly 16-18 or something|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Nice 5 @D - if they bid the slam|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: EW off the hook |pg||
nt|pelu: NS could also go for penalty against EW - 2@CX = 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say that the W hand looks more like what I usually hold|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes e came in expecting the weak hand in south|pg||
nt|dburn: if classical strong club, yes - 17-19 or even 17-20 more common ranges nowadays|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I'm old school|pg||
nt|flash: this is the kind of deal which decides matches - much less short matches like this|pg||
nt|flash: to some extent, the @D call helps North - whatever values South has might well include some in @Cs|pg||
nt|peachy: good decision, 5D would only tumble one or so|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: dblfits all around, and now that was brought to daylight|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - the lead must be a @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Service-double - earns nothing, helps N/S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: strictly speaking, yes, but you can get a fairly good count on the E hand i think|pg||
nt|flash: East suggests defense vs 5@Ss and strongly suggests that West not bid more (especially vulnerable)|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree with Jim's explanation, for what its worth|pg||
nt|flash: Hans actually sneaked in a good point - suggesting/directing the @D lead was important here|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  even w/o dbl - could be gain for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NorthÂ´s opening bid pushed E/W to game, equalling the match|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|hawe45:  Nice @D-suit - brings 4 tricks to East-West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - cancel|pg||
nt|po-s: Hans, asusual you are right - North will cover the Dten and yes, four tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why South volunteered a bid in front of partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
nt|peachy: this has chances to chke, and I think it will|pg||
nt|peachy: S sensibly signs off|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s 9 - "partner, I have clubs" - seems so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here than in OR|pg||
nt|flash: XX shows 1st round control|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: K or Q from S |pg||
pc|c7|nt|flash: notice that the @D lead would hold this to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I am surprise the diamond lead didnt come, after West's valiant effort|pg||
nt|flash: to quote David Berkowitz:  if  i'd bid @Cs, would you have led a @D????|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Yes true|pg||
nt|peachy: make*|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Nice for once to see instant scoring outside Scandinavia and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can we hope for America to follow suit?|pg||
nt|hlortz: in 10 or 20 years|pg||
nt|peachy: she could even play low and make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should have bid 5 @C - to get a @D-leas...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Duboin has ensured a diamond lead if they get to slam in the other room by bidding 5@D over 4@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S EW here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Will need to avoid 4 losers though|pg||
nt|gracelin: may need to guess the SQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or @DQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: First round finesses|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gracelin: if that fails, at least declarer still has an entry to dummy for the D finesse.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, this one may well produce a swing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zmud-Bal stopped in 5@S on board 3|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Spade to ten preserves entry to finesse diamonds or ruff third round high|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|davidstern: I will back declarer to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|xenya: with the @D lead indicated, that was a wise decision -- stopping in 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Sementa led a club :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: A home derby played last round where Oz Players (klinger et al) beat Oz two (Gill) 25-5 |pg||
nt|davidstern: Zimmerman should be 4@S here?? Thoughts ??|pg||
nt|gracelin: no wonder the losing team call themself OZ 2|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think only because they entered second|pg||
nt|gracelin: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: As I said Zimmerman should pass 3@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: he maybe happy with his decision when the hand is over.|pg||
nt|davidstern: They are bidding this hand in the CR 1S X P 1NT 2@D so West will be able to show hand at low level perhaps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|gracelin: maybe 2S by East and 3D by West, and East can bid 4S then.|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is one of those hands - if partner has one or two good cards @SQ and/or @DQ I want to be in 4@S if he has a blitz I will get doubled for penalty so all a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bidding still going but N/S have reached 2NT where they can make a total of two tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|davidstern: And that is where they are playing.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|davidstern: They @DK lead will minimise any possible damage|pg||
pc|c4|nt|davidstern: And heart switch for 8 tricks|pg||

mc|9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: EW 2@H perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see losers here|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 2 the overcall of 2 @C pushed e/w to 3 @D -1 |pg||
nt|hlortz: 3n here for ns will they bid it?|pg||
nt|dburn: he needed to, for some reason - not quite sure what that was all about|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - he went up with the jack on the first round of hearts|pg||
nt|flash: our skepticism of the board 2 result is the 1 IMP on the scoreboard so far|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: likely 3S by S|pg||
nt|dburn: but I don't have much idea why he did that, with K9x in his hand|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was a case of "monkey fell from tree"|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: this alert?  is it "could be 2" |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe playing for West to have @h10x and no entry, but that seems a bit of a view|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Still no game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not everybodyÂ´ s taste that 2 NT - facing a passed partner|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: this will be a very tight match, both teams have some of the world's best pairs playing,  and Fantunes, perhaps theeee best|pg||
mb|2D|nt|peachy: if S doesnt bid them now, the S willl be lost forever|pg||
nt|flash: X reasonable, but now without risk - my partners always bid 2@D...|pg||
nt|flash: note the 1NT call without a stopper|pg||
nt|flash: values first, shape 2nd??|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hlortz: anyone X 1@H with south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no thin double by South|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 cards suits?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  strange 1N... even if playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin has obviously heard "6-4, come alive"|pg||
nt|flash: and maybe even 6-5|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I erred, Fantoni-Nunes not playing now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can take the first 11 tricks against 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: JC doesn´t quite believe the explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: prob same as open rm|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N takes the push to 3...faster than I could type|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  why not a simple raise?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow aggressive double|pg||
nt|jtr: Just right at MPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in their lucky day EW win @s game|pg||
nt|peachy: good start, W raised|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main problem - to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: lose 2h and 3s|pg||
nt|flash: the stopperless 1NT does have its potential drawbacks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and against 2 NT also|pg||
nt|peachy: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: how about 3NT Hans|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: good decision by West here - that raise wasn't automatic|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm unfamiliar with ew system, for me raise would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|peachy: they did well|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sounds like penalties, with good hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: Aiming for the KOD Roland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S probably wanted to dbl the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going for the KOD is tempting at MP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KOD = Kiss of Death|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead - only a @S could give S some problems|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Let me count|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  Here they only get 10, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments from now...|pg||
mc|9|nt|hlortz: aka 200|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -200 at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead was better, and logical on the auction and the W hand|pg||
nt|chick: kind of a waste of the 10|pg||
nt|peachy: its cold, dont think any lead woulda caused a prob|pg||
nt|flash: but an important lesson:  the defenders can't see your hand...|pg||
nt|peachy: silence|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: 7NT and 7H is much better than 7S or 7D|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|gracelin: my guess of the final contract is 7H here.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|6C|nt|davidstern: Best if EW dont push too hard in clubs|pg||

nt|jtr: Even my grandmother would manage 9 i think|pg||
nt|jbgood: there are always a mix-up somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in Central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far the standard fo card play has not matched the quaity of the bidding|pg||
nt|tez: nicely played|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  @S-guess is worth 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S made E-W on that one, so a potentially very big 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here N/S can take the first ?? tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but somehow I doubt every pair will bid 7N|pg||

nt|pelu: now on slam-level|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely n/s draws a dble here |pg||
nt|peachy: 12-15 bal, 19+ any, and two more options|pg||
nt|flash: again, the multi-meaning 1@C opener|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  NS got lot of points again.  @h game? NT?|pg||

nt|hlortz: 5@H now??|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c opening means..nat or 16+any hand..polish club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I agree with 5 @H |pg||
nt|dburn: I neither - they were 19th in the standings after four rounds, but not sure what they did in their last match|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts n/s in a spot quickly |pg||
nt|tez: bid or not to bid..pass is not forcing i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: for all N knows,  S may have no clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: 16+ nat or 12-18 4441|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: 5NT? = I can play slam in 2 suits?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some will not even be in a grand slam. Just wait and see|pg||
nt|po-s: which it probably ewas|pg||
nt|xenya: on 18, EW in the other room didn't find the 4@S save -- 8 imps to World Youth|pg||

nt|tez: 6 enuf:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: he will bid pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree  but S has to like his hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@d by S seems to make things easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @d suit most likely the one in question |pg||
nt|flash: 2@D natural and VERY positive|pg||
nt|flash: grand slam easy from here - far more difficult to reach at the table?|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D 5+ C or D, usually gf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A 2 C-overcall by East, might have brought some trouble for N/S |pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C|pg||

nt|tez: and also 7@s..then:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (when he decides play) |pg||

nt|hawe45:  5 @C Voidwould - and South is taken by surprise|pg||

nt|flash: 5@C (obviously???) intended as exclusion - but....|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|peachy: so much to find out, even after 1H opening|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: operator may have missed the subtle pointing to bidding card |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in mp, rather be in 3N or 5@d?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A lucky 3 NT here |pg||
nt|po-s: Did he really make nine tricks on the previous hand?|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is take/out to @s..strong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 ball, or 18-19 ball or natural @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: N to double? |pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
nt|peachy: W has max and six cards, well done to Pass|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: how would you like to pass as E then put THIS dummy down in a mere 4 spades then watch pd go down?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Patrick Huang |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- when W didn't play his last spade to tap S|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s or pass i thk|pg||
nt|tez: :(|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: and that is a slightly aggressive responsive double by South, but part score swings are generated by pushing your opponents around|pg||
nt|flash: note the 2@C call - the 6-card suit outweighs the 4-card length in @Hs, despite the fact that partner is far more likely to hold @Hs than @Cs|pg||
nt|flash: but, we seem to have run into the question of whether the 'free bid' shows values|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the spade finesse is on I make 630 vs 620|pg||
nt|peachy: but|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks, Shrley and Hi all.|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was always going to bid 3@s, but no harm in seeing whether his opponents accidentally pass him out in 2@s doubled first|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||
nt|peachy: i see no chance for OT|pg||
nt|tez: they are leading 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again we see the lead middle from 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: EW can defeat 4@S on a @S lead (DD decl can 2xfiness in @D and make)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: all leads 2/4......better way to describe it   (thx spec) |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with the @S-vois, South has a few values|pg||
nt|hawe45:  void|pg||
nt|peachy: if 3D was GF he cant pass now...or can he|pg||
nt|flash: SJ Simon counseled :  how much worse could your hand be...    not much!!!???|pg||
nt|peachy: Also "How to bid misfits?"  A: "Don't"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must take his chance - 4 @c was the first bid from North, which was - maybe - NOT forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: a spec says 3D asked for D stopper|pg||
nt|flash: most would play a cue bid forcing to game in major or NT, but only to 4-level in minor???|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that is a sensible way to play it|pg||
nt|flash: again, need to remove shoes to count losers in S hand???|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I suppose on this lie of cards North-South actually had some play for 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3 down is bad news for ew|pg||
nt|pelu: so all leads = I have a higher card in this suit!!|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes horrible suit breaks for decalarer good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: if you have singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: lol:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: again OR just back,  I think the Italian waiters should be removed from that room!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: i would feel like the unluckiest person born|pg||
nt|peachy: I love all our Polish specs who help with NS system interpretation, for the benefit of all our gallery|pg||
nt|flash: 250 will be 6 IMPs back - tightening the match significantly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South find out, that this lead is a singleton?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: without def help, that is|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|pelu: nice start for decl|pg||
nt|hlortz: still looks like -800 though|pg||
nt|tez: 1 way ticket for 800:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is smart enough to know that N would not X with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with the 2 @S bid, the long clubs should be with S |pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: and they arent helping so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and so declarer. but what about defence?|pg||
nt|peachy: but not for 3C|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|flash: i've had a question about the 'free bid' issue|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|peachy: brb get coffee|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: why not q of @H?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|tez: @h again pls|pg||
nt|flash: there was a marvelous historical (not hysterical) explanation of the roots of this concept in a recent Bridge World|pg||
nt|flash: my roth-stone training suggests that is you aren't forced to make a call, any call you choose to make is for a reason|pg||
nt|flash: usually values, although extra shape might compensate|pg||
nt|flash: the 'modern' game is, of course, on a totally different tack|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c3|pc|d3|nt|dburn: that would have been trickier - not sure why South did not see it through by bidding 3@d to show both red suits|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|peachy: well, not to crash your party, but I think the latter applied here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|tez: trying only 800|pg||
nt|flash: in any case, the pause b4 passing protected South's position in the post mortem...   well, i thought about bidding more...|pg||
mc|8|nt|mdgraham: three NS pairs in a part-score!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now comes a push|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if W returns @s|pg||
nt|peachy: w has to return a trump, otherwise making, and surely will|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good move from E - to take @s king and return @c offering losing choice to declarer|pg||
nt|flash: South looks for the Undo button|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close match|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: 3NT for EW looks slid.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gracelin: solid|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|gracelin: good try but south has the wrong black A|pg||
nt|davidstern: N/S playing 4@C in the OR on the previous board 5@Cx -2 at this table so that should be 6 back for Zimmerman|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|gracelin: it's easy for West to bid 2NT with J9xx  Jx  AJ10x  A1098, then the S2 lead would be a big winner.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gracelin: probably DA and D now.|pg||
nt|davidstern: Good to do on hands where it wont matter|pg||
nt|xenya: still it's unlikely declarer will risk his contract by taking a @D finesse -- he will play safely for 9 i think|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|davidstern: How is none safe?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|davidstern: nine|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: HJ and H to dummy for a diamond finesse is also safe, but you don't get many D tricks on that play either.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and 3 clubs at the most|pg||
nt|gracelin: low H to dummy then DQ wll you the maximum trick, but not 100%safe.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: ARF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is always right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also when he isn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess I would ask if you sit for the X on the N hand |pg||
nt|peachy: this could still we a tiny plus for BEAUTY against 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: hah, you belong to the school of "Always bid to win the post mortem" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  West is lucky here - a Multi would nok be a success|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - South opening|pg||
nt|tez: other room 4@s doubled..specs said:)|pg||
nt|flash: specs now up to 387 and still very little harassment...   i mean few comments   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the unlikely event that i passed originally as E, i doubt i could bring myself to pass 4S when pd bids it facing a passed hand at unfavorable vul with an unlinmited hand behind ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him. if i did summon such conservatism, and then watched 4S go down, i'd head for the bar|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: not much of fit anywhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And in 3 NT, you must hunt the 9th trick|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yeah - @H not 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S passes another opening bid by many standards|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, if the suits were majors I'd open.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: I'd open S at any vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be better to have the minors reversed, but you cant have everything all the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an interesting problem over 1H. i dont think 2H gets the job done. prefer 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: splinter would be my choice|pg||
nt|xenya: or cruel rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe someone in the audience can tell us what 2@D is|pg||
nt|peachy: club position fortunate|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts never break friendly in Japan|pg||
nt|peachy: aonly a few ricks for declarer here, we'll see how few|pg||
nt|peachy: tricks*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This time - in 3 NT - the @D-suit must be handled well|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: might even keep West out  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Brave man, East|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: on this day in history, a modern, aggressive player passed a rotten 11-count in 2nd chair...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise no entry|pg||
mb|2N|nt|peachy: which would in your book be weaker, Pass or 4D by N over 3H?|pg||
nt|tez: makeable 7@h..i belive they will stop 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam in board 5 was missed in OR (4@S + 3)|pg||
nt|tez: they are not playing with open cards:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting the OR is connected to us  but we are not reconnected to them |pg||
nt|sybarra: or should I say they were|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for a double of 4@H at MP?|pg||
nt|jtr: Might be necessary|pg||
nt|jtr: If we make 3@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but not that UNfriendly, surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 10-13, 2NT asking - 3@C = minimum, 3@D asking for singleton, 3Nt = singleton @S|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c pls|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X making, so 5@CX only cost 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At this level no problem|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: You'll get 200 here, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
nt|po-s: is this a hand that wants ruffs or to tap declarer?|pg||
nt|po-s: tap apparently|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he would be happy with four - that would mean his opponents could make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they can - may have stolen the pot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||
nt|tez: wrang i m here ..trust me pls:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|flash: and, lo and behold, the auction proceeded smoothly (in both rooms)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another NT-bid without a sure stopper...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|sybarra: almost same auction other room,  but instead of 2 nt, E bid 2 sp |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d break will be big disaster for declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: apprximately 2 down?|pg||
nt|xenya: well W dropped a trick when he failed to put up the Q, but that was far from obvious?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes you told him 7@H he could have just bid 6 LOL|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now no @D-finesse|pg||
nt|flash: low @S a bit surprising?   North would like the 9 to lead the Q, but...|pg||
nt|flash: ah - there was a 1@S call...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Any lead 660|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: one spade and two clubs would be different|pg||
nt|hlortz: /relate/|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nie had conquered the world of  "Go" some 20 years ago and turned his interest to bridge in recent years.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, u r right, four|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  But here only 600|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cancel, too early here|pg||
nt|peachy: he can still take 9|pg||
nt|peachy: or more if def allows :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So in fact it was a good lead, leading the @S King, and West takes 11 tricks - here only 9|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead in OR, that ALONE tells me it was a good lead, plus, I would have led Q or 10 = further evidence...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  next door 4@s made when defence offered @c trick to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that South, who had a maximum for his initial pass, did not take some action when a weak no trump came back|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain by noticing that the players at this level aren't afraid to pause and consider their play(s)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|peachy: or that in Strong Club context, he didnt open|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain even more by noticing when they pause|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: so you will be in Reno next month?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: probably private, too :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: well, justice served, in a sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry provate|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks for the trainingin "Go", he is a very good card plaer in bridge, but his biddng is a bit old fashioned.|pg||

nt|davidstern: @D right @H blocked  spades break|pg||
nt|gracelin: because on HQ lead, it's natural for declarer to knoc out CA, easy's entry, first.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hlortz: hi Bart|pg||
nt|tez: hi Bart:)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS in OR also missed 3NT in board 4 - so the standing is 3-33!|pg||

nt|bbramley: can zmud bid 1NT here to show 4@S and minor?|pg||
nt|flash: halfway through the match - close and entertaining|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: negative free bid working here|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this 4S is too strong for my standards, cannot have two side suits controlled|pg||

nt|flash: how light does one open in 3rd chair?   the more lead-directional the call, the lighter it might be???|pg||
mb|r|nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S absolutely needed trumps 22 because one club had to be ruffed to set up the suit, and later a spade had to be ruffed. if Ds are 3-1 the hand cant make|pg||
nt|peachy: but don't know|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8:  N  3NT-1 in the OR|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, Roland said earlier was made with +1 bd7|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@H is an option|pg||
nt|chick: yes, raija, and it kept them out of a very good (but unfortunately unmakeable) slam|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22, EW in the OR did bid and make 3N on basically the same defence: @H lead ducked by N|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  any reason for West to bid immediately?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: still - with no club fit..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait - errare humanum est|pg||

nt|bbramley: i don't think he can make it even with a perfect guess - more clubs will sink it|pg||

nt|hlortz: really?n follow to 3 @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Tez @H  pleasant dreams |pg||
nt|bbramley: i see, henry, so he'll threaten to dump both spades - yes, that would be PERFECT guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  we have comfortable sitting at home, with coffee and double-dummy deals, not so they|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, pressure of a big event|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must be declarer at this board, we might see an NL-score  now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol yes the deep 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 4@H in OR - but here the lead: a small @S from S?????????????????|pg||

nt|sybarra: I said "ugh"  and would you believe there is spec with that bbo name? |pg||
nt|flash: if South, holding KJx, wouldn't bid NT, that was no longer a possible/plausible strain|pg||
nt|peachy: OR overcalled 1NT with S hand, no wonder they got to game|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  and world-wide watching |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: so it could be a dblwhammy for them, dbld game and a plus unmaking slam.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  But even on a @D-lead from East, you should have 10 tricks|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||

nt|peachy: Merijn home here, fortuitous rightsiding|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: in a dition to different club play then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|bbramley: that will simplify the defense - if he hadn't cashed @SA it gets complicated|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must be a strong field|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It ain't bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct declarer technique on Boards 1, 4, and 7 in this room would have the MY team up by about 30 instead of struggling|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also here a couple of IMPÂ´s for Italy - just taking their tricks|pg||
nt|flash: seems unlikely that Lavazza will lose IMPs on this one?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: another good slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ken Rae is from the Shetlands|pg||
nt|peachy: a likely 3NT here now|pg||

nt|peachy: 11-18 5+ H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: Nunes still in the box after @SK|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like he was down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even a spade lead does not defeat 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9:  S  4@SX-3  500 to EW|pg||
nt|peachy: partscore deal here, most likely|pg||
nt|po-s: you´re such a blood thirsty person|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is a scope for variations|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: chance for North-South to retaliate by reaching a lucky slam of their own - 6@c and 6NT both make if played by North (who has bid clubs)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Normally E/W would make 620 in 4 @H, but here...|pg||
nt|xenya: not normally, PO, no|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S = what guys?  1 nt|pg||
mb|2N|nt|peachy: crucial moment, go or not to go|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm betting no|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: time for Blackwood |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 NT on the N hand is excellent|pg||
nt|peachy: even if one does raise on three sometimes, doing so with S hand would be sick|pg||
nt|peachy: 2c is 10+,  GF if fit and then 2+ cl|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 4 @H you get 12 tricks - in 6 6 @H only 10|pg||
nt|flash: these stopperless NT calls are frightening!!!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: i dont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defeating this 4 @H will bring NL in front|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think the real score is 10-17|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of science in action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 controls I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Geoff Breskal won the Gold Cup many years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: many many years ago|pg||
nt|hlortz: indelicate but effective|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David Edwin in the audience remembers when|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this event is well-known for collecting "names" in Yokohama, the organizers do their best to attract "stars" giving national players fine possibility to compete  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no good lead for South|pg||
nt|peachy: Have to stay away from spade lead to have any chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best he could do|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - 6@c, as a spectator points out, will not make if East leads her diamond|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: a case for cashing the ace - not done|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way, and 2@D looks like an artif GF, or maybe this range balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this is more a lucky one than the 6NT was, there he only needed spade finess|pg||
nt|gracelin: I was in Yokohama for the NEC cup last year.  This Latin team did very well but they are missing Diego this time.|pg||
nt|dburn: all academic - they aren't going to bid a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately our operators do not speak English, so I can't explain how to reconnect after a crash|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is a bilingual specctator to help Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's all in our manual, but that's also in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: they soudn't.  This is amuch worse slam than last board which only needs a finesse.|pg||
nt|peachy: is Diego B in another team or not there this year?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this might be tricky both for declarer and  defenders|pg||
nt|po-s: that HQ is a good card, otherwise declarer might have  difficulties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This one should depend om finding the @S Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we think 2 @D= 18+ |pg||
nt|pelu: they play tranfer-ans on 1@C - so 1@S sh be a normal 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm little conservative with 25 hcp total|pg||
nt|hlortz: but i guess they are high enough|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: tk he is not cming thisyear.|pg||
nt|flash: semi-sensible lead for a push...|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: 2H is just begging for EW to bid the vul game and make it by finessing partner for H queen which they would not otherwise do|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was thinking of sac in those colors?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not every lead kills this 4 @H - but IÂ´m sure, the @C Ace did|pg||
nt|peachy: seems this is now going set, straining my eyes for way to make, but no|pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto is a great player but not the miracleman|pg||
nt|bbramley: plenty high - even with a moderately friendly lie i don't think he'll make it|pg||
nt|pelu: in 4@H Nunes played @H to 8 and A in trick 2!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: not sure when   late 70's    early 80's I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative shift that turns out to be good|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it was safe|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|hawe45:  East might think, that South is in position to get a @C-ruff - not North. He must play @H Ace and another @H|pg||

nt|bbramley: 3@S makes, lose 1 of each|pg||
nt|sybarra: no doesnt make,  think it loses a trick in each suit,,  |pg||
nt|flash: might North have called 2@H over 1@S, instead of Xing again?   (thnx, Deb)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Easte must have been very close to a D|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, after the lead and the favorable DA position.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jbgood: why is that, Henry?|pg||
nt|peachy: S is strong enough to open naturally, with longest suit, follow up with diamonds twice|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, interesting. as for me, I hate hands like S's - points in short honours and main suit (@c) w/o controls |pg||

mb|3C|nt|ady: major suit cards placedbadly for e/w|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Great bid:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is N a chicken?|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, I would just bid 3D, 3S sounds too weak|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps 3S is their sys|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester makes no other|pg||
nt|po-s: will East comply - Lebensohl probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S is a good bid - for E/W, now East waill avoi the @D-lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: they also play CAPP over 1NT opening, so 2D shows both maors.|pg||
nt|flash: practical call?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: I almost didnt belive that he took the @D-finess -|pg||

nt|po-s: doubledummy on a spade lead ducked and another spade...|pg||
nt|po-s: give up a club and a diamond, then throw South in at the end for a heart favor|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Strange decision - West has the hand for bidding 4 @S|pg||

nt|sybarra: they are in 3 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s it - you sit up here in the cold North, trying to find out, how to bid 4 @S - and North just did it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Very bad lead this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure about result on 10, but before it was 22-17|pg||
nt|peachy: as well as her own|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Herman just needs to find Forrester's entry to get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Keep looking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: little does he know it's in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he must have one after 3@H without A and Q, right?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North had no good lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: although he might suspect it |pg||
nt|po-s: this way is no good though|pg||
nt|sybarra: down 3!! |pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: maybe the @CA and another would have been better?|pg||

nt|sybarra: on a low club lead fro N |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|po-s: but now North can break communications should declarer duck the diamond|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: Bas really didn't want a ruff, I think he was trying for a lead not to give a trick or something|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: this likely to be around average     double for north might have gain quite a bit|pg||

nt|sybarra2: but playing the sox off this hand!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gracelin: yes, Lin is a very agressve bidder.  Nie didn't take account for that.  |pg||

nt|gracelin: 5D|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT will survive because of the excellent intermediates in hearts|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: In 3NT with a H lead, declarer needs to guess the spade position if East shifts to that at some stage.|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I guess the defence can put him to the test in spades, that's why 5@D is better|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: interestingly, it was S who seemed to make a decision|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the CR where they bid and made 4@S by setting up hearts North opened 2@D multi and South bid 2@H and played it there so more IMPS for Lavazza|pg||

nt|marlowepi: can make double dummy of course. diamond king and spade finesse. but declarer should put in the diamond ten at trick one to try to force a dummy entry|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2C?|pg||
nt|peachy: i like 2C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is more like a 2C opener than a 2C rebid|pg||
nt|flash: of course, the higher a team finishes, the more control they retain over their opponents in the KOs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: yes, it only took 24 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: lets see how 3NT fares...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@H now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3C by N would have been an underbid|pg||
nt|chick: a nice reverse into 2@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17:13 in Japan now|pg||
nt|flash: 1@D shows at least 4 and a shapely hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: Operator -pl UNDO!|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C usually shows 9 card in the minors, either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to get it corrected |pg||
nt|bbramley: 3-1 trumps would have made it much more complicated|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gracelin: it may go 3S and 3NT, not a great contract.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H probably shows the 1444|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a VERY lucky 3N...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|peachy: not at all, 3S the last making one, but if EW in other room play 15-17NT (I dont know if they do) might go same way|pg||
nt|flash: although it might just be patterning out (1354 or 1345) with a max for not opening 1@C|pg||

nt|peachy: according to sys card|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: nice judgment by Merijn Groenenboom|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||

nt|hawe45:  VERY|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|jbgood: but will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|gracelin: because in this sequence EW can stop in 2S, while if you transfer, you need to followup with 2NT. |pg||
pc|d9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: seems a big play not finessing the @s and taking 11|pg||
nt|peachy: one more down doesnt matter, 2N not making either|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok |pg||
nt|peachy: while if in 2NT and game makes...|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ady: east can get most of the match points if entering with A@H   cashing dimonds and finessing 10@C     |pg||
nt|peachy: then opps have more and they wont lie silent|pg||
nt|peachy: the 1pt hand was squeezed, beautiful!|pg||
