nt|bjacobs: Unfortunately, the web site tends to trail a bit when displaying the scores after the previous round|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I can only say that these two teams are in "qualifying contention"|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|an|H+S|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: By now, North and West have got it all out of their systems|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp:  Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This will be a close run thing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: E was not on the right wavelength i think -- clearly W showed 5 @Hs and probably only 4 @Ss|pg||
pc|sK|nt|drorp:  i think the contract is going to make after this lead, even if they do switch to A@C and @C|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, another sparkling trump lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South was trying to stop East ruffing West's hearts, but there's a massive flaw in that reasoning|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: The flaw being that with South's long useless hearts, there's not a lot of ruffing required, if any|pg||

nt|peachy: and off we go, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: great misfit to begin with |pg||
nt|peachy: the tournament website did not have them unless I completely missed it|pg||
nt|hlortz: what do ew play? ns polish club for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morning all:)|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome to this 14-board Qualifying Match 10.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hey Jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Al.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peachy: The Youth tem is well placed in the current running score|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure - but I will knos some of their gadgeds - and spects will help me - I hope :):)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, to watch the 6th qualifying Match from Yokohama|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to be England Ladies against a japanese team|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NEC Bridge Festifal|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone and welcome back |pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play 1N=15-17,  Klinger-Mullamphy transfer over their 3+ 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to get there if W bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - He will sure risk 2 @S|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: however n/s do not play at speed of light (until the end of hand) |pg||
nt|peachy: Qualification Match number 7 on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - letÂ´s start with 1 NT undoubled?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: The tournament website for those interested, scores from Match 5 are not yet there but will sonn I'm sure http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: from NEC Bridge Festival in Yokohama, Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 15th NEC Cup. 12 rounds of qualifying (Swiss), 14 boards per match. This is a match from round 7 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello V|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker-Gower are the "South" part of Team South Sweden -- they're from South Africa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heavy promotion of the N hand will likely allow 3N to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have a CC that says NS play Precision with variable NT [sometimes 10-12, other 14-16]|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and now?|pg||
nt|peachy: esciting hand, afteralll|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the current leaders versus  2|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: they found the @S lead in the other room |pg||
nt|marlowepi: case for Slead but H normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's a WBF card from 2008 - so maybe they played for Bulgaria in Beijing|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oh well, cant spell|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Raija Davis, Hans Werge and Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the ecats site has a CC for the Italians from the 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 3rd @D might bring some problemes|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings -- not updated for Round 7 yet |pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well called peter|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H should make because of the @c discard on the @S Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and with this lead...|pg||
nt|shevek: here we are, hello everyone, the last round of the swiss|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|peachy: W got worried and pulled|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find the best lead: @C Ace|pg||
nt|po-s: anyone knows the standings?|pg||
nt|shevek: you're picking Hans :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|flash: a bit harsh to attribute a result to a normal lead?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
nt|shevek: current results will be updated soon at: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S back is best|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat light and risky double by N on just 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - anf opener third in hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  @S 10 was an option|pg||
nt|flash: the trump split will slow declarer down a bit|pg||
nt|xenya: creates a small problem for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  udca|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no big risk to double 180 instead of 90|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: ruffing with the 9 seems to be correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s not the way everybody would play. Ruff with the Jack og King and play against the Queen. But no argument against success|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Polish Club, EW 5card major and 15-17NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|flash: declarer will probably start on one of the pointed suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His problem is, that @S King might be by the 1 @D-bidder |pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is weighing his options|pg||
nt|flash: mentally going through each possible line - trying to find the safest/ most reasonable|pg||
nt|flash: all not lost if the @SK off-side|pg||
nt|peachy: against this opposition, it pays to be careful|pg||
nt|flash: that looks like the most probable choice from here|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has a rather strong clue to the location of the @DA...|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Awful @H-shift, partner wanted @S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|po-s: soon is not soon enough...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some interesting decisions at several stages of the auction here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: udca=Upside Down  Count  Attitude|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Raija.|pg||
nt|peachy: Jordan:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello raija, jordan, rehi Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru 8 matches posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Marshall.|pg||
nt|peachy: Al:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think this is match  10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Either N or E might have made a double at their turn.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can see 3C with the N hand, but double looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C in context of Precision probably shows longer @C|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: onthis defence, it's cold|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- a number of big clubbers use  1@D-2@H as Reverse Flannery - to show the 5@S 4@H weak responding hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
nt|flash: declarer's problem, if the @SK is, indeed, offside is the lack of an entry to hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Both of these teams are prime candidates for winning the whole event|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may accept the invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should we say it this way - @S-shift was not killing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Yokohama. hi to all|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had few options, but that certainly clarified/simplified things for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argument for @S is that partner has all the points -- even if @H strikes strength -- may not be entry to East's length|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: now should go down, he doesnt have the ricks any more|pg||
pc|h5|nt|shevek: A few words about the format of the event:|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: he lead 9, so....N had to count (3) |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: oh you mean N  sorry |pg||
nt|xenya: 1N went down next door, so it will be not 3 imps, but 6|pg||
nt|shevek: 48 teams entered, random draw for the 1st match, then swiss draw|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: Netherlands, with a strong young team, is also among the favorites|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: can no lnger make|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  In a while, dummy has two tricks but no entry|pg||
nt|shevek: a 12-round swiss of 14-board matches to qualify 8 teams to the KO phase|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|nt|flash: declarer's home now - on virtually any line where he doesn't revoke|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: this is not going well at all for the declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: was making when he was in dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: the idea of ruffing losers ought to have occurred to declarer sooner than it did|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: On the other hand, you may beat 3N off the top if partner has @HAKxxx, but not @SAKxxx|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  we are attending 2nd qualifying match of prestigeous NEC Cup|pg||
nt|po-s: hello all, particularly Mr W|pg||
nt|pelu: yes @c6|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello David|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Must be a flat board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- played the 2@H bidder to hold ZERO @H honors|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of Roland choices here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here 3 NT better be played by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. the case for a spade is that if you are beating this with hearts your heart ten is redundant, whereas if spades is the right suit the heart ten may be of some use on defense|pg||
mb|1C|nt|peachy: Lavazza brought this time Duboin-Sementa, Bocchi, Madala, and Guido Ferraro|pg||
nt|flash: all right, folks - we've got a relatively small group in this room (to watch two of the best pairs in the world), so pls move down to the front of the auditorium and feel free to ...|pg||
nt|flash: ask questions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  Hello PEO|pg||
nt|po-s: is there a link to standings?|pg||
nt|xenya: hello PO|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems here, that 4 @H depends on the @C-suit|pg||
nt|flash: Polish Club - several possible hands|pg||
nt|flash: in this case, the strong(est) option|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|xenya: but this might not be flat -- particularly after the double by W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  EastÂ´s double is OK - for the minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ecats should still have convention cards for both pairs online from Beijing 2008 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly hand, endplayed into making 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3-loser hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct play makes it|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: overcals in minor vuln sh normal be on 6 card suits - so S passed where mane clubplayers would bid 2@C|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
nt|hlortz: for sure vul too dangerous to overcall at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N take any action now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e., is it worth is?|pg||
nt|peachy: strongest is 19+ any shape|pg||
nt|flash: our operator threw up a small false card|pg||
nt|flash: didn't slow us down, however   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
nt|xenya: Oz Players are currently 4th, 16 VPS ahead of Sara who are 6/7th |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = ART Game Force [2-way Checkback]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know why Sementa didn't bid 2@H :(|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here a pass from West would be a big win!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice West-hand - E/W can make 1 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
nt|shevek: they probably will :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
nt|pelu: and prob @Ss bad for declayer - act 2@H down 1 - EW tahe the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i freely open 1N with a 5-card major, but here i would open 1S. i doubt we have a game if pd responds 1N, and if pd is 35 in majors we will play wrong suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either 2C was Puyppet or E is already steaming trying to get the swing back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: current standings available at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1100 against 2 @H D - and against any other contract I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: the teams' primary target is to get to the quarter-finals|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
nt|hlortz: dubion must be worth another try here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Henry.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may not try. he may just bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe 2NT has dual meaning|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin ..my typing is lacking|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 IMPs to Bulgaria on 1 - Lavazza got to 5@D and that was doubled and set 3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1 = 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that much point in trying when YOU have eight controls. partner is likely to drop you even when you want to be there|pg||
nt|peachy: even a player with no pulse would get that dbld, I think,|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@d looks like an overbid... whatever it means|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|po-s: he must win and return a trump|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defense @C Ace and a trump|pg||
nt|po-s: 2D obviously showed hearts - transfer advance|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  And defense can have some fun against 4 @S, when they play the 13th @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not updated after round 3 yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow, what do they open?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NO 8+ fit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: think e will make exactly 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 losers  and no problem with ruffing @Ss|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see where E found the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East trusted South - a mistake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why 5@c now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough decision atr trick one, probably wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: so ifyou changed @H and @D in west's hand, you would open 1N, Marshall?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa, this is hard to believe.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||
nt|hlortz: notice ns lead low from xx unlike most [non polish] pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was max of 14  presumably  2N or 3N said not great hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to David Greenwood|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|peachy: despite bad trump breakm, declarer still makes|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I'll always believe you should have made it, partner."|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||

nt|hawe45:  East should continue trump!|pg||
nt|pelu: also almost standard in denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer another X|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: instead, Beauty picked up 5 IMPs for missing game when the Latin played in a weird 4-2 spade fit|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hlortz: ah i see not common in USA|pg||
nt|flash: headed for 11 tricks?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  You have almost an opening bid - and your partner doubles 1 @S - should they have 790, then OK|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|po-s: South should have cashed the HA if he had had it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  AActually South should have played the @D King maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: but club is no good since declarer can ruff high and throw a dia|pg||
nt|hawe45:  10 I think|pg||
nt|peachy: let me ask our BFF (best friend forever) GIB...|pg||
nt|flash: @D honor now keeps 11 in play|pg||
nt|peachy: he says 11 or 12|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: S needed to switch, but W needed to win first trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my fault - was chatting -- 2@C WAS 5-Card Stayman  and the pair defines using it with 53 majors -- transfer then 2/3 NT = 52|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even opposite this dog 6N has fair play: Qx   KTx   Kxx  QJTxx|pg||
nt|xenya: and 2 last qualifying rounds will be played today, including this one|pg||
nt|xenya: so this match is quite important for Sara|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  OK - I made a new count|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|po-s: finess spades and not get the D ruff|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  But declarer should then guess, whether SouthÂ´s doubleton is Q or 10 |pg||
nt|peachy: Bulgaria has a rare chance to get considerable headstart|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: i would just pass as E and collect all the 100's i can|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: there ought to be a Law against doing that...|pg||
nt|loganrun: 7 of spades seems fiarly straighforward|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: How does 5@d do?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I just wee, that Englands opponents are the junior team, a pair from Czech Republic at the other table|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, W didn't double, so E was never tempted|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  it doesn't seem like big result for EW - they could win 5@c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The unblock of @S 10 was no good idea|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: N may hop q here |pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said earlier,  we will not be playing at speed of light (like the brazilians) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: poor Giorgio -- @DQ onside AND  both pointed suits 33|pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 6NT/E in the OR.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: poor nothing. the result was earned|pg||
nt|hlortz: i dont know their sys maybe 3n/3d denied as much as qx of @S still ...|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: Looks like 11|pg||
nt|po-s: "cashing" the dia king would be disaster if you switch red aces in West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better an unblock of @H 10|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: @C continuation might have allowed declarer to get out for -1 -- a @H is asfe for 2 off|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: here David, here's the box, step on it and shout :)|pg||
nt|peachy: curiously enough, EW had 4H making, if I saw correctly in this hand|pg||
nt|dburn: well, repeated spade leads might do in 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer can't reach the dummy without losing a 4th trick, so a push|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: perhaps u are right|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  Did we get back to 7 tricks?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 670 due to bad defense from East, who coukd also defeat the contract by rising sith the @C King|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  Right, @D Ace after @C King might look right|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  survived for down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: yes, board 23 was 9 tricks|pg||

mb|4S|nt|hlortz: we see here the strong part of 1@C |pg||

nt|shevek: 1@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Too late po|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Good old Irving Gordon, originally from Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I bet David played against him a few times|pg||
nt|jtr: And in teams with him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awfully good hand for a weak 2, if that is what it is|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red suits lie well for NS - for 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway well done by both sides as 4@H was cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: usual 1@C is like a weakNT|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club, weak no trump in use for North-South|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18, 5c S|pg||
nt|flash: we had a famous baseball player in the old days "Shoeless" Joe Jackson...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their convention card from Sao Paolo just says "2-way checkback"|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  vul 2N seems a bit rich with W hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, Sveta:)|pg||
nt|flash: supposedly because, as a country boy, wearing shoes hurt his feet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then:  xx   KTx   KQx   QJTxx|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will Westrun in 5 @D DOUBLED...|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: in Hans' case, not removing his shoes might indicate fewer tricks than available...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4-9 HCP, 5+@H & 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|peachy: I still have suspicion 2NT was not denying hearts, perhaps to show the 12-14 instead of more wideranging options included in 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hi Raija, welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not cold, I think. You have a losing option in @C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like X or 3@D?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: 2N vul against not has limited appeal|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure Scotland wasnt joined to europe when he was there:)|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to overcall, perhaps on the basis that his hand is too good - immediate overcalls destructive in nature|pg||
nt|peachy: nt apparent;ly 16-18 or something|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You have 10 slo tricks in 4 @H, but before that, defense will have 4 or 5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  slow|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  S to the rescue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice 5 @D - if they bid the slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now - why is West passing?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW off the hook |pg||
nt|pelu: NS could also go for penalty against EW - 2@CX = 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say that the W hand looks more like what I usually hold|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes e came in expecting the weak hand in south|pg||
nt|dburn: if classical strong club, yes - 17-19 or even 17-20 more common ranges nowadays|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I'm old school|pg||
nt|flash: this is the kind of deal which decides matches - much less short matches like this|pg||
nt|flash: to some extent, the @D call helps North - whatever values South has might well include some in @Cs|pg||
nt|peachy: good decision, 5D would only tumble one or so|pg||
nt|xenya: very unlikely at these colours and with W being silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction in OR '|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H denies a top honor  - but that doesn't surprise Klinger|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: dblfits all around, and now that was brought to daylight|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - the lead must be a @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Service-double - earns nothing, helps N/S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice contract - on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Do we all bid 1 @S - I do not|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: seems a small spade allows to make it -- a club lead would have been more challenging|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: strictly speaking, yes, but you can get a fairly good count on the E hand i think|pg||
nt|flash: East suggests defense vs 5@Ss and strongly suggests that West not bid more (especially vulnerable)|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree with Jim's explanation, for what its worth|pg||
nt|flash: Hans actually sneaked in a good point - suggesting/directing the @D lead was important here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   1N already said 12-14|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even w/o dbl - could be gain for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NorthÂ´s opening bid pushed E/W to game, equalling the match|pg||
nt|othered1: with no trump lead and very friendly breaks, this can play well on cross ruff.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you see they made 5 in the other room,   @h and ht continuation |pg||
nt|hlortz: oh im NOT defending their bidding LOL you have 19 pard opens and you dont move past 3n.|pg||
nt|peachy: X more flexible|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: as cards lie, can make 5 by going up ace, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 lead is ATTITUDE  [seems an exaggeration of the suit]|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Nice @D-suit - brings 4 tricks to East-West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - cancel|pg||
nt|po-s: Hans, asusual you are right - North will cover the Dten and yes, four tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D could lead to 3D cold for 3N or 4S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why South volunteered a bid in front of partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
nt|peachy: this has chances to chke, and I think it will|pg||
nt|peachy: S sensibly signs off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer D from W on the first round of bidding. 15HP behind opener|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s 9 - "partner, I have clubs" - seems so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here than in OR|pg||
nt|flash: XX shows 1st round control|pg||
nt|shevek: west is Johan Sylvan, a hugely successful poker player, but....pass was right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: K or Q from S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think best was to fly @CA, ruff @H  top @D pitching @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is much to be said AGAINST this 4 @S 1) Suit is too short - but good 2 ) Hand can play also in @H - and @C|pg||
nt|po-s: Johan is also a very good bridgeplayer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|flash: notice that the @D lead would hold this to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I am surprise the diamond lead didnt come, after West's valiant effort|pg||
nt|flash: to quote David Berkowitz:  if  i'd bid @Cs, would you have led a @D????|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: Yes true|pg||
nt|peachy: make*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- I'd try 2N|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice for once to see instant scoring outside Scandinavia and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can we hope for America to follow suit?|pg||
nt|hlortz: in 10 or 20 years|pg||
nt|peachy: she could even play low and make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should have bid 5 @C - to get a @D-leas...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: X for me|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  sure... 40 or 50 years from now|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello kibitzers:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: I see we have a strong match going here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defense have misplayed the @C-suit|pg||

pc|hT|nt|po-s: Could South possibly have 8401|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: too well perhaps|pg||
nt|peachy: Hans, I didnt know you had good sense of humor :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have had|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Some play this DONT -. or others, where D = 1-suiter|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wasnt just 19, it was about the crispest 19 imagineable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 3N|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: top D before H ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- unblock Ace first|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  But now the @C-guess will decide - and East will fix it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: 3N is my second choice|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not on a club opening lead she couldnt|pg||
nt|peachy: not opening lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|d4|nt|jtr: What do we think of West's 2NT though?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S should have played trumps from the very beginning|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1D response showed four+hearts, 2C was puppet to 2D and 2S inviting with four|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK - not much the defenders can do to hurt him since he has one spade trick and two of each|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D is my LAST choice :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N could fail cold for 4S though, and on many hands where E would not trake you out|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: Might have been wise to cash HA, it could disappear on the club|pg||

pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: There are several large downsides with 1@D followed by 2@C (over 1@S)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1)  That's a diamond "suit"?|pg||
nt|xenya: friendly lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2) it is how you miss a 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the downside with 1NT rebid is that you don't have a balanced hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd much prefer to open 1@H and rebid 2mi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because the hearts are so good|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But, playing 5 card majors, some would regard that as a hanging offence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I break any rule in sight|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Poor old declarer fogured: "|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "I'd better play for @SA and @DA on-side"|pg||

nt|dburn: maybe playing for West to have @h10x and no entry, but that seems a bit of a view|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree with W's pass -- the fact that you are behind the opener doesn't matter much with his holding -- no tenaces, just controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+@C, not 4@C & 4@D [1@D]|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|hawe45:  Still no game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not everybodyÂ´ s taste that 2 NT - facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes you need to make that call with an undistinguished balanced 16. here you are close to 8 trix in yr own hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL expects to hear more @H from LHO|pg||
nt|loganrun: but that means that he has ace of hearts and king of clubs outside of his trump suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the bare @C King, South would have taken the kead in his hand to play @C King|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this will be a very tight match, both teams have some of the world's best pairs playing,  and Fantunes, perhaps theeee best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW rate to go minus in game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to hear more hearts, it matters little what you do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+,  1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|peachy: if S doesnt bid them now, the S willl be lost forever|pg||
nt|flash: X reasonable, but now without risk - my partners always bid 2@D...|pg||
nt|flash: note the 1NT call without a stopper|pg||
nt|flash: values first, shape 2nd??|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sounds right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and you will be outbidden in a lot of hands:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: pretty good 6@H here with west opening|pg||
nt|peachy: now this 1NT will drive bulgarians to six|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D=@Hs i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: anyone X 1@H with south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no thin double by South|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 cards suits?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  strange 1N... even if playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin has obviously heard "6-4, come alive"|pg||
nt|flash: and maybe even 6-5|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I erred, Fantoni-Nunes not playing now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can take the first 11 tricks against 1 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even Kokish might think North too good for 1@H overcall :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: JC doesn´t quite believe the explanation|pg||
nt|loganrun: that as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: prob same as open rm|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N takes the push to 3...faster than I could type|pg||
nt|peachy: not a bad choice, d finesse near 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi: its over|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  why not a simple raise?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow aggressive double|pg||
nt|jtr: Just right at MPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in their lucky day EW win @s game|pg||
nt|peachy: good start, W raised|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main problem - to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: lose 2h and 3s|pg||
nt|flash: the stopperless 1NT does have its potential drawbacks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and against 2 NT also|pg||
nt|peachy: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: how about 3NT Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm starting to think that the long run winner for South is to PASS the DBL|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: good decision by West here - that raise wasn't automatic|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm unfamiliar with ew system, for me raise would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|peachy: they did well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=transfer|pg||
nt|loganrun: this hand will play well as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 1C was clubs or wk or 18-19 NT, 1H showed spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: even if Gower doesn't lead a minor -- still only 9 tricks  [i think]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S bids 3S, as he should, they arein slam|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: sounds like penalties, with good hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: Aiming for the KOD Roland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S probably wanted to dbl the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going for the KOD is tempting at MP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KOD = Kiss of Death|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead - only a @S could give S some problems|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Let me count|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Edgar Kaplan is rolling over in his sepulchre Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here they only get 10, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments from now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Vlad -- i'm not really here, just adding some explanations of alerts if i can|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome!|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S was consistent with a wk NT with 2-3 spades...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hlortz: aka 200|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -200 at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead was better, and logical on the auction and the W hand|pg||
nt|chick: kind of a waste of the 10|pg||
nt|peachy: its cold, dont think any lead woulda caused a prob|pg||
nt|flash: but an important lesson:  the defenders can't see your hand...|pg||
nt|peachy: silence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  20 tricks in difference or so|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks simple enough|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: pause -- in case Klinger has ducked @DA??|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: wrong J by pd - and he has 3 of them :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bulgaria matched the 4@S contract on 19 - and two overtricks for 2 IMPs to 23-zip.|pg||
nt|hlortz: bulgarians are going full speed ahead|pg||
nt|peachy: N gambled, W could have had Ax spades and KQxx xlubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N could easily turn out to be an underbid, e.g. if N held:   KJxx   Axx   AKQxx  x   they would play 3N with 6D near cold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction from Vladi Isporski|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: and on board 18 West kept NS out of 4@s by opening 1@s on five low and a pile of dingo's kidneys|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  and should get it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not 500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 25 3@S-1 was above average for NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: total waste|pg||
nt|chick: although I guess a pitch on the J doesn't do much|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|po-s: trump I think,  knowing that South has a good number of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 11-13, 3/4@H   2@D=ART Game Force [effectively 4th suit]|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: not about pitch, about how many clubs nead to be ruffed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as it was proved next door |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: penalties ranged from 1400 (4Nx-5 EW) to 800 (4Hx-3 NS)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now you can make an overtrickm playing on @C|pg||
nt|po-s: and now a club finesse?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been weaker hand than 2N  --- not sure what 3@C asks :(|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|pelu: how do u play on a @s-lead?? - can u make 3NT? |pg||
nt|peachy: well, perhaps I am wrong, fforgot the 3S bid after hearts were set by 3H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Duboin to have opening bid, he MUST hold @DK|pg||
nt|peachy: wd|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: push on 3 -- same contract, same result in the OR|pg||
nt|jcwla: Highly impressive.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  Oh - no entry any longer|pg||
nt|pelu: prob on an endplay of West?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: it could be beaten double dummy -- @H lead, A, @H ruff, underlead @Cs, another @H ruff -- and there is another trick for the defence -- but now it makes|pg||
nt|po-s: fortunately no|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: you could from the beginning but why bother too much, IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: so that was 11 IMPs to The Latin, who usually make a good showing in this tournament|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might pÃ¥ 1.200 - 2 x 600|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: pitch a loser now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  be 1200|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hlortz: i dont see how to make it offhand ...|pg||
nt|tez: hi all|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|peachy: lucky that E had the D 0 also|pg||
nt|hlortz: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Tezcan |pg||
nt|xenya: EW's sophisticated methods got them to 3N on a hand where most would be in 4@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: 10|pg||
nt|peachy: I would think the LATIN team is a favorite here, they have some good players.  I don't know anything about he Japanese Beauty|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Automatic 500 it seems. Better to double on your first turn with the South cards. Then you won't get in trouble later|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hoping for a terrible @H-break with lenght by South|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s4|nt|po-s: does he know the Dx was a winner?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tez: zmud now home|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: indeed, 3N looks a better contract on their combined hands|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: OK, so the defence missed a trick. Still 200 should be good|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Don't do it Dror - it's bad for you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lat time someone said that (me), a pair arrived in 6NT off two aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and made it needless to say|pg||
pc|s3|nt|drorp:  Nah, i don't, just mentioning to those who wonder when they'll get a chance for a break :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We can see the friendly layout, but it's a bit trickier for declarer, who 8 tricks and several chances for a 9th|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|drorp:  ducking 1st spade is the way to start|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why is it better to duck the first spade? You are not better off if they switch to hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Probably lead up twice to @CKQ, and then if that goes pear-shaped, you can take the diamond finesse, into the safe hand (hence also maybe cashing in on a 3-3 diamonds break)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: And Roland's problem scenario comes true ...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|drorp:  good switch|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, the plan I suggested is not quite so good now ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why I think he should have won the first spade in hand to lead a club up|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NS have an awful lot of tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 top tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: about 16|pg||
nt|jtr: A few tricks here|pg||
nt|hlortz: 7 @D @H or NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you would expect a flat 7N across the field |pg||
nt|jbgood: no|pg||
nt|jtr: Even my grandmother would manage 9 i think|pg||
nt|jbgood: there are always a mix-up somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in Central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far the standard fo card play has not matched the quaity of the bidding|pg||
nt|tez: nicely played|pg||
nt|po-s: misplaying diamonds like that...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S-guess is worth 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S made E-W on that one, so a potentially very big 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here N/S can take the first ?? tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they won't mind that 1 imp loss at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but somehow I doubt every pair will bid 7N|pg||
nt|po-s: the spot cards in D and H were crucial - should have made|pg||
nt|hawe45:  -Ready for another partscore|pg||
nt|po-s: Carruthers never get to bid his hearts...unless 2D was multi|pg||
nt|pelu: now on slam-level|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely n/s draws a dble here |pg||
nt|peachy: 12-15 bal, 19+ any, and two more options|pg||
nt|flash: again, the multi-meaning 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Bulgarian EW also playing big club   their auction begins  1@D-DBL-P-2@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: need to get to NT not @H here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=(21)22-23|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  NS got lot of points again.  @h game? NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And the Multi might help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how high does e/w bid?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 5@H now??|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c opening means..nat or 16+any hand..polish club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I agree with 5 @H |pg||
nt|dburn: I neither - they were 19th in the standings after four rounds, but not sure what they did in their last match|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts n/s in a spot quickly |pg||
nt|tez: bid or not to bid..pass is not forcing i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: for all N knows,  S may have no clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: 16+ nat or 12-18 4441|pg||
nt|xenya: weak 1N?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Â´Looks like a flat 3 NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5NT? = I can play slam in 2 suits?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if they are up against The Latin their results can't have been bad|pg||
nt|peachy: if the have puppet, easy|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|Walddk2: Some will not even be in a grand slam. Just wait and see|pg||
nt|po-s: which it probably ewas|pg||
nt|xenya: on 18, EW in the other room didn't find the 4@S save -- 8 imps to World Youth|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the X shows @S or just cards?|pg||
nt|tez: strong opening |pg||
nt|sybarra: will S bid 7?|pg||
nt|tez: i thk|pg||
nt|pelu: cards I exp - but spect can correct me :)|pg||
nt|tez: 6 enuf:)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly different auction in other room  since 1 @H=sp |pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least that's what the old convention card says :(|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh never mind 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easier without it|pg||
nt|peachy: but S decided not to even look, reasonable decision with 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: he will bid pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree  but S has to like his hand |pg||
nt|loganrun: strightforward 3NT after West shows 18-19 bal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  3@d by S seems to make things easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @d suit most likely the one in question |pg||
nt|flash: 2@D natural and VERY positive|pg||
nt|flash: grand slam easy from here - far more difficult to reach at the table?|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D 5+ C or D, usually gf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A 2 C-overcall by East, might have brought some trouble for N/S |pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C|pg||
nt|flash: SPECS!!!   287 people in here and there's virtual silence!!!   c'mon - talk to us|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N did not want to lead a trump because he was worried about hearts affording discards. he preferred clubs to diamonds for an unusual reason--they were weaker, i.e. he hoped the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ten would best serve the defense if the suit was not attacked from his side|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: at least 3@c gets some strength across i imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: to Zmud|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be at sprint speed of play |pg||
nt|pelu: 6@Hs will only cost 800 - but rish that opp bid 7 - and then he also has to bid 7@H|pg||
nt|tez: and also 7@s..then:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (when he decides play) |pg||
nt|dburn: looks like strong club for both pairs, given that 1@d opening|pg||
nt|flash: private msgs only to any commentator who has +++ in their profile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @C Voidwould - and South is taken by surprise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Voidwood|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D was 5+ DIAM and usually GF, I made a mistake, thanks friendly spec!!!|pg||
nt|flash: i've seen this b4...|pg||
nt|flash: 5@C (obviously???) intended as exclusion - but....|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H showed H stopper!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|peachy: he surely has it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 NT is the spot - nu risc for @D-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  no|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there was a flat grand (13 tables) at the YC once - about 30 years ago |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is lesson for all......think at first trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Now 7NT is easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the few hands 2/1 players would have an easy time with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning, afternoon, evening, as you please|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Roland!|pg||
nt|po-s: it looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT is the limit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would have asked if opener held 3 or 4@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: Blackwood is a fine convention|pg||
nt|flash: standings at   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very heavy 1 NT - or?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  so, first push?|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm sure that is correct|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jtr: KC is even better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one pair in 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: make, prob with overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: check the Daily Bulletins - they're among the best in the world...   a Rigal-Colker production paid advertisement...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H?! That will make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: two in six|pg||
nt|peachy: nice switch|pg||
nt|xenya: trappy hand -- they are bound to end up in 3N -- and they did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=long suit game try -- not sure why that is an alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S brought his rabbi  (play ace with K is singleton off side) |pg||
nt|xenya: i womder what system NS are playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both players strong NT with their regular partners|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: he has a cost free chance to try find the Q|pg||
nt|dburn: and of course, whenever you open some minimum in 4th chair partner always punishes you by jumping to 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: 1 key card for @Hs, excluding @Cs...    but a big swing in a short match|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will attack @C before @D - finessing @D into the hand without @SS-trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Didnt bother about the @dQ expecting South to have 3 @ds|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding will take longer than the play|pg||
nt|jtr: There are a few less experienced pairs in the field remember|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 IMP - the first for NL|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe South didÂ´nt like his hand with 2 suits without stopper|pg||
nt|po-s: I think the 4spades doubled got misscored - - it was 2 down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: well played|pg||
nt|peachy: and he did do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Fu expected either weaker hand with @D & @S or  stronger would take another call|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: yes, 3 trumps, a spade and 4 tricks in the minors -- EW can't do anything about that|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: too right -- pure values in @S & @D = old fashioned 1@D instead of 1N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: note - would NOT do that if @D & @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think well judged actions from both players|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: now S must find the right lead to set, will she? small d but of course we see all cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No danger, @H Ace will not be missed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza got to 3NT so 12 more coming to Bulgaria.  Up 35-0 now.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Al|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: Patrick Huang tells me that Lin has played for Taiwan in the Venice Cup, and that Nie is from China where she is a celebrated Go player|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean *he|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kantar article in most recent ACBL Bulletin would have said 3N was the ONLY decision|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|peachy: thanks for the info|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contradiction in terms. if it is the only call, there is no decision|pg||

nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter on this hand, but if Klinger held 3@C instead of 4 -- he would be truly endplayed now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: a swing is possible here -- but more likely EW in the OR will also reach 3N declared by E |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Ish & Bach both strong backgrounds in Acol -- would be surprised if they also play 3NN|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a hand, where you might bid 4 @S|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: nice coment shirley..i agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question will be if they "reconnect" the tables |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: I would open the E hand at any colors. many would disagree of course, but it is an opening bid by many well-respected yardsticks|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H was again a transfer to 4S :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  almost :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they lost connection again..... |pg||

nt|hawe45:  East has 3 stoppers in the @S-suit|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 1H u mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i told the computer to display -- wonder where @S came from|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: operator may have missed the subtle pointing to bidding card |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in mp, rather be in 3N or 5@d?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A lucky 3 NT here |pg||
nt|po-s: Did he really make nine tricks on the previous hand?|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is take/out to @s..strong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 ball, or 18-19 ball or natural @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: N to double? |pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
nt|peachy: W has max and six cards, well done to Pass|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: how would you like to pass as E then put THIS dummy down in a mere 4 spades then watch pd go down?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Patrick Huang |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Agree - will West make his 620? Double-finesse in @C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- when W didn't play his last spade to tap S|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s or pass i thk|pg||
nt|tez: :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ashley Bach also led a small @C  [the 6]|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: and that is a slightly aggressive responsive double by South, but part score swings are generated by pushing your opponents around|pg||
nt|flash: note the 2@C call - the 6-card suit outweighs the 4-card length in @Hs, despite the fact that partner is far more likely to hold @Hs than @Cs|pg||
nt|flash: but, we seem to have run into the question of whether the 'free bid' shows values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 spec telling me that NS are NOT playing Precision at this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has good cards facing a splinter, but unable to cue 4D he must bid 4H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the spade finesse is on I make 630 vs 620|pg||
nt|peachy: but|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks, Shrley and Hi all.|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was always going to bid 3@s, but no harm in seeing whether his opponents accidentally pass him out in 2@s doubled first|pg||
nt|po-s: what was the phrase? Youthful?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||
nt|peachy: i see no chance for OT|pg||
nt|tez: they are leading 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again we see the lead middle from 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: EW can defeat 4@S on a @S lead (DD decl can 2xfiness in @D and make)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: all leads 2/4......better way to describe it   (thx spec) |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with the @S-vois, South has a few values|pg||
nt|hawe45:  void|pg||
nt|peachy: if 3D was GF he cant pass now...or can he|pg||
nt|flash: SJ Simon counseled :  how much worse could your hand be...    not much!!!???|pg||
nt|peachy: Also "How to bid misfits?"  A: "Don't"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must take his chance - 4 @c was the first bid from North, which was - maybe - NOT forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: a spec says 3D asked for D stopper|pg||
nt|flash: most would play a cue bid forcing to game in major or NT, but only to 4-level in minor???|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that is a sensible way to play it|pg||
nt|flash: again, need to remove shoes to count losers in S hand???|pg||
nt|peachy: hearts behaving, Bulgaria can hardly lose on this deal, or Lavazza gain|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: I suppose on this lie of cards North-South actually had some play for 4@h|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|tez: 3 down is bad news for ew|pg||
nt|pelu: so all leads = I have a higher card in this suit!!|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes horrible suit breaks for decalarer good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: if you have singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: lol:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: again OR just back,  I think the Italian waiters should be removed from that room!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt Mullamphy seems to be operating a bit here -- maybe HOPING to get to 8@S with his 2 sure trump tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: i would feel like the unluckiest person born|pg||
nt|peachy: I love all our Polish specs who help with NS system interpretation, for the benefit of all our gallery|pg||
nt|flash: 250 will be 6 IMPs back - tightening the match significantly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South find out, that this lead is a singleton?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: without def help, that is|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: @S9 is discouraging|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: nice start for decl|pg||
nt|hlortz: still looks like -800 though|pg||
nt|tez: 1 way ticket for 800:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is smart enough to know that N would not X with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with the 2 @S bid, the long clubs should be with S |pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: and they arent helping so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and so declarer. but what about defence?|pg||
nt|peachy: but not for 3C|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|xenya: EW seem to bid every game in sight -- and a little bit more|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|flash: i've had a question about the 'free bid' issue|pg||
nt|po-s: but there defenders began with a club|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  Put @D 3-1 and this would cost|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: brb get coffee|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: why not q of @H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade lead from getgo needed to hold it to 4|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|tez: @h again pls|pg||
nt|flash: there was a marvelous historical (not hysterical) explanation of the roots of this concept in a recent Bridge World|pg||
nt|flash: my roth-stone training suggests that is you aren't forced to make a call, any call you choose to make is for a reason|pg||
nt|flash: usually values, although extra shape might compensate|pg||
nt|flash: the 'modern' game is, of course, on a totally different tack|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza on the board with an overtrick IMP in 3NT on 21.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|dburn: that would have been trickier - not sure why South did not see it through by bidding 3@d to show both red suits|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: well, not to crash your party, but I think the latter applied here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|s7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|tez: trying only 800|pg||
nt|flash: in any case, the pause b4 passing protected South's position in the post mortem...   well, i thought about bidding more...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: three NS pairs in a part-score!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now comes a push|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if W returns @s|pg||
nt|peachy: w has to return a trump, otherwise making, and surely will|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good move from E - to take @s king and return @c offering losing choice to declarer|pg||
nt|flash: South looks for the Undo button|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close match|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: in the auction, South limited his hand by 2S instead of bidding a more ambiguous (as to strength and shape) 2C|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||

nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
nt|po-s: is this a hand that wants ruffs or to tap declarer?|pg||
nt|po-s: tap apparently|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South does his best|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he would be happy with four - that would mean his opponents could make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they can - may have stolen the pot here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  looks like 300|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - behind the suit|pg||
nt|loganrun: after partner doubled for takeout - sure|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be beaten |pg||
nt|xenya: with careful defence|pg||
nt|peachy: three unescapable losers, will be a ppush|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so easy to defend - @D-ruffs etc.|pg||
nt|po-s: but West will overruff hearts or clubs very soon|pg||
nt|loganrun: and south has trouble getting back to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway, this gave noting away, the @H-finesse South can handle himself|pg||
nt|po-s: he will probably try the CQ which holds, then what?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||
nt|tez: wrang i m here ..trust me pls:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 11 tricks to me too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6 trumps, 2 ruffs, 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|flash: and, lo and behold, the auction proceeded smoothly (in both rooms)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another NT-bid without a sure stopper...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|shevek: play a @d maybe?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: almost same auction other room,  but instead of 2 nt, E bid 2 sp |pg||
nt|loganrun: Jack of diamonds works best|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe a diamond directly, but sometimes West has the CA|pg||
nt|loganrun: great card|pg||
nt|shevek: for different reasons neither west nor east can play trumps :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has by far the best reason|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  @d break will be big disaster for declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: apprximately 2 down?|pg||
nt|xenya: well W dropped a trick when he failed to put up the Q, but that was far from obvious?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes you told him 7@H he could have just bid 6 LOL|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now no @D-finesse|pg||
nt|flash: low @S a bit surprising?   North would like the 9 to lead the Q, but...|pg||
nt|flash: ah - there was a 1@S call...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Any lead 660|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA, 3 clubs and 2 diamonds, including a ruff |pg||
nt|po-s: So East wins and plays a heart, D ruff, Club to ace? and a heart?|pg||
nt|shevek: ouch|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mistiming let's @HT score?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The non-competitive auctions continue.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
nt|xenya: S was naturally hoping for a club honour when he bid 3N -- that was not to be|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|hawe45:  670 os their way|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: one spade and two clubs would be different|pg||
nt|hlortz: /relate/|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nie had conquered the world of  "Go" some 20 years ago and turned his interest to bridge in recent years.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, u r right, four|pg||
nt|shevek: why so keen? to play @h?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For no reason|pg||
nt|po-s: aces should mostly be ducked - a lesson which has not yet reached my country|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  But here only 600|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cancel, too early here|pg||
nt|peachy: he can still take 9|pg||
nt|peachy: or more if def allows :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So in fact it was a good lead, leading the @S King, and West takes 11 tricks - here only 9|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead in OR, that ALONE tells me it was a good lead, plus, I would have led Q or 10 = further evidence...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N plays a third spoade and throws a D, so can W, and E plays a fourth spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not 100% inescapable. but the defense is easy enough|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  next door 4@s made when defence offered @c trick to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that South, who had a maximum for his initial pass, did not take some action when a weak no trump came back|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain by noticing that the players at this level aren't afraid to pause and consider their play(s)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: or that in Strong Club context, he didnt open|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain even more by noticing when they pause|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: so you will be in Reno next month?|pg||
nt|xenya: a club honour in the N hand that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or K & Q to fall singleton |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|chick: probably private, too :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: well, justice served, in a sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry provate|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps an endplay in diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does @CK transfer threat for a squeeze?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems to me that either way W gets an overruff. maybe i am missing something|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, not much chance to catch up if the cards dont cooperate by giving some options|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: Thanks for the trainingin "Go", he is a very good card plaer in bridge, but his biddng is a bit old fashioned.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|flash: @C2 is UDA - encouraging|pg||
nt|peachy: where could he get rid of them?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen some New Zealand and Australian pairs using this 2@C opener -- but don't recall ever seeing it from an ACBL representative|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45:  End-plys possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  play|pg||
nt|peachy: The open room had some conn probs in earlier matches|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H Ace, @C KIng, @H back and the @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South knowa WeatÂ´s distribution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And doesÂ´nt matter, whether West has single og double @H from the beginning|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But badly enough, the @C Jack comes down, which means 10 tricks without this endplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: so he overkilled |pg||
nt|tez: no=undo|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: note that NS are lucky in that S has the @S8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza has now bid to slam on 22 -- off two top tricks -- so the rout continues.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: i dont understand this|pg||
nt|peachy: it may be a failing on my part!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, East didÂ´nt tahe the @C Ace, sleeping !!!|pg||
nt|peachy: the pause here probably is some external prob, surely declarer is not thinking like this'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now safe to play last trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing hearts|pg||
nt|hlortz: surely only 620//|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you giving too little credit to EW then :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 200 - 10/58 for NS|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  They insist on giving gifts in the @S--suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: hardly mattered at that point|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Good card-reading!|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: Actually, with Zimmerman and Lavazza 1-2, maybe 4th is better than 8th.  You definitely don't want to play one of them|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it couldn't cost to cash that last trump :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like that should be -300|pg||
nt|loganrun: Jack of diamonds was a great card but not as good as what happened|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe it was an element of surprise for west |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West was too fast, East could hardly have a double with only small @D|pg||
nt|loganrun: for surprise - he took awhile to play the ace|pg||
nt|po-s: kids is nice - Johan just turned 50|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  lot of spades by NS, but 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: This could be trouble for N-S|pg||
nt|peachy: a lucky 12 tricks here, but we'll see|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - 1NT was 14-16, which explains why it bought the hand on the previous deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: hi Bart|pg||
nt|tez: hi Bart:)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS in OR also missed 3NT in board 4 - so the standing is 3-33!|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 very exciting pais here Kit,  however  because of crashes rooms not connected,  Peter has running score |pg||
nt|bbramley: can zmud bid 1NT here to show 4@S and minor?|pg||
nt|flash: halfway through the match - close and entertaining|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 4+  unless exactly 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass over 1 @S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tez: negative free bid working here|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the end of day 2  Lavazza was in the lead of the 12-round swiss qualifying|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this 4S is too strong for my standards, cannot have two side suits controlled|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing 1nt=long minor and major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i already said the defense was easy. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know what they did in match 9|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: is that raptor? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is there a name for it|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 31-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final|pg||
nt|peachy: seems the organizers dont post match results until the following match is completed, been that way so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh   |pg||
nt|peachy: oh well, guess it works to mix it up...!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S took a line of play that could never succeed there|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm rooting for the Netherlands to get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't know the name, i just know how they play|pg||
nt|peachy: best bridge on the planet in front of us, what a treat|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hawe45:  They might be there after board 7 - but we need OR-result|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, they lost 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure you have played agst them |pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D? -- major + minor?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well lookee here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Saved |pg||
nt|peachy: I guess they will get to this slam now, E showing shape I assume|pg||
nt|flash: how light does one open in 3rd chair?   the more lead-directional the call, the lighter it might be???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=one-round force|pg||
nt|chick: a clear violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone else prefer to pass 1@S?|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S absolutely needed trumps 22 because one club had to be ruffed to set up the suit, and later a spade had to be ruffed. if Ds are 3-1 the hand cant make|pg||
nt|peachy: but don't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass would be eminently sensible|pg||
nt|chick: no, but I prefer to bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would prefer 1N if semi-force or non-force|pg||
nt|jcwla: E did not switch to @S when in with @HA -- all went bye bye on the @D's -- 11 to Lavazza on 22|pg||
nt|hlortz: odd looking to me west dbls stiff in unbid suit  east with k 5th doesnt bid them|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8:  N  3NT-1 in the OR|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, Roland said earlier was made with +1 bd7|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard bids 2 @D,  if not I will |pg||
nt|sybarra: (over 2 @C)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- you just don't know what hand partner holds for 2@C when 1N is absolute force|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, should have been -300 -- unless W didn't play 2 rounds of hearts at the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans -- is your plan to PASS reopening DBL?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No the 1 NT, which should mean, that I was too week for 1 NT directly |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@H is an option|pg||
nt|chick: yes, raija, and it kept them out of a very good (but unfortunately unmakeable) slam|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22, EW in the OR did bid and make 3N on basically the same defence: @H lead ducked by N|pg||
nt|po-s: how about "Polish"?|pg||
nt|bbramley: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E apparently assumed N had announced 4 spades so the double would be more for clubs and hearts. not condoning that line of thought just attempting to explain|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless 2@H was xfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: no chance, without def erring|pg||
nt|tez: i m chicken..i have no idea for convention names|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello po, you are always welcome :)|pg||
nt|tez: hi PO|pg||
nt|othered1: which brings us back to playing the other 6+card fit a level lower :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would make it hard to play 2H, the single most likely correct contract when W doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  any reason for West to bid immediately?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared a pass by North who could well have had a heart fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  then|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: still - with no club fit..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait - errare humanum est|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  tourney site |pg||
nt|flash: still a long way to go for N-S to reach game after this start?   (the balancing X certainly helped)|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead here|pg||
nt|loganrun: This has no chance even on a non club lead as long as West is still not thinking about the last hand|pg||
nt|po-s: if a spade, three rounds of diamonds, ruffed overruffed, and a heart|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hlortz: this will make with a good view in @H suit i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks - it is bedtime but I must see my expartner overbid - alittle|pg||
nt|peachy: i am betting on diam lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the Italian pairs often use DBL in mid auction to just say  extra points|pg||
nt|loganrun: the 6 and 7 of hearts come into play|pg||
nt|shevek: ok kids, against suit contracts we lead shortage |pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: holding four bad hearts i would incline to pass. game is unlikely and i have some defense. if pd bids after i pass, i will be very well placed to act, but if i bid 1N, i will have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to stop bidding before i have much usefuyl info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for Klinger if Apteker does Pass 1@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all that from a guy who has to blow the dust off the green card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA then ruffing finesse might hold this to down 1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: and which one is ex?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (sorry I do not know) |pg||
nt|hlortz: needs a deep finesse here :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't think he can make it even with a perfect guess - more clubs will sink it|pg||
nt|tez: many thanks all..here 4.09 am..bye all..see you..enjoyed|pg||
nt|hlortz: really?n follow to 3 @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Tez @H  pleasant dreams |pg||
nt|bbramley: i see, henry, so he'll threaten to dump both spades - yes, that would be PERFECT guessing|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we have comfortable sitting at home, with coffee and double-dummy deals, not so they|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, pressure of a big event|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must be declarer at this board, we might see an NL-score  now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol yes the deep 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 4@H in OR - but here the lead: a small @S from S?????????????????|pg||
nt|hlortz: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: N did well to show his max, assumedly Dbl meant it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't quote me on that|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: 10 imps|pg||
nt|pelu: to K|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said "ugh"  and would you believe there is spec with that bbo name? |pg||
nt|flash: if South, holding KJx, wouldn't bid NT, that was no longer a possible/plausible strain|pg||
nt|peachy: OR overcalled 1NT with S hand, no wonder they got to game|pg||
nt|hlortz: well unless 2@D xfer not making the case for it im just confused :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wel sure, but the question is why E ddnt bid spades. of course it shows extras|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West surely counted on a @C-.suit in East|pg||
nt|po-s: If you guys don´t stop I´ll leave and go back to bed - but I guess that would please yoy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 2 told me something|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  and world-wide watching |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now lead any minor for down 2  -- even @DJ works -- ruff, @HA  @D ruff @C uppercut to re-establish @C10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they bid 2D a;ready|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: so it could be a dblwhammy for them, dbld game and a plus unmaking slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah -- yes i can live with that tactic|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hlortz: oops my bad lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a cnfusing auction:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: see i *said* i was confused.. meanwhile 3@C not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Raija predicted 23 a push so 35-12 at the halfway mark.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but he has an awfully good hand and i dont see a better call for him if he is going to bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it helps to know that both of the round kings are offside :)|pg||
nt|xenya: this inelegant contract might make...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  But even on a @D-lead from East, you should have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|po-s: must be a commentator|pg||
nt|peachy: lost that one|pg||
nt|shevek: he was thinking abt @ds chris :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: i guess that works too|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Won @DK at trick 2, advanced @CQ and got clubs wrong later, playing for the double finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: Merijn home here, fortuitous rightsiding|pg||
nt|po-s: hmm, overruff and a heart would make it more difficult for West|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: in a dition to different club play then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|bbramley: that will simplify the defense - if he hadn't cashed @SA it gets complicated|pg||

nt|mdgraham: about 5/58 at the moment|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: But looking at past hands in this match, I dont expect them to be in slam other room, no matter how biddable|pg||
nt|peachy: I am glad that the big name teams are not yet on vugraph, giving others the chance to experience that thrill as players|pg||
nt|flash: of course, Mandala, youngster that he (still) is, decided that the South hand was a 1NT overcall   :)|pg||
nt|shevek: fair enough, south knows the opening lead lesson , he thought west was short!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: or East thought 2N was different from what West thought|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must be a strong field|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It ain't bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct declarer technique on Boards 1, 4, and 7 in this room would have the MY team up by about 30 instead of struggling|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also here a couple of IMPÂ´s for Italy - just taking their tricks|pg||
nt|flash: seems unlikely that Lavazza will lose IMPs on this one?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam! |pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 3NT in the OR on a @C lead from N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: another good slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ken Rae is from the Shetlands|pg||
nt|peachy: a likely 3NT here now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East has a difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think that did NOT make overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that could very well be a Strong Two |pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure it is|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a rare beast|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18 5+ H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D 4+ [unless 4=4=3=2]|pg||
nt|xenya: not unexpectedly, 6 was a push -- 4@SX down 1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @D - can they bid it?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: Nunes still in the box after @SK|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like he was down 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A silent 4 @H - coffe-board|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: even a spade lead does not defeat 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9:  S  4@SX-3  500 to EW|pg||
nt|peachy: partscore deal here, most likely|pg||
nt|po-s: you´re such a blood thirsty person|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is a scope for variations|pg||
nt|po-s: overruff in diamonds and a heart would have made I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes quessing the @H-positionm |pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: chance for North-South to retaliate by reaching a lucky slam of their own - 6@c and 6NT both make if played by North (who has bid clubs)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After 2 @D -- West will have some work to get to 6 in a black suit |pg||
nt|peachy: they better play well, it is not easy to take 9 there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  Normally E/W would make 620 in 4 @H, but here...|pg||
nt|xenya: not normally, PO, no|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S = what guys?  1 nt|pg||
nt|bgn: no thanks, not today. Just watching NEC :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do EW play 2/1 GF even in comp? or neg free bids?|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl not my choice..|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@c some countertakeout|pg||
nt|shevek: obviously west is thinking|pg||
nt|po-s: 15 pretty poor points - 2H is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: crucial moment, go or not to go|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm betting no|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: time for Blackwood |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 NT on the N hand is excellent|pg||
nt|peachy: even if one does raise on three sometimes, doing so with S hand would be sick|pg||
nt|peachy: 2c is 10+,  GF if fit and then 2+ cl|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 4 @H you get 12 tricks - in 6 6 @H only 10|pg||
nt|flash: these stopperless NT calls are frightening!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i dont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defeating this 4 @H will bring NL in front|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think the real score is 10-17|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of science in action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 controls I am told|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When 2 @D is majors, I would lead @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No success this time though|pg||
nt|po-s: Was South really contemplating anything but Pass or  was Sylvan really thinking?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Geoff Breskal won the Gold Cup many years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: many many years ago|pg||
nt|hlortz: indelicate but effective|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David Edwin in the audience remembers when|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this event is well-known for collecting "names" in Yokohama, the organizers do their best to attract "stars" giving national players fine possibility to compete  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no good lead for South|pg||
nt|peachy: Have to stay away from spade lead to have any chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best he could do|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - 6@c, as a spectator points out, will not make if East leads her diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a case for cashing the ace - not done|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way, and 2@D looks like an artif GF, or maybe this range balanced|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: this is more a lucky one than the 6NT was, there he only needed spade finess|pg||
nt|gracelin: I was in Yokohama for the NEC cup last year.  This Latin team did very well but they are missing Diego this time.|pg||
nt|dburn: all academic - they aren't going to bid a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3 Ds need heart shift|pg||
nt|peachy: this at least one down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South could double for the lead|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess was the screen |pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately our operators do not speak English, so I can't explain how to reconnect after a crash|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is a bilingual specctator to help Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's all in our manual, but that's also in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: they soudn't.  This is amuch worse slam than last board which only needs a finesse.|pg||
nt|peachy: is Diego B in another team or not there this year?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: this might be tricky both for declarer and  defenders|pg||
nt|po-s: that HQ is a good card, otherwise declarer might have  difficulties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This one should depend om finding the @S Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we think 2 @D= 18+ |pg||
nt|pelu: they play tranfer-ans on 1@C - so 1@S sh be a normal 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm little conservative with 25 hcp total|pg||
nt|hlortz: but i guess they are high enough|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: tk he is not cming thisyear.|pg||
nt|flash: semi-sensible lead for a push...|pg||
nt|shevek: the operator has to wait for both bids|pg||

mc|9|nt|loganrun: 2H seems straightforward but 4H has some obstacles in the play|pg||

nt|peachy: Marshall the standup comic :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, I think E should have tried for game by bidding 2NT|pg||

nt|peachy: identical auction so far as in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this DBL gets more votes :)     |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very likely that 3N makes but 4H does not (or that both do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure notes talk about Matt's DBL - but i won't be able to find it in time :(|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: X by E should show extras, convertible vcalyues|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This slam is better |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Klinger would duck the @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H-P-3@S???|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I dunno about that, E had only one club stopper|pg||
nt|bbramley: polish club, usually a weak nt, but sometimes...  18+ HCP|pg||

nt|flash: only 21 HCP - and the opps are bidding...   |pg||
nt|peachy: but not any more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For a 21Â´er, North has a weak hand|pg||
nt|flash: now, i have a preference...   5-card suits are shown?  4-card suits aren't???|pg||
nt|peachy: not when the opp bid it?|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I misunderstood|pg||
nt|flash: now you're teasing?   3@C puts things up a level, but we're not escaping this any more cheaply??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will South rebid 3@S over 3@C or ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S helps with shape, but without an honor  yuk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4D autosplinter (if ti is)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will show his shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 4@D is minorwood  [RKCB in @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - the key is that south needs to hear about @H filler to really get excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, that 5-level again|pg||
nt|pelu: coprrection : Nunes maded 41Hs - correction by operator (misclicks)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep thought if he played @H to the 7 he'd make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will e/w get in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec points out 4 @S makes |pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@D=artif weak, 1@H=nat but could still be a weak nt (F1?), 2@D nat NF|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@S makes, lose 1 of each|pg||
nt|sybarra: no doesnt make,  think it loses a trick in each suit,,  |pg||
nt|flash: might North have called 2@H over 1@S, instead of Xing again?   (thnx, Deb)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When I was young(er), this pass was for playing 2 @D RD|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm having a conversation with two specs, forgive my inattention please|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise they can make bluff-RD|pg||
nt|flash: only 2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I agree...!|pg||

nt|hlortz: now 4@H from n?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems unlikely that spades will play better than clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, I would, but I am not them :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||
nt|peachy: 9 count and support|pg||
nt|po-s: will East be satisfied with 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: 4C|pg||
nt|sybarra: right bart, I shouid double check  what spec say :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki finally reveals his true nature|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hate to splinter with singleton Ace|pg||
pc|s6|nt|po-s: or 6? no..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C looks fine|pg||
nt|po-s: he won´t get much cooperation I think - well maybe 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easte must have been very close to a D|pg||
nt|flash: certainly i expected partner to make this call - if i didn't bid 3@C earlier, i pass and try not to look too ready for the axe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hard bid to explain is not Matt's double but rather 5H|pg||
nt|chick: wonder why he ran from 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bingo!|pg||
nt|peachy: now P|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont hold up your bingo card yet, they have not IDed a spade control yet|pg||
nt|xenya: i never do|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, after the lead and the favorable DA position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker may have given the show away with his DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be tickled pink to play 5DX after W volunteered the suit over my X|pg||
nt|chick: but he can't let it go undoubled|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- failure to hear a 4@D call probably means some @S values -- but who knows|pg||
nt|loganrun: This is your coffee board Hans|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hlortz: defense wants to make sure declarer has an entry for the @D finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: a little relief here for Zimmermann, match is not yet out of hand by any means|pg||
nt|flash: a sexy 3 IMPs?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he uses it toplay trumps...|pg||
nt|po-s: then a small which is wrong if KJ bare|pg||
nt|peachy: dia shift there could have held but partner's suit is normal |pg||
nt|peachy: I think 4H was an offer to play, |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Duboin's silence against 1@S-2@S has paid off with 6 more on 25 as Bulgaria's E/W got to 2NT/W-2.  Lavazza to within 11.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this is why 3@S probably wrong|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bidding 2N does not rule out getting to 3H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @S D is "only" 1400, I think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: 4H|pg||
nt|xenya: no matter what W does now, declarer will only lose 2 more trumps |pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i like 4D better than 3S--the slam interest is underscored, as opposed to 3S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: 4S was not a strong effort, i think, N should put S in the picture with some sort of fit-showing club bid|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes then 4@H clearly control bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 4D-4H, now S can bid 4N=  "i am still interested, but i dont have a spade control"|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, I dont think 4H was control, he has to show it at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: but again, I dont have their notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and another keypoint for partnerships   would 3@C-4@C be forcing?  [key is to be on same page]|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: she can pitch a @H forcexample|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's 5 more imps for NANIWADA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hlortz: 200 52/58 so far|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: it was a 16IMP swing on the 6@D fiasco|pg||
nt|po-s: trump ace I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: even then he has an re-entry on @H10 - to take the @D-finess :(|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, OR stayd in partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: a ping-pong match|pg||
nt|jcwla: Already 10 coming to Bulgaria, slam would have been an extra 5.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|mdgraham: ah, scores are back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Healthy lead Sandqvist-McIntosh have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But much can still happen in an uneven field|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any views on 2@S there/|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, this event seems to revolve around how well you kill the less experienced pairs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon it's a bit quacky |pg||
nt|hlortz: i dislike the ambiguity of 2@S limit *or better*|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well done|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: then it was lucky they DID bid it, the loss would have been significant|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jcwla: 7 IMPs a board...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: heres a sexy little number|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh should I say W is and E is still thinking|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|jbgood: why is that, Henry?|pg||
nt|peachy: S is strong enough to open naturally, with longest suit, follow up with diamonds twice|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, interesting. as for me, I hate hands like S's - points in short honours and main suit (@c) w/o controls |pg||
nt|peachy: hah, if gets a chance...|pg||
nt|flash: natural; limited|pg||
nt|flash: asking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 7H to get a trump lead:)|pg||
nt|shevek: at the end of the Swiss, ties will be broken by IMP quotient|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  E will give a hand|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: ew could scramble 8 tricks in s[ades|pg||
nt|peachy: ooh, and they are going for it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: major suit cards placedbadly for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H??!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  time for W to show big fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open room have finished by now|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes if a world class defender puts u in dummy dont finesse...!|pg||
nt|flash: 6-card suit; no outside 4-card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Great bid:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is N a chicken?|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, I would just bid 3D, 3S sounds too weak|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps 3S is their sys|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best game on EW 3nt on W|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is a near Yarborough -- the @D10 spoils the picture |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Art Garfunkel?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=5+@H & 5+@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think East and West have minimum, both oif them|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester makes no other|pg||
nt|po-s: will East comply - Lebensohl probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S is a good bid - for E/W, now East waill avoi the @D-lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=6-13 HCP, 4+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: to put necomers in the picture - SARA needs ten more vPs than SouthSweden to qualify|pg||
nt|shevek: in the KO phase, the team with the higher position from the Swiss gets a ½IMP carryover|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: they also play CAPP over 1NT opening, so 2D shows both maors.|pg||
nt|flash: practical call?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not Garfunkel   this GF gets more respect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=@D   go figure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has now bid only only the suit in which he has about 6% of his HCP :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and in the OR they are in 6 nt by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: with a sp lead |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the unbid portion of his hand his per capita HCP average is 2.5 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Klinger had option to bid 4@H to show solid/1-loser suit|pg||
nt|shevek: try to be impartial PO :) (commentator's ethics, etc...)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: I almost didnt belive that he took the @D-finess -|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, South has NO 3 @C-bid|pg||
nt|shevek: I didn't cheer when ish played in 7@h missing 1 ace (and made it)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: no double from South, slightly surprising|pg||
nt|jbgood: point taken|pg||
nt|po-s: doubledummy on a spade lead ducked and another spade...|pg||
nt|po-s: give up a club and a diamond, then throw South in at the end for a heart favor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to bid 3S here i think, and then W will bid 4D|pg||
nt|peachy: this game, if they stretch, could also make if def finds a wrong lead|pg||
nt|peachy: so match not over yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S is Puppet to 2N   making 3@C INV   [where immediate 3@C would be game force]|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another monster result for Bulgaria here.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  Strange decision - West has the hand for bidding 4 @S|pg||

pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  OK - thatÂ´s better|pg||
nt|po-s: but he might simply go for hearts in a simpler fashin|pg||
nt|po-s: fashion|pg||
nt|po-s: DJ isn´t very good either, is it|pg||
nt|xenya: it is not|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@H looks down 1, -50 a good save vs. 3@D making 110 or 130|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E decided there was no way to show, so he i susing KC hoping to hide his hand as declarer:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: EW are adopting the NS strategy of self-destruction :(|pg||
nt|peachy: bit score relief for Naniwada now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6 more imps for NANIWADA |pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: so, Lavazza team MUST stretch to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duboin has perfect picture to find 4@H jumpm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bocchi is the best at stretching:)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, thats why he is so tall?|pg||
nt|po-s: have I supported anyone? ANYONE?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South will easily make 7 tricks...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|po-s: so it leaves a club or a heart|pg||
nt|xenya: complex hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 3 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s it - you sit up here in the cold North, trying to find out, how to bid 4 @S - and North just did it|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3-2 spades plus 3-3 hearts or QJ doubleton|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @H10    really??|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Very bad lead this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure about result on 10, but before it was 22-17|pg||
nt|peachy: as well as her own|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds heavily in favor of W shortness being in Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 2 top hearts and Ds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Absolutely NOT, po!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Herman just needs to find Forrester's entry to get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Keep looking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: little does he know it's in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he must have one after 3@H without A and Q, right?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North had no good lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: although he might suspect it |pg||
nt|po-s: this way is no good though|pg||
nt|sybarra: down 3!! |pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: maybe the @CA and another would have been better?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East just wanted to se the @H-signals from N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Unblock...|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps nothing is lost yet|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a good example of aggressive bidding -- EW got just a bit too high, but that induced NS to go overboard too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i am tired -- was thinking West declaring @S  :(|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Voila they say in France|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a low club lead fro N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: responses to RKC are 1430 ONLY when trump=@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|po-s: but now North can break communications should declarer duck the diamond|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: Bas really didn't want a ruff, I think he was trying for a lead not to give a trick or something|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: this likely to be around average     double for north might have gain quite a bit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht can happily keep the @HK8 over dummy's @HQ7|pg||
nt|hlortz: -2 looks normal|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: preserving more options this way perhaps|pg||
nt|po-s: no, as a commentator you must do the opposite|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S showed @HQ  said nothing about @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: I would think a higher club from W would make it clearer for partner to return @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Endplay for overtrick instead|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but playing the sox off this hand!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: yes, Lin is a very agressve bidder.  Nie didn't take account for that.  |pg||
nt|peachy: indeed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: Bob Drijver, sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 pickups in a row will put Oz in the lead|pg||

nt|shevek: the bill for that 670 arrived (sorry PO)|pg||

nt|po-s: yep, they went one down |pg||
pc|cA|nt|bbramley: yes, good trump plays, now an extra club loser|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 5/6/6/14|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: but if that 3rd D was ruffed, a spade could come back and heart queen could be promoted via another D|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: "we" did...|pg||

nt|peachy: No, Nie's jump did it, IMO.  |pg||

nt|marlowepi: reverse black suits in W hand & very likely Ron would open at 4 level at these colors|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|peachy: Open room was allowed to play in 4C, good for them|pg||

mb|2H|nt|sybarra: I think I know some folks who would open 4 @S on W hand|pg||
nt|flash: obviously, the defense has the first 4 tricks available here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W 130 in OR is a good result for NL|pg||
nt|po-s: funny hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, Lin might double the weak NT opening with a stronger hand.|pg||
nt|flash: Multi - weak 2 in a major; 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Big result for Italy in OR|pg||
nt|flash: knowing quite well that a 2@S call won't be forthcoming|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a few good hands in a row for them|pg||
nt|xenya: potentially|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, you think that´s why he opened 1NT to make South declarer in diamonds (with a transfer bid)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: n/s can make 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|peachy: right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for South Sweden - itÂ´s only 50 kilometers from here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: anybody see a result other than down 3?|pg||
nt|chick: not unless E drops a card on the table accidently|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, making. but that would be 5D :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: only a @C lead will give 6@H a problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt look good for playing in Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That's what you get for overcalling 2@S vul against not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is dead as a rat|pg||

nt|hlortz: 2@S was a sort of prebalance but south didnt know that|pg||
nt|jtr: He had a  tough decision|pg||
nt|peachy: I think best now to bang down the spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead the @D Ace - and lose 620|pg||

nt|gracelin: they might wrongsided the 3NT cntract, but luckily, DJ is in north hand.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Puppet Stayman auction   3@D=at least 1 4-card major   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can do it a lot later in 6D|pg||

nt|po-s: good sacrifice in 5C|pg||
nt|hlortz: well the 10@H dropping is a clue also..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C is 4-card Stayman|pg||
nt|po-s: The diamonds are so good, and the aces are not NTfriendly|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  Will @D 10 followed by the 9 wake up South?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And @H 10|pg||
nt|peachy: probably will lead diamond, leastr self-destructive without seeing all hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has stronger spot cards in club but he might go after spade since he has no entry for the long club suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing now    4@S=RKCB  5@C=3 keycards, 5@D asks @HQ  5@S=yes and @SK|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c29|st||md|3SQJT642HQ53DKCAJ5,SAK8HJ876DJ753CQ9,S73HAT2D98642CT73,S95HK94DAQTCK8642|sv|b|nt|jtr: Amazing you taught him so much in one session:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can make double dummy of course. diamond king and spade finesse. but declarer should put in the diamond ten at trick one to try to force a dummy entry|pg||
nt|peachy: other table behind a bit, maybe still some connection issues? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what a bloody result next door!|pg||
nt|po-s: seems you lose a spade a heart and 3 minor tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N had 8 tricks he would probably just be taking them rather than letting himself go down 2 extra tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: yup, gold star to lavazza for the 6@D in the or|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an| |nt|peachy: could well be duplicated here|pg||
nt|xenya: right, so the 3@D bid was not also quite natural but also correct|pg||
nt|po-s: - and perhaps one in the wash|pg||
nt|hlortz: undo?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the original Blue Team Club -- North would open 3@C  -- how's that for useless trivia|pg||
nt|po-s: anyway, you say 23 is 20-10 in VPs, so another 2 imps is what SARA would need|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: ah, no|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's not the end )))|pg||
mb|d|nt|po-s: wrong bidders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert must mean 1@C=2+   which North surely has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another 6 @H - with @D behaving|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 14 is the last board of the match; restart 10 minutes to the hour with the last match today|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps the issue here is the margin, rather than the outcome?  as long as both finish in the top 8, they advance to the KO phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: 2C?|pg||
nt|peachy: i like 2C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is more like a 2C opener than a 2C rebid|pg||
nt|flash: of course, the higher a team finishes, the more control they retain over their opponents in the KOs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment in Europe  is for 1x-(1@H)-DBL to DENY 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have another Italian DBL that can't be described confidently|pg||
nt|xenya: boards 10 and 12 are potentially very good for Sara|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IsÂ´nt 6 @H a fair shot from SouthÂ´s position?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hardly the 18-20 HCP  [semi]balanced hand most of us expect for 4@H|pg||
nt|shevek: no no, I say 19-22 is 20-10VP|pg||
nt|shevek: 23-26 is 21 VP|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes, it only took 24 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: lets see how 3NT fares...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S or 4@C now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what now by S?  XX?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@H now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3C by N would have been an underbid|pg||
nt|chick: a nice reverse into 2@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17:13 in Japan now|pg||
nt|flash: 1@D shows at least 4 and a shapely hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator -pl UNDO!|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C usually shows 9 card in the minors, either way|pg||
nt|po-s: mind you - that is to pass South Sweden - it does not mean that SS get knocked out as they are 5th at the moment|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1NT - not my chioce |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to get it corrected |pg||
nt|bbramley: 3-1 trumps would have made it much more complicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker is liking this more and more with each round of bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: hasn't north done a lot of bidding, considering the @SK isn't full value?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Short of entries, East might play @D to the Ace.|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe 1@s was Xfer to 1NT?|pg||
nt|shevek: Dbl I mean|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: it may go 3S and 3NT, not a great contract.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H probably shows the 1444|pg||
nt|po-s: yes it was|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
nt|peachy: aceless softie, unless to my surprise 4C were forcing, cant be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each player wary of void in partner's other suit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: a VERY lucky 3N...|pg||
nt|hlortz: w needs to overtake the @H trick 1 and play @S to beat 5@C easy for these guys im sure|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and not a great slam because of having to guess @S at trick one  :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|peachy: not at all, 3S the last making one, but if EW in other room play 15-17NT (I dont know if they do) might go same way|pg||
nt|flash: although it might just be patterning out (1354 or 1345) with a max for not opening 1@C|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D-1S-2C shows 5-4 or 4-5 minors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are in GF and S is unlimited. N has good cards, good IN-OUT valuation|pg||
nt|othered1: Wouldn't north have bid the same, to imply stiff @S, if the @SK work a working K?|pg||
nt|sybarra: fast arrival "hopefully"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe aceless and somewhat soft, but all values are working|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: nice fit|pg||
nt|chick: at least they got into a makeable game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, might|pg||
nt|po-s: 3S shows good with short diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: according to sys card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- why so pessimistic?   [even if it is the max they can make]|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: nice judgment by Merijn Groenenboom|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I expect a flat board, losing 1 spade, 1 heart and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was same in other room (correctly) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently it was, but i dont know why S bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course VIctor Mollo's Hideous Hog said   you have to bid bad slams -- because so many good ones go down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s because of the cue-bid - bidding with closed eyes 6 @H, it is a fair slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Slam score at board 10|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|peachy: theygot there anyway, at least|pg||
nt|peachy: in the other room, bulgarian EW put NS to a guess, well done|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||
nt|po-s: this time the hearts behave. You need to guess how to treat diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy slam|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hlortz: fortunately this is a simple 4@S making so we arent missing anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might lose @C to ensure game??|pg||
nt|sybarra: only if @D's break I thnk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: our predictions havent really fetched tonightm have they Sveta :)|pg||
nt|xenya: @C shift was needed to beat it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@s on board 9:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 17:)|pg||
nt|xenya: imps|pg||
nt|xenya: lucky|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be a simple cliam by operator (easiest) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: why not just transfer to @s' /|pg||
nt|peachy: would be pretty conservative not to be in game vul IMPs|pg||
nt|hlortz: so 6 imps for staying out of game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Terrific bidding by Bulgaria in this match.  No bidding on last bd at least in OR.|pg||
nt|loganrun: If you can see around corners this is cold but declarer can't|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: well i want to be in it if it is on 32 trumps. actually you need more, but it is still worthwhile. anyway when i said "easy" i meant easy to make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wonder why S didnt temporize with 4D which looks like a freebie. maybe that would have been KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly what i was thinking Marshall  when i used the "p" word  [pessimistic]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thought it stood for Pusillanimous|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  u r right, Raija|pg||
nt|shevek: that explains 1NT bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: and he got that wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra2: then invite?  maybe I missed something earlier|pg||
nt|flash: we were speaking of shoes earlier - as usual, Mandala-Bocchi have their bidding shoes on!!!   another monster result|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|jtr: There will be a few in slam on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: may make 12 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose  usage|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|cJ|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They have a VERI BIG set here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  VERY|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|jbgood: but will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|gracelin: because in this sequence EW can stop in 2S, while if you transfer, you need to followup with 2NT. |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: @C switch coming too late...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jtr: seems a big play not finessing the @s and taking 11|pg||
nt|peachy: one more down doesnt matter, 2N not making either|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok |pg||
nt|peachy: while if in 2NT and game makes...|pg||
nt|flash: while this is playing out...    thnx to NEC for their continuing sponsorship of this great tournament|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: east can get most of the match points if entering with A@H   cashing dimonds and finessing 10@C     |pg||
nt|peachy: then opps have more and they wont lie silent|pg||
nt|peachy: the 1pt hand was squeezed, beautiful!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but no more problem now - u r right again - overtrick|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: Sara gaining momentum|pg||
pc|s6|nt|flash: thnx to the JCBL, and particularly Akito Omasa, for inviting us to participate |pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our commentators for guiding us through the hands|pg||
nt|flash: and to the specs for trying to keep us on our toes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: on track for a push|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: deserved it i think -- i don't see why you should bid up to 3N on these hands|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: sry - not qq but 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they have 18 HCP and no fit, and have already bid once|pg||
nt|peachy: even if it was pseudo|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: and are vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is going for the gusto play|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: well played by N i think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|po-s: you should - if it mkes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: perhaps NS know their "customers"|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's -3 and maybe 10 imps if other room stops in 3S.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: now only 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: 11:) |pg||

nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final knockout round -- SARA currently in 15th place, OZ in 3rd|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: Will this be the flattest of flat 4@S's I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably not|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S for n/s    west will need to lead clubs to hold to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: some wont bid game perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: why should it be flat   not all will lead a club|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you everyone, was a pleasure to keep company with you all, incl kibitsers!|pg||
nt|flash: next match scheduled in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you miss slam you should make exactly five|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as has our Vugraph Operator -- well done!|pg||
nt|po-s: if South had discarded a heart he could have endplayed declarer for 2 down|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Last board now. Many thanks to our operator in Yokohama, and to kakasi, Raija and Hans|pg||
nt|peachy: Last board now, thank you to Japan Contract Bridge League, BBO, and our Roland Wald, for bringing this event to vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: if it's customary for NS to open that light, they must have some machinery to let them stop low |pg||
nt|po-s: and if in 2NT you still need to ddo the right thing in D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's true|pg||
nt|po-s: correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and not all bid what we think they should:)|pg||

nt|peachy: Jim "Flash" Gordon, quick on his feet, humor, great analysis. And Hans from the cold North, wonderful!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nite all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would show 4+@H but show length as natural players do [@S first when 55]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing 15-17, I would be in game as East|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - new plansRight spot - they played the same system...|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a reasonable bet, neeed clubs to behave|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perhaps Drijver thought that 3@C implied heart fit|pg||
nt|shevek: a big thank you to our excellent operator, to NEC for staging this great event, and to the JCBL (Akito Omasa)|pg||
nt|shevek: and last but not least thanks to our spectators who give us a reason to be here in the first place|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But there is a losing option - the @H-finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: a very thin game that could be beaten on a trump lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: but now...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Highly exciting and involving set of boards.|pg||
nt|peachy: Specs, you were so very quiet this match, you all are free to comment to us as much as you like :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: rarity on OR a passed out board|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everyone, see you soon|pg||
nt|jcwla: One pd of mine says the passout decision is the best part of his game.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: just under an hour|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - needs onle @S-suit 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  only|pg||
nt|peachy: I thought about that. Many play fit jumps by PH|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-switch is bad - tka this trick|pg||
nt|hawe45:  take|pg||
nt|peachy: he will figure it out.  Must take|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He might as well; he knows spades are 4-4 after the lead, no?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a fast duck in @CÂ´s from West very soon - and we shall wee|pg||
nt|hawe45:  see|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but you need less luck in 2N and you won't go down 3 vulnerable |pg||
nt|xenya: good stop|pg||
