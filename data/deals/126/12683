nt|varange: what to lead? Spade is unattractive.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C+1@H+2@D=top 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will cost blood, sweat and tears|pg||
mb|d|nt|varange: and having no entries, it is probably a good idea trying to find partner's long suit outside of spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: overtricks to follow-very friendly lay out of cards|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: about 2 off so 600 swing possible|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|varange: i'm at a loss to see how they arrived in 2@s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to show both majors after the 1nt interference. So they found the Moysian only.|pg||
nt|varange: in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same sequence but transfer, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: John Carruthers suggests 1@c-1@d-1NT-DBL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible|pg||
nt|paulg:  stength according to vulnerability ... so no doubt what it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: a little too much, again the vuln game bonus makes them bid a lot|pg||
nt|paulg:  Presuming that South could have bid 3@h to show a good raise, I think North has overdone it a little|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree, the 2 spade call showed a decent hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|varange: would 2@c by east show the majors?|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|pc|s2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 2 off, east west gaining even more imps here|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding thin vulnerable games is fine if you only go down one, but costly when more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and there was a small chance to be doubled- so that could have been expensiv|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldfriede: None of the possible continuations of South are to his liking.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|varange: 2@h initially looks to be OK, but has the slight blemish of not making, far as I can tell|pg||
