nt|marlowepi: very good stuff by W. he had the right idea but fell from grace, forgiven however by the cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jcwla: Do you like 1@S or 1NT rebid here by E?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: when defenidng you cant afford to go iubnto the tank at the critical point|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: you must be ready with a misleading discard in TEMPO|pg||
nt|faramarz: 1NT from  W is a better contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: in general, yes, but on that deal the tempo before D queen is not really relevant as regardless of his holdings he would have to think about which red suit to discard. in fact, in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that context a quick diamond queen might be more suspect than a slower one|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: a very good question asked by spec is waht was north's reason for bnot continuing the hearts|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was north afraid of in other words|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the answer is that he was trying to stop spade ruffs, fearing W held QJxxx of trumps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: so that S could not overruff|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|faramarz: N hadnt realy a good reason for not continuing a H   but this wldnt change anything|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: catering for a possible but unlikely position his partner was very likely to have a spade higher than the 8 or at least be perceived by declarer to be likely to ov er ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|faramarz: guess   who comes to 7 tricks  first !!!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|lestergold: or would north have thought that switching to a trump would prevent two ruffs in dummy iof spades were solid as he knew that declarer could get back to hand in clubs|pg||
nt|jcwla: Never a bad idea to lead @H's here -- W made a forced major response and E did not promise any nor did W make any inquiry about E's @H's -- lets 'em know they can't put you off ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: your lead and when works has good psychological effect|pg||
nt|faramarz: one way to make it,   @s  to the K  @d to dummy  & @s |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|faramarz: Steven listens to me|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: yes, mike as i reckon it S was better than a 3-2 favorite to hold a spade bigger than the 8, which was why i critiqued the spade shift at the start of the play|pg||
nt|faramarz: this also works|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: you were right Marshall of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the of course in that sentence makes it an overbid at all times:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: the main point is surely that one spade shify was never going to prevent the hearts being ruffed in dummy if that play was viable|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: je signales aux spectateurs francophones qu'ils sont invites a me poser des commentaires ou des questions en francais aussi bien qu'en anglais:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: it might have in fact made it viable when without the shift it wasnt viable |pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, this is a push.|pg||

nt|vugraphzcz: little slow table to start but the smokers are at this table|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon from sunny Geneva :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: hi Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: No snow 20 km North|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no "weak" 2 suiter opening in N|pg||
nt|hedyg: might have considered opening 1@s anyhow|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wiki: hello again - 8 more boards|pg||
nt|k ylinen: pas,kun on 11ap ja tasainen|pg||
nt|rodal f: A realy good quality at that @S for the bid:))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Juho, Markku, Roland, kibs!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome back! Hi Markku P, Kalle and Juho|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And good morning to Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|k ylinen: hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS play modified Blue Club w 4c majs and canapes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Rodal and all welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kaapo2:  NS play Blue Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not splinter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-suiter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: suction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i believe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after 64 boards lots of imps have been scored|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky slam to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: hi everyone, wlc|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Nice to be here|pg||
nt|hedyg: can they stop before 4@s now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@D= @ss + @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H by E now?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can make 6 @C, nor 6 @H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  Easy play here - all suitys behave|pg||
nt|hedyg: check for 4 @ss|pg||
nt|wiki: 5 @S optimum as EW can make 5 1C or @D|pg||
nt|wiki: @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: hand when you know pd has @s:s but u wanna play in @h :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: now we see -now we didnt -i think south must transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 clubs now?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes 2 clubs ns 2 diamonds |pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi Frank|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: U2 Hedy:))|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead likely to be @D by both N and S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: 2 aces and the correct singelton, so missed a slam on this one|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo2:  Holding a 4-card major, North usually would open with the major|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But 3@H at least is on|pg||
nt|k ylinen: N passed with 11 hcp and balanced as system requires so|pg||
nt|runnerup: now sure|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Team SaTu was up by 50 IMPs after yesterday - but the lead was cut down to 17 IMPs during the first 8 board segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i thought E would have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N took a risk, S might not have dias suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i suppose S may correct to 2N since N showed max|pg||
nt|runnerup: six any from west is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 6@d about finding @dQ (or 6@s by W)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why didn't E bid 3 dias?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi Marc and Hans + specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  That's why South gets to bypass her 4-card @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  For what reason 1 @D from North - and not 1 C???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c-3@H-3NT= not intterested in @Hs looking for @ss|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Hello|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kaapo|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Still 24 boards to play|pg||
nt|mmmakela: normally N has 5 dias for this bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Good evening Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time it went 1@S  4@H  declarer was in a 0-0 fit. Sadly, it wasn't on vugraph|pg||
nt|wiki: bur probably 3 pass here|pg||
nt|miniemin: East-West "Ranna Ruutu"  system from Estonia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @D and after @SA @D return some guessing by the declarer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 1 @S Pass 4@S would have worked better here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: hi all, JM Boite is taking over|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Patrick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: because with 4 4 they open 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see - but why?|pg||
nt|wiki: but - sorry about my fingers :(|pg||
nt|wiki: hello again and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: you could bid 4@c asking pd to trf to his suit, then pass the 4@h response|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't know promised max|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Jean-Marc :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Interesting: Fist in hand, everybody would open the S-hand - nor the North-hand, which is clearly better! |pg||
nt|hawe45:  First|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: hi all, 1st time on duty|pg||
nt|hedyg: gl to you :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A partscore might with some problems,but some help by that lead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Test the @C for the hook and 3-3. If not 3-3 u need to hit the @D, but here the @C works|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Mikko!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: because when the bidding goes 1@d-1@s-X he can bid 2@c without 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
nt|doctorone: Frankly, I would just have bid 3N as S. See where we are now. But as it is our day, we will survive in 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3NT shows 4@ss to me|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I do hope, that the survival will be in 4 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s without them and 3NT with them|pg||
nt|doctorone: I meant over 2NT, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: why give up on finding a 4 4 @s fit?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is a sequence it's good to have an agreement on so that you don't get to play in a 1-0 fit|pg||
nt|runnerup: changes for +1|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|peachy: this should make max 7 tricks if lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah, Roland has 0-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs and vug operator:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup: yes south had dimonds but very weak opening otherwise-perhaps lucky + score anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: a quick -1? or....|pg||
nt|hedyg: E played his smallest @C for @d and S falsecarded to show the 2@c in E..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  But hard to find the killing @d-lead against 4 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd will NEVER bid over 3NT ....:(|pg||
nt|miniemin: Hi Markku|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good by to a plus-score|pg||
nt|doctorone: I don't want to open a debate... I know how many positions about this issue exist, but I don't like bidding 2N with 4@s... So my problem is solved. I know, they are drawbacks of ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, 4 @H can NEVER mak - if not South plays @H to the 10, he is short of entries|pg||
nt|peachy: prob six|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|wiki: both pairs playing  strong club|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: Well that sequence owed more to Culbertson than anything CC Wei might have|pg||
nt|oliverc: come up with :)|pg||
nt|wiki: now 420|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 9 is good|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|doctorone: good lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: coded 9s?|pg||
nt|doctorone: seems so, or just a falsecard, in front of N's opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: stephan thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: only with @s lead this is 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|oliverc: but who are we to argue with success?|pg||
nt|muppe: +1 now it seems. Defence would have done its best with trump lead or switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kursat Ozsahin|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs A@d to be in W to make this|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Tha was killing (the) defence|pg||
nt|runnerup: with 9 diamonds 6 can be found if east supports i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: no such luck|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I think EW play strong club with 5-card majors and 14-16 1NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|runnerup: hi all people |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: hmmm|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wiki: now S must play @C|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|hedyg: now need to finesse @c|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. W gave S a chance|pg||
nt|wiki: now N must play @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Good morning. This is the Finnish senior qualification to Europeans|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|runnerup: not the best line|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10@C better? Lavental|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: why @d?|pg||

nt|doctorone: he will make and win an impor two :) Thats the bridge story |pg||
nt|hedyg: they have split some pairs...Latinovs regular pd is Tom Fenwick who is at home coughing. mishaps are bound to happen|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|peachy: nice of W to save outcard for E|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i prefer 2C, with double later. if it goes 1H-X-4H-4S, you wont know if you are in the right spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here heart beats 3N and there should be three losers in 5C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and there are other advantages of the overcall too. very very unlikely that you will play in 2C|pg||
nt|faramarz: Alon will bid 4@h if pushed to & will go -2 |pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact its hard to see how best cefence allows declarer more than nine tricks in a club contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N will not enjoy discarding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: best for south to pass 3N knowing that heart lead wuill almost certainly defeat it|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: not sure why he would know 3N is going down. if he had the ace of spades instead of the king, better chances of beating it, but even then EW coiuld easily have 9 runners. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nevertheless S has a very easy opass thanks to the colors|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: well he can lay all the clubs he likes around the houses but at least one off depending on whetehr he cashes out or not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my comments assume 3H was pre-emptive|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: it would be in most half sane bidding shystems|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s9|pc|cK|nt|faramarz: what will be the last 6 cards kept by south ??   he has to discard 5 times    but unfortunately  declarer has only  one @h   if he had 2 cds @h   he cld make this |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: yes, faramarz his hand was too good:)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: So 5 to N/S - W took a very reasonable chance and it did not pay off.|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe should have played a diamond at trick 2 although no way should north then or now be caught napping|pg||
nt|faramarz: ceci donne encore 5 imp à Squeese|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since that would lead to down 2 if N is not comatose, W would have to believe there was an excellent chance of it working, which i doubt he would |pg||
nt|lestergold: Is North reallyin the  tank?|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he is i hope he doesnt drown in it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is simply double and triple checking. no harm in that. they dont confiscate the ace of D if it is played after a huddle:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzcz: W:s comment was that he didn't like the chances of making that contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but considering the situation of the match, he felt he had to bid it|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6nt is the other possibility because it can be plaised to west|pg||
nt|mmmakela: "nice" fit EW here|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: game both sides here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: good max E has here|pg||
nt|vbman: some might open with e|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  In the open room, they weren't sure if 4@H was a splinter or not, resulting in playing in 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any 1@D for major?|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal loking 4 hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Strong club all around in this match. NS hear play a Precision-style system with 14-16 NT, and EW strong club with control responses, and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  *here|pg||
nt|runnerup: a borderline game 3nt or better 5 diamonds -difficult both|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chance to over bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: now ossi can pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: But -1 or 7?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|miniemin: 2@C = 6-10 hcp , majors at least 5-4 or 4-5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 positive things, dias hook working and spades 3-3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with 2 @H showing majors, N/S will know better|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  How can E/W get a trick against a @H-slam?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd certainly open the East hand. Precision tends to lose the Diamond suit a bit,|pg||
nt|oliverc: since the 1@D Opening is more of a catch-all and in classic precision can easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: have as few as 2 Diamonds|pg||
nt|wiki: shorter than in Ostende :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: canape opening in use|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W have some work to do to make 5 @C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45:  7 @C looks like only 1100|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and clubs 33|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H pre empt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT look better - lot of discards for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Yes, could be a swing board|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@h will probably make, will they bid it?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  4@C should do it|pg||
nt|vbman: i dont think its gf |pg||
nt|vbman: ah there|pg||
nt|vbman: 4 card support makes s hand a giant|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe not in red|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not u W. Was thinking abough S:)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well judged|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i don't like that bid with only 3 card support|pg||
nt|k ylinen: limit Stenberg|pg||
nt|runnerup: this makes so good start for satu |pg||
nt|rodal f: NT a better try Y, but will end in @C if S don't give a gift|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: huge triumph for satu to play in 2 @C making|pg||
mb|d|nt|doctorone: would you support @cs as E?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Or may-be 1400 because of the bad trump-split|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a waste of time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass - or bid 5 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Unless EW think otherwise|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes, the overcall will make it easier for NS to get to this slam|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I do|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5-4 and not minimum|pg||
nt|runnerup: Väiski seems to bid that support instead of 1 spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: can u play 4@s still if opener shows suit there?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes 1 @S response stands out|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I suppose Makela doubted whther 4H makes because he only bid 3S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  1@D could be short if 11-13 balanced, so EW don't really know about the huge double fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe time again:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@h would be -1 if u find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is the last 8-board segment of this 80-board qualification match. The winners get the right to play for Finnish seniors in the 2010 Europeans in Ostend, Belgium|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: NS are discussing the bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to duck the @d switch|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ItÂ´s OK to cover the second @D from West - this time|pg||

mb|4C|nt|hedyg: i really prefer 3@c over 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i'd like to bid 1@s instead of 2 with the S hand|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looking at EW's cards, 5@C looks to have just 3 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 5@c could be -2 but on a @h lead it would make|pg||
nt|muppe: Easy 10 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias here better than 3 nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new try from S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: W I ment|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
nt|rodal f: and......|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Normally 5 @C is a good contract, put the @D Ace doubleton by opener, and it works well|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now 5@c|pg||
nt|wiki: pass was ok now when 3 NT is not quite makeable|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: north asking lots of questions to east|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: well heart lead and right guess...|pg||
nt|runnerup: they really liked to take away trumps from dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still to find who have @DAX block. To hard for me|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kaapo2:  Of course @D ruff takes it 2 down|pg||
nt|vbman: close your eyes and bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: south is gonna bid it after the 2NT call|pg||
nt|rodal f: I wonder if S would have leaded @HA in 5@C. Take a look and see what would have happend if not|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3@S is on two|pg||
nt|k ylinen: he could, because system requires 5 cards to 1S bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps south is weak for her 3 diamond can they stop|pg||
nt|runnerup: now hearts lets this home but can n lead something else |pg||
nt|rnmalik: It is an interesting hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzcz: now an overtrick|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Friendly match - E/W passing...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, but hard to bid it looking at W´s cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 2@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: what is the best line in 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stole spot since 4@C is on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non at open so I have to leave. See u later might.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo2:  5@C that is|pg||

nt|vbman: cool|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|mmmakela: still wondering how could anyone open E hand w 7-4 showing majors, I'd treat it as spades only|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|peachy: i liked 2S better, no defense except potential slow club|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even here a endplay is needed since @D are 4-2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kaapo2:  This is the third segment of 8 boards out of 10. After this segment, there will be a late lunch and the restart is then at 15:30 local time (14:30 CET)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|runnerup: yes they can so -different chances but all makes i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i like this line|pg||
nt|runnerup: now +1|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knew that E had at most 3@ds if he had 9 Ms and singleton @c|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Sr. Forgot the @S was 5-2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - and no end-play works|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: now he can pull trumps and ruff out J@d if only W does not have 3 @hs|pg||
nt|runnerup: north hoped this to be forcing but -partner passed-dissopointing--4 spades on but lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: ups|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h6|nt|wiki: Keep you high cards says N|pg||

pc|hK|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes, it should|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup: yes not so clear how to play this|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd've played Q|pg||
nt|rodal f: A free hook if @D now and @S solve the problems|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|doctorone: that explains why they scored a trick there... Declarer guarding against 3@h with W allowed a @d ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: ofcourse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Only an exsta IMP:))|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non for play @H NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: :(|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Playing South for J-x or 10-x, right play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Must have been so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and South is endplayed|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s5|pc|h7|nt|hedyg: he cannot just play top cards and then find @hs 3-1 , K@D in E and Q@s in W|pg||
nt|doctorone: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: so a chance for cassini to gain some imps|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|oliverc: Kibber rightly points out that 4@S here was a little pointless, (since the only control|pg||
nt|oliverc: that North is likely to have is in Spades so North unlikely to respond with anything|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb 2 min|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oliverc: other than 5@H)|pg||
nt|wiki: it is seldom right that both play the same suit |pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: he is playing 6@Hs not 7|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|marlowepi: hard to tell from his collection, i admit, but presumably 2D shows a good weak 2 in a major, close to opening values|pg||

nt|peachy: i think so too|pg||
nt|k ylinen: any one for 5% by S?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5D|pg||
nt|wiki: we always say it is only 1 IMP but when it happens often enough....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit hard but often OK. |pg||
nt|wiki: depends on feelings -  sitting here I do not know|pg||
nt|wiki: but ok for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: conservative here|pg||
nt|runnerup: Cassini seems to start strongly -to get back imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: yes, my mind was in wrong contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: leading @S J wasn't "impossible" in this sequence (or small spade)|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 h ew|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, opening 1@S or perhaps 4@S looks more sensible on the East  cards on the previous board|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no |pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry priv|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  At least one of the kibitzers was a little confused, so I'll clarify: all of these players are from Finland, but EW use an Estonian bidding system, Ranna ruutu, or Beach Diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - you shall beat 3 NT, facing a partner, who did bid but nothing over 3 @C - @d-lead not out of question|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcg: back|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  You can make 5 @C by finessing the @H 8!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Quite nice a hand at West|pg||
nt|muppe: indeed|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Does Juho know any Rabbis?|pg||
nt|oliverc: exactly, so maybe 5@C a more helpful cue-bid than 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Did Timo not bid 3@S already?|pg||
nt|wiki:  4 @S here but  only DD|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems 4h+1 or +2 -if you guess all but a lot can happen here|pg||
nt|runnerup: but then you down get lucky + score --very lucky board for brothers|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|peachy: is NS also playing some strong club variant?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they be taken? Only a partscore for EW|pg||
nt|runnerup: a diamond ruff set 6 and this opening will make difficulties|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: would anyone bid on with N:s hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: opponent most often have both major fits|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcg: steven "reevaluating his @d single"|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe 3NT I belive|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|wiki: maybe entry problem even dd|pg||
nt|rodal f: By DD y Wiki. Would u be there? |pg||
nt|rodal f: But I belive they will end there. Vul for EW|pg||
nt|wiki: unfortunately  - but 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|wiki: but 3 NT has its chances as always|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems difficult to bid to best contract -2 hearts ,but now possible|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5 imps to Cassini in first played deal|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 lubs best but also spades makes |pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT by S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 easy tricks in 3 NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: lebensohl apply here?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Or was he too strong for it :)|pg||
nt|vbman: no doubletons for 3 sp|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: you mean the obvious 8@H finesse?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Could be. They haven't played together very regularly but usually play strong club in most of their partnerships|pg||
nt|peachy: kib confirmed Einari-risti|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding again|pg||
nt|hedyg: no need to stayman with 4 3 3 3|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D for @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Sry 4 @C...|pg||
nt|doctorone: but wait.... Dont you loose 1@d and 2@hs ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the conceratisme pays?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 H huge underbid imo|pg||
nt|runnerup: wd and nothing to play ==|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Played by South, West might give away 3 NT with a @H--lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: going off in 3NT is no big deal as that should be a push|pg||
nt|hawe45:  630/630 - no big choice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzcz: @d ruff beats 6|pg||
nt|runnerup: n thinging to 1nt or 2 d|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: blocked the 2@c bid from E|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: steven has a definite advantage since he played tom's system for years|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes - T removed to 4 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Both pairs here use strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS play Einari club, a common system in Finland, especially in the Turku area. It has 4-card majors and control-showing responses to strong club|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Einari club, close relative of Blue Club|pg||
nt|muppe: Slam makes only IF declarer drops @dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: why do you ask?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  EW use Blue Club, an old Italian system with canape style and also control responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: does a safe line of play exist here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think W would lead J@d and not from an ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Has North not paid his entry fee - PASS...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough to beat 2@d though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Joe :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps east was worried cause he only had 2 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 1 @D is transfert, 2 @D is a reversal without heart support|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzcz: but can't be bid missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  No Rabbis around, so slam is destined to go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this is 1 down so 2 ims or so possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: coenraets in the "tank"|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Conservatisme|pg||
nt|k ylinen: according to their system Eeva should have opened 4 and a half D*s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: kinda difficult to do that|pg||
nt|runnerup: control problems how to make this so that you dont loose clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no safe line|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kaapo2:  So the 1@S opening is often just 4 cards|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I thinks Timo is quite aggressive in bidding to the 3-level. Of course 2@S looks just fine for me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: winning 1/2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Dan Bylund|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Wow|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|muppe: 6@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: Timo is again hoping for @cQ/@hQ or @sK onside|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kaapo2:  Timo thinks he's good at guessing trump kings I suppose|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  SaTu stands for Salo-Turku, two cities in South-West Finland. "Satu" is also a Finnish word, meaning a fairy tale|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: not the best option he could hv choosen it seems|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if the @H are divided 3/2 the declarer has 6@C tricks:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kaapo2:  And to Kalle Ylinen, who will give some comments on the system played by EW|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes u r right|pg||
nt|k ylinen: really?|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps 2nt --4h|pg||

pc|dA|pg||

pc|h7|nt|runnerup: perhaps was not a god idea to play small to first heart round|pg||

pc|h4|nt|diaoff: Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kalle|pg||
nt|rodal f: A friendly but understandable lead from N|pg||

nt|hawe45:  E/W can make 4 @S - N/S nothing at that level|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looked at the @S sac EW but level 5 can become a bit hard if NS find there @C ruff|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what East would bid--too  good for a 14-16 1NT |pg||
nt|garnetts: I don't like because of both the shape and hard values |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she could have opened 1@c (16+) but chose against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Showing the majors vulnerable with 4-4 is not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|mmmakela: facing passed partner 2 NT seems best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me an action hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But in 5 @D there is a point, if South takes only one round of trumps and plays on @H, thatÂ´s winning play|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Oh my !|pg||
nt|doctorone: How easy for W is it to bid?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a joke - show us, what West really vbid...|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  The other team is named after the space craft Cassini. That's because one of their players, VÃ¤inÃ¶ KelhÃ¤ playing in the open room, had a part in designing some scientific equimpent for Cassini|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 4@h is makeable here|pg||

pc|sK|nt|doctorone: no, no... Hans. This is true|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes we have exceptionally lots of snow even in Helsinki|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And close to -20 and lots of snow even in the South|pg||
nt|peachy: optimum reached at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for the longer majors. Ha!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Should Kanerva bid 4? Seems a bit hard with the wasted @DQ but he does have a singleton and a good side suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry easnt prepared to that diclare play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|muppe: 5 imps to SaTu in first brd, other room played 1NT+1|pg||

nt|wiki: funny that you over ruff when you have 5 @C in hand - but those things happen:)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|k ylinen: tough competition|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, good pressure by NS|pg||

nt|wiki: @C lead helps  but is normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: a super max 1nt opening by north|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 5@S max 2 down by the ruff in @C but .....|pg||
pc|s9|nt|muppe: And in the 2nd board Cassine takes 3 imps back. Other room found 5@cx -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: always play the @h6 at first opportunity|pg||
nt|oliverc: That's no doubt one of the reasons East chose the opening|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well, I need to be going soon. Have fun here!|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd be happy enough to open 1@D and reverse into the Hearts given the chance|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not only do we not like the 2@C bid but I suspect we hate the 3@H bid too|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And partner often cannot raise when 4 is on|pg||

mb|3C|nt|lestergold: thx Roland please do not overestimate me|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|faramarz: a slam on a @h finess & @c & @h squeese |pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@S???|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cue bids have not reached Belgium?|pg||
nt|faramarz: 4@s  shows  all controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a few residual chances in the minors in case spades dont break|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lestergold: no cue on the way he hasnt got much to cue only a choice of three|pg||
nt|lestergold: why bother with checking on aces when you can guess for them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it shows all aces, how can West rule out a grand slam?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt it does|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why W would check for aces holding a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could East not have @HQ instead of @DJ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: it just shows no ability to evaluate a hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|faramarz: in in this sequense  Steven showed a slam interested 5+ cds @s & 4 cds @h  &  Philippe show all controls|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: in thatcase why no grand exploration?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 6S is quite reasonable if all E can do is bid 4S. W can hope that the lead will matter for a swing, more likely than that they have a grand when E cant cuebiud. and a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: direct 6S makes them guess the lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzcz: i'm interested in seeing whether N opens 1@d, 1@h or 3@d|pg||
nt|wiki: did not follow the play -something went wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: one doesn't always pick up 6-6 shape|pg||
nt|wiki: at least my thinking of 1-2 down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's why S can only pass in pairs|pg||
nt|runnerup: I think it is very difficult to pass -but now if ever-if partner has good card and thinks this allways forcing so --dont |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not, bid 3@c, just show an invite (whatever your method is to do that)|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes like 1 kib saed even 4 diamonds is better that 3 h|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: next|pg||
nt|rodal f: I must say that I totaly lost myself. Didn't look at the @H by SW at last.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcg: what about this for an action hand in south:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes the play is too fast for the operator|pg||
mb|2N|nt|k ylinen: normally EW are conservative bidders|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: would everyone else pass E hand too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: they play modified blue club with canape|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 in diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Knowing J Laakso he must really be steaming(sry poker phrase) now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H looks a good spot for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 5@s still safe|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 3 result corrected, ty Jean-Marc :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Ah - here 3 x @C beats 4 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: N wishing he hadn't opened now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hopefully some nice bidding to come|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 7 @S, declarer could make the show-up squeeze against South for 1510|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S friendly and @HQ same so only a hook in @H needed for the grand I belive|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|kaapo2:  Against Blue Clubbers, anything is possible ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: and against seniors even more is?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I believe they still resond with controls|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Even after the 3@C call|pg||
nt|muppe: really?|pg||
nt|vbman: weak 2 dia avail?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: no|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not me --as I play a weak 2@D but if I didn't I have no objection to 3@D |pg||
nt|vbman: then no|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be hard for EW to stop under slam now|pg||
nt|k ylinen: Mäkelä really isn't a chicken!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: phone brb|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: W alerted both 1@h and 1@s (1@h being @c+@d or @s i assume, but E didn't alert them|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 h with good guessing in h|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  No alert, so perhaps I was wrong|pg||
nt|reisig: Not the most descriptive bidding I've seen|pg||
nt|runnerup: now we see strong club action but south can pass up to 7 -which is not very common|pg||
nt|runnerup: can they find clubfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: finally got a verbal explanation|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now they will reach it|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 500 if passed and defended well|pg||
nt|hedyg: S not strong enough to bid @cs now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Transfers still aren't standard in Finland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the end Parviainen is happy to defend I suppose, but I would have bid with his cards over 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 3@h promising 5+@h|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|diaoff: Guess that E is happy not to have entered this bidding, yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: and I admit I would aslo have bid 3@D over 2@S |pg||
nt|sybarra: I have difficulty with canape (except those served with cocktails) any way |pg||
nt|rodal f: And only 10 tricks by normal play|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: but passing is  a hard way to earn a living in bride|pg||
nt|rodal f: UNDO that 3@H???? OR|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|kaapo2:  I suppose NS play 2-way Stayman, and 2@H and 2@S are weak, natural|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes I hate to say that lots of pairs are still using two-way Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 4@c alerted by south, not by north|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: I think south is taking 4@c as a @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: will he blast the slam or investigate further?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad luck - 3 @H from South is 2.300|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d by S would be forcing i think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Might take 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And in fact the bidding looks very sensible to me|pg||
nt|wiki: rest of the day W is ashamed with his @D - maybe could not bid 2 @C - do not know their system |pg||
nt|wiki: ok - he made it quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i think he tried to mislead opponents|pg||

nt|rodal f: LOL:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Though it may, Hedy, I see no reason to bid anything other than 3N again :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 5NT GS invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: There is a squize endplay at S in @C for 11|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I am NOT impressed by this bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: E is laughing, He has said he has no major, so he does not understand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The space between 3 NT and 6 @S was not used|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And wrong hand playing - doesÂ´nt matter this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 3 @C was asking for hearts, 3 @H was transfert|pg||

nt|runnerup: ok this even makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt seems 97% but 4 spades needs something -about 85%|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= weak and long|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: ok - now RD|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kaapo2:  Other table already reached 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the context of 12-16 2+ diamonds I don't think 2@D is enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: take in hand, K@c, @H to dummy and disc a @d on A@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: this hand has Kx Kx and wants to rightside NT, i agree|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now the test for East - not @D Queen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: because strong club W will settle in 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Agree|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's worth 3@D imo|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looks like just making|pg||
nt|vbman: more to cassini|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they landed |pg||
nt|wiki: @D lead makes it almost fool proof|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes but hard to reach 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: My bid would have been 2@H force for one round|pg||
nt|rodal f: RD are OK to. |pg||
nt|wiki: without D I thin 2 @S is almost enough in white but 2 @H is best for me(without D)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But RD can be taken for SOS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 5 from top for defence.......|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  But the suit (@D)= is frozen anywhere|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And since they started with boards 7-8, they've played 2 boards faster|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: yes but north has double stopper in hearts in this secuence|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Canape style 1@S. She could have any longer suit and just 4@S, or some balanced hands|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oliverc: no, to SaTu|pg||
nt|garnetts: This was meant to be 5@H and a minor --and look at how defensive the hand is |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here we go|pg||
nt|runnerup: not so easy to take them anyhow|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - trump lead is always the best, this time very good|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: very hard to beat this|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I think 3@S here only guarantees 5 cards, but Erkki doesn't really have other choice than to raise|pg||
nt|mmmakela:   25 a push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Got a phone I had to answer. Back|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: 6@D is a good choice in case partner has xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Qxx   xxx    in the majors and 6@H would fail whereas 6@D makes|pg||
nt|peachy: nice bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly, but for me 6@D would have been a grand slam invitation in this auction|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, good to be able to bid 6@D as a suggestion to play. I might have a fear that it's interpreted as a try for grand|pg||
nt|k ylinen: Väiski teki hyvän tarjouksen 4S, muttei se riittänyt Eevan slammihalujen torjumiseen|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this goes down i am very angry |pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|wiki: KQx in W:s second suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't get ure lead Wiki. So -1. Next|pg||
nt|wiki: Hardly as D always promises at least 3 @S or then stron minorhand|pg||
nt|rodal f: And after the pressed 2@S from S it's easyer for N to pass at level2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best now is to duscard a @D on the next @C|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|runnerup: so made|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: E promising 5 spades |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: lets see the play for 5 or 6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wiki: But with that balanced hand I think that also after D by W  2 @H is best bid|pg||
nt|wiki: so we can rest in 2 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i would rather use the 2@h for some strong hands then for those with fit, 2/3/4@s would seem enough bids when u have @s:s|pg||
nt|runnerup: in hand with opening agains 12 points and single spade thy managed to stop in 2 spades to get + score|pg||

mc|11|nt|rnmalik: S|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|2H!|nt|lestergold: Roland you must have dealt this hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: 4H enormous contract but will they bid it?|pg||
nt|faramarz: The 2@h  transfer   bid  helps more NS   on their way to @h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure how great a contract it is single dummy after W opens 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was easier in closed as north was able to overcall the dim with a simple heart which was raised etc|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What was 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: W i known to have at least 2 hearts, and N has losers to get rid of, which means ruffing them. even K9x of hearts in W hand will beat the game|pg||
nt|faramarz: here after such long hesitation i dont think that S can raise to 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: I mant its enormous as cards lie and not really awful in general on many days tyou will be able to ruff both dims losing a club  a spade a and  trump trick only|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcwla: So like Archie Bell and the Drells, this match will do the Tighten Up here.|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously one opp holding KJx especially offside would not be grat!|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 2 IMPs you are happy to concede in a long match. 6@D was clearly superior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and next time it may earn you a huge swing|pg||
nt|vbman: 4h|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S a good save here, though|pg||
nt|garnetts: They made 3@S next door |pg||
nt|wiki: NS might get 9 in 3 NT|pg||
nt|wiki: took few seconds to think it through|pg||
nt|k ylinen: pd could be weak w 0 points|pg||
nt|wiki: my partners alway are and have only 3 @Ss|pg||
nt|rodal f: Correct Kalle|pg||
nt|runnerup: spades lies badly so normall loking result|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Now, how does Blue Club open this West hand? I suppose with 1@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W dbld 1 @D opening in OR which I just can't understand|pg||
nt|runnerup: partscore battle 9 in hearts to get|pg||
nt|runnerup: +1 seemed to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: declarer claimed 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i asked him how many|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: he said 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: Cassini had an accident at other table|pg||
nt|runnerup: little expensive in other room -4 spades can even go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: south getting "some" hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Same @H suit in North as previous board|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oliverc: East unlikely to look further than a p/s, though, and won't compete to the 4-lvel|pg||
nt|garnetts: Will east bid if North tries 2@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: Might if he plays a gadget |pg||
nt|oliverc: East knows they're out-gunned|pg||
nt|vbman: tx and a bypass|pg||
nt|wiki: good cards but funny that you cannot make even 3 @S|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I would listen more|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will EW gain some IMPs here? Belive now if E don't go bananas|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes ew bidding can make difference to open room |pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Other table also played 3@S on  4 so one missed chance for Cassini (they still one an overtrick IMP though)|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -he dint count because he was happy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 @C on supermisfit was a triumph as expected|pg||
mb|1H|nt|doctorone: I dont understand opening 1@c here as Fernando does... Sorry :)|pg||

nt|garnetts: Like here |pg||
nt|kaapo2:  *won|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no 1 NT?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, if SaTu avoid the same accident, they are verrry close to winning this|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  1 @C...HELP|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: he is trying to create swings|pg||
nt|doctorone: That, I understand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well Leb would apply over 2@S by South|pg||
nt|rodal f: Neigher can NS make 3@D so the border passed for bought|pg||
nt|wiki: actually I think that S has more 1 @S opening that multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: did he miscount or downgrade|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Pirjo alerts a natural call?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Perhaps it's so standar to use this as a pre-emtpive raise that she thinks it better to alert :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: maybe i saw wrong, they do not use the alert card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @H I meant|pg||
nt|hawe45:  800 on the desk|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice @H quality by N. If opps get the contract and S are to lead u often loose a trick. But 4@H on now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: bid of 5@D gives a choice of contract or DBL, thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: a pass is not an option...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But OR must have played 1, 2, 3 etc|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: with only 11 hcp and alanced hand W would have to pas, so now 12...13 p|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  600 is a strange result in this board but that was recorded in the open room|pg||
nt|vbman: 3sp better|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@S by South now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Asking for the teach them a sharp lesson with 4@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: That will terrify East |pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: until it drifts off|pg||
nt|vbman: will loose the 1st 4 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: there is a chance of accident, since if E was strong she would have acted over 2@h, so why play 2N as Leb and not 2-suiter|pg||
nt|wiki: S playing - @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I am up for the adventure in 3 nt |pg||
nt|reisig: opening 1@h w 9xxx ..just goes against my grain|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's against my religion|pg||
nt|wiki: that must ne 1 @S even in USA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When I was young, one doubled with the North hand - 800 or 1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now on bd 1|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a real hand for Roland 20-20HP and .....|pg||

nt|rodal f: And a @H lead for IMPs to NS who need some|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i put the explanation to 2N o what 2N is|pg||
nt|runnerup: can east pass?-no she did not|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems to make = here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: though he should open 1@h if he downgraded, hmmm...|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many months over 17 year for u Hans?:)))) |pg||
pc|d5|nt|diaoff: On a @H lead, declarer must be a bit careful on this one|pg||
nt|peachy: Wouldthat be true if he held xx diamonds?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 2NT promised stoppers in both Majors|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she had only 2 tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: Eki has to guess well or play well to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: though if defence starts with 4 rounds of @d, E pitching 2@h:s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oliverc: so a push after all that|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd game isn't it--4@H laydown and the opps play a partscore  |pg||

nt|vugraphzcz: i have no idea|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: at least the 1@d opening had a different meaning there|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Play since 1965 - no age..|pg||

nt|rodal f: I belive I had my first time at the club in 1970 as 11y old|pg||

pc|h4|nt|kaapo2:  Next set is scheduled to start in ten minutes, so we're just about on time|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Ah right, 400|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: slam is makeable|pg||
nt|reisig: That suit ...looks like 3 cards|pg||

nt|oliverc: vulnerability|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S NS here|pg||
nt|wiki: we are in Finland now, so it is nothing :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but fair for public view @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@d didn't say anything about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: opener could have full 16 count|pg||
nt|rodal f: Could be Markku. Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 40 imps differense now|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: since 2N was interested in only partscore or about slam|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe opener bid 3 NT with max ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but our E forgot system|pg||
nt|wiki: ok|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This match consists of 80 boards divided into 10 segments of 8 boards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think Kanerva loses nothing returning a dia against any distribution|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes was endplayed but played it down |pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was NOT shouting!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But right you are|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: What's that I hear from the green room?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They'll compare scores, have a cig break, and then get back to action|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: l think its better 3sp 1st round|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: 5 bds left|pg||
nt|wiki: the most natural reason|pg||
nt|wiki: to go wrong|pg||
nt|runnerup: here 2 spades makes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes even Timo had a change to switch to his sing d -and then it is down allways|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good pass by Kelhä in OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: erkki played for a practically no-chance when ruffed the club rerurn|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is our last board. Great thanks to our marvellous operators Juho GranstrÃ¶m here and Pauli Nieminen in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we have had some fantastic boards:)|pg||
nt|varange: sorry I missed them|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: but still no swings :(|pg||
nt|varange: looks like a close score|pg||
nt|varange: systems, Rashed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: The last board for this segment. When will the next start?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  By good guessing, here E/W can pick up 420|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|hedyg: any rabbi could make a slam here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H or 4@H is a good shot to keep the spades out of it --since partner has passed |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@H?|pg||
nt|oliverc: (by North)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Segment 8 is scheduled to start 11:10 local time (10:10 CET)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better to PASS the West hand, than being obliged to open a suit so weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard for S trying to help pard|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: sorry about the mistake in the title folks, this is the last segment|pg||
nt|santyclz: Do you have to be a rabbi to play @ds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no but to catch the K@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean as an overcall of 1@D |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: after cig break, i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks 3nt ofcause can overbid 15+15 so|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes no chance better that some lucky change -hmm..strange|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And thanks to two Markkus, Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤ and Markku Pekkinen, for comments|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Common sense:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: N-S play classic belgian system (similar to SEF= France)|pg||
nt|varange: that helps.|pg||
nt|varange: ah thanks|pg||
nt|varange: Common sense is so uncommon|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hahahahahah|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: E-W plays a strong @c system with many variations|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: why not bid 4@d here?|pg||
nt|doctorone: I would elect 4N !|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd is strong and short in @c, surely he is interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: 11 tricks in H here|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe board wich NS don't need|pg||
nt|wiki: 3 NT by S best|pg||
nt|mmmakela: here easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but N can thank E for that|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Thanks also to the Bridge League of Finland for organising, and to Bridge Base Online for letting us show this exciting match|pg||
nt|runnerup: here is a slam but not good contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will just mess it up|pg||
nt|hedyg: if N had doubled instead of 2@c S could play 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3-3 Ms double is an option over 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: what was dbl?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is bad - but best for defence|pg||
nt|rodal f: Only the @C guess I belive. The rest are to come auto. Or? Hans.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wiki: not sure what 3 NT is, but looks like East should look for the minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause they can overbid-18+13 |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: S doesn't believe in slam w his 4333|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes seems that Eeva also-2 diamonds is onesuiter in heartrs or spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in OR seems they didn't|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 clubs best |pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And of course thanks to all our kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: @c and @d 33 or oen of them with the other 24 and @h finesse?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: 4333 and 15 would make me choose 3NT over Stayman|pg||
nt|mmmakela: absolutely|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: No xx to show a void?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d for me shows @d stopper and 2nd rd @c control|pg||
nt|doctorone: Surely the right thing to do, Joe|pg||
nt|garnetts: K@C looks like a switch too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are we over for match point?:)))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: K and dias|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 spades can be only 1 down -best defence sets it -2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely accepts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Friendly lead|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hedyg: who should XX? where? what?|pg||
nt|garnetts: likley to get the spades right too I think |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult for South - has NO good lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|doctorone: N|pg||
nt|hedyg: true, yes|pg||
nt|doctorone: over 4@c X P P|pg||
nt|reisig: dbl = I want to lose 800+|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: reisig is right|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yess|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but the explanation at table was either @c:s or take-out of @c:s|pg||
nt|wiki: against me they always bid 6 NT and both finesses work|pg||
nt|wiki: just change the hands EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thats standard bridge Wiki:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: wiki u r the lucky one|pg||
nt|varange: good to have someone at the venue who is knowledgeable, thanks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|hedyg: sry getting tired here too|pg||
nt|hedyg: good defense|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Often used for the 2 lowest colors, but most use it for majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @HJ would be a good lead but no|pg||
nt|varange: risky low level dbl|pg||
nt|rodal f: I attac anyway (nearly) so @D from a 9er was my last @H the first and @S 2nd one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If Souths lead could not be a doubleton, East might have continued with @D 10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Wake-up call pls|pg||
nt|rodal f: By reading from the lead. Who had @DJ? N. Who have @DA? S will never lead from a A9X(X). Where are the @CK to be found by the odds? S!!!!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not that easy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But why do they stop playing|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit tired Janssens there I belive.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: All 4 players seem tired|pg||
nt|rodal f: So no EPO to give them?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: Only red bull|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hehehe|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wiki: RKCB obviously is 2 from 5 without @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 30-32 between you, never mind Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Agree Roland. 1NT-3NT would look just about right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|reisig: 3N was a minor preempt ...I thk|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: An obvious X, might better to say|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some told me that S left the room.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|runnerup: heart finess always and 4-2 can be handled in some cases makes it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: would not make|pg||
nt|varange: heart and another?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one @H with the Q@D EW would have an edge|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: seems obvious from here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is the advantage of seeing all cards:)|pg||
nt|varange: not easy from east's POV|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D switch|pg||
mc|9|nt|wiki: red  makes it difficult of course|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 still makes from south -but they bid 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: ok, this is doomed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forget my coffe boards|pg||
nt|wiki: so 11 more to SaTu|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS use canape even in responses|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  So I suppose South has now shown better clubs than diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: here south could have 2-6 minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: not obvious for everybody i guess, certainly not for Somers|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - but what is going on? I have an appointment on tuesday - will we finish in time?|pg||

nt|hedyg: Faramarz can you explain the bids?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d looked like relay, but what is 4@c?|pg||
nt|faramarz: 3@c  shows a single & 3@d askd which one, 4@c shows @c single in a 18-19 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah ok ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Tom Fenwick, 1 of my teammates is watching here and i want to take this opportunity to wish him a very happy birthday (tomorrow)|pg||

mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|doctorone: someone doubled here? ah no... :)|pg||
nt|faramarz: if he had a single in a 12-14  he wld bid 3@h showing @c single|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 2NT is 3+ @ss?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4th @s is very valuable here|pg||
nt|faramarz: 2NT is 4+ fit GF|pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugraphzcg: declarer has chosen for the @d 4-4 A@s on - line|pg||
nt|faramarz: 6@s showed probably a @h void but this is strange|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed it was strange|pg||
nt|hedyg: what would 6@h have shown then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: Hubert is happy because he found the spade queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|faramarz: i dont know these details of their system.  normally 6@h shows the @h void|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is what i thought|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||

nt|lestergold: well on a misfitting combined 22, a normal bidding system would allow you to subaside quietly in 2S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it is not that easy to get to 2S|pg||
nt|faramarz: he is a passed hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right what is the auction to 2@S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to rebid 2H or he could miss a game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and W is now stuck|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|faramarz: there is no way that they cld stop at 2@s   but  3@d cld have been bid|pg||

nt|lestergold: would expect to play in 3D 2N is horrible |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: once you decide your hand is worth 2D (which is arguable, certainly--it would seem perverse not to show your 3 stoppers in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: it also encouraged east to rebid his psades whereas 3C would have much more likely have yielded a quiet 3D|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: that last point is certainly right|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: or 4 good cards in the unbid suit in a weak hand not well suited to a no trump contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: after all in a no trump contract your diamonds are not likely to come in unless pard has a dim fit which in that case means that you are probably likely to have 5D on more safely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the best solution is to play some sort of Gazilli-like 2C rebid by opener after a 1N response. then W would happily bid 1N instead of 2D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcwla: needed low @H|pg||

nt|rodal f: 4@D a bit hard? By his 15HP|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: west is wandering|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East should obviously pass 3 D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Do they play a system?|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 2@S force by semi (@D) was enough after 3@D from W|pg||

mb|p|nt|doctorone: really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Noit classic - classic is WITHOUT any other suit - and especially the other major can be dangerous|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I repeat: East has NO @S-suit for a multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Must have some intermediates|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H was p/c|pg||
nt|varange: 2@d = solid raise of the overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 opposite 14, hardly|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 5@d...|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  Any blue ones (RD)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I gave a "but" Hedy:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s looks coldish|pg||
nt|hawe45:  11 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: very solid :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so did i|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|faramarz: 5@d is the safe contract   &  3@d   is a clear underbid from valerie.   she usually never underbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: Dummy says I might have been a coward...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: i would have bid 2NT as W not 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: he made no effort towards game at all|pg||
nt|varange: yes, he has another bite of the cherry|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: north cannot do smthg else than bid 4@s|pg||
nt|tez: j of @s pls|pg||
nt|tez: ty:)|pg||
nt|tez: dbl wants @s lead..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  550 anyway|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|doctorone: agreed|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|varange: so can south|pg||
nt|varange: trial bid maybe|pg||
nt|rodal f: And N asked for the troubble. Why not ask by 2NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Unblock your @D, North - the 10 and 9|pg||
nt|tez: do you dbl with W hand?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|varange: I don't see why south would bid the same cards twice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: over valued his hand|pg||
nt|varange: yes. A flat ten-pointer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D-2@S=ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: East will find the @h switch when in with @dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ok that 3NT will run home. Still....|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a reasonable mulit in @S, West must bid game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And if East starts with PASS, game is easy to be reached|pg||
nt|hedyg: if E starts with pass S openes 1@d and W passes!|pg||
nt|tez: i agree with dbl..|pg||
pc|sT|nt|varange: anyhow, the 2@d adequately describes it, and he should abide by p's decision|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: so how do you reach game then?|pg||
nt|doctorone: How is that hans???? after S opens 1@d and N responds 1@h how can game be raeched?|pg||
nt|varange: yes, agreed, Rashed|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  West could just bid 4 @D over 3 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody likes to bid higher than 3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - but with such a @D-fit|pg||
nt|faramarz: 4@d is a slam bid,  3@h followed by 4id   shows the hand  in their system|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like 3@H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A slkam bid should go via 3 @H/overbid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  slam|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some robberplayers even like to build:-)|pg||
nt|hedyg: depends on your agreements|pg||
nt|faramarz: yes 3@h  followed by 4@d |pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: E says W should have bid 3 D|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@H? and deny the @ss?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt seem right|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: sorry, 4D of course,. But W says 4D is a slam try.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhh there we have it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Liked ure sequence for the 6@D Tez.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: hi Frederic|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: i see that the first two bids systematic obviously 2d transfer|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: yes west has taken pard's double of 2d seriously|pg||
nt|lestergold: west not vul so not much risk|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: seemed to cause north to go mad|pg||
nt|faramarz: on the @d  A lead the contract is made|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|faramarz: it needs immediate switch to @s  to break this|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: West had a difficult lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Faramarz|pg||
nt|faramarz: now only a @h loser remains|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/s have got away with blue murder all caused by east getting busy with a K and two jacks|pg||
nt|lestergold: a case of carless talk costs lives|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos north thought the opposition's announced diamond fit improved his hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|faramarz: that is how a poor game makes,   it needs a lead directing double|pg||

mb|1N|nt|doctorone: Sure... I know him :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But to repeat / slam try can pass via 3 @H...!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|doctorone: was answering a Question about S opening or not :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This Soputh hand is also very poor!|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course he opens!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South|pg||
nt|hedyg: double=?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh sry thought N had opened 1NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That explains|pg||
nt|hawe45:  S-lead seems to defeat 4 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you would pass Hans?|pg||
nt|faramarz: 3@h  is mainly a stopper asking  bid  proposing 3NT |pg||
nt|hedyg: do they play weak NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: 2@d anyone?|pg||
nt|varange: xfer to spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 2 @H will not be defeat...|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: Squeeze will be champion...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  Am I the only one, who would bid 2 @S over 1 @D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: too good for 2@s|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzcg: majors I think|pg||
nt|faramarz: 3NT is a make  but they will not bid it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wandered abough the same Hedy. Must be a 12-14 variant or some simulare|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|doctorone: Passs???? is this true???|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing that they managed to stop|pg||
nt|tez: jack?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|faramarz: N/S have gained the deal at the other table. this is a 12 imp swing to BCOB|pg||
nt|hawe45:  WasÂ´nt the @C 8 big enough???|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They bid a part score - and that is the maximum|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|varange: 2@c is normally majors, and 2D shows equall length|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|doctorone: They are lucky not to find S's majors the other direction... I know, I know it is the winning bid HERE... But I still don;t think it is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What would West lead against 3 NT?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: why not 8?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  I am not so sure about 3 NT E&W / West has only ONE entry|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|nt|doctorone: small @s LOLLLL|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|varange: no idea what this is. one spec suggests that west may have forgotten they play multilandy and thought it was Capp or something :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: does it matter?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: they dont have 9 tricks anyhow|pg||

nt|lestergold: dont show a suit in abad hand unless you are sure that u want that suit led|pg||
nt|lestergold: i.e. a bad suit in a bad hand |pg||
nt|faramarz: i dont think that this game will be bid at the other table|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: I think you are safe from suffering commentator's curse on that one Fara|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lestergold: 3 guaranteed losers but what about ten inners!!??|pg||
nt|lestergold: winners|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|lestergold: two heart losers which need disposal of|pg||
nt|lestergold: over ruffs or promotion of J of trumps|pg||
nt|faramarz: this is a very poor game   even poorer than the other one|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: club finesse works and its theoretically a trick but u tell me how declarer is going to unravel the communications heere ruff a heart and swet one up for a discad with north ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: holding a doubleton club|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no helpful lead this time so it will be interesting to see which way west decides to go down here|pg||
nt|faramarz: @h duck,  @h to the A,  @s to dummy,  ic finess, @c K,   @s to dummy &  @c  A|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|faramarz: declarer  shall hope for some good breaks & @c finess|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: first hurdle|pg||
nt|lestergold: nine tricks where is tenth?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade shift is ill-conceived as you cannot stop one ruff, and a second ruff might not be necessary or alternatively rates to weaken declarer's trumps|pg||
nt|faramarz: no 10th trick here|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will have some discards to make|pg||
nt|faramarz: now, @s to A  &  @c  A   then @c ruff & all spades  he can make it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: it cannot be better to do that than to lead spade queen, spade to ace, etc|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|faramarz: with the 2@h  bid from N he will put the @d A with him |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: endplay does it|pg||
nt|faramarz: Steven is a very good card player   he managed to make this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leaving a trump out as he did could only lose and never gain|pg||
nt|lestergold: last spade will hurt and be easy to read position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you say so. he exposed himself to a trump promotion for no reason though|pg||
nt|jcwla: This could even up the match.|pg||
nt|faramarz: yes he shld play  @s Q & @s to the K|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Jordan|pg||
nt|faramarz: now it needs a fals card such as  @d Q by north   to mislead Steven |pg||
nt|marlowepi: here comes mr. jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: They should make a movie... :)|pg||
nt|faramarz: N shall hide the @d  10|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: he cant seriously go wrong her he made the decision to play north for diamond ace he knows will confirm count shortly |pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: now north is done for|pg||
nt|faramarz: 2@h  may have come from 6 crads|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: N -- It only hurts for a while...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: N should have discarded D queen instead of ten|pg||
