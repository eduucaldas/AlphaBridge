nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 15th NEC Cup. 12 rounds of qualifying (Swiss), 14 boards per match. This is a match from round 11 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 11 rounds. First 8 after round 12 advance for the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Standings after 10 rather|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1NT/W seems like a good possibility.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1N|nt|peachy: if they manage to stay that low|pg||
nt|peachy: well, they will now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|jcwla: Any votes for anything other than 1@C by S?|pg||
nt|peachy: third seat, normal agreements might be violated|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|peachy: I like that if third seat 1m opening is not a full opener, it is lead directing, so for me, no 1C|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Exactly.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room 1NT is doubled. South opened 1@D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: 1D much better|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: but who knows, maybe they play Precision?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|peachy: or they follow my principle:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: If I open light in third seat, I want my suit led.  Meanwhile the X seems aggressive.|pg||

nt|peachy: and off we go, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: great misfit to begin with |pg||
nt|peachy: the tournament website did not have them unless I completely missed it|pg||
nt|hlortz: what do ew play? ns polish club for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morning all:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and here we go |pg||
nt|marlowepi: play ball|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H|pg||
nt|othered1: Are convention cards available?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome to this 14-board Qualifying Match 10.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hey Jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Al.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: The Youth tem is well placed in the current running score|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure - but I will knos some of their gadgeds - and spects will help me - I hope :):)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, to watch the 6th qualifying Match from Yokohama|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to be England Ladies against a japanese team|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NEC Bridge Festifal|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone and welcome back |pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play 1N=15-17,  Klinger-Mullamphy transfer over their 3+ 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to get there if W bids|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - He will sure risk 2 @S|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: however n/s do not play at speed of light (until the end of hand) |pg||
nt|peachy: Qualification Match number 7 on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - letÂ´s start with 1 NT undoubled?|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: The tournament website for those interested, scores from Match 5 are not yet there but will sonn I'm sure http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: from NEC Bridge Festival in Yokohama, Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 15th NEC Cup. 12 rounds of qualifying (Swiss), 14 boards per match. This is a match from round 7 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello V|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker-Gower are the "South" part of Team South Sweden -- they're from South Africa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heavy promotion of the N hand will likely allow 3N to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have a CC that says NS play Precision with variable NT [sometimes 10-12, other 14-16]|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and now?|pg||
nt|peachy: esciting hand, afteralll|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the current leaders versus  2|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: they found the @S lead in the other room |pg||
nt|marlowepi: case for Slead but H normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's a WBF card from 2008 - so maybe they played for Bulgaria in Beijing|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: oh well, cant spell|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Raija Davis, Hans Werge and Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the ecats site has a CC for the Italians from the 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 3rd @D might bring some problemes|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings -- not updated for Round 7 yet |pg||
pc|dK|nt|hlortz: well called peter|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H should make because of the @c discard on the @S Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and with this lead...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|peachy: W got worried and pulled|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
pc|s5|nt|flash: a bit harsh to attribute a result to a normal lead?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S back is best|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat light and risky double by N on just 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - anf opener third in hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  @S 10 was an option|pg||
nt|flash: the trump split will slow declarer down a bit|pg||
nt|xenya: creates a small problem for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  udca|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no big risk to double 180 instead of 90|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: ruffing with the 9 seems to be correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s not the way everybody would play. Ruff with the Jack og King and play against the Queen. But no argument against success|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Polish Club, EW 5card major and 15-17NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|flash: declarer will probably start on one of the pointed suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His problem is, that @S King might be by the 1 @D-bidder |pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is weighing his options|pg||
nt|flash: mentally going through each possible line - trying to find the safest/ most reasonable|pg||
nt|flash: all not lost if the @SK off-side|pg||
nt|peachy: against this opposition, it pays to be careful|pg||
nt|flash: that looks like the most probable choice from here|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has a rather strong clue to the location of the @DA...|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Awful @H-shift, partner wanted @S|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some interesting decisions at several stages of the auction here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: udca=Upside Down  Count  Attitude|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Raija.|pg||
nt|peachy: Jordan:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello raija, jordan, rehi Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru 8 matches posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Marshall.|pg||
nt|peachy: Al:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think this is match  10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Either N or E might have made a double at their turn.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can see 3C with the N hand, but double looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C in context of Precision probably shows longer @C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: onthis defence, it's cold|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: and actually -- a number of big clubbers use  1@D-2@H as Reverse Flannery - to show the 5@S 4@H weak responding hand|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
nt|flash: declarer's problem, if the @SK is, indeed, offside is the lack of an entry to hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Both of these teams are prime candidates for winning the whole event|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may accept the invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should we say it this way - @S-shift was not killing|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Yokohama. hi to all|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had few options, but that certainly clarified/simplified things for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argument for @S is that partner has all the points -- even if @H strikes strength -- may not be entry to East's length|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: now should go down, he doesnt have the ricks any more|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: he lead 9, so....N had to count (3) |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh you mean N  sorry |pg||
nt|xenya: 1N went down next door, so it will be not 3 imps, but 6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: Netherlands, with a strong young team, is also among the favorites|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: can no lnger make|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In a while, dummy has two tricks but no entry|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|flash: declarer's home now - on virtually any line where he doesn't revoke|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|chick: this is not going well at all for the declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: was making when he was in dummy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: the idea of ruffing losers ought to have occurred to declarer sooner than it did|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|othered1: On the other hand, you may beat 3N off the top if partner has @HAKxxx, but not @SAKxxx|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  we are attending 2nd qualifying match of prestigeous NEC Cup|pg||
nt|po-s: hello all, particularly Mr W|pg||
nt|pelu: yes @c6|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello David|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Must be a flat board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- played the 2@H bidder to hold ZERO @H honors|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of Roland choices here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here 3 NT better be played by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. the case for a spade is that if you are beating this with hearts your heart ten is redundant, whereas if spades is the right suit the heart ten may be of some use on defense|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|peachy: Lavazza brought this time Duboin-Sementa, Bocchi, Madala, and Guido Ferraro|pg||
nt|flash: all right, folks - we've got a relatively small group in this room (to watch two of the best pairs in the world), so pls move down to the front of the auditorium and feel free to ...|pg||
nt|flash: ask questions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  |pg||
mb|2N|nt|hawe45:  Hello PEO|pg||
nt|po-s: is there a link to standings?|pg||
nt|xenya: hello PO|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems here, that 4 @H depends on the @C-suit|pg||
nt|flash: Polish Club - several possible hands|pg||
nt|flash: in this case, the strong(est) option|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: but this might not be flat -- particularly after the double by W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  EastÂ´s double is OK - for the minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ecats should still have convention cards for both pairs online from Beijing 2008 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly hand, endplayed into making 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3-loser hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct play makes it|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: overcals in minor vuln sh normal be on 6 card suits - so S passed where mane clubplayers would bid 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
nt|hlortz: for sure vul too dangerous to overcall at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N take any action now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e., is it worth is?|pg||
nt|peachy: strongest is 19+ any shape|pg||
nt|flash: our operator threw up a small false card|pg||
nt|flash: didn't slow us down, however   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
nt|xenya: Oz Players are currently 4th, 16 VPS ahead of Sara who are 6/7th |pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = ART Game Force [2-way Checkback]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know why Sementa didn't bid 2@H :(|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here a pass from West would be a big win!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
nt|pelu: and prob @Ss bad for declayer - act 2@H down 1 - EW tahe the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i freely open 1N with a 5-card major, but here i would open 1S. i doubt we have a game if pd responds 1N, and if pd is 35 in majors we will play wrong suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either 2C was Puyppet or E is already steaming trying to get the swing back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: current standings available at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1100 against 2 @H D - and against any other contract I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: the teams' primary target is to get to the quarter-finals|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
nt|hlortz: dubion must be worth another try here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Henry.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may not try. he may just bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe 2NT has dual meaning|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin ..my typing is lacking|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 IMPs to Bulgaria on 1 - Lavazza got to 5@D and that was doubled and set 3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1 = 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that much point in trying when YOU have eight controls. partner is likely to drop you even when you want to be there|pg||
nt|peachy: even a player with no pulse would get that dbld, I think,|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  And defense can have some fun against 4 @S, when they play the 13th @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not updated after round 3 yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow, what do they open?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NO 8+ fit|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: think e will make exactly 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 losers  and no problem with ruffing @Ss|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see where E found the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East trusted South - a mistake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why 5@c now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough decision atr trick one, probably wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: so ifyou changed @H and @D in west's hand, you would open 1N, Marshall?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa, this is hard to believe.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||
nt|hlortz: notice ns lead low from xx unlike most [non polish] pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was max of 14  presumably  2N or 3N said not great hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to David Greenwood|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|peachy: despite bad trump breakm, declarer still makes|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I'll always believe you should have made it, partner."|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: 1H was 4+ 7+HCP, a diamond canape possibility|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jbgood: an unlucky downer (2?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||
nt|hlortz: s taps the dummy to shut out the long spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Brock's point of view I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  for standings after session 1|pg||

nt|jtr: Did 2@s really make 9 on board 23?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East should continue trump!|pg||
nt|pelu: also almost standard in denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer another X|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: instead, Beauty picked up 5 IMPs for missing game when the Latin played in a weird 4-2 spade fit|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah i see not common in USA|pg||
nt|flash: headed for 11 tricks?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  You have almost an opening bid - and your partner doubles 1 @S - should they have 790, then OK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|po-s: South should have cashed the HA if he had had it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  AActually South should have played the @D King maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: but club is no good since declarer can ruff high and throw a dia|pg||
nt|hawe45:  10 I think|pg||
nt|peachy: let me ask our BFF (best friend forever) GIB...|pg||
nt|flash: @D honor now keeps 11 in play|pg||
nt|peachy: he says 11 or 12|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S needed to switch, but W needed to win first trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my fault - was chatting -- 2@C WAS 5-Card Stayman  and the pair defines using it with 53 majors -- transfer then 2/3 NT = 52|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even opposite this dog 6N has fair play: Qx   KTx   Kxx  QJTxx|pg||
nt|xenya: and 2 last qualifying rounds will be played today, including this one|pg||
nt|xenya: so this match is quite important for Sara|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  OK - I made a new count|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  But declarer should then guess, whether SouthÂ´s doubleton is Q or 10 |pg||
nt|peachy: Bulgaria has a rare chance to get considerable headstart|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: i would just pass as E and collect all the 100's i can|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: there ought to be a Law against doing that...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|jtr: How does 5@d do?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I just wee, that Englands opponents are the junior team, a pair from Czech Republic at the other table|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, W didn't double, so E was never tempted|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it doesn't seem like big result for EW - they could win 5@c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The unblock of @S 10 was no good idea|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: N may hop q here |pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said earlier,  we will not be playing at speed of light (like the brazilians) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: poor Giorgio -- @DQ onside AND  both pointed suits 33|pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 6NT/E in the OR.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: poor nothing. the result was earned|pg||
nt|hlortz: i dont know their sys maybe 3n/3d denied as much as qx of @S still ...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d3|nt|jtr: Looks like 11|pg||
nt|po-s: "cashing" the dia king would be disaster if you switch red aces in West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better an unblock of @H 10|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|xenya: @C continuation might have allowed declarer to get out for -1 -- a @H is asfe for 2 off|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|peachy: here David, here's the box, step on it and shout :)|pg||
nt|peachy: curiously enough, EW had 4H making, if I saw correctly in this hand|pg||
nt|dburn: well, repeated spade leads might do in 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer can't reach the dummy without losing a 4th trick, so a push|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2NT perhaps here.|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think some would overcall with the East cards|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about 1@C and 1@D. Hearts? Anyone in the audience know?|pg||

nt|jcwla: Several of these 1@C's have been 2+|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcwla: Ostensibly a push at 3NT making on 2.|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has to shift to @C when in on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C 2+, @D=4+H|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|peachy: pretty normal lead so same tricks likely in other room as well as same contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: N can hold off @C 3 times...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I hear that 1@D is always 5+, so they actually open 1@C on 4441|pg||

pc|c2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Same lead in the other room where East did overcall|pg||

mb|p|nt|hlortz: we see here the strong part of 1@C |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S after a (strong) 1C from S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  -200 -I doÂ´nt know why|pg||
nt|flash: i have a hard time with only 9, though...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: 5@c on EW. can they find it?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Good old Irving Gordon, originally from Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I bet David played against him a few times|pg||
nt|jtr: And in teams with him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awfully good hand for a weak 2, if that is what it is|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red suits lie well for NS - for 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway well done by both sides as 4@H was cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: usual 1@C is like a weakNT|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club, weak no trump in use for North-South|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18, 5c S|pg||
nt|flash: we had a famous baseball player in the old days "Shoeless" Joe Jackson...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their convention card from Sao Paolo just says "2-way checkback"|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  vul 2N seems a bit rich with W hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, Sveta:)|pg||
nt|flash: supposedly because, as a country boy, wearing shoes hurt his feet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then:  xx   KTx   KQx   QJTxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: in Hans' case, not removing his shoes might indicate fewer tricks than available...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4-9 HCP, 5+@H & 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|peachy: I still have suspicion 2NT was not denying hearts, perhaps to show the 12-14 instead of more wideranging options included in 1C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  hi Raija, welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not cold, I think. You have a losing option in @C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like X or 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2N vul against not has limited appeal|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure Scotland wasnt joined to europe when he was there:)|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to overcall, perhaps on the basis that his hand is too good - immediate overcalls destructive in nature|pg||
nt|peachy: nt apparent;ly 16-18 or something|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You have 10 slo tricks in 4 @H, but before that, defense will have 4 or 5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  slow|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S to the rescue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice 5 @D - if they bid the slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now - why is West passing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW off the hook |pg||
nt|pelu: NS could also go for penalty against EW - 2@CX = 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say that the W hand looks more like what I usually hold|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes e came in expecting the weak hand in south|pg||
nt|dburn: if classical strong club, yes - 17-19 or even 17-20 more common ranges nowadays|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I'm old school|pg||
nt|flash: this is the kind of deal which decides matches - much less short matches like this|pg||
nt|flash: to some extent, the @D call helps North - whatever values South has might well include some in @Cs|pg||
nt|peachy: good decision, 5D would only tumble one or so|pg||
nt|xenya: very unlikely at these colours and with W being silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction in OR '|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H denies a top honor  - but that doesn't surprise Klinger|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: dblfits all around, and now that was brought to daylight|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - the lead must be a @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Service-double - earns nothing, helps N/S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice contract - on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Do we all bid 1 @S - I do not|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: seems a small spade allows to make it -- a club lead would have been more challenging|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: strictly speaking, yes, but you can get a fairly good count on the E hand i think|pg||
nt|flash: East suggests defense vs 5@Ss and strongly suggests that West not bid more (especially vulnerable)|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree with Jim's explanation, for what its worth|pg||
nt|flash: Hans actually sneaked in a good point - suggesting/directing the @D lead was important here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   1N already said 12-14|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even w/o dbl - could be gain for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NorthÂ´s opening bid pushed E/W to game, equalling the match|pg||
nt|othered1: with no trump lead and very friendly breaks, this can play well on cross ruff.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you see they made 5 in the other room,   @h and ht continuation |pg||
nt|hlortz: oh im NOT defending their bidding LOL you have 19 pard opens and you dont move past 3n.|pg||
nt|peachy: X more flexible|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, can make 5 by going up ace, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 lead is ATTITUDE  [seems an exaggeration of the suit]|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Nice @D-suit - brings 4 tricks to East-West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - cancel|pg||
nt|po-s: Hans, asusual you are right - North will cover the Dten and yes, four tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D could lead to 3D cold for 3N or 4S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why South volunteered a bid in front of partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
nt|peachy: this has chances to chke, and I think it will|pg||
nt|peachy: S sensibly signs off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer D from W on the first round of bidding. 15HP behind opener|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s 9 - "partner, I have clubs" - seems so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here than in OR|pg||
nt|flash: XX shows 1st round control|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: K or Q from S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think best was to fly @CA, ruff @H  top @D pitching @C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|flash: notice that the @D lead would hold this to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I am surprise the diamond lead didnt come, after West's valiant effort|pg||
nt|flash: to quote David Berkowitz:  if  i'd bid @Cs, would you have led a @D????|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jtr: Yes true|pg||
nt|peachy: make*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- I'd try 2N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Nice for once to see instant scoring outside Scandinavia and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can we hope for America to follow suit?|pg||
nt|hlortz: in 10 or 20 years|pg||
nt|peachy: she could even play low and make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should have bid 5 @C - to get a @D-leas...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: X for me|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure... 40 or 50 years from now|pg||
nt|peachy: I was only defending E bidding which may have been systemic:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: this plays very well|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  ACBL just got around to approving negative dbls:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  wiil S be brave enough to return a trump?|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Hans, sorry I am late|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello kibitzers:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: I see we have a strong match going here|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: too well perhaps|pg||
nt|peachy: Hans, I didnt know you had good sense of humor :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have had|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Some play this DONT -. or others, where D = 1-suiter|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: it wasnt just 19, it was about the crispest 19 imagineable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 3N|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: top D before H ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- unblock Ace first|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  But now the @C-guess will decide - and East will fix it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: 3N is my second choice|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: not on a club opening lead she couldnt|pg||
nt|peachy: not opening lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|jtr: What do we think of West's 2NT though?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S should have played trumps from the very beginning|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1D response showed four+hearts, 2C was puppet to 2D and 2S inviting with four|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK - not much the defenders can do to hurt him since he has one spade trick and two of each|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 3@D is my LAST choice :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N could fail cold for 4S though, and on many hands where E would not trake you out|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|peachy: Might have been wise to cash HA, it could disappear on the club|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: hes got 7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|xenya: in the other room, E didn't overcall, but also naturally led a spade|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: at red facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too aggressive at these colours|pg||
pc|hT|nt|po-s: 1C was a weak NT or clubs - didn´t know "my" system had spread that far east|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jtr: Very polite Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much, at these colours, and pard a passed hand  |pg||
nt|hlortz: vul not to my taste to easy to go -200 - or more|pg||
nt|jbgood: served its purpose: getting a plus score|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jtr: Yes fair point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it did, but it possibly should not have done|pg||
nt|jtr: If you dont give decisions the opponents dont have the opportunity for mistakes|pg||
nt|jbgood: agree, S's 3 @s was uncalled for|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe West called for it?:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: ah, now can endplay|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  more imps for Kitty's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and the problem comes in this kind of bidding sequence. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heart overcall actually helps declarer considerably as he knows heart ruffs in hand safe for quite a while. even if no overcall, S is a favorite to make, but the overcall takes ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the strain out of it, so defenders get no edge in mental-energy depletion from this hand as they might w/o the 1H bid|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: if dares|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  South had 2 @D - North 5.... |pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto probably hard counting everything|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North made a smart discard with the @D Queen, looking like a man keeping to the other suits!|pg||
nt|peachy: however, teramoto knows north has the last diamond|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  All counts for the finesse -. and 620|pg||
nt|peachy: well done|pg||
nt|po-s: btw, when does it stop to be "east" and becomes west?|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: and the defence dropped a trick somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hard conditions - you land 3 NT losing 1 IMP|pg||

nt|dburn: he needed to, for some reason - not quite sure what that was all about|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - he went up with the jack on the first round of hearts|pg||
nt|flash: our skepticism of the board 2 result is the 1 IMP on the scoreboard so far|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem with 2N is that it is an underbid|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: likely 3S by S|pg||
nt|dburn: but I don't have much idea why he did that, with K9x in his hand|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was a case of "monkey fell from tree"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this alert?  is it "could be 2" |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe playing for West to have @h10x and no entry, but that seems a bit of a view|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree with W's pass -- the fact that you are behind the opener doesn't matter much with his holding -- no tenaces, just controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+@C, not 4@C & 4@D [1@D]|pg||

nt|marlowepi: sometimes you need to make that call with an undistinguished balanced 16. here you are close to 8 trix in yr own hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL expects to hear more @H from LHO|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this will be a very tight match, both teams have some of the world's best pairs playing,  and Fantunes, perhaps theeee best|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+,  1@D=4+@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: if S doesnt bid them now, the S willl be lost forever|pg||
nt|flash: X reasonable, but now without risk - my partners always bid 2@D...|pg||
nt|flash: note the 1NT call without a stopper|pg||
nt|flash: values first, shape 2nd??|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sounds right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and you will be outbidden in a lot of hands:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: pretty good 6@H here with west opening|pg||
nt|peachy: now this 1NT will drive bulgarians to six|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D=@Hs i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: anyone X 1@H with south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no thin double by South|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 cards suits?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh yes|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|andyv:  strange 1N... even if playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin has obviously heard "6-4, come alive"|pg||
nt|flash: and maybe even 6-5|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I erred, Fantoni-Nunes not playing now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can take the first 11 tricks against 1 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even Kokish might think North too good for 1@H overcall :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: JC doesn´t quite believe the explanation|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|peachy: prob same as open rm|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N takes the push to 3...faster than I could type|pg||
nt|peachy: not a bad choice, d finesse near 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi: its over|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  why not a simple raise?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow aggressive double|pg||
nt|jtr: Just right at MPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in their lucky day EW win @s game|pg||
nt|peachy: good start, W raised|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main problem - to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: lose 2h and 3s|pg||
nt|flash: the stopperless 1NT does have its potential drawbacks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and against 2 NT also|pg||
nt|peachy: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: how about 3NT Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm starting to think that the long run winner for South is to PASS the DBL|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|dburn: good decision by West here - that raise wasn't automatic|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm unfamiliar with ew system, for me raise would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|peachy: they did well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even if Gower doesn't lead a minor -- still only 9 tricks  [i think]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S bids 3S, as he should, they arein slam|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: sounds like penalties, with good hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: Aiming for the KOD Roland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S probably wanted to dbl the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going for the KOD is tempting at MP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KOD = Kiss of Death|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead - only a @S could give S some problems|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Let me count|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Edgar Kaplan is rolling over in his sepulchre Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here they only get 10, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments from now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Vlad -- i'm not really here, just adding some explanations of alerts if i can|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hlortz: aka 200|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -200 at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead was better, and logical on the auction and the W hand|pg||
nt|chick: kind of a waste of the 10|pg||
nt|peachy: its cold, dont think any lead woulda caused a prob|pg||
nt|flash: but an important lesson:  the defenders can't see your hand...|pg||
nt|peachy: silence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  20 tricks in difference or so|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks simple enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pause -- in case Klinger has ducked @DA??|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wrong J by pd - and he has 3 of them :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bulgaria matched the 4@S contract on 19 - and two overtricks for 2 IMPs to 23-zip.|pg||
nt|hlortz: bulgarians are going full speed ahead|pg||
nt|peachy: N gambled, W could have had Ax spades and KQxx xlubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N could easily turn out to be an underbid, e.g. if N held:   KJxx   Axx   AKQxx  x   they would play 3N with 6D near cold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction from Vladi Isporski|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and on board 18 West kept NS out of 4@s by opening 1@s on five low and a pile of dingo's kidneys|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  and should get it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not 500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 25 3@S-1 was above average for NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: total waste|pg||
nt|chick: although I guess a pitch on the J doesn't do much|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|po-s: trump I think,  knowing that South has a good number of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 11-13, 3/4@H   2@D=ART Game Force [effectively 4th suit]|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: not about pitch, about how many clubs nead to be ruffed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as it was proved next door |pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: penalties ranged from 1400 (4Nx-5 EW) to 800 (4Hx-3 NS)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now you can make an overtrickm playing on @C|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been weaker hand than 2N  --- not sure what 3@C asks :(|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|pelu: how do u play on a @s-lead?? - can u make 3NT? |pg||
nt|peachy: well, perhaps I am wrong, fforgot the 3S bid after hearts were set by 3H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Duboin to have opening bid, he MUST hold @DK|pg||
nt|peachy: wd|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: push on 3 -- same contract, same result in the OR|pg||
nt|jcwla: Highly impressive.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Oh - no entry any longer|pg||
nt|pelu: prob on an endplay of West?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: it could be beaten double dummy -- @H lead, A, @H ruff, underlead @Cs, another @H ruff -- and there is another trick for the defence -- but now it makes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: you could from the beginning but why bother too much, IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: so that was 11 IMPs to The Latin, who usually make a good showing in this tournament|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might pÃ¥ 1.200 - 2 x 600|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: pitch a loser now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  be 1200|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hlortz: i dont see how to make it offhand ...|pg||
nt|tez: hi all|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: lucky that E had the D 0 also|pg||
nt|hlortz: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Tezcan |pg||
nt|xenya: EW's sophisticated methods got them to 3N on a hand where most would be in 4@H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: 10|pg||
nt|peachy: I would think the LATIN team is a favorite here, they have some good players.  I don't know anything about he Japanese Beauty|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Automatic 500 it seems. Better to double on your first turn with the South cards. Then you won't get in trouble later|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hoping for a terrible @H-break with lenght by South|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|po-s: does he know the Dx was a winner?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tez: zmud now home|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: indeed, 3N looks a better contract on their combined hands|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: OK, so the defence missed a trick. Still 200 should be good|pg||

nt|poohbear: if you win in hand then they beat you by pitching a @c|pg||

nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in Central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far the standard fo card play has not matched the quaity of the bidding|pg||
nt|tez: nicely played|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S-guess is worth 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S made E-W on that one, so a potentially very big 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here N/S can take the first ?? tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they won't mind that 1 imp loss at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but somehow I doubt every pair will bid 7N|pg||
nt|po-s: the spot cards in D and H were crucial - should have made|pg||

nt|po-s: Carruthers never get to bid his hearts...unless 2D was multi|pg||

nt|peachy: 12-15 bal, 19+ any, and two more options|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looks like Bulgarian EW also playing big club   their auction begins  1@D-DBL-P-2@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N=(21)22-23|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how high does e/w bid?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 5@H now??|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c opening means..nat or 16+any hand..polish club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I agree with 5 @H |pg||
nt|dburn: I neither - they were 19th in the standings after four rounds, but not sure what they did in their last match|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts n/s in a spot quickly |pg||
nt|tez: bid or not to bid..pass is not forcing i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: for all N knows,  S may have no clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: 16+ nat or 12-18 4441|pg||
nt|xenya: weak 1N?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 5NT? = I can play slam in 2 suits?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if they are up against The Latin their results can't have been bad|pg||
nt|peachy: if the have puppet, easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some will not even be in a grand slam. Just wait and see|pg||
nt|po-s: which it probably ewas|pg||
nt|xenya: on 18, EW in the other room didn't find the 4@S save -- 8 imps to World Youth|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the X shows @S or just cards?|pg||
nt|tez: strong opening |pg||
nt|sybarra: will S bid 7?|pg||
nt|tez: i thk|pg||
nt|pelu: cards I exp - but spect can correct me :)|pg||
nt|tez: 6 enuf:)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly different auction in other room  since 1 @H=sp |pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least that's what the old convention card says :(|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh never mind 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easier without it|pg||
nt|peachy: but S decided not to even look, reasonable decision with 4333|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: he will bid pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree  but S has to like his hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@d by S seems to make things easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @d suit most likely the one in question |pg||
nt|flash: 2@D natural and VERY positive|pg||
nt|flash: grand slam easy from here - far more difficult to reach at the table?|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D 5+ C or D, usually gf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A 2 C-overcall by East, might have brought some trouble for N/S |pg||

nt|marlowepi: club ten would best serve the defense if the suit was not attacked from his side|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jtr: at least 3@c gets some strength across i imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: to Zmud|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be at sprint speed of play |pg||
nt|pelu: 6@Hs will only cost 800 - but rish that opp bid 7 - and then he also has to bid 7@H|pg||
nt|tez: and also 7@s..then:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (when he decides play) |pg||
nt|dburn: looks like strong club for both pairs, given that 1@d opening|pg||

nt|hawe45:  5 @C Voidwould - and South is taken by surprise|pg||

nt|flash: 5@C (obviously???) intended as exclusion - but....|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H showed H stopper!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|peachy: he surely has it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 NT is the spot - nu risc for @D-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  no|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there was a flat grand (13 tables) at the YC once - about 30 years ago |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is lesson for all......think at first trick |pg||
mb|2N|nt|jtr: Now 7NT is easy|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning, afternoon, evening, as you please|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Roland!|pg||
nt|po-s: it looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT is the limit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would have asked if opener held 3 or 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Blackwood is a fine convention|pg||
nt|flash: standings at   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very heavy 1 NT - or?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  so, first push?|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm sure that is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: KC is even better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one pair in 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: make, prob with overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: check the Daily Bulletins - they're among the best in the world...   a Rigal-Colker production paid advertisement...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H?! That will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: two in six|pg||
nt|peachy: nice switch|pg||
nt|xenya: trappy hand -- they are bound to end up in 3N -- and they did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=long suit game try -- not sure why that is an alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S brought his rabbi  (play ace with K is singleton off side) |pg||
nt|xenya: i womder what system NS are playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both players strong NT with their regular partners|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: he has a cost free chance to try find the Q|pg||
nt|dburn: and of course, whenever you open some minimum in 4th chair partner always punishes you by jumping to 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: 1 key card for @Hs, excluding @Cs...    but a big swing in a short match|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtr: Didnt bother about the @dQ expecting South to have 3 @ds|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding will take longer than the play|pg||
nt|jtr: There are a few less experienced pairs in the field remember|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 IMP - the first for NL|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  Maybe South didÂ´nt like his hand with 2 suits without stopper|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well played|pg||
nt|peachy: and he did do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Fu expected either weaker hand with @D & @S or  stronger would take another call|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: yes, 3 trumps, a spade and 4 tricks in the minors -- EW can't do anything about that|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- pure values in @S & @D = old fashioned 1@D instead of 1N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: note - would NOT do that if @D & @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think well judged actions from both players|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: now S must find the right lead to set, will she? small d but of course we see all cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No danger, @H Ace will not be missed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza got to 3NT so 12 more coming to Bulgaria.  Up 35-0 now.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Al|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: Patrick Huang tells me that Lin has played for Taiwan in the Venice Cup, and that Nie is from China where she is a celebrated Go player|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Kantar article in most recent ACBL Bulletin would have said 3N was the ONLY decision|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: thanks for the info|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contradiction in terms. if it is the only call, there is no decision|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hmm -- was declarer supposed to play @CQ before @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter on this hand, but if Klinger held 3@C instead of 4 -- he would be truly endplayed now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: a swing is possible here -- but more likely EW in the OR will also reach 3N declared by E |pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||

mb|4C!|an|P/C|mb|4H|nt|drorp:  but perhaps if p has clubs he doesn't want to play only 4@C, 4@D is also pass or correct?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4NT can't be misunderstood, 5@C was perhaps a little dangerous|pg||
nt|jcwla: The sort of hand that leads to some quick system discussion.|pg||
nt|peachy: i was thinking too that 5C is too ambiguous|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C must be conventional - what do you bid with @CQJxxxxxx|pg||
nt|sharkey: anyhow - shud be a push either sac off 1|pg||
nt|peachy: 4C is, 5C could have been misunderstood in partnerships that are not on firm ground|pg||

nt|flash: i think we'll see that hand in tomorrow's (today"s???) Daily Bulletin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ish & Bach both strong backgrounds in Acol -- would be surprised if they also play 3NN|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a hand, where you might bid 4 @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: nice coment shirley..i agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question will be if they "reconnect" the tables |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|marlowepi: I would open the E hand at any colors. many would disagree of course, but it is an opening bid by many well-respected yardsticks|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H was again a transfer to 4S :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  almost :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they lost connection again..... |pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that there are no connection to OR after 2 x crash|pg||
nt|sybarra: it can be done ...|pg||

nt|hawe45:  East has 3 stoppers in the @S-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Impossible to bid this slam even with other opening bid from S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: remember  NS playing Precision so 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C [16+ HCP]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H u mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i told the computer to display -- wonder where @S came from|pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|peachy: so much to find out, even after 1H opening|pg||
nt|hlortz: cosmic ray no doubt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: operator may have missed the subtle pointing to bidding card |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in mp, rather be in 3N or 5@d?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A lucky 3 NT here |pg||
nt|po-s: Did he really make nine tricks on the previous hand?|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is take/out to @s..strong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 ball, or 18-19 ball or natural @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: N to double? |pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
nt|peachy: W has max and six cards, well done to Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: how would you like to pass as E then put THIS dummy down in a mere 4 spades then watch pd go down?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Patrick Huang |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Agree - will West make his 620? Double-finesse in @C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- when W didn't play his last spade to tap S|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s or pass i thk|pg||
nt|tez: :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ashley Bach also led a small @C  [the 6]|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: and that is a slightly aggressive responsive double by South, but part score swings are generated by pushing your opponents around|pg||
nt|flash: note the 2@C call - the 6-card suit outweighs the 4-card length in @Hs, despite the fact that partner is far more likely to hold @Hs than @Cs|pg||
nt|flash: but, we seem to have run into the question of whether the 'free bid' shows values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 spec telling me that NS are NOT playing Precision at this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has good cards facing a splinter, but unable to cue 4D he must bid 4H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the spade finesse is on I make 630 vs 620|pg||
nt|peachy: but|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks, Shrley and Hi all.|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was always going to bid 3@s, but no harm in seeing whether his opponents accidentally pass him out in 2@s doubled first|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||
nt|peachy: i see no chance for OT|pg||
nt|tez: they are leading 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again we see the lead middle from 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: EW can defeat 4@S on a @S lead (DD decl can 2xfiness in @D and make)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: all leads 2/4......better way to describe it   (thx spec) |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with the @S-vois, South has a few values|pg||
nt|hawe45:  void|pg||
nt|peachy: if 3D was GF he cant pass now...or can he|pg||
nt|flash: SJ Simon counseled :  how much worse could your hand be...    not much!!!???|pg||
nt|peachy: Also "How to bid misfits?"  A: "Don't"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must take his chance - 4 @c was the first bid from North, which was - maybe - NOT forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: a spec says 3D asked for D stopper|pg||
nt|flash: most would play a cue bid forcing to game in major or NT, but only to 4-level in minor???|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that is a sensible way to play it|pg||
nt|flash: again, need to remove shoes to count losers in S hand???|pg||
nt|peachy: hearts behaving, Bulgaria can hardly lose on this deal, or Lavazza gain|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: I suppose on this lie of cards North-South actually had some play for 4@h|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tez: 3 down is bad news for ew|pg||
nt|pelu: so all leads = I have a higher card in this suit!!|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes horrible suit breaks for decalarer good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: if you have singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: lol:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: again OR just back,  I think the Italian waiters should be removed from that room!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt Mullamphy seems to be operating a bit here -- maybe HOPING to get to 8@S with his 2 sure trump tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|peachy: i would feel like the unluckiest person born|pg||
nt|peachy: I love all our Polish specs who help with NS system interpretation, for the benefit of all our gallery|pg||
nt|flash: 250 will be 6 IMPs back - tightening the match significantly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South find out, that this lead is a singleton?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: without def help, that is|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @S9 is discouraging|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: nice start for decl|pg||
nt|hlortz: still looks like -800 though|pg||
nt|tez: 1 way ticket for 800:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is smart enough to know that N would not X with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with the 2 @S bid, the long clubs should be with S |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|peachy: and they arent helping so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and so declarer. but what about defence?|pg||
nt|peachy: but not for 3C|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|xenya: EW seem to bid every game in sight -- and a little bit more|pg||
pc|d2|nt|flash: i've had a question about the 'free bid' issue|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Put @D 3-1 and this would cost|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: brb get coffee|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: why not q of @H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade lead from getgo needed to hold it to 4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: @h again pls|pg||
nt|flash: there was a marvelous historical (not hysterical) explanation of the roots of this concept in a recent Bridge World|pg||
nt|flash: my roth-stone training suggests that is you aren't forced to make a call, any call you choose to make is for a reason|pg||
nt|flash: usually values, although extra shape might compensate|pg||
nt|flash: the 'modern' game is, of course, on a totally different tack|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza on the board with an overtrick IMP in 3NT on 21.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|dburn: that would have been trickier - not sure why South did not see it through by bidding 3@d to show both red suits|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: well, not to crash your party, but I think the latter applied here|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s4|pc|hQ|nt|tez: trying only 800|pg||
nt|flash: in any case, the pause b4 passing protected South's position in the post mortem...   well, i thought about bidding more...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three NS pairs in a part-score!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now comes a push|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if W returns @s|pg||
nt|peachy: w has to return a trump, otherwise making, and surely will|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good move from E - to take @s king and return @c offering losing choice to declarer|pg||
nt|flash: South looks for the Undo button|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close match|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: in the auction, South limited his hand by 2S instead of bidding a more ambiguous (as to strength and shape) 2C|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pc|hT|pg||

nt|sharkey: as was in CR...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- who thought that hand would NEVER end|pg||
nt|peachy: Lavazza not used to scores like this|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  West is lucky here - a Multi would nok be a success|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - South opening|pg||
nt|tez: other room 4@s doubled..specs said:)|pg||
nt|flash: specs now up to 387 and still very little harassment...   i mean few comments   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the unlikely event that i passed originally as E, i doubt i could bring myself to pass 4S when pd bids it facing a passed hand at unfavorable vul with an unlinmited hand behind ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him. if i did summon such conservatism, and then watched 4S go down, i'd head for the bar|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not used to countries that drink tea instead of coffee either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that confirms it -- definitely NOT Precision|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: not much of fit anywhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And in 3 NT, you must hunt the 9th trick|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yeah - @H not 3-3|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: S passes another opening bid by many standards|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, if the suits were majors I'd open.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: I'd open S at any vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be better to have the minors reversed, but you cant have everything all the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an interesting problem over 1H. i dont think 2H gets the job done. prefer 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: splinter would be my choice|pg||
nt|xenya: or cruel rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: does making only 4 seem 1 too few?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: Maybe someone in the audience can tell us what 2@D is|pg||
nt|peachy: club position fortunate|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts never break friendly in Japan|pg||
nt|peachy: aonly a few ricks for declarer here, we'll see how few|pg||
nt|peachy: tricks*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This time - in 3 NT - the @D-suit must be handled well|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: might even keep West out  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Brave man, East|pg||
mb|3N|nt|flash: on this day in history, a modern, aggressive player passed a rotten 11-count in 2nd chair...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will this break the streak of all hands declared by either North or West?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: which would in your book be weaker, Pass or 4D by N over 3H?|pg||
nt|tez: makeable 7@h..i belive they will stop 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam in board 5 was missed in OR (4@S + 3)|pg||
nt|tez: they are not playing with open cards:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting the OR is connected to us  but we are not reconnected to them |pg||
nt|sybarra: or should I say they were|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for a double of 4@H at MP?|pg||
nt|jtr: Might be necessary|pg||
nt|jtr: If we make 3@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but not that UNfriendly, surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 10-13, 2NT asking - 3@C = minimum, 3@D asking for singleton, 3Nt = singleton @S|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c pls|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X making, so 5@CX only cost 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At this level no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: (not being picky sorry)|pg||
nt|hlortz: that IMP on 21 is suspect even it looked like 660 to me tho maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 2@C may be  18-19 bal   [same as EW 2@D opener]|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You'll get 200 here, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
nt|po-s: is this a hand that wants ruffs or to tap declarer?|pg||
nt|po-s: tap apparently|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South does his best|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he would be happy with four - that would mean his opponents could make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they can - may have stolen the pot here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  looks like 300|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be beaten |pg||
nt|xenya: with careful defence|pg||
nt|peachy: three unescapable losers, will be a ppush|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||

nt|flash: and, lo and behold, the auction proceeded smoothly (in both rooms)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another NT-bid without a sure stopper...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|sybarra: almost same auction other room,  but instead of 2 nt, E bid 2 sp |pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  @d break will be big disaster for declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: apprximately 2 down?|pg||
nt|xenya: well W dropped a trick when he failed to put up the Q, but that was far from obvious?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes you told him 7@H he could have just bid 6 LOL|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now no @D-finesse|pg||
nt|flash: low @S a bit surprising?   North would like the 9 to lead the Q, but...|pg||
nt|flash: ah - there was a 1@S call...|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  Any lead 660|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA, 3 clubs and 2 diamonds, including a ruff |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mistiming let's @HT score?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The non-competitive auctions continue.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
nt|xenya: S was naturally hoping for a club honour when he bid 3N -- that was not to be|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: one spade and two clubs would be different|pg||
nt|hlortz: /relate/|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nie had conquered the world of  "Go" some 20 years ago and turned his interest to bridge in recent years.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, u r right, four|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  But here only 600|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cancel, too early here|pg||
nt|peachy: he can still take 9|pg||
nt|peachy: or more if def allows :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So in fact it was a good lead, leading the @S King, and West takes 11 tricks - here only 9|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead in OR, that ALONE tells me it was a good lead, plus, I would have led Q or 10 = further evidence...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N plays a third spoade and throws a D, so can W, and E plays a fourth spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not 100% inescapable. but the defense is easy enough|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  next door 4@s made when defence offered @c trick to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that South, who had a maximum for his initial pass, did not take some action when a weak no trump came back|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain by noticing that the players at this level aren't afraid to pause and consider their play(s)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: or that in Strong Club context, he didnt open|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain even more by noticing when they pause|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so you will be in Reno next month?|pg||
nt|xenya: a club honour in the N hand that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or K & Q to fall singleton |pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: probably private, too :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: well, justice served, in a sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry provate|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps an endplay in diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does @CK transfer threat for a squeeze?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems to me that either way W gets an overruff. maybe i am missing something|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, not much chance to catch up if the cards dont cooperate by giving some options|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: Thanks for the trainingin "Go", he is a very good card plaer in bridge, but his biddng is a bit old fashioned.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|flash: @C2 is UDA - encouraging|pg||
nt|peachy: where could he get rid of them?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen some New Zealand and Australian pairs using this 2@C opener -- but don't recall ever seeing it from an ACBL representative|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tez: no|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  End-plys possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  play|pg||
nt|peachy: The open room had some conn probs in earlier matches|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H Ace, @C KIng, @H back and the @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South knowa WeatÂ´s distribution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And doesÂ´nt matter, whether West has single og double @H from the beginning|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But badly enough, the @C Jack comes down, which means 10 tricks without this endplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: so he overkilled |pg||
nt|tez: no=undo|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: note that NS are lucky in that S has the @S8|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Lavazza has now bid to slam on 22 -- off two top tricks -- so the rout continues.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: i dont understand this|pg||
nt|peachy: it may be a failing on my part!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, East didÂ´nt tahe the @C Ace, sleeping !!!|pg||
nt|peachy: the pause here probably is some external prob, surely declarer is not thinking like this'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now safe to play last trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing hearts|pg||
nt|hlortz: surely only 620//|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you giving too little credit to EW then :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: 200 - 10/58 for NS|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome to Bart Bramley |pg||
nt|ahollan1: it couldn't cost to cash that last trump :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like that should be -300|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  lot of spades by NS, but 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: This could be trouble for N-S|pg||
nt|peachy: a lucky 12 tricks here, but we'll see|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - 1NT was 14-16, which explains why it bought the hand on the previous deal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hlortz: hi Bart|pg||
nt|tez: hi Bart:)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS in OR also missed 3NT in board 4 - so the standing is 3-33!|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 very exciting pais here Kit,  however  because of crashes rooms not connected,  Peter has running score |pg||
nt|bbramley: can zmud bid 1NT here to show 4@S and minor?|pg||
nt|flash: halfway through the match - close and entertaining|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 4+  unless exactly 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass over 1 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: negative free bid working here|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the end of day 2  Lavazza was in the lead of the 12-round swiss qualifying|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|peachy: this 4S is too strong for my standards, cannot have two side suits controlled|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing 1nt=long minor and major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i already said the defense was easy. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know what they did in match 9|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: is that raptor? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is there a name for it|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 31-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final|pg||
nt|peachy: seems the organizers dont post match results until the following match is completed, been that way so far|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sybarra: oh oh   |pg||
nt|peachy: oh well, guess it works to mix it up...!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S took a line of play that could never succeed there|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm rooting for the Netherlands to get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't know the name, i just know how they play|pg||
nt|peachy: best bridge on the planet in front of us, what a treat|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  They might be there after board 7 - but we need OR-result|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, they lost 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure you have played agst them |pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D? -- major + minor?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well lookee here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Saved |pg||
nt|peachy: I guess they will get to this slam now, E showing shape I assume|pg||
nt|flash: how light does one open in 3rd chair?   the more lead-directional the call, the lighter it might be???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=one-round force|pg||
nt|chick: a clear violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone else prefer to pass 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S absolutely needed trumps 22 because one club had to be ruffed to set up the suit, and later a spade had to be ruffed. if Ds are 3-1 the hand cant make|pg||
nt|peachy: but don't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass would be eminently sensible|pg||
nt|chick: no, but I prefer to bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would prefer 1N if semi-force or non-force|pg||
nt|jcwla: E did not switch to @S when in with @HA -- all went bye bye on the @D's -- 11 to Lavazza on 22|pg||
nt|hlortz: odd looking to me west dbls stiff in unbid suit  east with k 5th doesnt bid them|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8:  N  3NT-1 in the OR|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, Roland said earlier was made with +1 bd7|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard bids 2 @D,  if not I will |pg||
nt|sybarra: (over 2 @C)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- you just don't know what hand partner holds for 2@C when 1N is absolute force|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, should have been -300 -- unless W didn't play 2 rounds of hearts at the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans -- is your plan to PASS reopening DBL?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No the 1 NT, which should mean, that I was too week for 1 NT directly |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@H is an option|pg||
nt|chick: yes, raija, and it kept them out of a very good (but unfortunately unmakeable) slam|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22, EW in the OR did bid and make 3N on basically the same defence: @H lead ducked by N|pg||
nt|po-s: how about "Polish"?|pg||
nt|bbramley: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E apparently assumed N had announced 4 spades so the double would be more for clubs and hearts. not condoning that line of thought just attempting to explain|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless 2@H was xfer to @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: no chance, without def erring|pg||
nt|tez: i m chicken..i have no idea for convention names|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello po, you are always welcome :)|pg||
nt|tez: hi PO|pg||
nt|othered1: which brings us back to playing the other 6+card fit a level lower :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would make it hard to play 2H, the single most likely correct contract when W doubles|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for West to bid immediately?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared a pass by North who could well have had a heart fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  then|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: still - with no club fit..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait - errare humanum est|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  tourney site |pg||
nt|flash: still a long way to go for N-S to reach game after this start?   (the balancing X certainly helped)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hlortz: this will make with a good view in @H suit i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks - it is bedtime but I must see my expartner overbid - alittle|pg||
nt|peachy: i am betting on diam lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the Italian pairs often use DBL in mid auction to just say  extra points|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: holding four bad hearts i would incline to pass. game is unlikely and i have some defense. if pd bids after i pass, i will be very well placed to act, but if i bid 1N, i will have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to stop bidding before i have much usefuyl info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for Klinger if Apteker does Pass 1@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all that from a guy who has to blow the dust off the green card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA then ruffing finesse might hold this to down 1|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: and which one is ex?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (sorry I do not know) |pg||
nt|hlortz: needs a deep finesse here :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't think he can make it even with a perfect guess - more clubs will sink it|pg||
nt|tez: many thanks all..here 4.09 am..bye all..see you..enjoyed|pg||
nt|hlortz: really?n follow to 3 @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Tez @H  pleasant dreams |pg||
nt|bbramley: i see, henry, so he'll threaten to dump both spades - yes, that would be PERFECT guessing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  we have comfortable sitting at home, with coffee and double-dummy deals, not so they|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, pressure of a big event|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must be declarer at this board, we might see an NL-score  now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol yes the deep 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 4@H in OR - but here the lead: a small @S from S?????????????????|pg||
nt|hlortz: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: N did well to show his max, assumedly Dbl meant it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't quote me on that|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: 10 imps|pg||
nt|pelu: to K|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said "ugh"  and would you believe there is spec with that bbo name? |pg||
nt|flash: if South, holding KJx, wouldn't bid NT, that was no longer a possible/plausible strain|pg||
nt|peachy: OR overcalled 1NT with S hand, no wonder they got to game|pg||
nt|hlortz: well unless 2@D xfer not making the case for it im just confused :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wel sure, but the question is why E ddnt bid spades. of course it shows extras|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West surely counted on a @C-.suit in East|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  and world-wide watching |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now lead any minor for down 2  -- even @DJ works -- ruff, @HA  @D ruff @C uppercut to re-establish @C10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they bid 2D a;ready|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: so it could be a dblwhammy for them, dbld game and a plus unmaking slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah -- yes i can live with that tactic|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hlortz: oops my bad lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a cnfusing auction:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: see i *said* i was confused.. meanwhile 3@C not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Raija predicted 23 a push so 35-12 at the halfway mark.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but he has an awfully good hand and i dont see a better call for him if he is going to bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it helps to know that both of the round kings are offside :)|pg||
nt|xenya: this inelegant contract might make...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  But even on a @D-lead from East, you should have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|po-s: must be a commentator|pg||
nt|peachy: lost that one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: i guess that works too|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Won @DK at trick 2, advanced @CQ and got clubs wrong later, playing for the double finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: Merijn home here, fortuitous rightsiding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: in a dition to different club play then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|bbramley: that will simplify the defense - if he hadn't cashed @SA it gets complicated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 4-4 in majors on S odds are good for a @d Hx on S|pg||
nt|hlortz: lavazza lucky on bd 22 or it would be lots to not much|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure how much -150 is worth|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: about 5/58 at the moment|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: But looking at past hands in this match, I dont expect them to be in slam other room, no matter how biddable|pg||
nt|peachy: I am glad that the big name teams are not yet on vugraph, giving others the chance to experience that thrill as players|pg||
nt|flash: of course, Mandala, youngster that he (still) is, decided that the South hand was a 1NT overcall   :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: or East thought 2N was different from what West thought|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C-lead would have been better|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  definitely agree|pg||
nt|peachy: while for the "names" it is bread'nbutter|pg||
nt|xenya: no, likely down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Make that 180|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was a clear misdefense by E in the other room. he simply did not analyze the hand. |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|xenya: but i can't wait to see the result from the other room on 23|pg||
pc|d3|nt|po-s: probably the same|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: the other table seems to be having a bit of connection trouble|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: bah needed ot be small sp|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i think Giorgio Duboin was the  1 ranked player in the world for many years -- with a recent overtake by frequent teammate Fulvio Fantoni|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin gonna make this well done,,|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: back to making|pg||
pc|s8|nt|flash: again, in a short match, a huge swing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 NT seems better than D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  No 4-card @S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  "names" will appear in finals - it's obvious )))|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, no doubt, including some excellent japanese teams who might be there|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: South is not enjoying this hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: from what we've seen before, looks uncharacteristic that EW stopped short of game here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so well played by E|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|peachy: that is a common agreement|pg||
nt|peachy: another that I have heard of is it shows H stopped and denies S stopped|pg||
nt|drorp:  usually the defense against 2 known suit bids is that 1 cue bid shows fit and limit or better and the other shows GF hand with the 4th suit, while bidding the 4th suit (3@C in this case) would be non forcing.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: first slam! |pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 3NT in the OR on a @C lead from N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: another good slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ken Rae is from the Shetlands|pg||
nt|peachy: a likely 3NT here now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East has a difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think that did NOT make overtrick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: that could very well be a Strong Two |pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure it is|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a rare beast|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18 5+ H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D 4+ [unless 4=4=3=2]|pg||
nt|xenya: not unexpectedly, 6 was a push -- 4@SX down 1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @D - can they bid it?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: Nunes still in the box after @SK|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like he was down 2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: even a spade lead does not defeat 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9:  S  4@SX-3  500 to EW|pg||
nt|peachy: partscore deal here, most likely|pg||
nt|po-s: you´re such a blood thirsty person|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is a scope for variations|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: chance for North-South to retaliate by reaching a lucky slam of their own - 6@c and 6NT both make if played by North (who has bid clubs)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After 2 @D -- West will have some work to get to 6 in a black suit |pg||
nt|peachy: they better play well, it is not easy to take 9 there|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Normally E/W would make 620 in 4 @H, but here...|pg||
nt|xenya: not normally, PO, no|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S = what guys?  1 nt|pg||
nt|bgn: no thanks, not today. Just watching NEC :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do EW play 2/1 GF even in comp? or neg free bids?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: crucial moment, go or not to go|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm betting no|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: time for Blackwood |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 NT on the N hand is excellent|pg||
nt|peachy: even if one does raise on three sometimes, doing so with S hand would be sick|pg||
nt|peachy: 2c is 10+,  GF if fit and then 2+ cl|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 4 @H you get 12 tricks - in 6 6 @H only 10|pg||
nt|flash: these stopperless NT calls are frightening!!!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: i dont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defeating this 4 @H will bring NL in front|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think the real score is 10-17|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of science in action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 controls I am told|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When 2 @D is majors, I would lead @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No success this time though|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Geoff Breskal won the Gold Cup many years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: many many years ago|pg||
nt|hlortz: indelicate but effective|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David Edwin in the audience remembers when|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this event is well-known for collecting "names" in Yokohama, the organizers do their best to attract "stars" giving national players fine possibility to compete  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no good lead for South|pg||
nt|peachy: Have to stay away from spade lead to have any chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best he could do|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - 6@c, as a spectator points out, will not make if East leads her diamond|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: a case for cashing the ace - not done|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way, and 2@D looks like an artif GF, or maybe this range balanced|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: this is more a lucky one than the 6NT was, there he only needed spade finess|pg||
nt|gracelin: I was in Yokohama for the NEC cup last year.  This Latin team did very well but they are missing Diego this time.|pg||
nt|dburn: all academic - they aren't going to bid a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3 Ds need heart shift|pg||
nt|peachy: this at least one down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately our operators do not speak English, so I can't explain how to reconnect after a crash|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is a bilingual specctator to help Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's all in our manual, but that's also in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: they soudn't.  This is amuch worse slam than last board which only needs a finesse.|pg||
nt|peachy: is Diego B in another team or not there this year?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: this might be tricky both for declarer and  defenders|pg||
nt|po-s: that HQ is a good card, otherwise declarer might have  difficulties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This one should depend om finding the @S Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we think 2 @D= 18+ |pg||
nt|pelu: they play tranfer-ans on 1@C - so 1@S sh be a normal 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm little conservative with 25 hcp total|pg||
nt|hlortz: but i guess they are high enough|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: tk he is not cming thisyear.|pg||
nt|flash: semi-sensible lead for a push...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: 2H is just begging for EW to bid the vul game and make it by finessing partner for H queen which they would not otherwise do|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was thinking of sac in those colors?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not every lead kills this 4 @H - but IÂ´m sure, the @C Ace did|pg||
nt|peachy: seems this is now going set, straining my eyes for way to make, but no|pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto is a great player but not the miracleman|pg||
nt|bbramley: plenty high - even with a moderately friendly lie i don't think he'll make it|pg||
nt|pelu: in 4@H Nunes played @H to 8 and A in trick 2!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it wasn't easy i guess |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: not sure when   late 70's    early 80's I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative shift that turns out to be good|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it was safe|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe two if def really alert|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  East might think, that South is in position to get a @C-ruff - not North. He must play @H Ace and another @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- this could have been dead minimum 2@H  [5+@H, 10+ HCP]|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Hi David|pg||
nt|flash: i'm getting some coaching in the 'modern' game - distribution first; stoppers later...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, minimum, but not dead minimum. the suit is good, and there is a residual fit for E, and the hand has 2 aces|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: still could be achieved i think|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 3 1/2 defensive tricks??|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Stay with us, you are on soon anyway|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6N+1 52/58|pg||
nt|gracelin: Seems EW use a similar scheme like CAPP against opponent strong club opening.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The stopperless NT is called practical bidding. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but giving up over 2@C is a mystery -- that appears to be the winning approach|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: one pair made 7N by South|pg||
nt|ady: bet possible for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1977 it was. Thanks to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13 tricks, I suppose|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|flash: something about old dogs and new water dishes...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually @SK is still interesting -- would Klinger duck to preserve entry to dummy?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|nt|peachy: might as well have used the HK, what else to do with it?|pg||
nt|peachy: toss it under the ace?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will do next time|pg||
nt|pelu: but still down 1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: why a club shift? and if that is what E asked for, why did he?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think my copy of CC says 1st discard is upside-down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart would seem marked from both sides of table|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|nt|bbramley: i like his line of play: he needed 1 of 2 club finesses through south, plus the spade finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: really? spade to king?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I bet - that is a push :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if wins @SA gets extra @S trick, but cannot establish @D|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: EW make some diamonds|pg||
mc|12|nt|peachy: 4 more tricks for declarer, 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 11 IMPs to NL   21-17|pg||
pg||

mb|d|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|drorp:  now it might be impossible|pg||

nt|peachy: which encourages N no end!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: S passed - hmm|pg||

nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  12 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|peachy: match is closer, always more exciting that way isnt it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 22-16  rather|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10:  NS  680|pg||
nt|bbramley: ah, so that's why you called them conservative :) i'll try to pay closer attention|pg||
nt|peachy: you keep spilling them?|pg||
nt|flash: i keep expecting them to contain wine...|pg||
nt|peachy: oooh|pg||
nt|peachy: giggle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @S bid by South -- 3@D is no walk in the park|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 3NT failed by 3 in the OR so Lavazza to within 35-18.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/goldcup/goldcupwinners.htm|pg||
nt|peachy: Marshall the standup comic :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, I think E should have tried for game by bidding 2NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's a Precision 1D opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: something seems to have happened to the website - board scores disconnected|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably sitting down however|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore in @s for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS can compete with minors, but @s rules|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, but it makes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: e/w sure to get to game   but should be down 1|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Here is today's bulletin, editors Barry Rigal and Rich Colker -  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec2010_data/bulletins/blt1.pdf|pg||
nt|peachy: identical auction so far as in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this DBL gets more votes :)     |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very likely that 3N makes but 4H does not (or that both do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure notes talk about Matt's DBL - but i won't be able to find it in time :(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: X by E should show extras, convertible vcalyues|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This slam is better |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Klinger would duck the @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H-P-3@S???|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I dunno about that, E had only one club stopper|pg||
nt|bbramley: polish club, usually a weak nt, but sometimes...  18+ HCP|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton kings here one on one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: with his rabbi,  N  or S can make game in either red suit |pg||
nt|peachy: nice safe contract|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sfoxa:  could be too high (if NS find @h ruff) |pg||
nt|kakasi: Iy[ [ÌûÖBBO©çÌ¨mç¹Å·G@@]Tª êÎAêxEBhEðÂ¶ÄAà¤êxJ«A»ÌÌ¿âÉYESÆ¦Ä­¾³¢ÆÌ±ÆÅ·B|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: nice fillers and suit in dummy|pg||
nt|flash: only 21 HCP - and the opps are bidding...   |pg||
nt|peachy: but not any more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For a 21Â´er, North has a weak hand|pg||
nt|flash: now, i have a preference...   5-card suits are shown?  4-card suits aren't???|pg||
nt|peachy: not when the opp bid it?|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I misunderstood|pg||
nt|flash: now you're teasing?   3@C puts things up a level, but we're not escaping this any more cheaply??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will South rebid 3@S over 3@C or ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S helps with shape, but without an honor  yuk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4D autosplinter (if ti is)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will show his shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 4@D is minorwood  [RKCB in @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - the key is that south needs to hear about @H filler to really get excited|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Oh, that 5-level again|pg||
nt|pelu: coprrection : Nunes maded 41Hs - correction by operator (misclicks)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep thought if he played @H to the 7 he'd make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will e/w get in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec points out 4 @S makes |pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@D=artif weak, 1@H=nat but could still be a weak nt (F1?), 2@D nat NF|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@S makes, lose 1 of each|pg||
nt|sybarra: no doesnt make,  think it loses a trick in each suit,,  |pg||
nt|flash: might North have called 2@H over 1@S, instead of Xing again?   (thnx, Deb)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When I was young(er), this pass was for playing 2 @D RD|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm having a conversation with two specs, forgive my inattention please|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise they can make bluff-RD|pg||
nt|flash: only 2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I agree...!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks, kakasi explaining what to do for the operator in Japanese|pg||
nt|kakasi: I[v[ÌÊð\¦·é½ßÅ·B|pg||
nt|hlortz: now 4@H from n?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems unlikely that spades will play better than clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, I would, but I am not them :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||
nt|peachy: 9 count and support|pg||
nt|po-s: will East be satisfied with 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: 4C|pg||
nt|sybarra: right bart, I shouid double check  what spec say :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki finally reveals his true nature|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hate to splinter with singleton Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: or 6? no..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C looks fine|pg||
nt|po-s: he won´t get much cooperation I think - well maybe 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easte must have been very close to a D|pg||
nt|flash: certainly i expected partner to make this call - if i didn't bid 3@C earlier, i pass and try not to look too ready for the axe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hard bid to explain is not Matt's double but rather 5H|pg||
nt|chick: wonder why he ran from 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bingo!|pg||
nt|peachy: now P|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont hold up your bingo card yet, they have not IDed a spade control yet|pg||
nt|xenya: i never do|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, after the lead and the favorable DA position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker may have given the show away with his DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be tickled pink to play 5DX after W volunteered the suit over my X|pg||
nt|chick: but he can't let it go undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course -- failure to hear a 4@D call probably means some @S values -- but who knows|pg||
mb|6H|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: defense wants to make sure declarer has an entry for the @D finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: a little relief here for Zimmermann, match is not yet out of hand by any means|pg||
nt|flash: a sexy 3 IMPs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he uses it toplay trumps...|pg||
nt|po-s: then a small which is wrong if KJ bare|pg||
nt|peachy: dia shift there could have held but partner's suit is normal |pg||
nt|peachy: I think 4H was an offer to play, |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Duboin's silence against 1@S-2@S has paid off with 6 more on 25 as Bulgaria's E/W got to 2NT/W-2.  Lavazza to within 11.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this is why 3@S probably wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: bidding 2N does not rule out getting to 3H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @S D is "only" 1400, I think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: 4H|pg||
nt|xenya: no matter what W does now, declarer will only lose 2 more trumps |pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i like 4D better than 3S--the slam interest is underscored, as opposed to 3S|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: 4S was not a strong effort, i think, N should put S in the picture with some sort of fit-showing club bid|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes then 4@H clearly control bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 4D-4H, now S can bid 4N=  "i am still interested, but i dont have a spade control"|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, I dont think 4H was control, he has to show it at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: but again, I dont have their notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and another keypoint for partnerships   would 3@C-4@C be forcing?  [key is to be on same page]|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: she can pitch a @H forcexample|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's 5 more imps for NANIWADA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hlortz: 200 52/58 so far|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: it was a 16IMP swing on the 6@D fiasco|pg||
nt|po-s: trump ace I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: even then he has an re-entry on @H10 - to take the @D-finess :(|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, OR stayd in partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: a ping-pong match|pg||
nt|jcwla: Already 10 coming to Bulgaria, slam would have been an extra 5.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: this could be tricky?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bbramley: keeping control against spade tap|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: to specs: sorry rooms not connected,  we are trying our best to keep running score |pg||
nt|pelu: ny calculation are 42-6 for Zimmermann - but.......(:(:|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, scores are back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Healthy lead Sandqvist-McIntosh have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But much can still happen in an uneven field|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any views on 2@S there/|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, this event seems to revolve around how well you kill the less experienced pairs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon it's a bit quacky |pg||
nt|hlortz: i dislike the ambiguity of 2@S limit *or better*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Being in the right place at the right time|pg||
nt|jtr: That too|pg||
nt|chick: the other table bid 6@D but made it|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki will wonder why wrang didn't lead his (necessarily) singleton diamond - might drop it for that reason|pg||
mc|12|nt|flash: i've had a suggestion that X of 2@H might not have been penalties...   the 'modern' game strikes again?  all Xs below 2NT are t/o???|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  oh, even 6 |pg||
nt|peachy: interesting hand here, we'll see how the players deal with it|pg||
nt|po-s: who is Vondracek (was hoping sombody else wd ask)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N kind of made that comeback for them|pg||
nt|sybarra: well true |pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 6 @H in the OR hee |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 7 IMPs a board...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: heres a sexy little number|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh should I say W is and E is still thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: why is that, Henry?|pg||
nt|peachy: S is strong enough to open naturally, with longest suit, follow up with diamonds twice|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, interesting. as for me, I hate hands like S's - points in short honours and main suit (@c) w/o controls |pg||
nt|peachy: hah, if gets a chance...|pg||
nt|flash: natural; limited|pg||
nt|flash: asking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 7H to get a trump lead:)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|sfoxa:  E will give a hand|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: ew could scramble 8 tricks in s[ades|pg||
nt|peachy: ooh, and they are going for it|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: major suit cards placedbadly for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H??!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  time for W to show big fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open room have finished by now|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes if a world class defender puts u in dummy dont finesse...!|pg||
nt|flash: 6-card suit; no outside 4-card suit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: Great bid:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is N a chicken?|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, I would just bid 3D, 3S sounds too weak|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps 3S is their sys|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best game on EW 3nt on W|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is a near Yarborough -- the @D10 spoils the picture |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Art Garfunkel?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=5+@H & 5+@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think East and West have minimum, both oif them|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester makes no other|pg||
nt|po-s: will East comply - Lebensohl probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S is a good bid - for E/W, now East waill avoi the @D-lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=6-13 HCP, 4+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: they also play CAPP over 1NT opening, so 2D shows both maors.|pg||
nt|flash: practical call?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not Garfunkel   this GF gets more respect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=@D   go figure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has now bid only only the suit in which he has about 6% of his HCP :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and in the OR they are in 6 nt by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: with a sp lead |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the unbid portion of his hand his per capita HCP average is 2.5 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Klinger had option to bid 4@H to show solid/1-loser suit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: I almost didnt belive that he took the @D-finess -|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, South has NO 3 @C-bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: no double from South, slightly surprising|pg||
nt|jbgood: point taken|pg||
nt|po-s: doubledummy on a spade lead ducked and another spade...|pg||
nt|po-s: give up a club and a diamond, then throw South in at the end for a heart favor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to bid 3S here i think, and then W will bid 4D|pg||
nt|peachy: this game, if they stretch, could also make if def finds a wrong lead|pg||
nt|peachy: so match not over yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S is Puppet to 2N   making 3@C INV   [where immediate 3@C would be game force]|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another monster result for Bulgaria here.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Strange decision - West has the hand for bidding 4 @S|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose the operator will catch up with comparisons when has a chance|pg||

pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  OK - thatÂ´s better|pg||
nt|po-s: but he might simply go for hearts in a simpler fashin|pg||

nt|po-s: DJ isn´t very good either, is it|pg||
nt|xenya: it is not|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@H looks down 1, -50 a good save vs. 3@D making 110 or 130|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E decided there was no way to show, so he i susing KC hoping to hide his hand as declarer:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: EW are adopting the NS strategy of self-destruction :(|pg||
nt|peachy: bit score relief for Naniwada now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6 more imps for NANIWADA |pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: so, Lavazza team MUST stretch to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duboin has perfect picture to find 4@H jumpm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bocchi is the best at stretching:)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, thats why he is so tall?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|po-s: so it leaves a club or a heart|pg||
nt|xenya: complex hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 3 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s it - you sit up here in the cold North, trying to find out, how to bid 4 @S - and North just did it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: @H10    really??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Very bad lead this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure about result on 10, but before it was 22-17|pg||
nt|peachy: as well as her own|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds heavily in favor of W shortness being in Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 2 top hearts and Ds|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Herman just needs to find Forrester's entry to get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Keep looking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: little does he know it's in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he must have one after 3@H without A and Q, right?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North had no good lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: although he might suspect it |pg||
nt|po-s: this way is no good though|pg||
nt|sybarra: down 3!! |pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: maybe the @CA and another would have been better?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East just wanted to se the @H-signals from N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Unblock...|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps nothing is lost yet|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a good example of aggressive bidding -- EW got just a bit too high, but that induced NS to go overboard too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i am tired -- was thinking West declaring @S  :(|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  Voila they say in France|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a low club lead fro N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: responses to RKC are 1430 ONLY when trump=@H|pg||
pc|s7|nt|po-s: but now North can break communications should declarer duck the diamond|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: Bas really didn't want a ruff, I think he was trying for a lead not to give a trick or something|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: this likely to be around average     double for north might have gain quite a bit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht can happily keep the @HK8 over dummy's @HQ7|pg||
nt|hlortz: -2 looks normal|pg||
pc|c5|nt|flash: again, http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings...   pls check out the Daily Bulletins|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S showed @HQ  said nothing about @S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: I would think a higher club from W would make it clearer for partner to return @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Endplay for overtrick instead|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but playing the sox off this hand!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: yes, Lin is a very agressve bidder.  Nie didn't take account for that.  |pg||

nt|sharkey: Now NS got the @S lead established...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West is awkwardly placed now|pg||
nt|drorp:  east passes to show something like no 4 hearts and no spade stop, they might eventually land in 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: S has to lead an honor vs 3 NT though else suit blocked|pg||
nt|peachy: i am venturing a  Guess E denied 4H and denied S stopper|pg||
nt|sharkey: E's NT opening only 14 HCP - may have upgraded to 15|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 4@D will get them to 4@H|pg||
nt|drorp:  now even if the play 3NT, it'll be easy for S to lead K, knowing there is no stopper in E|pg||

nt|sybarra: :)|pg||

nt|peachy: No, Nie's jump did it, IMO.  |pg||
nt|xenya: another game missed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reverse black suits in W hand & very likely Ron would open at 4 level at these colors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S alerted because system on over DBL -- so MAX = 12 HCP|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, by 8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D best here i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|peachy: Open room was allowed to play in 4C, good for them|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  E/W 130 in OR is a good result for NL|pg||
nt|po-s: funny hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, Lin might double the weak NT opening with a stronger hand.|pg||
nt|flash: Multi - weak 2 in a major; 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Big result for Italy in OR|pg||
nt|flash: knowing quite well that a 2@S call won't be forthcoming|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a few good hands in a row for them|pg||
nt|xenya: potentially|pg||

nt|peachy: I think best now to bang down the spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead the @D Ace - and lose 620|pg||

nt|Walddk4: kakasi whose real name is Satoshi Imai|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defence is @C Ace and a @H - double-dummy|pg||
nt|peachy: Groenenboom can play whichever club, he doesnt know yet it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West has the @H Queen, he will get it anyway|pg||
nt|po-s: good sacrifice in 5C|pg||
nt|hlortz: well the 10@H dropping is a clue also..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C is 4-card Stayman|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will @D 10 followed by the 9 wake up South?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  And @H 10|pg||
nt|peachy: probably will lead diamond, leastr self-destructive without seeing all hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has stronger spot cards in club but he might go after spade since he has no entry for the long club suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing now    4@S=RKCB  5@C=3 keycards, 5@D asks @HQ  5@S=yes and @SK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|peachy: likely not making|pg||

nt|hlortz: will E find a @C lead? i bet no|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

pc|sK|nt|hlortz: up k@D ruff a @H 2 trumps exit a @D think he could make dbl dummy|pg||

nt|peachy: S probably wanted to take a sure plus and not jeopardize it in case EW could have run somehow|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: excitement gere and a chance for oz players to extend their lead|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: here not gere i dont find him exciting|pg||
nt|drorp:  i bet they'll bid the slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cold with North as declarer, but I don't think any system can arrange that|pg||
nt|sharkey: S will not be overly exited by pd's 4@C|pg||
nt|jcwla: i would be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after round 12 advance to the quarter-finals|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|peachy: that could be exclusion|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|drorp:  he decided he either plays 6 or 7, depending on aces situation, so he asks for aces excluding the A@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: visions of the "exclusion" hand from BB|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 5 NT showing 2 including trump Q?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would for me|pg||
nt|peachy: fortunate spades for NS|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: oh dear, an accident|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And for Bach too|pg||
nt|sharkey: we may have a new leader....|pg||
nt|jcwla: this looks like one ace and the queen of trump -- d/k 5nt|pg||
nt|peachy: needs spade lead now or else...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Lots of speculation by Kibs over meaning of 5 NT|pg||
nt|drorp:  without a spade lead, declearer does have 13 tricks, 4 diamonds after setting them up+6 hearts+1 club+2 more ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|peachy: saved the most excitement last here|pg||

nt|marlowepi: can make double dummy of course. diamond king and spade finesse. but declarer should put in the diamond ten at trick one to try to force a dummy entry|pg||
nt|peachy: other table behind a bit, maybe still some connection issues? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what a bloody result next door!|pg||
nt|po-s: seems you lose a spade a heart and 3 minor tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N had 8 tricks he would probably just be taking them rather than letting himself go down 2 extra tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: yup, gold star to lavazza for the 6@D in the or|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|peachy: could well be duplicated here|pg||
nt|xenya: right, so the 3@D bid was not also quite natural but also correct|pg||
nt|po-s: - and perhaps one in the wash|pg||
nt|hlortz: undo?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the original Blue Team Club -- North would open 3@C  -- how's that for useless trivia|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: ah, no|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's not the end )))|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: wrong bidders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert must mean 1@C=2+   which North surely has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another 6 @H - with @D behaving|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: 14 is the last board of the match; restart 10 minutes to the hour with the last match today|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps the issue here is the margin, rather than the outcome?  as long as both finish in the top 8, they advance to the KO phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2C?|pg||
nt|peachy: i like 2C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is more like a 2C opener than a 2C rebid|pg||
nt|flash: of course, the higher a team finishes, the more control they retain over their opponents in the KOs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment in Europe  is for 1x-(1@H)-DBL to DENY 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have another Italian DBL that can't be described confidently|pg||
nt|xenya: boards 10 and 12 are potentially very good for Sara|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IsÂ´nt 6 @H a fair shot from SouthÂ´s position?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hardly the 18-20 HCP  [semi]balanced hand most of us expect for 4@H|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: yes, it only took 24 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: lets see how 3NT fares...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S or 4@C now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what now by S?  XX?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@H now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3C by N would have been an underbid|pg||
nt|chick: a nice reverse into 2@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17:13 in Japan now|pg||
nt|flash: 1@D shows at least 4 and a shapely hand|pg||
mb|5H|nt|pelu: Operator -pl UNDO!|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C usually shows 9 card in the minors, either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to get it corrected |pg||
nt|bbramley: 3-1 trumps would have made it much more complicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker is liking this more and more with each round of bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: hasn't north done a lot of bidding, considering the @SK isn't full value?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: it may go 3S and 3NT, not a great contract.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H probably shows the 1444|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
nt|peachy: aceless softie, unless to my surprise 4C were forcing, cant be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each player wary of void in partner's other suit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: a VERY lucky 3N...|pg||
nt|hlortz: w needs to overtake the @H trick 1 and play @S to beat 5@C easy for these guys im sure|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and not a great slam because of having to guess @S at trick one  :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|peachy: not at all, 3S the last making one, but if EW in other room play 15-17NT (I dont know if they do) might go same way|pg||
nt|flash: although it might just be patterning out (1354 or 1345) with a max for not opening 1@C|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D-1S-2C shows 5-4 or 4-5 minors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are in GF and S is unlimited. N has good cards, good IN-OUT valuation|pg||
nt|othered1: Wouldn't north have bid the same, to imply stiff @S, if the @SK work a working K?|pg||
nt|sybarra: fast arrival "hopefully"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe aceless and somewhat soft, but all values are working|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: nice fit|pg||
nt|chick: at least they got into a makeable game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, might|pg||
nt|po-s: 3S shows good with short diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: according to sys card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- why so pessimistic?   [even if it is the max they can make]|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|peachy: nice judgment by Merijn Groenenboom|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I expect a flat board, losing 1 spade, 1 heart and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was same in other room (correctly) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently it was, but i dont know why S bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course VIctor Mollo's Hideous Hog said   you have to bid bad slams -- because so many good ones go down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s because of the cue-bid - bidding with closed eyes 6 @H, it is a fair slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Slam score at board 10|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: theygot there anyway, at least|pg||
nt|peachy: in the other room, bulgarian EW put NS to a guess, well done|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||
nt|po-s: this time the hearts behave. You need to guess how to treat diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy slam|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hlortz: fortunately this is a simple 4@S making so we arent missing anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might lose @C to ensure game??|pg||
nt|sybarra: only if @D's break I thnk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|peachy: our predictions havent really fetched tonightm have they Sveta :)|pg||
nt|xenya: @C shift was needed to beat it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@s on board 9:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 17:)|pg||
nt|xenya: imps|pg||
nt|xenya: lucky|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be a simple cliam by operator (easiest) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: why not just transfer to @s' /|pg||
nt|peachy: would be pretty conservative not to be in game vul IMPs|pg||
nt|hlortz: so 6 imps for staying out of game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Terrific bidding by Bulgaria in this match.  No bidding on last bd at least in OR.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: well i want to be in it if it is on 32 trumps. actually you need more, but it is still worthwhile. anyway when i said "easy" i meant easy to make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wonder why S didnt temporize with 4D which looks like a freebie. maybe that would have been KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly what i was thinking Marshall  when i used the "p" word  [pessimistic]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thought it stood for Pusillanimous|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  u r right, Raija|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: and he got that wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra2: then invite?  maybe I missed something earlier|pg||
nt|flash: we were speaking of shoes earlier - as usual, Mandala-Bocchi have their bidding shoes on!!!   another monster result|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|jtr: There will be a few in slam on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: may make 12 now|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|hK|pc|d7|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  VERY|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: but will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|gracelin: because in this sequence EW can stop in 2S, while if you transfer, you need to followup with 2NT. |pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: @C switch coming too late...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: seems a big play not finessing the @s and taking 11|pg||
nt|peachy: one more down doesnt matter, 2N not making either|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok |pg||
nt|peachy: while if in 2NT and game makes...|pg||
nt|flash: while this is playing out...    thnx to NEC for their continuing sponsorship of this great tournament|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: east can get most of the match points if entering with A@H   cashing dimonds and finessing 10@C     |pg||
nt|peachy: then opps have more and they wont lie silent|pg||
nt|peachy: the 1pt hand was squeezed, beautiful!|pg||

nt|hlortz: rarity on OR a passed out board|pg||

nt|sybarra: just under an hour|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - needs onle @S-suit 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  only|pg||
nt|peachy: I thought about that. Many play fit jumps by PH|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-switch is bad - tka this trick|pg||
nt|hawe45:  take|pg||
nt|peachy: he will figure it out.  Must take|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He might as well; he knows spades are 4-4 after the lead, no?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a fast duck in @CÂ´s from West very soon - and we shall wee|pg||
nt|hawe45:  see|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but you need less luck in 2N and you won't go down 3 vulnerable |pg||
nt|xenya: good stop|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: sone sunshine for Sweden - 4@S +420 in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kovachev must have forgotten he's not playing precision on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Mullamphy upgraded earlier NT, here Klinger downgraded|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: but needs correct timing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h ruffs before @c ruffs|pg||
nt|sybarra: we start again in about 20 min |pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: nothing but clubs to lead..|pg||

nt|hlortz: doesnt matter here but the slow j@C suggests e has another as w aj dbltn you would see a and prompt j :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s better than the finesse|pg||
nt|bbramley: he can claim 9 on a crossruff|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra2: supposedly another 10 inches on top of the 18 we got over the weekend |pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: I'm going to watch some more, only 9PM here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and once again it is snowing in Wash. DC......|pg||

nt|flash: no compelling reason to go wrong, so...|pg||
nt|flash: extra chance?   ruff the @C, play 3 rounds of @Ds??|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, its over. just and push|pg||
nt|xenya: the fact that 1N might fail doesn't mean that you have to bid 3N|pg||

nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|po-s: which I think was misplayed|pg||
nt|xenya: and it's the last hand too|pg||
nt|po-s: he should have ducked the spade it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: keep in mind - we're skeptical of some of the posted result  [ 7 300 instead of 200, and an overtrick somewhere]|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|nt|jtr: But he had time|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks everyone!! |pg||
nt|peachy: Bye for now!|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again all see you back in 40 min |pg||
nt|xenya: crossruff yields only 9 tricks, so declarer needs another trick elsewhere |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|peachy: or something like it, ruff club now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c to @sQ, and @dQ|pg||
