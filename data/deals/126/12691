nt|rodal f: Hi Lasse|pg||
nt|lasseaa: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S in OR amazing|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: funny result here from open|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|varange: who can help us out with the systems they play?|pg||
nt|po-s: Hej alla norrmän - East i closed må vare meget duktig|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Let's see if E/W will find 4@h here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, perhaps not ha-ha funny, but strange funny|pg||
nt|paulg:  i saw this next door and brogeland seemed to ask his partner to transfer to game ... and then gave him the option of playing it|pg||
mb|3C!|an|one single major|nt|vugraphzec: hi Lasse!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|Ask witch is single|nt|janhamhurg: interesting- this hand might produce a big swing and will!|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Looks like they are on their way.|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that 2@s doesn't show support for the hearts|pg||
mb|3S!|an|single !S|nt|andyv:  hard to tell if E has a good hand or not:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@C was a new one for me can Lars exsplain it for specs + me?:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|keylime:  At the other table, North began with an aggressive 3@c, and South was able to direct the spade lead for down 1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: 3nt is of course an alternative.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: asking for @S check|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This should make with a few overtricks.|pg||
nt|varange: what to lead? Spade is unattractive.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C+1@H+2@D=top 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will cost blood, sweat and tears|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4@h will be easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: and having no entries, it is probably a good idea trying to find partner's long suit outside of spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: overtricks to follow-very friendly lay out of cards|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec tell 4-4-4-1 but is it always a single major. Y|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So slam lost by there system|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|janhamhurg: about 2 off so 600 swing possible|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|varange: what would you lead from south?|pg||
nt|lasseaa: not the system, in pratice, same bidding in the other room|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Closer to 3 off, maybe more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree so 500+300makes 13|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 4, if W continues trumps |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'm from the classic school of preeempts, especially in 2nd seat.|pg||
mc|12|nt|janhamhurg: even in a context of strong club, the north opening bid seems a bid light|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and in a natural system its def to light|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: just my opinion though|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: So the pre torney favorites Midt-Trøndelag is in the lead going into the last round, and seem headed for another title|pg||

nt|varange: same here. also east has just clearly announced ownership of stoppers|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer played last hand way too fast|pg||
nt|keylime:  agreed. very much an autopilot type fo approach|pg||
nt|rodal f: Specs by 50-50 now. Did Es hand grow after 3@S or not. Grew I will say|pg||
mb|1D|nt|janhamhurg: spades hearts here, who will win the bidding?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  a 5-card multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Will East show his majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasseaa: with the singlejumps after 1 nt, you avoid shit three NT, but you loose control on slams|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzec: ouch|pg||
nt|keylime:  If the defense can start spades quickly, this is going down a bit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|varange: i'm at a loss to see how they arrived in 2@s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to show both majors after the 1nt interference. So they found the Moysian only.|pg||
nt|varange: in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same sequence but transfer, I think|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|varange: John Carruthers suggests 1@c-1@d-1NT-DBL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible|pg||
nt|paulg:  stength according to vulnerability ... so no doubt what it is|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|janhamhurg: a little too much, again the vuln game bonus makes them bid a lot|pg||
nt|paulg:  Presuming that South could have bid 3@h to show a good raise, I think North has overdone it a little|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|janhamhurg: agree, the 2 spade call showed a decent hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|varange: would 2@c by east show the majors?|pg||
nt|varange: intersting.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: if double shows at least 5/4 in the majors I am all for it, but else...|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|janhamhurg: so 2 off, east west gaining even more imps here|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding thin vulnerable games is fine if you only go down one, but costly when more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and there was a small chance to be doubled- so that could have been expensiv|pg||
pc|h8|nt|baldfriede: None of the possible continuations of South are to his liking.|pg||
nt|keylime:  at the other table, the auction was a bit more sedate; E did not open 3@d but competed after the spade fit was known|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|varange: 2@h initially looks to be OK, but has the slight blemish of not making, far as I can tell|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: so the 2 dia bid shows probably no points at all----|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|baldfriede: @h splinter bid now?|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially over a 1st seat NV vs. VUL preempt|pg||

nt|xenya: a trivial 3N|pg||

nt|lasseaa: three rounds of spade = 10|pg||
nt|lasseaa: wrong|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|drewsky: West should return a club in case declarer has AKQ of @D...in order to remove the entry to dummy|pg||

nt|andyv:  Dwayne, you agree with the xfer to 2@h by E?|pg||
nt|keylime:  there's a lot of schools of thought on transferring with that weak of a suit|pg||
nt|keylime:  I tend to look at my hand to see if I have some ruffing value to help declarer; in this instance, I would xfer due to A@c and two doubletons|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: 2 singles+ a doublefit- much to discover during the bidding|pg||
mb|3N|nt|keylime:  one of the keys to playing team games is not letting a flow of hands like NS has had, get to you. That's why you have teammates.|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|drewsky: I think it also matters what minor the oppopnents open relative to your length in their minor as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 3H by West?|pg||
nt|Rafa: Winner here represents Norway in the European Champions Cup in November|pg||
nt|drewsky: At the other table, west opened north's 5 card minor, so a delayed takeout double of hearts was not to be considered|pg||
nt|jcmax: The cards lie very favourably for EW and exactly where you wwould expect them to be with this bidding. But does W have enough to drive to game?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 dia transfer|pg||
nt|keylime:  3NT down off the hop so to avoid it will score well|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: good raise is my guess|pg||

mb|4S|nt|janhamhurg: 2 hearts showing 4 |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least forcing:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: All by good cards here:) 2NT=inviting jacoby and 3@H good lift in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I don't think so, after all partner only balanced|pg||
nt|jcmax: But maybe E feels he is not minimum?|pg||
nt|po-s: so does West hav a good enough hand?|pg||
nt|po-s: West could have just raised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, 3@H is a serious raise|pg||
nt|drewsky: Certainly the west hand is worth more than a simple raise to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: fine bidding here- no 3 heart bid with only 8 trumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c on NS. have to bid this to pick up some IMPs|pg||

nt|rodal f: Easyer the @D became|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|po-s: which is why East could try four|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  South almost certainly has a 12-14 balanced hand on the auction, so not even tempting for North|pg||
nt|rodal f: U ended up by the contract Ralf:)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|keylime:  the dreaded mirror distribution hands|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|po-s: yes, he could have tried 3H - maybe they won´t notice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But our operator would|pg||
nt|drewsky: A lot depends on the range of a balance....East could have as little as 10 HCP or as much as 15|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: do you agree Frank?|pg||

nt|xenya: 2@C shows clubs and a major?|pg||
mb|d|nt|keylime:  many p'ships play 4@c/@d over a 3M preempt as a two suited overcall showing the minor and other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@c is precision-like, 9-15 HCP|pg||
nt|paulg:  normally 6 clubs|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  W has just enough defense to not take the push.... I'm not sure that I wouldn't have bid 4@s over 4@c with the W hand... the vul is right.|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Berset comments on his clubsuit: nice hand in poker :)|pg||
nt|keylime:  I confess if the auction had gone 1@s (2@s) I would raise, and then think about it when South came back in with another bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: The reason I have bridge notes is that at my age I would forget otherwise.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 1NT 17-19|pg||
nt|rodal f: Back to the tr to @H and 1@H normaly tell 3cards. If 4 a jump til 2@H would have comed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baldfriede: But now we will have the change in leadeship|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|po-s: so much more comfortable when you see all the cards|pg||
nt|drewsky: Sabine, you are young amonst most of your peers|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|nigel: Poor play at trick one by North now 2@h should make|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcmax: We like to lead an unbid major vs NT, but some theories say that leading from Axxx is not a good idea when there are reasonable alternatives.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would have led @C3, but I am hopeless|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess I might have picked a spade tto although a heartnonce in a while|pg||
nt|lasseaa: its pick a minor|pg||

pc|d8|nt|janhamhurg: so any idea how you can beat a team like that??|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|drewsky: OUI, OUI, OUI|pg||
pc|dT|nt|po-s: French always lead fromxxx|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: last board of the match|pg||
nt|jcmax: Unless East bids 4NT next...|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps if East can double 4D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|baldfriede: North's opening definitely upgrades South's hand a lot.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, it is difficult to see how after that start|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Transferring into his major with 4@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: knowing there is a good fit and with a void in their suit, there is some reason for taking action|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Half on by a bid at N but did wice |pg||
mb|p|nt|drewsky: oops.....maybe now ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and was right sided too!|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: or after a spade lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcmax: Difficult for W. he is looking at great defence vs a @H contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  the bidding will not help the defence this time|pg||
nt|xenya: on any lead i think|pg||
nt|keylime:  yep|pg||
nt|rodal f: They know some IMPs are neded and therby Kvangraven went in box|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OR made same so fare|pg||
nt|lasseaa: with Bakke/Høylands defense, I put my money on a homerun|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR came a 3@S bid|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|keylime:  I suspect 2NT is a relay, 3@c either all minimums or 3 pc minimum|pg||
nt|rodal f: vent|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: There is a case for a 4@H response, pass or correct, if you don't want to hear about their minors, but maybe that would have made East bid 4NT on the way out|pg||
nt|jcmax: it didn't at the other table, though|pg||
nt|po-s: But not if 4H is natural to play|pg||
nt|drewsky: Most play 4@H is NOT pass/correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't know about "most"|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: I´d settle for many|pg||
nt|rodal f: I realy hope ure at ure home Lasse:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|nigel: Although it is not a success, I like the passive heart lead rather than a low club. Different to defending against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: Hi, how are you|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we say hi to Trond Hantveit:)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|drewsky: I believe that is standard to play that 4@C says ...treansfer me into your suit|pg||
nt|keylime:  and business is about to pick up here|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Ringseth and Ekren are enjoying this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2N asked what type of raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: Anyway, with this particular S hand you could be pretty sure partner would work out what you are doing even if 4@H was not pass or correct :)|pg||
mb|5S|an|.|mb|p|nt|lasseaa: this story have no happy ending|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was same bid til 4@CC|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Then I will ask Trond and Lasse what they would have didded after 3@H?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: bidded|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 4 clubs is OK, but then I would pass 4nt. partner has told you several times now that he has a minimum hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: West has no reason to continue pushing, as there is not estatblished a fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non to give there meanings. My bid would have been 4@H by single Q nearly 100 by 100 times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Trong u came:)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|keylime:  yep. some may term it as a "3rd suit forcing" style of raise. Quite rare to have 2NT as natural in this sequence|pg||
nt|hantveit: that is my second option, the problem with that bid is that you might lose the club fit. 4 clubs is last chance for partner wo wake up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Trond|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Drew, tell us why Multi is still a naughty word in ACBL land|pg||
nt|drewsky: If my agreement was not pass/correct, then I would afraid of missing my 6-6 spade fit if I bid 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: riding home on a crossruff wave|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sure- on any lead|pg||
nt|xenya: he has 5 hearts, 2 spades and 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|hantveit: ..to wake up..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hantveit: the pain will quickly go over here, when dummy arrives, you know you are down. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Came a interesting one from a spec. 3@S follwed by 4@C is quebid by @H and E should bid 4@H. Sence by that one two|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|po-s: the double might not have promised a sui, just lead directing|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hantveit: That depends on what you have agreed. If they play first find best game, then look for slam, 3spade is just asking for spade stopper.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|andyv:  I think out here they call it Rosenberg|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcmax: 7-6 you mean and the opps don't bid?|pg||
nt|keylime:  maybe what, 400, 800 here coming?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|drewsky: The ACBL frowns upon openings that can have more than one meaning|pg||
nt|drewsky: Sabine..I hold the record....I once bid exlusion blackwood and my partner had the same void as I did|pg||
