mb|1D|nt|kit: Likely 1@D opening and 2@S from East|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kit: 4@S is a lucky make with ace of clubs onside|pg||
nt|larrymori: still 4 losers|pg||

mb|d|mb|r|nt|kit: unless ace of clubs is ducked -- which it might well be|pg||

nt|sybarra: tourney web site |pg||
nt|peachy: and off we go, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: great misfit to begin with |pg||
nt|peachy: the tournament website did not have them unless I completely missed it|pg||
nt|hlortz: what do ew play? ns polish club for sure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peachy: The Youth tem is well placed in the current running score|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure - but I will knos some of their gadgeds - and spects will help me - I hope :):)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - He will sure risk 2 @S|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: however n/s do not play at speed of light (until the end of hand) |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and now?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well called peter|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||

nt|larrymori: a little light unfav with doubletons, and 5 card suit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|kit: And the overcall was effective, as it drove opponents one level too high|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||

nt|kit: Although it may be necessary for him to start the spades first|pg||
nt|larrymori: probably studying the @h spots too for that play|pg||
nt|kit: If he cashes a trump and then passes the jack of hearts, North will have to give up something.|pg||
nt|larrymori: he can do that without cashing a trump|pg||
nt|kit: yes he can, but he doesn't know the layout until he cashes the second trump|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: declarer may have deduced the bad diamond split when no trump return|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes so that gives more credence to ducking the @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems here, that 4 @H depends on the @C-suit|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3-loser hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible slam|pg||

nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: overcals in minor vuln sh normal be on 6 card suits - so S passed where mane clubplayers would bid 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
nt|hlortz: for sure vul too dangerous to overcall at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N take any action now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e., is it worth is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
nt|pelu: and prob @Ss bad for declayer - act 2@H down 1 - EW tahe the first 6 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  And defense can have some fun against 4 @S, when they play the 13th @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not updated after round 3 yet|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: think e will make exactly 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 losers  and no problem with ruffing @Ss|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||
nt|hlortz: s taps the dummy to shut out the long spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Brock's point of view I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  for standings after session 1|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|po-s: South should have cashed the HA if he had had it|pg||

nt|po-s: but club is no good since declarer can ruff high and throw a dia|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  But declarer should then guess, whether SouthÂ´s doubleton is Q or 10 |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c8|pc|d6|nt|jtr: How does 5@d do?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it doesn't seem like big result for EW - they could win 5@c|pg||

nt|sybarra: as I said earlier,  we will not be playing at speed of light (like the brazilians) |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|jtr: Looks like 11|pg||
nt|po-s: "cashing" the dia king would be disaster if you switch red aces in West|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Good old Irving Gordon, originally from Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I bet David played against him a few times|pg||
nt|jtr: And in teams with him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awfully good hand for a weak 2, if that is what it is|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red suits lie well for NS - for 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway well done by both sides as 4@H was cold|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S to the rescue|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: EW off the hook |pg||

nt|hlortz: yes e came in expecting the weak hand in south|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Oh - cancel|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why South volunteered a bid in front of partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: since 2@C can be garbage stayman, should the RDBL show more than when not using that treatment?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|kit: I guess they just never play 2@C redoubled|pg||
nt|larrymori: too much emphasis on garbage instead of some semi-inv hands with majors |pg||
