nt|xenya: expect it to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  3rd hand vul against not is a rarer place to open light|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S in OR amazing|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: funny result here from open|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|varange: who can help us out with the systems they play?|pg||
nt|po-s: Hej alla norrmän - East i closed må vare meget duktig|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Let's see if E/W will find 4@h here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, perhaps not ha-ha funny, but strange funny|pg||
nt|paulg:  i saw this next door and brogeland seemed to ask his partner to transfer to game ... and then gave him the option of playing it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|an|.|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: interesting- this hand might produce a big swing and will!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|baldfriede: Looks like they are on their way.|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that 2@s doesn't show support for the hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to tell if E has a good hand or not:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime:  At the other table, North began with an aggressive 3@c, and South was able to direct the spade lead for down 1.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|baldfriede: 3nt is of course an alternative.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: asking for @S check|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This should make with a few overtricks.|pg||
nt|varange: what to lead? Spade is unattractive.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C+1@H+2@D=top 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will cost blood, sweat and tears|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4@h will be easy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|varange: and having no entries, it is probably a good idea trying to find partner's long suit outside of spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: overtricks to follow-very friendly lay out of cards|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janhamhurg: about 2 off so 600 swing possible|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sQ|nt|varange: what would you lead from south?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: Closer to 3 off, maybe more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree so 500+300makes 13|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 4, if W continues trumps |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|keylime:  I'm from the classic school of preeempts, especially in 2nd seat.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: even in a context of strong club, the north opening bid seems a bid light|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and in a natural system its def to light|pg||

nt|varange: same here. also east has just clearly announced ownership of stoppers|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer played last hand way too fast|pg||
nt|keylime:  agreed. very much an autopilot type fo approach|pg||
mb|3S|nt|janhamhurg: spades hearts here, who will win the bidding?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|paulg:  a 5-card multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Will East show his majors?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|vugraphzec: ouch|pg||
nt|keylime:  If the defense can start spades quickly, this is going down a bit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|varange: i'm at a loss to see how they arrived in 2@s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to show both majors after the 1nt interference. So they found the Moysian only.|pg||
nt|varange: in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same sequence but transfer, I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|varange: John Carruthers suggests 1@c-1@d-1NT-DBL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible|pg||
nt|paulg:  stength according to vulnerability ... so no doubt what it is|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janhamhurg: a little too much, again the vuln game bonus makes them bid a lot|pg||
nt|paulg:  Presuming that South could have bid 3@h to show a good raise, I think North has overdone it a little|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janhamhurg: agree, the 2 spade call showed a decent hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|varange: would 2@c by east show the majors?|pg||
nt|varange: intersting.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: if double shows at least 5/4 in the majors I am all for it, but else...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|janhamhurg: so 2 off, east west gaining even more imps here|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding thin vulnerable games is fine if you only go down one, but costly when more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and there was a small chance to be doubled- so that could have been expensiv|pg||
pc|s9|nt|baldfriede: None of the possible continuations of South are to his liking.|pg||
nt|keylime:  at the other table, the auction was a bit more sedate; E did not open 3@d but competed after the spade fit was known|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|varange: 2@h initially looks to be OK, but has the slight blemish of not making, far as I can tell|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|varange: well, now makes|pg||

nt|andyv:  Dwayne, you agree with the xfer to 2@h by E?|pg||
nt|keylime:  there's a lot of schools of thought on transferring with that weak of a suit|pg||
nt|keylime:  I tend to look at my hand to see if I have some ruffing value to help declarer; in this instance, I would xfer due to A@c and two doubletons|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this hand it makes a little more sense since your only points are the Ace of @c... not exactly NT material |pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Ekren is thinking - the only operator-friendly player at the table :)|pg||
nt|keylime:  now if I had defensive values like QJT or KJx, then I let pard play it at 1NT knowing I have a slow playing hand|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|h7|nt|andyv:  safety play hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: If any would like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|2C|nt|drewsky: I think it also matters what minor the oppopnents open relative to your length in their minor as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 3H by West?|pg||
nt|Rafa: Winner here represents Norway in the European Champions Cup in November|pg||
nt|drewsky: At the other table, west opened north's 5 card minor, so a delayed takeout double of hearts was not to be considered|pg||
nt|jcmax: The cards lie very favourably for EW and exactly where you wwould expect them to be with this bidding. But does W have enough to drive to game?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 dia transfer|pg||
nt|keylime:  3NT down off the hop so to avoid it will score well|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: good raise is my guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: 2 hearts showing 4 |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least forcing:)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jcmax: I don't think so, after all partner only balanced|pg||
nt|jcmax: But maybe E feels he is not minimum?|pg||
nt|po-s: so does West hav a good enough hand?|pg||
nt|po-s: West could have just raised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, 3@H is a serious raise|pg||
nt|drewsky: Certainly the west hand is worth more than a simple raise to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: fine bidding here- no 3 heart bid with only 8 trumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c on NS. have to bid this to pick up some IMPs|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW can get a hard time to beat 3NTNS. But them to bid it....|pg||
mb|4C|nt|po-s: exactly Drew|pg||
nt|jcmax: E would like to bid something in between 3@S and 3@H really. He took the optimistic view. Well done!|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|andyv:  ok, now this is suicide|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: which is why East could try four|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|paulg:  South almost certainly has a 12-14 balanced hand on the auction, so not even tempting for North|pg||
nt|rodal f: U ended up by the contract Ralf:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|keylime:  the dreaded mirror distribution hands|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|po-s: yes, he could have tried 3H - maybe they won´t notice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But our operator would|pg||
nt|drewsky: A lot depends on the range of a balance....East could have as little as 10 HCP or as much as 15|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a better contract than 4@s in OR in my opinion|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: do you agree Frank?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|janhamhurg: right, but how often we see those 3 heart bids?|pg||

mb|p|nt|drewsky: Esat west can make 5@D, but I doubt they can get into teh bidding|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: game noth south here with open cards|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: last board of the match|pg||
nt|jcmax: Unless East bids 4NT next...|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps if East can double 4D|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: North's opening definitely upgrades South's hand a lot.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, it is difficult to see how after that start|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Transferring into his major with 4@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: knowing there is a good fit and with a void in their suit, there is some reason for taking action|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Half on by a bid at N but did wice |pg||
pc|hT|nt|drewsky: oops.....maybe now ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and was right sided too!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|janhamhurg: or after a spade lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcmax: Difficult for W. he is looking at great defence vs a @H contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  the bidding will not help the defence this time|pg||
nt|xenya: on any lead i think|pg||
nt|keylime:  yep|pg||
nt|rodal f: They know some IMPs are neded and therby Kvangraven went in box|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|keylime:  I suspect 2NT is a relay, 3@c either all minimums or 3 pc minimum|pg||
nt|rodal f: vent|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a case for a 4@H response, pass or correct, if you don't want to hear about their minors, but maybe that would have made East bid 4NT on the way out|pg||
nt|jcmax: it didn't at the other table, though|pg||
nt|po-s: But not if 4H is natural to play|pg||
nt|drewsky: Most play 4@H is NOT pass/correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't know about "most"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|po-s: I´d settle for many|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nigel: Although it is not a success, I like the passive heart lead rather than a low club. Different to defending against 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|drewsky: I believe that is standard to play that 4@C says ...treansfer me into your suit|pg||
nt|keylime:  and business is about to pick up here|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Ringseth and Ekren are enjoying this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2N asked what type of raise|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcmax: Anyway, with this particular S hand you could be pretty sure partner would work out what you are doing even if 4@H was not pass or correct :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d9|nt|keylime:  yep. some may term it as a "3rd suit forcing" style of raise. Quite rare to have 2NT as natural in this sequence|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Drew, tell us why Multi is still a naughty word in ACBL land|pg||
nt|drewsky: If my agreement was not pass/correct, then I would afraid of missing my 6-6 spade fit if I bid 4@H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|baldfriede: riding home on a crossruff wave|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sure- on any lead|pg||
nt|xenya: he has 5 hearts, 2 spades and 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|po-s: the double might not have promised a sui, just lead directing|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  I think out here they call it Rosenberg|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcmax: 7-6 you mean and the opps don't bid?|pg||
nt|keylime:  maybe what, 400, 800 here coming?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|drewsky: The ACBL frowns upon openings that can have more than one meaning|pg||
nt|drewsky: Sabine..I hold the record....I once bid exlusion blackwood and my partner had the same void as I did|pg||
nt|po-s: it frowns upon most things which werent invented there|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
