nt|xenya: expect it to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  3rd hand vul against not is a rarer place to open light|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S in OR amazing|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: funny result here from open|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|varange: who can help us out with the systems they play?|pg||
nt|po-s: Hej alla norrmän - East i closed må vare meget duktig|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Let's see if E/W will find 4@h here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, perhaps not ha-ha funny, but strange funny|pg||
nt|paulg:  i saw this next door and brogeland seemed to ask his partner to transfer to game ... and then gave him the option of playing it|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: interesting- this hand might produce a big swing and will!|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Looks like they are on their way.|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that 2@s doesn't show support for the hearts|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  hard to tell if E has a good hand or not:)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|keylime:  At the other table, North began with an aggressive 3@c, and South was able to direct the spade lead for down 1.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt is of course an alternative.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: asking for @S check|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This should make with a few overtricks.|pg||
nt|varange: what to lead? Spade is unattractive.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C+1@H+2@D=top 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will cost blood, sweat and tears|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4@h will be easy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|varange: and having no entries, it is probably a good idea trying to find partner's long suit outside of spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: overtricks to follow-very friendly lay out of cards|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: about 2 off so 600 swing possible|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|varange: what would you lead from south?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Closer to 3 off, maybe more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree so 500+300makes 13|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 4, if W continues trumps |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|keylime:  I'm from the classic school of preeempts, especially in 2nd seat.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|janhamhurg: even in a context of strong club, the north opening bid seems a bid light|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and in a natural system its def to light|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: just my opinion though|pg||

nt|varange: same here. also east has just clearly announced ownership of stoppers|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer played last hand way too fast|pg||
nt|keylime:  agreed. very much an autopilot type fo approach|pg||
mb|3D|nt|janhamhurg: spades hearts here, who will win the bidding?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  a 5-card multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Will East show his majors?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|vugraphzec: ouch|pg||
nt|keylime:  If the defense can start spades quickly, this is going down a bit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|varange: i'm at a loss to see how they arrived in 2@s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to show both majors after the 1nt interference. So they found the Moysian only.|pg||
nt|varange: in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same sequence but transfer, I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|varange: John Carruthers suggests 1@c-1@d-1NT-DBL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible|pg||
nt|paulg:  stength according to vulnerability ... so no doubt what it is|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janhamhurg: a little too much, again the vuln game bonus makes them bid a lot|pg||
nt|paulg:  Presuming that South could have bid 3@h to show a good raise, I think North has overdone it a little|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|janhamhurg: agree, the 2 spade call showed a decent hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|varange: would 2@c by east show the majors?|pg||
nt|varange: intersting.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: if double shows at least 5/4 in the majors I am all for it, but else...|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d2|pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|janhamhurg: so 2 off, east west gaining even more imps here|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding thin vulnerable games is fine if you only go down one, but costly when more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and there was a small chance to be doubled- so that could have been expensiv|pg||
mc|6|nt|baldfriede: None of the possible continuations of South are to his liking.|pg||
nt|keylime:  at the other table, the auction was a bit more sedate; E did not open 3@d but competed after the spade fit was known|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@C enterprising opposite a possible two-card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: East took the push.  Must have rather solid overcalling style|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: unless it shows both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the advantage is that East has no cue available below the game level|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes, forced a decision on East|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|varange: I gtg. See you all.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think West played East for cards. With that square of hand, there would be no reason to really bid that way|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|baldfriede: N/s will likely end in 4@s here.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h splinter bid now?|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially over a 1st seat NV vs. VUL preempt|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if E had th ideal hand, 8 tricks would be the max one could expect in NT with the W hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|keylime:  and we both know, pard never has what we need, when we need it|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|janhamhurg: 12 tricks is a lot here 10 or 11 seem to be normal|pg||
nt|xenya: a trivial 3N|pg||
nt|paulg:  you see that they made 12 tricks in the other room and you think this will be a chance ... but then you see only Roland would bid it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|drewsky: West should return a club in case declarer has AKQ of @D...in order to remove the entry to dummy|pg||
nt|po-s: rarely do I get enough for 3NT over preempts (just have to bid them anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: would he|pg||

pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: well, there are risks involved, but there are also risks in passing|pg||
nt|othered1: The fight might end right there in 2@HX|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|drorp: i thought that in the aggressive scandinavian bridge, N would double :)|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|paulg:  these are not the hands you need when well behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@H not a bad contract but to bid would require some bidding|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I'd prefer 2@c overcall to a dounle|pg||
nt|baldfriede: double*|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no values for a DBL-VUL|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, he could make 12 but had to cash 13th @D first squeezing W out of a winner|pg||
mb|2H|nt|baldfriede: Hm, 2@s alerted. Does it mean both majors and game try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: no knowledge unless the partnership has some agreement|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: if W had to bid could bid 3@C and 4@H was on|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: ut West shouuld have led a @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: top 10 tricks|pg||
nt|keylime:  alert shift there to prevent the discard on the long diamond there|pg||
nt|andyv:  Dwayne, you agree with the xfer to 2@h by E?|pg||
nt|keylime:  there's a lot of schools of thought on transferring with that weak of a suit|pg||
nt|keylime:  I tend to look at my hand to see if I have some ruffing value to help declarer; in this instance, I would xfer due to A@c and two doubletons|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this hand it makes a little more sense since your only points are the Ace of @c... not exactly NT material |pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Ekren is thinking - the only operator-friendly player at the table :)|pg||
nt|keylime:  now if I had defensive values like QJT or KJx, then I let pard play it at 1NT knowing I have a slow playing hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  how much did you pay him, Lors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|baldfriede: Yes, now they have it.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But we have three world champions at this table, so the bridge should be good|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|paulg:  the ability to make these ambiguous jumps to game, that can be weak or strong, is an oft-missed advantage of strong club systems|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|keylime:  For the kibitzers, consider this hand in context: xxx xxxxx xx Kx, and ask pard if over a strong NT, if he/she would want a xfer. A good discussion piece.|pg||

nt|jcmax: hope to make a t/o double of hearts later.|pg||
nt|paulg:  first IMPs on the board, but it's a long way back|pg||
nt|xenya: GIB might help too|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|paulg:  i play 2@c as natural over a 1@c opener, but be nice to play 3@c as natural here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|janhamhurg: may be 2 heart is making here|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|drewsky: I think it also matters what minor the oppopnents open relative to your length in their minor as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 3H by West?|pg||
nt|Rafa: Winner here represents Norway in the European Champions Cup in November|pg||
nt|drewsky: At the other table, west opened north's 5 card minor, so a delayed takeout double of hearts was not to be considered|pg||
nt|jcmax: The cards lie very favourably for EW and exactly where you wwould expect them to be with this bidding. But does W have enough to drive to game?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 dia transfer|pg||
nt|keylime:  3NT down off the hop so to avoid it will score well|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: good raise is my guess|pg||
mb|3C|nt|janhamhurg: 2 hearts showing 4 |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least forcing:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I don't think so, after all partner only balanced|pg||
nt|jcmax: But maybe E feels he is not minimum?|pg||
nt|po-s: so does West hav a good enough hand?|pg||
nt|po-s: West could have just raised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, 3@H is a serious raise|pg||
nt|drewsky: Certainly the west hand is worth more than a simple raise to 3@S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: fine bidding here- no 3 heart bid with only 8 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: exactly Drew|pg||
nt|jcmax: E would like to bid something in between 3@S and 3@H really. He took the optimistic view. Well done!|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  ok, now this is suicide|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|po-s: which is why East could try four|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|paulg:  South almost certainly has a 12-14 balanced hand on the auction, so not even tempting for North|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|keylime:  the dreaded mirror distribution hands|pg||
pc|hK|nt|po-s: yes, he could have tried 3H - maybe they won´t notice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But our operator would|pg||
nt|drewsky: A lot depends on the range of a balance....East could have as little as 10 HCP or as much as 15|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: right, but how often we see those 3 heart bids?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c2|pc|d9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|xenya: fairly often i think|pg||

mc|7|nt|drewsky: Dangerous line of play is @Ds are 4-1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Misguessed diamonds after that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is a problem in 5@D, now.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still needs to ruff two spades, which leaves K10 of diamonds in dummy|pg||
nt|drorp: a kib points out that he has to hook the diamond at the 1st diamond trick, or else he can't ruff 2 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the Buffalo Sabres are on *the* edge. Nice to know, thanks|pg||
nt|othered1: But is ruffing 2@S the only winning line?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|drorp: has to ruff 2 spades, now that he has 2 discards it doesn't matter to establish them, but has to ruff 2 of them and complete a cross ruff|pg||

nt|keylime:  he doesn't know South has the 5@d stiff|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|jcmax: Only certain match considerations would make that possible I guess. Let's say you feel you need a swing on the last board in order to win or you are behind a lot in a long match at ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|baldfriede: North's opening definitely upgrades South's hand a lot.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, it is difficult to see how after that start|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Transferring into his major with 4@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|janhamhurg: or after a spade lead|pg||

nt|xenya: on any lead i think|pg||
nt|keylime:  yep|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|keylime:  I suspect 2NT is a relay, 3@c either all minimums or 3 pc minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: There is a case for a 4@H response, pass or correct, if you don't want to hear about their minors, but maybe that would have made East bid 4NT on the way out|pg||
nt|jcmax: it didn't at the other table, though|pg||
nt|po-s: But not if 4H is natural to play|pg||
nt|drewsky: Most play 4@H is NOT pass/correct|pg||

mb|r|nt|po-s: I´d settle for many|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drewsky: I believe that is standard to play that 4@C says ...treansfer me into your suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzec: Ringseth and Ekren are enjoying this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2N asked what type of raise|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|keylime:  yep. some may term it as a "3rd suit forcing" style of raise. Quite rare to have 2NT as natural in this sequence|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe 3@H to show 5-5. Not sure if they play that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: One team I play in has a strict rule - if you go one down in a freely-bid 5M, you and your partenr have to buy all other team-members a drink  |pg||
