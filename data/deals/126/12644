nt|sharkey: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-card majors, strong NT for E-W I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the Czechs, we shall see|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S appears to be the limit EW can make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If it goes 1NT-Pass-Pass, has West enough for a bid?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: NV today - probably...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah well, doesn't apply today|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS may be playing Weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Not sure I agree with S here... - Pass seems timid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Probably North showed 1+ (or even 0+) diamonds.  Hence the pass|pg||
mb|d!|mb|2D!|nt|sharkey: Or Max 1@D?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dbl showing 15-17 NT I assume|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Not sure why bother view Pd's pass|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Liz McGowan|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning, everybody|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: Well, what are the bookmaker's odds on this contract?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some endplays possibilities here|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: Declarer ruffs out all the diamonds, whilst drawing trumps.  Leads a club, and ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Should make after @DA @S@S and @C S endplayed|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - Ruff @D first of course|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Takes an unlikely club lead and ruff to beat it?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Too late...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Transnational teams they are. World Youth from Czech Republic and Japan, Canukusa from England, Canada and USA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps.  It looks like 2 endplays may be required to make this|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree Liz @C opening lead and subsequent ruff will do|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But we would all lead @DA :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: First you endplay South in clubs (he must lead a heart ... to the 10 and queen).  Then you endplay North in clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now we are in a different, equally interesting track|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whoever leads small @C from N has either peeked or is in a class of his own|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not updated after round 3 yet|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - these teams have 39 & 33 VPs after two rounds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Funny, declarer is still in a position to eliminate diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If South cashes @CA and leads a diamond?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ruff, and play a heart to the queen, ruff the last diamond, and now a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Satoshi Imai from Japan|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D without cashing @C A is suggested|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What a truly weird hand this is|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: Ruff, play a club|pg||
nt|kakasi: hello |pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: Hi Satoshi|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And now the defence can beat it ... but they must be absollutely precise|pg||
nt|bjacobs: diamond, club, heart|pg||
nt|bjacobs: club|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bakhshi played with Andrew Robson for several years - he cannot quite emulate his speed but he tries|pg||
nt|sharkey: Had to ruff - new @C - ruff @D and new @C and wud make I think|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bakhshi also played with Forrester|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: New strong partnership in England: David Gold - Tony Forrester. Tom Townsend moved to Poland|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: Well, they played a bit of ping-pong.  That's real life bridge for you.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This would be one of the more complex play/defence hands you will see|pg||
nt|sharkey: S failed to lead @H to pd - now making|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Declarer usually favourite in these - harder for the defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||

pc|h5|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h6|mc|9|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 11/12 - 14 I presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here we see the pre-emptive power of the weak 1NT ... E/W has lost their spade fit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks like it - 5-card major and all - may work well here|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: W had a chance - NV - maybe he should have ventured...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wouldn't|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a tough call.  I think few would take a bid with that West hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: N will bid game VUL|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5332 does not generally profit from bidding over 1NT|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The 5th heart was enough for Macura to accept|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: A far from minimum hand :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|sharkey: In CR S opened 1@H which made for a convenient 1@S overcall by W|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Somewaht surprised N didnt bid game - considering the VUL bonus at IMPs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This really is a perfect example of the upside and downside of the weak 1NT.  At these colours, that opening could be penalized about a squillion points|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But in fact, it brings in an 8 imp swing|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||

nt|po-s: "cashing" the dia king would be disaster if you switch red aces in West|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|cuttysark: So it should be - your competitive style had to be different over a suit that isn't 'real'|pg||

pc|s8|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: something seems to have happened to the website - board scores disconnected|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably sitting down however|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore in @s for EW|pg||

nt|peachy: Here is today's bulletin, editors Barry Rigal and Rich Colker -  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec2010_data/bulletins/blt1.pdf|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|marlowepi: very likely that 3N makes but 4H does not (or that both do)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|chick: I dunno about that, E had only one club stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  could be too high (if NS find @h ruff) |pg||
nt|kakasi: Iy[ [ÌûÖBBO©çÌ¨mç¹Å·G@@]Tª êÎAêxEBhEðÂ¶ÄAà¤êxJ«A»ÌÌ¿âÉYESÆ¦Ä­¾³¢ÆÌ±ÆÅ·B|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|peachy: nice fillers and suit in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, that 5-level again|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I agree...!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks, kakasi explaining what to do for the operator in Japanese|pg||
nt|kakasi: I[v[ÌÊð\¦·é½ßÅ·B|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||
nt|peachy: 9 count and support|pg||
nt|po-s: will East be satisfied with 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: 4C|pg||
mb|4C|nt|po-s: or 6? no..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C looks fine|pg||
nt|po-s: he won´t get much cooperation I think - well maybe 4D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: bidding 2N does not rule out getting to 3H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: 4H|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  now it's 5 more imps for NANIWADA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hlortz: 200 52/58 so far|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: ah, scores are back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Healthy lead Sandqvist-McIntosh have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But much can still happen in an uneven field|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any views on 2@S there/|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, this event seems to revolve around how well you kill the less experienced pairs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon it's a bit quacky |pg||
nt|hlortz: i dislike the ambiguity of 2@S limit *or better*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Being in the right place at the right time|pg||
nt|jtr: That too|pg||
nt|chick: the other table bid 6@D but made it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|peachy: then it was lucky they DID bid it, the loss would have been significant|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d2|pc|h8|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: After a rash of part score hands we have hit the game zone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should East just rightside 3NT rather than let partner play it after lebensohl?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: I assume Lebensohl enabled both tables to rightside this 3 NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Make up your minds|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Please - you make them up for us :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: Certainly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The right side for this 3NT is the E/W side|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: yes  indeed - may be problemsa after Still wud make vs @D lead I think|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry|pg||
nt|sharkey: problems after @D lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The advantage of East playing it is if South has Kx or Qx in spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The disadvantage of East playing it is if South has a strong minor to lead|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the CR, I see John Carruthers put @CK under @CA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could that be an operator error?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think so.  2 rounds of spades had been played, JC thought he'd be endplayed with @CK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: it would certainly make the contract easier to make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is gonna go down to the wire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer has 8 clear tricks |pg||
pc|c5|pc|d5|nt|sharkey: @C now will divulge N has 9 black cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: South may have to make 3 pitches.  It may be necessary for him to pitch @DKQ!!!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One thing is sure - the play will take some time|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: If South doesn't keep an exit card, he can be endplayed|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Has to pitch @D else @H set up|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's the play on @SA (if it's played) that's key|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if he wins the second diamond, he's endplayed.  He has to keep a LOW Diamond|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is the key point|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: Oh wonderful!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: and perhaps pitch a minor suit king under an ace - JC was nearly right|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Is Barry Rigal here?  This is DEFINITELY a hand for the bulletin|pg||

nt|sybarra: making way too many here...   wonder why no @S return |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, even 6 |pg||
nt|peachy: interesting hand here, we'll see how the players deal with it|pg||
nt|po-s: who is Vondracek (was hoping sombody else wd ask)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|jbgood: why is that, Henry?|pg||
nt|peachy: S is strong enough to open naturally, with longest suit, follow up with diamonds twice|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, interesting. as for me, I hate hands like S's - points in short honours and main suit (@c) w/o controls |pg||
nt|peachy: hah, if gets a chance...|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  E will give a hand|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: major suit cards placedbadly for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H??!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  time for W to show big fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open room have finished by now|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jtr: Great bid:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is N a chicken?|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, I would just bid 3D, 3S sounds too weak|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps 3S is their sys|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester makes no other|pg||
nt|po-s: will East comply - Lebensohl probably|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S is a good bid - for E/W, now East waill avoi the @D-lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: no double from South, slightly surprising|pg||
nt|jbgood: point taken|pg||
nt|po-s: doubledummy on a spade lead ducked and another spade...|pg||
nt|po-s: give up a club and a diamond, then throw South in at the end for a heart favor|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Strange decision - West has the hand for bidding 4 @S|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose the operator will catch up with comparisons when has a chance|pg||

nt|po-s: fashion|pg||
nt|po-s: DJ isn´t very good either, is it|pg||
nt|xenya: it is not|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: EW are adopting the NS strategy of self-destruction :(|pg||
nt|peachy: bit score relief for Naniwada now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6 more imps for NANIWADA |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|po-s: so it leaves a club or a heart|pg||
nt|xenya: complex hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|hawe45:  Very bad lead this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure about result on 10, but before it was 22-17|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Now Herman just needs to find Forrester's entry to get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Keep looking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: little does he know it's in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he must have one after 3@H without A and Q, right?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North had no good lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although he might suspect it |pg||
nt|po-s: this way is no good though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: maybe the @CA and another would have been better?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East just wanted to se the @H-signals from N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Unblock...|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps nothing is lost yet|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Voila they say in France|pg||
pc|cT|nt|po-s: but now North can break communications should declarer duck the diamond|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: Bas really didn't want a ruff, I think he was trying for a lead not to give a trick or something|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to be around average     double for north might have gain quite a bit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht can happily keep the @HK8 over dummy's @HQ7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d8|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|chick: I would think a higher club from W would make it clearer for partner to return @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Endplay for overtrick instead|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|peachy: Bob Drijver, sorry|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: seems it's a good thing (for EW) that W's hand is closed|pg||

nt|chick: a nice reverse into 2@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17:13 in Japan now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: a VERY lucky 3N...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: nice fit|pg||
nt|chick: at least they got into a makeable game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, might|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: nice judgment by Merijn Groenenboom|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I expect a flat board, losing 1 spade, 1 heart and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: theygot there anyway, at least|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||
nt|po-s: this time the hearts behave. You need to guess how to treat diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|peachy: our predictions havent really fetched tonightm have they Sveta :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  u r right, Raija|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: and he got that wrong|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: There will be a few in slam on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: may make 12 now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cT|pc|h9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|jbgood: but will be happy with 11|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: seems a big play not finessing the @s and taking 11|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: east can get most of the match points if entering with A@H   cashing dimonds and finessing 10@C     |pg||
nt|peachy: then opps have more and they wont lie silent|pg||
nt|peachy: the 1pt hand was squeezed, beautiful!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but no more problem now - u r right again - overtrick|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: on track for a push|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: deserved it i think -- i don't see why you should bid up to 3N on these hands|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - not qq but 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they have 18 HCP and no fit, and have already bid once|pg||
nt|peachy: even if it was pseudo|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: and are vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And Barry Rigal pointed out that since you also need other suits to break, you are happy to play for diamonds 3-3, in which case the double finesse is definitely indicated|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Final hand here, and I would like to thank our operator for another superb job|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|6|nt|bjacobs: And many thanks also to Liz and Carl (and Roland earlier) for the excellent commentary|pg||

nt|po-s: makes|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2: Will this be the flattest of flat 4@S's I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably not|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S for n/s    west will need to lead clubs to hold to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: some wont bid game perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: why should it be flat   not all will lead a club|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you everyone, was a pleasure to keep company with you all, incl kibitsers!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph! |pg||

nt|peachy: Last board now, thank you to Japan Contract Bridge League, BBO, and our Roland Wald, for bringing this event to vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: if it's customary for NS to open that light, they must have some machinery to let them stop low |pg||
nt|po-s: and if in 2NT you still need to ddo the right thing in D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's true|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: and not all bid what we think they should:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Not when South bids them|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!  We love you  @H@Hh|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our appreciation to the JCBL for ensuring that this prestigious event is brought to BBO. Akito Omasa has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||

nt|po-s: --and spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: i think most will be in game|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks to Japan Contract Bridge League and BBO for bringing this prestigious event on vugraph. Thanks to Roland Wald for his ongoing work to keep the vugrraphs staffed.  And thanks ...|pg||
nt|peachy: to Sveta Bodrenkova for her company and ecellent analysis.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  they managed to reach it - hope, W make it, too |pg||
nt|peachy: Here is the tournament website http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Oh - new plansRight spot - they played the same system...|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a reasonable bet, neeed clubs to behave|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perhaps Drijver thought that 3@C implied heart fit|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: just under an hour|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - needs onle @S-suit 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  only|pg||
nt|peachy: I thought about that. Many play fit jumps by PH|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-switch is bad - tka this trick|pg||
nt|hawe45:  take|pg||
nt|peachy: he will figure it out.  Must take|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He might as well; he knows spades are 4-4 after the lead, no?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a fast duck in @CÂ´s from West very soon - and we shall wee|pg||
nt|hawe45:  see|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but you need less luck in 2N and you won't go down 3 vulnerable |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|jbgood: nothing but clubs to lead..|pg||

nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s better than the finesse|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|peachy: better get the hearts going|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: Yes, awkward|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great recovery by the Dutch who were 0-16 doesn at some point|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|xenya: the fact that 1N might fail doesn't mean that you have to bid 3N|pg||
