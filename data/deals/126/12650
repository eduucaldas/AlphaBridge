nt|peachy: and off we go, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: great misfit to begin with |pg||
nt|peachy: the tournament website did not have them unless I completely missed it|pg||
nt|hlortz: what do ew play? ns polish club for sure|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|peachy: The Youth tem is well placed in the current running score|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure - but I will knos some of their gadgeds - and spects will help me - I hope :):)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, to watch the 6th qualifying Match from Yokohama|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NEC Bridge Festifal|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - He will sure risk 2 @S|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: however n/s do not play at speed of light (until the end of hand) |pg||
mb|r|nt|peachy: The tournament website for those interested, scores from Match 5 are not yet there but will sonn I'm sure http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and now?|pg||
nt|peachy: esciting hand, afteralll|pg||
mb|2D|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oh well, cant spell|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well called peter|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|peachy: W got worried and pulled|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may accept the invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Yokohama. hi to all|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: now should go down, he doesnt have the ricks any more|pg||

pc|d8|pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: this is not going well at all for the declarer|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hlortz: sry to be late hello all|pg||
nt|othered1: One way to stay out of @S :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D!|nt|fabsayc: might get to 3NT NS now which will make easily|pg||
nt|hlortz: picked off the opponents' 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|larrymori: it will make with the @hs not running, the 9 is big|pg||
nt|othered1: Having gotten @H into the auctiojn  ( I think), not easy to play 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well south has a 3NT bid i think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|larrymori: can start with X and south can bid it, guess not|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|hlortz: right. @H block but NS dont know that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|othered1: "The law" implies south has a trivial pass of 2@HX, but north isn't fully law-abiding |pg||

mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||

nt|sybarra: this may go all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: overcals in minor vuln sh normal be on 6 card suits - so S passed where mane clubplayers would bid 2@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
nt|hlortz: for sure vul too dangerous to overcall at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N take any action now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e., is it worth is?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
nt|pelu: and prob @Ss bad for declayer - act 2@H down 1 - EW tahe the first 6 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And defense can have some fun against 4 @S, when they play the 13th @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not updated after round 3 yet|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: think e will make exactly 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 losers  and no problem with ruffing @Ss|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||
nt|hlortz: s taps the dummy to shut out the long spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Brock's point of view I mean|pg||

nt|hawe45:  East should continue trump!|pg||
nt|pelu: also almost standard in denmark|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: instead, Beauty picked up 5 IMPs for missing game when the Latin played in a weird 4-2 spade fit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hlortz: ah i see not common in USA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|po-s: South should have cashed the HA if he had had it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  AActually South should have played the @D King maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: but club is no good since declarer can ruff high and throw a dia|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But declarer should then guess, whether SouthÂ´s doubleton is Q or 10 |pg||
pc|h9|pc|s4|nt|dburn: there ought to be a Law against doing that...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jtr: How does 5@d do?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sfoxa:  it doesn't seem like big result for EW - they could win 5@c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: N may hop q here |pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said earlier,  we will not be playing at speed of light (like the brazilians) |pg||
pc|dK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like 11|pg||
nt|po-s: "cashing" the dia king would be disaster if you switch red aces in West|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: @C continuation might have allowed declarer to get out for -1 -- a @H is asfe for 2 off|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: here David, here's the box, step on it and shout :)|pg||
nt|peachy: curiously enough, EW had 4H making, if I saw correctly in this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2N vul against not has limited appeal|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure Scotland wasnt joined to europe when he was there:)|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to overcall, perhaps on the basis that his hand is too good - immediate overcalls destructive in nature|pg||
nt|peachy: nt apparent;ly 16-18 or something|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S to the rescue|pg||

nt|hawe45:  OK - welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: I see we have a strong match going here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|xenya: too well perhaps|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  But now the @C-guess will decide - and East will fix it|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: not on a club opening lead she couldnt|pg||
nt|peachy: not opening lead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jtr: What do we think of West's 2NT though?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S should have played trumps from the very beginning|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1D response showed four+hearts, 2C was puppet to 2D and 2S inviting with four|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK - not much the defenders can do to hurt him since he has one spade trick and two of each|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|nt|peachy: Might have been wise to cash HA, it could disappear on the club|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: hes got 7|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|jtr: at red facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too aggressive at these colours|pg||
pc|s5|nt|po-s: 1C was a weak NT or clubs - didn´t know "my" system had spread that far east|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|jtr: Very polite Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much, at these colours, and pard a passed hand  |pg||
nt|hlortz: vul not to my taste to easy to go -200 - or more|pg||
nt|jbgood: served its purpose: getting a plus score|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jtr: Yes fair point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it did, but it possibly should not have done|pg||
nt|jtr: If you dont give decisions the opponents dont have the opportunity for mistakes|pg||
nt|jbgood: agree, S's 3 @s was uncalled for|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe West called for it?:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: ah, now can endplay|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  more imps for Kitty's|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: if dares|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  South had 2 @D - North 5.... |pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto probably hard counting everything|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North made a smart discard with the @D Queen, looking like a man keeping to the other suits!|pg||
nt|peachy: however, teramoto knows north has the last diamond|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  All counts for the finesse -. and 620|pg||
nt|peachy: well done|pg||
nt|po-s: btw, when does it stop to be "east" and becomes west?|pg||

nt|othered1: Then, I guess, 1@S might have been an option for north's rebid?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|hlortz: i'd give up in 1@H personally.|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes, protects the @h position, but the hand has gone down in value, I would have passed, pard did not X or supp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N = 15-17    West hand looks very close to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Then you actually play 14+ to 17|pg||
nt|larrymori: move the J into the @ds|pg||

nt|othered1: Then do you describe your 1N as "15-17 K&R Points"?|pg||
nt|hlortz: meanwhile both ew pairs did well to reach 4@S here. with 9 opposite 15.55 :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|larrymori: the @d bid helped and positionally the hand is good|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: right, with east making the aggressive decision at both tables.|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes the @H K like an ace|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||

nt|othered1: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|larrymori: if west were looking at 3 small @hs, he might have passed|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|larrymori: i think he has to play for 32 trumps, another @d and he is down with the uppercut|pg||

nt|Walddk2: EW 2@H perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see losers here|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 2 the overcall of 2 @C pushed e/w to 3 @D -1 |pg||
nt|hlortz: 3n here for ns will they bid it?|pg||
nt|dburn: he needed to, for some reason - not quite sure what that was all about|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - he went up with the jack on the first round of hearts|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|marlowepi: likely 3S by S|pg||
nt|dburn: but I don't have much idea why he did that, with K9x in his hand|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was a case of "monkey fell from tree"|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: this alert?  is it "could be 2" |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe playing for West to have @h10x and no entry, but that seems a bit of a view|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  Still no game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not everybodyÂ´ s taste that 2 NT - facing a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|peachy: if S doesnt bid them now, the S willl be lost forever|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: anyone X 1@H with south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no thin double by South|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 cards suits?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh yes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  strange 1N... even if playing 4 card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: JC doesn´t quite believe the explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: prob same as open rm|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N takes the push to 3...faster than I could type|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  why not a simple raise?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow aggressive double|pg||
nt|jtr: Just right at MPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in their lucky day EW win @s game|pg||
nt|peachy: good start, W raised|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main problem - to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: lose 2h and 3s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: good decision by West here - that raise wasn't automatic|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm unfamiliar with ew system, for me raise would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|peachy: they did well|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: sounds like penalties, with good hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: Aiming for the KOD Roland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S probably wanted to dbl the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going for the KOD is tempting at MP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KOD = Kiss of Death|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead - only a @S could give S some problems|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hlortz: aka 200|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -200 at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead was better, and logical on the auction and the W hand|pg||
nt|chick: kind of a waste of the 10|pg||
nt|peachy: its cold, dont think any lead woulda caused a prob|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|pelu: wrong J by pd - and he has 3 of them :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: and on board 18 West kept NS out of 4@s by opening 1@s on five low and a pile of dingo's kidneys|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  and should get it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not 500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 25 3@S-1 was above average for NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: total waste|pg||
nt|chick: although I guess a pitch on the J doesn't do much|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|po-s: trump I think,  knowing that South has a good number of hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: not about pitch, about how many clubs nead to be ruffed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as it was proved next door |pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: penalties ranged from 1400 (4Nx-5 EW) to 800 (4Hx-3 NS)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now you can make an overtrickm playing on @C|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|pelu: how do u play on a @s-lead?? - can u make 3NT? |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  Oh - no entry any longer|pg||
nt|pelu: prob on an endplay of West?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: it could be beaten double dummy -- @H lead, A, @H ruff, underlead @Cs, another @H ruff -- and there is another trick for the defence -- but now it makes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: you could from the beginning but why bother too much, IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: so that was 11 IMPs to The Latin, who usually make a good showing in this tournament|pg||

nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in Central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S-guess is worth 1 IMP here|pg||

nt|tez: 1@c opening means..nat or 16+any hand..polish club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I agree with 5 @H |pg||
nt|dburn: I neither - they were 19th in the standings after four rounds, but not sure what they did in their last match|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts n/s in a spot quickly |pg||
nt|tez: bid or not to bid..pass is not forcing i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: for all N knows,  S may have no clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5NT? = I can play slam in 2 suits?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if they are up against The Latin their results can't have been bad|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Some will not even be in a grand slam. Just wait and see|pg||
nt|po-s: which it probably ewas|pg||
nt|xenya: on 18, EW in the other room didn't find the 4@S save -- 8 imps to World Youth|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the X shows @S or just cards?|pg||

nt|tez: 6 enuf:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: he will bid pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree  but S has to like his hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@d by S seems to make things easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @d suit most likely the one in question |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: at least 3@c gets some strength across i imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: to Zmud|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be at sprint speed of play |pg||

nt|tez: and also 7@s..then:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (when he decides play) |pg||
nt|dburn: looks like strong club for both pairs, given that 1@d opening|pg||

nt|peachy: i'm sure that is correct|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: KC is even better|pg||

nt|peachy: make, prob with overtrick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: 4@H?! That will make|pg||

nt|peachy: nice switch|pg||

nt|peachy: he has a cost free chance to try find the Q|pg||

pc|s6|nt|jtr: Didnt bother about the @dQ expecting South to have 3 @ds|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding will take longer than the play|pg||
nt|jtr: There are a few less experienced pairs in the field remember|pg||

nt|sybarra: N to double? |pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
nt|peachy: W has max and six cards, well done to Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: how would you like to pass as E then put THIS dummy down in a mere 4 spades then watch pd go down?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Patrick Huang |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- when W didn't play his last spade to tap S|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s or pass i thk|pg||
nt|tez: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and that is a slightly aggressive responsive double by South, but part score swings are generated by pushing your opponents around|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the spade finesse is on I make 630 vs 620|pg||
nt|peachy: but|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks, Shrley and Hi all.|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was always going to bid 3@s, but no harm in seeing whether his opponents accidentally pass him out in 2@s doubled first|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||
nt|peachy: i see no chance for OT|pg||
nt|tez: they are leading 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again we see the lead middle from 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: EW can defeat 4@S on a @S lead (DD decl can 2xfiness in @D and make)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: all leads 2/4......better way to describe it   (thx spec) |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose on this lie of cards North-South actually had some play for 4@h|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tez: 3 down is bad news for ew|pg||
nt|pelu: so all leads = I have a higher card in this suit!!|pg||

nt|tez: if you have singleton?|pg||

nt|tez: 1 way ticket for 800:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is smart enough to know that N would not X with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with the 2 @S bid, the long clubs should be with S |pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: and they arent helping so far|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  West is lucky here - a Multi would nok be a success|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - South opening|pg||
nt|tez: other room 4@s doubled..specs said:)|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|marlowepi: in the unlikely event that i passed originally as E, i doubt i could bring myself to pass 4S when pd bids it facing a passed hand at unfavorable vul with an unlinmited hand behind ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him. if i did summon such conservatism, and then watched 4S go down, i'd head for the bar|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: not much of fit anywhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And in 3 NT, you must hunt the 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yeah - @H not 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S passes another opening bid by many standards|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, if the suits were majors I'd open.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: I'd open S at any vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be better to have the minors reversed, but you cant have everything all the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an interesting problem over 1H. i dont think 2H gets the job done. prefer 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: splinter would be my choice|pg||
nt|xenya: or cruel rather|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Maybe someone in the audience can tell us what 2@D is|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Brave man, East|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: which would in your book be weaker, Pass or 4D by N over 3H?|pg||
nt|tez: makeable 7@h..i belive they will stop 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam in board 5 was missed in OR (4@S + 3)|pg||
nt|tez: they are not playing with open cards:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting the OR is connected to us  but we are not reconnected to them |pg||
nt|sybarra: or should I say they were|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for a double of 4@H at MP?|pg||
nt|jtr: Might be necessary|pg||
nt|jtr: If we make 3@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but not that UNfriendly, surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 10-13, 2NT asking - 3@C = minimum, 3@D asking for singleton, 3Nt = singleton @S|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c pls|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X making, so 5@CX only cost 5 IMPs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: You'll get 200 here, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
nt|po-s: is this a hand that wants ruffs or to tap declarer?|pg||
nt|po-s: tap apparently|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he would be happy with four - that would mean his opponents could make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they can - may have stolen the pot here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||
nt|tez: wrang i m here ..trust me pls:)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: almost same auction other room,  but instead of 2 nt, E bid 2 sp |pg||
pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  @d break will be big disaster for declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: apprximately 2 down?|pg||
nt|xenya: well W dropped a trick when he failed to put up the Q, but that was far from obvious?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes you told him 7@H he could have just bid 6 LOL|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: one spade and two clubs would be different|pg||
nt|hlortz: /relate/|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nie had conquered the world of  "Go" some 20 years ago and turned his interest to bridge in recent years.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, u r right, four|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  next door 4@s made when defence offered @c trick to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that South, who had a maximum for his initial pass, did not take some action when a weak no trump came back|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: or that in Strong Club context, he didnt open|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: so you will be in Reno next month?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  @H Ace, @C KIng, @H back and the @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South knowa WeatÂ´s distribution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And doesÂ´nt matter, whether West has single og double @H from the beginning|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But badly enough, the @C Jack comes down, which means 10 tricks without this endplay|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||

mb|6C|nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must be a strong field|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It ain't bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct declarer technique on Boards 1, 4, and 7 in this room would have the MY team up by about 30 instead of struggling|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|jbgood: another good slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ken Rae is from the Shetlands|pg||
nt|peachy: a likely 3NT here now|pg||
mb|2C!|an|1suit|nt|mdgraham: that could very well be a Strong Two |pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure it is|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a rare beast|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: Nunes still in the box after @SK|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like he was down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even a spade lead does not defeat 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9:  S  4@SX-3  500 to EW|pg||
nt|peachy: partscore deal here, most likely|pg||
nt|po-s: you´re such a blood thirsty person|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is a scope for variations|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|dburn: chance for North-South to retaliate by reaching a lucky slam of their own - 6@c and 6NT both make if played by North (who has bid clubs)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  Normally E/W would make 620 in 4 @H, but here...|pg||
nt|xenya: not normally, PO, no|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S = what guys?  1 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: crucial moment, go or not to go|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm betting no|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: time for Blackwood |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 NT on the N hand is excellent|pg||
nt|peachy: even if one does raise on three sometimes, doing so with S hand would be sick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: i dont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defeating this 4 @H will bring NL in front|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think the real score is 10-17|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of science in action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 controls I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Geoff Breskal won the Gold Cup many years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: many many years ago|pg||
nt|hlortz: indelicate but effective|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David Edwin in the audience remembers when|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this event is well-known for collecting "names" in Yokohama, the organizers do their best to attract "stars" giving national players fine possibility to compete  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no good lead for South|pg||
nt|peachy: Have to stay away from spade lead to have any chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best he could do|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - 6@c, as a spectator points out, will not make if East leads her diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a case for cashing the ace - not done|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way, and 2@D looks like an artif GF, or maybe this range balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this is more a lucky one than the 6NT was, there he only needed spade finess|pg||
nt|gracelin: I was in Yokohama for the NEC cup last year.  This Latin team did very well but they are missing Diego this time.|pg||
nt|dburn: all academic - they aren't going to bid a slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately our operators do not speak English, so I can't explain how to reconnect after a crash|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is a bilingual specctator to help Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's all in our manual, but that's also in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: they soudn't.  This is amuch worse slam than last board which only needs a finesse.|pg||
nt|peachy: is Diego B in another team or not there this year?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: this might be tricky both for declarer and  defenders|pg||
nt|po-s: that HQ is a good card, otherwise declarer might have  difficulties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This one should depend om finding the @S Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we think 2 @D= 18+ |pg||
nt|pelu: they play tranfer-ans on 1@C - so 1@S sh be a normal 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm little conservative with 25 hcp total|pg||
nt|hlortz: but i guess they are high enough|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: tk he is not cming thisyear.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: 2H is just begging for EW to bid the vul game and make it by finessing partner for H queen which they would not otherwise do|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was thinking of sac in those colors?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not every lead kills this 4 @H - but IÂ´m sure, the @C Ace did|pg||
nt|peachy: seems this is now going set, straining my eyes for way to make, but no|pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto is a great player but not the miracleman|pg||
nt|bbramley: plenty high - even with a moderately friendly lie i don't think he'll make it|pg||
nt|pelu: in 4@H Nunes played @H to 8 and A in trick 2!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: not sure when   late 70's    early 80's I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative shift that turns out to be good|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it was safe|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East might think, that South is in position to get a @C-ruff - not North. He must play @H Ace and another @H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Hi David|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: with 3 1/2 defensive tricks??|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stay with us, you are on soon anyway|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6N+1 52/58|pg||
nt|gracelin: Seems EW use a similar scheme like CAPP against opponent strong club opening.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: one pair made 7N by South|pg||
nt|ady: bet possible for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1977 it was. Thanks to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: might as well have used the HK, what else to do with it?|pg||
nt|peachy: toss it under the ace?|pg||

nt|peachy: Here is today's bulletin, editors Barry Rigal and Rich Colker -  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec2010_data/bulletins/blt1.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very likely that 3N makes but 4H does not (or that both do)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|chick: I dunno about that, E had only one club stopper|pg||
nt|bbramley: polish club, usually a weak nt, but sometimes...  18+ HCP|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton kings here one on one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: with his rabbi,  N  or S can make game in either red suit |pg||
nt|peachy: nice safe contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  could be too high (if NS find @h ruff) |pg||

pc|s8|nt|peachy: nice fillers and suit in dummy|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, that 5-level again|pg||
nt|pelu: coprrection : Nunes maded 41Hs - correction by operator (misclicks)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep thought if he played @H to the 7 he'd make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will e/w get in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec points out 4 @S makes |pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@D=artif weak, 1@H=nat but could still be a weak nt (F1?), 2@D nat NF|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@S makes, lose 1 of each|pg||
nt|sybarra: no doesnt make,  think it loses a trick in each suit,,  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||

pc|c5|nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, after the lead and the favorable DA position.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hlortz: defense wants to make sure declarer has an entry for the @D finesse|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he uses it toplay trumps...|pg||
nt|po-s: then a small which is wrong if KJ bare|pg||
nt|peachy: dia shift there could have held but partner's suit is normal |pg||

nt|jtr: Yes, this event seems to revolve around how well you kill the less experienced pairs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon it's a bit quacky |pg||
nt|hlortz: i dislike the ambiguity of 2@S limit *or better*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Being in the right place at the right time|pg||
nt|jtr: That too|pg||
nt|chick: the other table bid 6@D but made it|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki will wonder why wrang didn't lead his (necessarily) singleton diamond - might drop it for that reason|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|peachy: then it was lucky they DID bid it, the loss would have been significant|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester makes no other|pg||

mb|p|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||

nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: they also play CAPP over 1NT opening, so 2D shows both maors.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: kakasi whose real name is Satoshi Imai|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defence is @C Ace and a @H - double-dummy|pg||
nt|peachy: Groenenboom can play whichever club, he doesnt know yet it doesnt matter|pg||

mb|p|pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  And @H 10|pg||
nt|peachy: probably will lead diamond, leastr self-destructive without seeing all hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes, it only took 24 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: lets see how 3NT fares...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: 2@H now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3C by N would have been an underbid|pg||
nt|chick: a nice reverse into 2@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17:13 in Japan now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator -pl UNDO!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to get it corrected |pg||
nt|bbramley: 3-1 trumps would have made it much more complicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: it may go 3S and 3NT, not a great contract.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a VERY lucky 3N...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|peachy: not at all, 3S the last making one, but if EW in other room play 15-17NT (I dont know if they do) might go same way|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice fit|pg||
nt|chick: at least they got into a makeable game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, might|pg||
nt|po-s: 3S shows good with short diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: nice judgment by Merijn Groenenboom|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I expect a flat board, losing 1 spade, 1 heart and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was same in other room (correctly) |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: theygot there anyway, at least|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||
nt|po-s: this time the hearts behave. You need to guess how to treat diamonds|pg||

nt|gracelin: because in this sequence EW can stop in 2S, while if you transfer, you need to followup with 2NT. |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtr: seems a big play not finessing the @s and taking 11|pg||

nt|sybarra2: ok |pg||
nt|peachy: while if in 2NT and game makes...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: east can get most of the match points if entering with A@H   cashing dimonds and finessing 10@C     |pg||
nt|peachy: then opps have more and they wont lie silent|pg||
