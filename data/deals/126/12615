nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
nt|petergill: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: this is the 3 segment of the 3 round quarter finals|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last 12 boards of a 36 board quarter-final in New Delhi, India|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Ruzbeh|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet heart partscore to start, perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Geoffrey and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi and welcome to all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its close after the first 16|pg||
nt|roswolf: very looks like a good match|pg||
nt|roswolf: a partscore to start|pg||
mb|1H|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now we will compare the scores|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that last board may well produce a swing - as even 3@s on spot on defenc cant make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: fireworks from the formidables is to be expected|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
nt|roswolf: 51 imps behind with 16 bds to go is a lot|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: 3@D = transfer|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|xenya: still, with a little bit of luck...|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi David|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: look fairly standard from what I saw last set|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like a prepared 1@D and a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 pair played multi 2@D the other normal weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to my co-commentator Frank Budai|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|petergill: South would balance with a Dbl if he was in the pass-out (last to speak, or balancing) position. |pg||
nt|roswolf: now if this makes.|pg||
nt|xenya: this appears to be makeable|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can well start with taking first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that this is the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark: good afternoon|pg||
nt|ady: hi     late start|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and the comeback would begin|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a trump and two clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good double - wrong ace for a maximum penalty godd still going down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not yet though|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  been pushed too high    cant make 4 if diamonds attacjed early|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome to New Delhi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the 1 hour delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed.....will catch up at claiming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunit|pg||
nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead gives declarer some work to do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mind you now I look they were different pairs :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: attacked|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: declarer should simply set up clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Hi James, Martin and specs I'm Frank from hot Norway. Just -23C now:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks to be -1 from here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: well declarer is favorite|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|petergill: Yes, the trump leads are very good defence. |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C wasn't making either, but it is normal to take out insurance on hands like these|pg||
nt|roswolf: btw do we know the systems|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Sinil     Liz|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraid i don't|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: 3@H was aggressive and may have led to a game raise - south knows his customer!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit unfortunate - the bidding looks reasonable, unlucky to find the trumps stacked. So first imps to CBAIlookk|pg||
pc|s8|nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|h2|nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence never touched trumps, declarer could probably hold his losses to only his five top losers|pg||
nt|xenya: but we can work it out i think -- in general|pg||
mc|10|nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||
pg||

nt|sybarra: expecting another 8-10 inches |pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Roland said at last segment that he should eat his hat if India started at correct time:) THX India. Hope he will send it direct at BBO:)))|pg||

nt|mcarroll: After 3 frantic boards - a little placidity?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the open room, N made 5@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS rather got away with that I'm afraid..|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well played to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: director has been called for settling a dispute|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: dispute resolved - scores remain the same|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 4@H    may have difficulty getting there|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence at the other table correclty led trumps, but they switched away from trumps too early. |pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a solid start for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a 4@S for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart barrage might occur|pg||
nt|roswolf: ns strong club ew 2/1 i am told|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 imps to the trailing team|pg||
nt|xenya: so 12 imps on the 1st board -- a promising start for the trailing team|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petergill: allowing declarer to ruff the club high |pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: this bid won't make N's day any happier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tell us about the players Sunit, please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S husband and wife as far as I recall|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: McGann dows not like passing |pg||
nt|sunit: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I could be wrong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hI liz|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like south's doubl|pg||
nt|roswolf: could receive a bloody nose|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: Ok. I can leave so they come back:)|pg||
nt|sunit: rajeev and himani are a husband- wife pair from Mumbai|pg||
nt|ady: north take-out double has given them a chance|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes 4@H is a great contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: X or 1nt here  - 1NT 4 me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a very strong weak raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankaus: S need to run |pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the obvious escapes us at the table|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2S is the last making contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 117 was 1 imp to n/s 3@D -2 in the other room|pg||
mb|d|nt|james_h: but bidding 2@d here is a poor IMPS bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I might have made a horrible takeout double with the South hand because of the 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C with the fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree unless playing 2/1|pg||
nt|xenya: what would you suggest, Jeoffrey?|pg||
nt|roswolf: axe|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Hang on a min Rodal :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit: I am not sure which Banerjee is this but must be from the railway team|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too much, four obvious losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still S there now for him|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass actually|pg||
nt|xenya: over 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: we'll give you 2 more hands|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: if pard cant act then game unlikely|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, when fixed stay fixed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that S in Open did not bid|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H by north conservative|pg||
nt|petergill: South is disciplined enough to stop bidding, despite 19 HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: downgrading KQ doubleton, Frank? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: solid game no dangers visible|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be bloody indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: that lead for the max i think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: east liked the hidden diamond fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this one really does require a lot of work|pg||
nt|ady: by South   sorry|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if vul they may hav pushed on to game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems a little conservative to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: trying for a club ruff seems best|pg||
pc|d7|nt|davidstern: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes this banerjee is from railways.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sunit: only way to beat this contract is after cashing both the clubs north has to play a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, this may make now|pg||
nt|sunit: difficult though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too late|pg||
nt|xenya: on best defence that is|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  in modern bidding, strong dbl on 1N is out of date |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes the whole hand needs to be downgraged imo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: This will make if declarer is careful in the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Needed a heart lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes good try next please :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s4|nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks only and no real pressure on E/W - i cant see a 9th ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes in first position, but a balancing dbl over 2@H is very much in vogue|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still may be OK if he runs a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|sunit: no can still beat|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sunit: with a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence dropping tricks i think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: well, whether South runs or not depends on your parameters for doubling 1NT   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can be endplayed to lead away from @DK|pg||
nt|sunit: why?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I suppose if the heart finesse was wrong 4@H might not make|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: whereas west cards were in spades where he thought they werent|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: Me neither|pg||
nt|sunit: no he can exit a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what trump? I cash all my trumps but one|pg||
nt|sunit: no endplay here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What are you going to throw on the spades?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: Good club lead - this looks like 200 to NS|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankaus: with a flattish 1 count u know this is not a gr8 spot|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|mcarroll: Unless the defence slip|pg||
nt|davidstern: The defence have now put this at risk by forcing declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll watch your discards and endplay you|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh no|pg||
nt|xenya: @D return was vital|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely the lead was a singleton?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: coup en passant now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|james_h: 1imp pick up here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: agreed, if you are certain partner cannot hold (for example) AKQJ sixth  plus an ace |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now has to ruff as @H pitched|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ciaran: Surprisingly, north didn't overcall at the other table|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  this auction needs to go back to the drawing board|pg||
pc|dK|nt|james_h: sry, 0 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Nerio Vakil|pg||

mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c shows strong,without fit (in std carrot)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: west hand is a problem hand for the weak nters as you can (and they have) missed their spade fit.  With such decent @s's i'd have opened 1@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 7@S makes..|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should take some action|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should go quietly|pg||
nt|xenya: considering 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: on repeated trump leads this can fail|pg||
nt|ady: playing 6@S  a decent score|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C inverted minor raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, not inverted minor, 1@C must be Strong Club|pg||
nt|roswolf: must be|pg||
pc|hK|nt|james_h: I dont believe South has shown his clubs naturally, he may have implied them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be implied now so 4@C to come?|pg||
nt|james_h: the fact the 3h is not alerted makes me think its just natural|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: looks as if they might pefewr the 4-4 fit... unfortunately|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C would be 5+ clubs, 8+ points, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D should make|pg||

nt|ciaran: Well bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H looks like an overbid |pg||

nt|petergill: EW in game-forcing auction |pg||
pc|h5|nt|james_h: ok, south must have shown clubs |pg||
nt|po-s: he has shown clubs when he doesn´t rebid NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the 4@D cue does not improve the E hand so they quit in time|pg||
nt|davidstern: Combined 24 cound stopped well short |pg||
nt|sunit: can be beaten by 2 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT Pass 3@D should excite East|pg||

nt|vinbtech: and a 9 card minor fit to boot as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tourney website|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  lacking the spot cards, 4th best (or low for some) is the best lead with the W cards in @ds|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer try to steal a spade to make?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: though 3n is far from easy; a tempo behind imo|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: well at  least they will get a plus score     might even turn out to be a good score for e/w if in CR they get overboard in a heart slam|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D shows 4@S 3@D 5@C and thus only one @h opposite Axxx = perfect, so heading for 6@D or even (unlikely) 7@D |pg||
nt|roswolf: south is right to duck on genral principles|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Nice to see that Mike Lawrence has so many fans in India. They even named a club after him as you see on the scoreboard|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D sets @D as trumps, 4@S cue bid of ace or king or both|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true David|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: why nt play trumps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sunit: now only 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought W would pass, then bid 2@S if needed|pg||
nt|petergill: Not looking for 7@D, as West is a passed hand, and "8 trumps" is not enough for 7@D to be a good % chance|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: This bus has snow chains James?|pg||
nt|andyv:  is it stealing?|pg||
nt|athene: actually no need to steal, especially - opps don't have anything to cash|pg||

nt|james_h: sorry Rodal, this it too tame for me|pg||
nt|james_h: I demand more "fast lane" hands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: but this time the @S save is too expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And might even aggravate the opps into the grand|pg||
nt|po-s: spade save is 2000 I think|pg||
nt|po-s: and 7clubs more|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1700 might enough|pg||
nt|james_h: West is considering her options|pg||
nt|po-s: right, I counted 6 spade tricks, forgot the ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  no reason for W to fly with the Ace|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @HA there's no rush anyway|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, should have hoped for a missguess it seems..|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|davidstern: But need to get there |pg||
nt|ady: around a 20 imps swing on the heart split   mind you 6@H is not a great contract    needs decent trump split  plus spade finesse|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice 4@S for N/S if they get there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid at both tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems to be biddable|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w might overstretch here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk5: How are you going to bid a grand slam with any accuracy when opps bid spades like mad as happened in the other matches?|pg||
nt|james_h: opening 1@c with this hand when looking at the NS (terrifying animals :) ) may not be appealing|pg||
nt|po-s: is 2C clubs or strong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Very favourable layout here for E/W - @SQJ doubleton, @DQ9 onside, @C 3-3, @HJ right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a classical weak 2, but I know a lot of players who would open 2@S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|james_h: clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: By exlution blackwood EW should have a easy line til 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR somehow found and made 3@c here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand wd probably have been opened in 3rd or 1st position|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino suggests pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a doddle :)|pg||
nt|xenya: reaching 3N looks obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: E worth an invite with two Axxx suits opposite a 15-17 NT, |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be beaten if clubs played before declarer can establish diamonds|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: thats with A@H right |pg||
nt|roswolf: might not make of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: its an underbid but she gets a chance to rev theing up now|pg||
nt|james_h: things|pg||
nt|po-s: I doubt that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising S did not show both Majors?|pg||
nt|james_h: lets see|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but unlikely as @Hq is a stand out lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: P??|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 2@C really a limited opening? I mean, after all she has a 3 loser hand. Impossible to catch up later I predict. I agree with PO|pg||
nt|james_h: Ciara(West) in crying|pg||
nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 21 points and the opps have ignored you ... and found a fit ... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good sign for finding fit with partner - N must be short in @h|pg||
nt|ady: still west can go up with the ace and switch to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game in @c looks attractive|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: only fit left is @C's  - I like A 2NT gets the values across and N is marked with a few @s's on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they dont have the theoretical points required, but maybe they will take the view that 3NT may be as likely as 2?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Will probably stop in 2N and be thankful to make|pg||
nt|xenya: courageous bid, 4@S |pg||
mb|3N|nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nonvulnerable game - not usually right to stretch|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even more unlikely into the aq10 :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2@S could be a 3 card raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tip i think is good when you have to make up a large deficit is either to upgrade or downgrade your values on every hand so as to engineer a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yep, spade now gives south some losing options...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Panja|pg||
nt|nerio24: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks made in closed room   playing in 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure of the EW system here....2@D either a straightforward Multi (so to speak) or possibly a bad-suit weak two|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If they do play clubs East must win the first diamond - West has to duck his king...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am told that Mike Lawrence has a carryover of 2 IMPs, not included on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|panja: so a Club ruff is the fourth trick for the defence?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  idee fixe|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S plays 4NT in Open|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see any problems here|pg||
nt|roswolf: following that principle i might have treated it as a 20 hcp hand and say open 2nt|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: told 2@D=5-7, 5+cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red lead brings 8th trick, what about 9th?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure about the 3@h bid seems a bit much - then again 3@s looks like a make and opposite @sHx even with the known 4+ @s with east woukd have good chances|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nasty break|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: sorry, 0-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: I dont think unlikely Sunil  with tht diamond suit there to provide discards|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: when you try a speculative lead and declarer ducks, you always hope you found a good thing|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: S really doesn't want to lead any suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: What was Hamilton's 2D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Some alerts have not been entered in this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|davidstern: Can certainly understand this auction - north unfoirtunately has a very good 2@S bid and east has a small amount of interest only|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: manageable perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: trump now S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: yes, a passive defence should do the job|pg||
pc|s6|nt|po-s: Probably there was a West face when Pass came back|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, the crux of the matter is that the West hand is too good for 2@C|pg||
nt|james_h: lol PO|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why W is so reluctant to lead pd's suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Difficult decsion whether to ruff high or not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in  |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3@S discard @C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: @C8 does not tell anything to East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|xenya: the fact that declarer didn't try to cash the @CK indicates he has another club|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|panja: good point|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be some overtricks here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: well, E seemed to encourage, and if so maybe wrong..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If the @C's broke 2/2 and hugh was able to sneak the @c9 into dummy this would make as it is hes blocked|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: 2@C is 5 card Stayman so 2@D denies|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: in which case there's far less long-term future in spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: possible end play here - W is probably going to discard 3@h and now @ha and another should produce 2@d tricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in 4@S probably ruff high|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kdr_fm: using the entry to finesse @D and play for split @d honours it looks like|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: west is sure the missing spades are 5-4, rather than 6-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 more rounds of @c would have been better |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed......will claim at the end|pg||
nt|xenya: E worked it out|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  next door S managed to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tempting to cash @DA, but a ruff/discard (heart) would have led to 2 down|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good going south|pg||

nt|frankaus: 26 zars so i would open it playing std|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This tournament at the Crowne Plaza in New Delhi is in honour of Mr Mohan Lal Bhartia, an industrialist who loved playing rubber bridge and promoting bridge. Two teams from this ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: event qualify to play in the Commonwealth Bridge Championships held near the Commonwaelth Games in New Delhi in late October 2010|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but may also be a swing tactic|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: Got it right|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well done|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: single suitor i think.. woolsey|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ciaran: Good choice - when N could not cue 4D, he needs a lot to make slam|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahhh|pg||
nt|ady: yes  I think so|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H needs @D 3-3 and @SA onside, so 4@H is where you want to be|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: just a question of six or seven|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s too much testosterone|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, asks about the grand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: and what a strange lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: 100% in Match points|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||
nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting push board|pg||
nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thats quite a raise by east on a 5 count but the clues are there - pd at least 6/4 opps bidding @D pd short .. good bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: also good judgment!!!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: yup but east knew his customer!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: @SQ switch causes lots of problems for declarer|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: ????|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kdr_fm: both @s onside easy 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzdz: network outage...will update scores at the end|pg||
nt|petergill: East has all prime cards - AK10 in the long suit, no queens and jacks, hence opening 1H|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: A spec informs me " they played dont"|pg||
pc|cA|nt|po-s: North might have T9xxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if there are too many losers, but the defence cannot get at their winners in time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not a great double there|pg||
pc|c3|nt|davidstern: This will provide declarer with the entry to set up diamonds|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|chick: I can't see any way that could have made from the point we saw it to|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Score confirmed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: well, he can ruff two clubs and hope for a non-existent spade-diamond squeeze|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough for defence to play @D|pg||

nt|athene: a very embarrassing flat board there for both teams :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yesterday morning, there were tight slams on three of the first four boards - this morning, it pays to stay low|pg||
nt|xenya: any other lead followed by a low clun would have almost certainly beaten it |pg||
nt|xenya: *club|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|petergill: whereas East passed his 11 count on Bd 27 as it was 4333 and short of aces, and on Bd 26 West didn't like the bare queen in his 12 count, and could not open 1@C as it was Strong ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: that should hurt n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: scores updated|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be trappy for e/w|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how to keep out of 3N and can a major game be made|pg||
nt|roswolf: moe imps back|pg||
nt|roswolf: more|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think the play went the way we saw it|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks flat|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes...probably a miskey in the 2nd last trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well a couple of missed chances for Scotland here...|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what strength 1nt is? 14 could be weak or mdeium|pg||
nt|athene: medium|pg||
nt|nerio24: In the closed room South was the declarer|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: E/W may get to 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: 14-16|pg||
nt|vinbtech: if not he escapes with a C ruff !|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: yes, that's what a lot of kibs are suggesting to me|pg||
nt|chick: probably right|pg||
nt|andyv:  it was weak in the OR:)|pg||
nt|athene: 12-14?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: the formidables have scored 21 unanswered imps so far this set|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzgh: She did|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this looks a desperate try by west..|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to catch 2@C, with their trumps 3-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed |pg||
nt|vinbtech: Hobson's Choice really|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and comes to the same 9 tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: thanks|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should raise|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: thanks Christine|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT by south not seeing all the hands seems a fair spot|pg||
nt|davidstern: Are EW playing strong club?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or has he simply avoided a reverse rebid|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y precision i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S is the best shot and defence need to be accurate i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with 19hcp, S is not going away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trivial 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Standard, EW play Strong Club|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Panja|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcarroll: The Open Room must have crashed, so we are not getting comparisons, but they bid and made 4@S on this board|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2H is a good result for N/S since it looks like E/W will make 2S, though it might be hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S asking for a @S stop|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  who will play this board will be disappointed heavily - all possible honours are off side|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the balance      5-3 fit in hearts   but part score only|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  including 4-0 @d break|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: On the spade lead S will be very happy until trick 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: but e/w fall into the trap|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should have down valued J@C and opened 1N imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S is the best they can do at this point i guess|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS lead by 20 imps before this set|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: but hope for declarer!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: constructive raise i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks good for the leaders|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ciaran: 2C from N forces 2D from S, and 2H is then to play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: again they decide not to push for the nonvul game|pg||
nt|ady: nice stop by e/w   via leb 2NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D to Q |pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: missing pass over 3@S by North |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this can make - needs East to guess trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  won't get there|pg||
nt|athene: but they can't get there|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can't move|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: east should have bid 2@D then redoubled that, to show 44 majors|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 4H should prevail |pg||
nt|ady: should be down now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a lead teaser he now has 8|pg||
nt|panja: 2S down one..will be two IMPs for NS?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: running to 2@H like this sounds like 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: e thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: As South denied 4 spades (else South would rebid 1@S), 2@S is a safe rebid, cannot be raised to 4@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ciaran: May not have been E thinking - they are playing with screens|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  the Italian teams of the 60s made a fortune by not opening 1N with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: alternatively east could redouble|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wanted to declare himself - didn't want the lead coming through all his tenaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: There was some ask for clarification of NS auction|pg||
nt|ciaran: Brave double from Hamilton should pick up 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hugh will be thinking what did i do to deserve that .. lovely contract nice lead ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: 9 now lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: probably down 1 -- but might make if he gets @Hs right|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: No problems in 3NT. 4@H also is cold|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ciaran: Thanks Christine|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: They have yo write it down so slower than |pg||
pc|hT|nt|vinbtech: w/ E showing minors and 2H, the S9 should provide the 10th trick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: he'll be smiling|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will lead 4th highest next time!?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now a sneaky @S6 |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: The cold is affecting me!|pg||
nt|athene: but EW could still organise it so that they scramble to 2@S by east|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|athene: for example let's say east bids 2@D then redoubles|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: and now west wants to play 2@S but from the other side|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: What about conceding two diamonds and claim?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spades are irrelevant|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: sso *he* bids 2@H and then redoubles that!|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y thats right|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: cant really see how to make  going up with A@C  does not solve anything either|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is on, but is not a great contract, needs no @H ruff, clubs to break and (if played by South) @SK onside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hope so!  worked for Chas Goren, usually right for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  I don't know if EW have that sophisticated of a partnership|pg||
nt|athene: this also has the advantage that partner has to suffer :) and you can go off and find a danish pastry and coffee  vendor|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, that I do think is the best reason for that bidding, Bill:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Not unaccompanied!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

nt|frankaus: zar opens S |pg||
nt|petergill: After this 36 board quarter-final, the semi-finals are 48 boards and the grand final 64 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: so you would open 1@S, Frank?|pg||
nt|xenya: 32 imps and 10 boards to go|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's a more solid-looking weak two |pg||
nt|frankaus: good W2@H|pg||
nt|chick: probably a good weak 2, as opposed to bidding a multi-like 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to set 6@h which is practically cold and find out it's a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difference of style; in the other room South opened 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 20 declarer went down in 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting 4@S EW here -- but they are unlikely to get anywhere near it|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a good sac here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|james_h: tactical 1@s ... prefering to opening 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s relay to 3N?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6 clubs from south looks ok now|pg||
nt|andyv:  good 6@c hand here|pg||
nt|athene: many people play it forces 3nt so that north can then show a minor 1 or 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can compete in spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes that was costly, and more to come|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: unusual|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nasty for W will he pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east might venture a call here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cant fault east's pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: or west?|pg||
nt|panja: that is a monster of a hand for a direct 4@H raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks flat|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: are NS playing preclike?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: yes, an opening 2@d says that you haven't got an opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I play it that way|pg||
nt|athene: it looks here as though it's clubs, though|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lucky 12 tricks here with @C breaking and both diamonds onside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: time fo0r a @D part score|pg||
nt|roswolf: or game if they start to shoot!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: strong club we were told|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: In the open Room, EW bid and made 2@S|pg||
nt|eamongall: Oops I slept in |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Eamon|pg||
nt|andyv:  but NS may play it strictly as a @c xfer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Minimum for the strong type|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - either minor suit slam works but probably not biddable|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But they seem to be edging towards it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North trying to show a really good diamond raise - cannot have spades|pg||
nt|petergill: I would pass, like Kachchu|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: lost connection.....back on track|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead would solve declarer's club guess |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: @H lead knocks this|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead - this keeps the defence in with a chance|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E digging a deeper hole|pg||
pc|d5|nt|james_h: Hi Eamon, did the snow eat your internet?|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like I missed some imps ..boards 1 3 4 ... but its ok ..there is still 25 boards in this match so maybe another 100 imps to be shared |pg||
nt|andyv:  or MSS and S's 6@c was p/c|pg||
nt|andyv:  either way, good contract|pg||
nt|ciaran: I'm giving up on predictions :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unfortunate - by north unlikely E would find a @h lead ... may well lead to a swing if open room N playing str NT  1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|panja: a result based on personalities rather than methods|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy 140 but 2 IMPs to MLC|pg||
nt|nerio24: another swing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh no trots out fsf|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks as if game is now predestined|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|eamongall: We have very skinny snow in Dublin North this morning and it just stopped |pg||
nt|ciaran: N has a four card fit, but no honours in partner's suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2/1 for e/w|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: y.....with a wide range opening....4@H would not be this strong...|pg||
nt|panja: still strong 1@C means 1@H limited to 17..not 15 as in Precision|pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|athene: of course 6nt has the same twelve tricks but declarer in 3nt wasn't risking the spade to the king|pg||
nt|ciaran: Was an agressive jump to 5D|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like a very lucky pickup for CBAI|pg||

nt|athene: and the count wasn't rectified for a spade-diamond squeeze on east|pg||
nt|ciaran: Certainly, but any minor honour would be far more valueable - @D K instead of @S K and slam is good|pg||
nt|davidstern: Blackwood and three key cards would work a treat|pg||
nt|vinbtech: not much good if u r there as well|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will probably get to 3 nt and go down here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 25 points not enough this time?|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   may get to 3NT     might make if west leads spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: good solid result in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lots of shape here - this auction could end with the word double |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not a terrible slam. I for one would be proud to be in it|pg||
nt|petergill: East was hoping to cash a 2nd @D after @CA, but @CA was not a necesary play on any layout|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they reach 3N it will make on clubs|pg||
nt|panja: good 5@C spot for NS in CR...could easily end up in 3N..if E does not preempt|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eamongall: Whats this Twitter thing ...says I can get tweets from the Camrose2010 ...or something |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: interesting collection poll 4 contract ? 5@C 4 me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon so|pg||
nt|chick: first NS have to get in the action|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 12 imps to N. Ireland which has edged out to an 18 imp lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lucky set for CBAI - the NIBU slam on board 1 had much better odds, but went off.  |pg||
nt|vinbtech: 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: prefer 2@C since they are playing strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: now..once can see what South is thinking|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand the 3@C bid -- unless it shows what N has -- 10hcp and 7 not so good clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: a quiet pass will ne some imps|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: S "I have one too"|pg||
nt|panja: the second position preempt has to be well defined...else this problem is bound to crop up|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Hanlon played with Carroll yesterday, can anyone explain why?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can bid 1S with that?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Running scores and standings are here: http://www.camrosebridge.com/|pg||
nt|panja: will have to be played carefully|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some would raise hearts with north|pg||
nt|andyv:  must show 0-4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind a raise by N|pg||
nt|ady: will need to make to make up for - 500 in CR|pg||
nt|roswolf: south inactive ----passive|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@C was strong?|pg||
nt|panja: especially on a @D lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh too active by west -will perhaps push them to 5@CX|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: NS were very conservative in Open|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: network outage.....will update the scores at the end.|pg||
nt|xenya: had W elected to open, slam would have been reached almost automatically i think -- not so easy now |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N struck oil with his absurd 1@H :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eamongall: SNOW :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Late arrival due to weather|pg||
nt|andyv:  in big @c auctions, the more room you take up in bidding, the better off you usually are|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: commentators curse strikes again, no double and no 5@C :)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 3D= 4144 8+; more likely 11+|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: Some sort of spade raise is a must on the North cards - 3@S weak, or - if not playing that way - then 2@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: friends need some swings soon |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kdr_fm: 6@S double dumy seems to be there - but 4@s the likely spot|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  yes, EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes 1 c strong and I think 1 spade 3-6 with 5 cards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|james_h: thanks for responces ... McGann was snow delayed it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: All ok here|pg||
nt|panja: good lead..no point in leading a singleton with a lone trump|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: String club? East was a bit frisky in the CR|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes :(|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Strong vlub, even|pg||
nt|ady: could be spade lead   and make |pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: 3ed @C gives prom|pg||
nt|james_h: He was not issued his CBAI Snow Shoes in time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: In Open John Carroll opened  the W hand 2@D - Multi, !!, 4@H - pass or correct  from Garvey, Double by S - (not greeted with approval by the commentators)|pg||
nt|eamongall: Blue Club stuff for Murchan Burns ..well it used to be when they played a few years ago |pg||
nt|james_h: Blue in the face club|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The defence slipped and 4@H doubled made so more imps to CBAI|pg||
nt|cuttysark: More likely a heart?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Welcome Sunil|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Sunil|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|xenya: that was unexpected|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: has led a heart    done well  to avoid J or 10 spades lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|frankaus: still has a making line by cashing just 1 top @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 7 3NT +2 in open - Wales now lead by 18|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I was wrong with "one more push" - in  7, in OR after @c lead 3NT had been made|pg||
nt|roswolf: OR 3@CX ouch|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: Nice to see a husband- wife pair play and do well|pg||

pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: I wonder how many divorces bridge has caused worldwide|pg||

nt|andyv:  i think 3N is right....the 2@s bid in closed room at least told declarer where his tricks were coming from|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this looks interesting - 6@c or 6@s seem possible is abit awkward|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if*|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dont think 6@S is a make, but 6@C is|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: P P 2/3@H dbl  4@H?  4@S or P  P ??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H has a couple of flaws|pg||
nt|panja: if EW bid 3N here...they can make it|pg||
nt|xenya: looked like 11 tricks to me|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: chance for Glyco;s to make up by bidding the vul game here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Glycols|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another very thin game - slim chance for Glycols to gain a few imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the overcall worked this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to play for that @c layout though|pg||
nt|roswolf: 770 is an unusual score|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: updated scores.....no double in that. - 3c +3|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  and 5@h coming next? really cruel board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you are going to pre-empt, I like 3@H better than 2 at these colours|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes with the @D fin on 9 tricks roll in|pg||
nt|xenya: can't remember ever seeing it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|eamongall: I think we won't see any more imps in this match ... rooms not joined it appears |pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|ciaran: Tight 3N for N/S here.  Looks like an accident for NIBU in the other room - playing in 5HX|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: time for a pairs 2@s ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  nice tip|pg||
nt|xenya: but normal result anyway -- slam is very hard to make on a @D lead|pg||
nt|ady: yes    nice lay for n/s    |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah then i withdraw my comments:):):)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eamongall: Carrot Club here .. .weak or strong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Roland3@H might have stolen the board|pg||
nt|petergill: India is pretty good at bridge - India sometimes makes the quarter-finals of the World Championships|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks possibly trappy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: 1nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-6 is not a two-suiter in my view|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's the multi again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a perfect 2@S opening|pg||
nt|panja: EW are unlikely to have bid the way it showed on last deal|pg||
nt|roswolf: the comeback contibues!!!!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Particularly not with a rotten 4-card suit and a great 6-carder|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: esp when the 6 carder is strong and the 4 carder weak|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what was 2@S ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Preference|pg||
mb|4C|nt|nerio24: preference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H showed both majors|pg||
nt|xenya: preference i guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N now by W?|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the double but i would do something! -|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the whole thing looked too awful with the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: right|pg||
nt|ady: hi all     sorry a little late|pg||
nt|petergill: Some of the top Italians have abandoned 3@C and 3@D weak jump overcalls, and would overcall 3@C on these East cards to show 6 clubs and 4 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I would|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen worse!!!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: pick a slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello David|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tournry website and gives the results of the swiss league and the 8 qualifiers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Both Souths pass 1@H - I think it is right to raise with 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes the Carvey preemptive tactics pushed them too far|pg||
nt|ady: ok    thx|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  N could have had a great result by passing 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|nerio24: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Playing a strong club your hand cannot be very strong|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but hard for south to envision game after his ptr has passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should go -1 i think|pg||
nt|panja: S shd double for D lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no a trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|panja: a @D and trump better perhaps?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup ok|pg||
nt|panja: rather, @D QA ruff and trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I dont like 1@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|xenya: but N may lead a @H...|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart lead likely|pg||
nt|panja: not perhaps...even a @C now..I would think|pg||
nt|xenya: for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|james_h: inviting trouble|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S by E in Open|pg||
nt|james_h: Ok, I MUST like it now :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup another huge swing to formidables|pg||
nt|xenya: 7 spades, 2 @H ruffs and the @CA|pg||
nt|roswolf: will be only a 14 imp difference|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ciaran: Well, 4S makes, so -800 not a disaster against the -790 for 4SX|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't think he can|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't either... but with that vul and S not making any game try, pass may not be so bad|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar to last hand in a way|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sunsamvar: so a push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - but when he has 9 red cards....|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 3@d |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: cold on a dummy reversal type play @SAK and another then play for @C 3/2 AK and finally Q with @s set up|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: -150 may be a great score for N/S|pg||
nt|petergill: Only 4 boards to go in the match, with NS leading by 25 imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: N/S were clearly on different wavelengths about the second double|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, as with 3@C if it makes the so did 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not sure what W hoped to get with the dbl... only suit he can really support is @c (and possibly @hs) while 2N seems just too obvious.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vikant Mehta|pg||
nt|vicky888: Hello all, a tight match for sure between DSM and formaidables!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Vikant welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Vikant:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: play paused for a minute.....directors intervening at another table|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: spades can go away on the clubs and diamonds, so must cash the A now or lose it|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has to hold his @h losers to 2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|panja: really a trick hand....the sacrifice in the CR is worth as an insurance..|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|sQ|nt|xenya: just count your tricks -- spades are unlikely to be 4-0|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no safety plays in the trump suit needed here|pg||
nt|petergill: South's spade-showing Dbl deterred East from rebidding 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: does south need to overtake?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|andyv:  this helps|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: alternatively 3 rounds of clubs and finesse diamond seems more straight forwar|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|james_h: 1@s is a fine bid|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|roswolf: yes i think he did - wd|pg||

nt|eamongall: seems they are joining the room |pg||
nt|james_h: I like Ciara and John, but I'd also like a shut out|pg||
nt|eamongall: but there was also another 18 imps to CBAI on boards 7-8 |pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: possibly because doing so now would be rather unsafe|pg||

nt|eamongall: I just came over from OPen to see this board |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like 4@d, 2@h, 2@c + 1@s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless they play here and east misguesses clubs, of course.....|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi from India :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: 5@C is a great contract   but with K@H with west might fail unless he leads a heart|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes time for me to have a nice Scottish malt Liz|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even worse, now bids 4!|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: looks like an 11 trick hand to me ...but 12 was made in other room |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well 5@C is a far better contract requiring only the @Hk with the opener|pg||
nt|xenya: now they should get there -- E has an easy 5@H bid|pg||
mb|5H|nt|chick: not me, cansino points or no, N has nothing to justify an opening in my book|pg||
nt|james_h: almost a slam here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like with the odds, just needs the last trump in dummy to score, ie 3-2 break|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The consensus here seems to agree |pg||
nt|ady: or heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  may win a couple of imps here (NS)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South ain't got no sensayuma|pg||
nt|vicky888: 5c sacrifice will be 3 down|pg||
nt|petergill: EW need 37 imps in 3 boards  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 3 making?  may lose a bundle too|pg||
mb|5S|nt|cuttysark: Hope you enjoy it - rather early for me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 4@H at W and a @S lead for 12 I belive|pg||

nt|roswolf: is that right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: this is a tricky contract too|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And now we get a chance to see for ourselves|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Who promised us that bridge is fair?|pg||
nt|frankaus: it would need some trialing - some may manipulate the pace to take advantage of knowing the score  towards the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't agree with the bidding and 3@s may not make |pg||
pc|h9|nt|eamongall: Murchan is lucky he is not in a slam ....opening with that kind of "put in your own word" |pg||
nt|andyv:  this may not make|pg||
nt|athene: when south rose the @CA that was a suggestion he held the @CQ too|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok back to the other room ...my vote is down 1 by Padraig O Brien |pg||
nt|ciaran: Much more interesting on a @D lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Bidding as correcter|pg||
nt|ciaran: My predictions have been wrong so far, but I back Padraig to make this.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, a spade lead gets @CK into play|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 33 is a good example that bridge is a bidder's game. Even if 3NT failed at the other table, their team still gains 2 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

pc|hK|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ciaran: the problem is E's @S9 - may need a deep finesse to make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||

nt|eamongall: I believe this is the Northern Ireland 2 team ...made up from finishers 4 5 and 6 in their trials |pg||
nt|andyv:  well, that was one break:)|pg||
nt|athene: there were a lot of indications available to north there|pg||
nt|athene: his partner ruffed with the @DQ so probably hasn't got another trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well done - and your predictions are back on track Ciaran|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if he found lead from AJx i'd be stunned|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 34: 11 easy tricks in 3NT, the play at the end might not have been exactly as recorded|pg||
nt|roswolf: some action here|pg||
nt|roswolf: a near slam for n/s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: well he did get his clubs, right after the opps got 6 tricks :)|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: another Maltish hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: how will East go about this one?|pg||
nt|athene: also the @H10 is suit-preference for spades|pg||
nt|vicky888: unlucky EWs at other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as many as +470 would have brung|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction should die quickly|pg||
nt|panja: how about E bidding 6@S on 5@D?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  I agree Bill... I don't think @s return was that hard to find but N didn't want to lead away from K@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: BBO players teabag1 and The Bishop ... make up the team (Mike Coffey and John Lavery ) |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather strange that West did not lead @CK in the other rom...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: club lead stand out from both sides|pg||
nt|dslee: Hmm, sunit might start taking chances now|pg||
mb|2D|nt|frankaus: 4@S immediatly would be my choice|pg||
nt|chick: bid both of his suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone like N's dbl?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have to p lay 4@H   on 4-3 fit  to make game    assuming a club lead in no-trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: I knew Padraig would not let me down!|pg||
nt|ady: or cam make 5@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so DSM LOOK AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS q/f|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl is dangerous at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vicky888: too weak for tht jump??|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess 3@h is not GF|pg||
nt|andyv:  W likes that bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: well both fits have been found - who will blink first|pg||
nt|po-s: how many boards?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think west had a clear 6@S BID ANYWAY|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: that looks suspiciously forcing |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but is 5@D natural now, or simply a cue bid?|pg||
nt|chick: don't know, but either will do|pg||
nt|chick: I'll bet he passes though|pg||
nt|frankaus: we have a 9 card M fit wit game values|pg||
nt|chick: bad suits, doesn't know if pard has the honors in the right places|pg||
nt|chick: (which he doesn't)|pg||
nt|frankaus: opp a weak NT  slam is a minor miracle |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: She!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S asks for Majors and strength|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW took 8 tricks in OR. what about doing the same in defence?|pg||
nt|petepunt: both @d wrong prob 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||

nt|roswolf: 16 bd sets|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: x3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 sets|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: South seems to be getting the diamonds into the game, but it is alwyas hard to diagnose opposing doubletons|pg||
nt|petergill: Had South pased the Double, EW would have been in serious trouble|pg||
nt|panja: W's problem must have been to judge whether 5@H was stiff or @HK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: 3@C has to be max without a Major|pg||
nt|ciaran: the bad diamond break dooms 3N here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 5 tricks will be good going.  May try @sA and @d finesse playing W for @dHx or HHx|pg||
nt|petergill: East has only 3 tricks and no more, so the vulnerable Double without any suit texture is very risky|pg||
nt|panja: in case of @HK what were the chances that two Aces were missing?|pg||
nt|xenya: well it was not clear to E that W had such good @Ds and @Ss|pg||
nt|panja: on the other hand, after hearing 5@D and looking at @H stiff and two black Aces...W might have crossed 5@S either by bidding 6@C or 6@S...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vicky888: flat board it seems|pg||
nt|nerio24: should be -1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is the best way to play the @H suit ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low towards the jack|pg||
nt|vicky888: play a low heart to jack, |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: west will be happy with this lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am informed I am wrong |pg||
nt|eamongall: about the team|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon was taking insurance with 4@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: First imps to NI|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: over the last few hands NS have played very well it seems...|pg||
nt|andyv:  they certainly have made good decisions|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and have bid this well|pg||
nt|andyv:  Board 10 not returning a @s is about the only play that I can be critical on|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H was quite pushy|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is but it works... hard to argue with success... I do it all the time and haven't found anyone to listen:)|pg||
nt|athene: well, it works if he makes this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is there that much to the play?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way it can't make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west coming to the same conclusion I think...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only one loser if East has Honour10|pg||
nt|panja: rather..W could have..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sunsamvar: and in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would have thuoght club was even more obvious in the other room where West had bid spades and not been supported|pg||
nt|dslee: would be some IMP for Formidables |pg||
nt|po-s: still some time until the lady has sung|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: can play east for Q10 or K10 dblton   or either hand for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: same contract  aalso by North make in CR|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|james_h: How date he lost us IMPs|pg||
nt|james_h: dare|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS LOOKS FLAT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|kdr_fm: up to 6 now|pg||
nt|nerio24: Alok who was east was having a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if NS are playing a strong @c system, 3@h is still an overbid when no fit has been found|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|james_h: Tom used to be better at insurance|pg||
nt|panja: so only 4 more boards to cover 28 IMPs?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: true - maybe she is on a diet|pg||
nt|dslee: these are two of the top 5 teams from India - Formidables represented india in BB|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: 3@H is quite a good bid, as it acts as a system-tester. Do EW have the capability to stop in 3@S if that is the limit of the hand, or do they have to bid to 4@S and go off  |pg||
nt|james_h: (his former career)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes my question is in the second round do you play for !KQ or H10 ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: But then he got a better offer!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|roswolf: 5 anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ciaran: can test diamonds, then play on H and end up taking a S finesse for a 9th trick, but you're then 2 off|pg||
nt|panja: y5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eamongall: I am wrong ... I just thought as no sign of Greenwood Anderson on this team ..it had to be the 2nd team |pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Yes Raja had been royally good :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some players would respond 4@D with the East hand - 5-5Majors, no slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: SF at 9:30 am IST|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision-style|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h seems middle of the road... you can bid 4@h and opps will always bid 4@s or you can pass and hope to buy the hand later.|pg||
nt|roswolf: should reach 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: There was none - but it is scored as making|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice gadget|pg||
nt|dslee: I hope laltu does not take it further to 3|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kdr_fm: schance here 6@c is on|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: It did make defensive error|pg||
nt|frankaus: TU Peter fine operating Ruzbeh|pg||
nt|vbman: he wont sell out|pg||
nt|panja: or 3N..|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I must say ...the camrose2010 website even tells you where to buy fish and chips ...as well as all the useful bridge information |pg||
nt|eamongall: Designed by Mr Officer ..hurray for him |pg||
nt|mcarroll: In Open E backed in with 3@C after much the same auction and plays there|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: got away|pg||
nt|vicky888: tripathi lost the opportunity to gain 9 IMPs and settled for 3 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks all....esp. the commentators and BBO team|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: ignore my last comment --it's the other way round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Means doing without Texas transfers, but here it gets the lead to the right hand|pg||
nt|petergill: North might raise this to 6@S|pg||
nt|po-s: I´m afraid I would have|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow, that's an unusual lead choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This auction will inevitably make the weaker hand declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  they own the @s suit...no choice with that vul|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why pass has a lot of merit|pg||
nt|xenya: re that slam hand -- perhpas E could have cuebid 4@H directly over 4@C -- he shouldn't be ashamed of his hand i think|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: sorry QF 3/3 tom. 9:30 IST not SF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East bid 4@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@S looks to make 6@S 5@C +@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@H cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 6@C tough to bid|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: returned a heart didnt cash @CJ ?|pg||
nt|dslee: laltu showed discipline :) most will take it to 3 :) with the @C and the @H stopper, guess laltu is scared of kushari :) seen how Kushari blasts him when he does some of these :)|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|athene: K10xx rather than KQxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It makes little sense to me to enter the auction at the 4-level|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Acceptable with a different type of suit, but A109xxx is rather asking for trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: North is probably trying to salvage something from a bad session|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Better at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he knows the majors are breaking badly... so why i wonder|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think East will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: E in think mode|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will cost a million and a half on the mandatory trump lead|pg||
nt|vicky888: difficult for N to judge tht|pg||
nt|vbman: this 8 carder is a computer dealt hand|pg||
nt|vbman: in such hands the dealer doesnt let u out in the cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational?|pg||
nt|roswolf: very good result for formidables in the other room|pg||
nt|panja: y..either game should make..|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, strange EW sold out there|pg||
nt|panja: for Nt..E would like his cards..the lower honours especially|pg||
nt|panja: for 4@S..there might be 4 fast losers..as far as E's picture goes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup maybe considering choice of strain|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: Results at http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vbman: especially if the opps have a fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: should make 9 tricke for 5 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wrong again :)|pg||
nt|dslee: 1@H pass by Kushari would had been interesting :) as one of the specs pointed out, surely laltu would Neg x|pg||
nt|roswolf: also e/w know they having a good set|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i wrongly or nor would have bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Not sure where East got a slam invite from|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the 4@D bid tells East that bad breaks are posssible and his ptrs @D points are probably wasted|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But I think he will escape the double and so not lose much|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so the salvage operation worked like a dream|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: He is about @SK short of an slam invite imo|pg||
nt|panja: the problem with this hand is the deceptive 1@C opening...|pg||
nt|panja: it kind of suggests to W that there would be wasted values in Clubs in the E hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: North's case for 6@S is that parner must have many spades to bid "5 over 5" in front of partner, and the kings figure to be onside in opener's hand|pg||
nt|po-s: if West had the DJ instead of the one in clubs....|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, I guess they wont risk anything now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: would have been a dream had 4@H made in the other room  IE|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this will gain a few more imps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: If West's double is penalty showing values in diamonds he cannot have the right cards|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|athene: i should have thought the @DK lead is far less likely to give away a trick|pg||
nt|athene: you know the @DA is almost certainly over you|pg||
nt|athene: but club lead could have found declarer with the queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of spot cards in the @d suit makes it almost even odds with a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: or even something like Jxx with declarer, AQx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the pips in diamonds are poor so I go with Easts lead|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good try from Micheal - hoping partner has @HKx |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 8 i guess with everyone bidding close vul games these days, defenders shd also be trigger happy on the double button when the trumps break badly|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get out of his own way... has to cash Ace of @s|pg||
nt|dslee: very honestly, I would bid 3 :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|james_h: and struck gold|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||
nt|james_h: another example of fortune favouring the bold|pg||
nt|petergill: Part of the case for North to pass 5@S is that if 5@s scores 680 it might be a pick-up anyway against 200 or 500 at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: 650 is still secure|pg||
nt|petergill: South could claim 650 if he wants to|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done to R L Kejriwal team, who join Formidables and two other teams in the 48 board semi finals|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: don't think East ruffed that @CK |pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an inspired defence?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: This is a great hand for the 1nt opener to be showing a 5-5 in majors and getting his ptr to declare 4 of a major|pg||
nt|po-s: risking is staying out of games as well|pg||
nt|xenya: true Panja, yet staying out of game on game-going values seems too cautious, particularly considering the state of the match|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|panja: now, @D to A..and a @H finesse perhaps..|pg||
nt|panja: or a @C ruff and @H finesse..if xruff is to be embarked upon, best to cash whatever on could in @H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: A @d back --> ruff, trump king, club ruff high, draw trumps |pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
nt|petergill: The top two teams in this event qualify to represent India in the Commonwealth Games Bridge Championship in New Delhi in October|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia is sending their Open and Women's teams to the Oct 25-31 Commonwealth Games bridge in Delhi - if your country is interested and eligible to send a team, let someone in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: India know|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||

pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set. Many thanks to Ruzbeh Raja, our excellent operator in New Delhi|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|james_h: When fortune does not favour the bold, it just gets forgotten about|pg||

pc|dK|nt|eamongall: Sadly Northern Ireland teams are a combined 112-10 down in imps in their 2 matches |pg||

nt|roswolf: well this should be the clinching board all n/s have to do is avoid bidding the 2-ace slam|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, this should seal the match|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: normal to reach 3nt here and go down|pg||
nt|dslee: EW partial more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW intervention in the other room kept NS safe|pg||

nt|panja: interesting bidding in the other room...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dslee: from sunit|pg||
nt|dslee: ok, he dint :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  at first look, no game for NS on this hand|pg||
nt|vbman: 3 nt makes?|pg||
nt|vicky888: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: x = raise to 2S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure of the wisdom of these canape overcalls |pg||
nt|chick: makes the second bid much easier in competition|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: sure, if partner expects a canape |pg||
nt|ciaran: A much longer auction in the other room to reach the same contract|pg||
nt|vbman: no at hand i think|pg||
nt|panja: two cue bids by North...and then ace ask by S, still the 6@H bid hoping the KC out was @HK..and that it was inside|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petepunt: 4 likely now|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: There is too much sex going on up north these days, they should focus their minds on bridge|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it could confuse the suit lengths|pg||
nt|chick: doesn't usually matter with 6-5 ... pard will have one of the two suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  N also opened 1@d in OR... made it easier for E to bid|pg||
nt|po-s: now?|pg||
nt|panja: now all that S needs to do is to check on Aces...|pg||
nt|panja: if aggressive, he will and stop in 5@H..if passive...we might see a 4@H bid here itself|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@c was ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: DD only 8|pg||
nt|vbman: you see h ak in east|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @S lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petepunt: mini - splinter|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after that W has 3 useful points, not 7|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: very surprised they not in 4 then every card in the west hand is full value - surely worth a 3@d game try ..|pg||
nt|vbman: wow|pg||
nt|vicky888: well lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow great lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, @c or @s lead look right from E point of view|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but N can duck|pg||
nt|vbman: and pray for opps to cash hearts for rectification|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|po-s: diamond is no good|pg||
nt|roswolf: well loudly quiet!?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: why did they reach this now? Going by the safe logic, this should be passed :) Important IMP for formidables I guess|pg||
nt|po-s: but def should prevail|pg||
nt|roswolf: should is the operative word|pg||
nt|dslee: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: what you say is right, Mike, but in cases like this, all you really want to do is make pard pick one of your two suits|pg||
nt|eamongall: Its not that James surely ... its lack of game time against players of EBU and Team Silver level |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: very sensible|pg||
nt|panja: oh ok..RKC will take them beyond 5@H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petepunt: but @h likely 4-1 after x|pg||
nt|andyv:  no need for that|pg||
nt|xenya: well-controlled auction |pg||
nt|roswolf: and well done to dhampur SM who must surely win now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|james_h: I blame the non sectarian sex|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: it will matter if partner is 2-2 in your suits, but that probably can't be the case here |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: super swicth from S|pg||
nt|panja: sorry I missread the last line of bidding in CR..it was a 5@S response to RKC there|pg||

pc|c2|nt|andyv:  yep|pg||

pc|cA|nt|petepunt: would have bid it with 5@H for sure|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, club gains against stiff king OR queen with east|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|po-s: diamond to nine?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcarroll: and another couple of imps to NIBU|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes there was down now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: accurate defence|pg||
nt|dslee: no saving now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: i mean ignoring the fact of this having no play anyway :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: as you would far rather be in a 6-2 fit than a 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|chick: If the 5-2 suit is trump and badly split, maybe yes, but I think most of the time, you will lose the same tricks in either contract.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather thought South would get the diamonds right there |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you might get forced as well - as is being graphically demonstrated here |pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was hoping for some horrible defensive crash and a no-loser club suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  no need to play A of @s is what I meant:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|dslee: for the benefits of the specs, 3 out of 4 players here are on BBO, Kushari=Kushari, Choksi = Sunit, Subhash = offthebend, can add them to your friend list|pg||

nt|ciaran: ..or at least making - we should find out shortly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: My turn for tempting fate, NS will bid to 4@H|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: cheers great fun all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like mulder berg|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eamongall: what does the word " recidivist " mean ...I need to understand a spec comment |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Backsliding - repeat offender|pg||
nt|andyv:  N really wants to get in this one?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wrong again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: I'm surprised that W hasn't shown the spades yet|pg||
nt|james_h: Etymology: French récidiviste, from récidiver to relapse, from Middle French, from Medieval Latin recidivare, from Latin recidivus recurring, from recidere to fall back, from re- + ...|pg||
nt|james_h: cadere to fall |pg||
nt|eamongall: sorry I asked ...back to bridge |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: back later if there is more|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eamongall: a @H 2@S s ...oops theres one gone |pg||
nt|james_h: McGann stuck for a lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  W could have a bit of a better hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  4@s or 3N will both make easily|pg||
pc|c2|nt|james_h: I might have tried a trump|pg||
nt|james_h: cos I see call da cards :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  not much to the hand except for declarer to stay awake|pg||
nt|xenya: this should be easy|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|vbman: now he can play with his left hand|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|james_h: good switch|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|eamongall: yeah but johnny will sniff a little and let it run |pg||
pc|c4|nt|james_h: and good duck|pg||
nt|james_h: wd John|pg||
nt|james_h: now he can disappear the @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: flat, so just brd 16 to score|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ciaran: I'm sure both doubles implied 4H, but someone has to bid them..|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: maybe north, knowing he has had a huge set, just wanted to avoid any possible risk|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that passing 2@H out is exactly safe|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, seems reasonable, this is only a couple of imps if its -1|pg||
nt|vicky888: it will be a flat board|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: another swing to the English|pg||

nt|mcarroll: tx all|pg||
nt|eamongall: its a good point ... should take longer playing and maybe save some imps |pg||
nt|james_h: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Thomas McCormac once said .."No point in being out here (smoking area) telling me about your mistakes when you could stay in there for another 15 minutes and NOT MAKES THEM |pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: Hi |pg||
nt|james_h: This is a battle between a 2 wal club NS and a 1 way club EW|pg||
nt|james_h: way|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW are playing precision, dbl of 2S should have shown max for the bidding but hardly inviting E to keep bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a good Pass fro W|pg||
nt|andyv:  who invited W?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S better pull!|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|james_h: Nice work by NS here, 2NT a good raise, 3d a trial bid (I expect)|pg||
nt|dslee: but I guess, here too, he should show that he has a 9 card major holding|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if East leads back a heart....question is, could the lead be from KJ10|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they find the killing defence?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: not sure why south didn't jump on 5@C|pg||
nt|panja: shd have led a trump..|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vbman: 1h is make or 1 down but they want to stay awake|pg||

pc|c6|nt|andyv:  exciting hand... somehow the feeling is N could have done better|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vbman: he hadto bid a game somewhere and let partner try to make it|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vicky888: much of give and take of IMPs does really happen during bidding... its like plz take some IMPs!! No, No... i dont need that many IMPs, lets settle for fewer... kidding :)|pg||

nt|james_h: the @hk really punished McGann|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  :))|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|nt|athene: east would have been better-off to bid a weak jump shift 3@H over 1@S|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  as usually, in CR we started with 2 last boards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: Second borderline 4@S in a row for Hanlon Mcgann - just the type of situation in which they thrive|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like -1|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that wasn't available for him|pg||
nt|panja: two down now..|pg||
nt|panja: it is better to play in the long suit of the weaker hand..as this hand demonstrates|pg||
nt|po-s: strange way of playing - seems to never provide more than 7 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: nice trump switch by E -- N still could make it but took a wrong line|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|panja: y|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
